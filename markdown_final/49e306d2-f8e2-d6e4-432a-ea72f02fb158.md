## Question

rxn stands for injection site rxn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "rxn" stands for "injection site rxn". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "rxn" typically abbreviates in medical contexts. Then, I should verify whether "injection site rxn" is a standard phrase used in the literature and labeling. Next, I will check if authors and regulators actually shorten "injection site reaction" to "ISR" or "rxn" in practice. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note any exceptions or ambiguities I need to flag.

> Let me first confirm the abbreviation logic. In medicine, "rxn" is a common shorthand for "reaction", so "injection site rxn" would naturally read as "injection site reaction", which aligns with standard usage patterns in clinical documentation and drug safety reporting [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether "injection site reaction" is itself a recognized medical term. Across multiple high-credibility sources, "injection site reaction" is repeatedly used to describe local adverse effects at the site of injection, including pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, and induration, and it is cataloged as a distinct adverse event class in drug safety summaries and guidelines, which confirms the legitimacy of the phrase being abbreviated [^46eb5a29] [^32cd4e69] [^2437aa50].

> I should confirm the actual abbreviation conventions used in the literature. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: authors and regulators consistently abbreviate "injection site reaction" as "ISR", not "rxn", in tables, figures, and safety sections, even though "rxn" is understood to mean "reaction" in general medical writing; examples include ixekizumab trials, HIV PrEP guidance, and interferon beta labeling, all of which standardize on "ISR" for injection site reactions [^93b7e6ab] [^9eb3bf65] [^d8893130].

> But wait, what if "rxn" is used elsewhere to mean something different? I need to check for potential ambiguity. In some contexts, "Rxn" can denote a chemical reaction, and in others it may be a product or brand name; for example, there is a gene therapy product named Papzimeos where "Rxn" appears in the proprietary name, which is unrelated to "injection site reaction", so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize the abbreviation across domains [^0b7a3a18].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my conclusion. Yes, "rxn" standing alone abbreviates "reaction", so "injection site rxn" is a reasonable informal way to say "injection site reaction", but the standard medical abbreviation in drug safety and clinical literature is "ISR", and using "ISR" avoids ambiguity and aligns with regulatory and journal conventions [^46eb5a29] [^93b7e6ab] [^9eb3bf65].

---

The abbreviation "rxn" in this context stands for **injection site reaction** [^notfound], which refers to local effects at the injection site such as pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, or induration [^46eb5a29]. Injection site reactions are common with subcutaneous or intramuscular medications, including biologics [^46eb5a29], GLP-1 receptor agonists [^e7072a93], and long-acting antiretrovirals [^18c416d7], and are usually mild and self-limited [^93b7e6ab]. Management is supportive, with site rotation, topical corticosteroids, and patient education to maintain adherence [^46eb5a29] [^43b65f7a].

---

## Clinical manifestations of injection site reactions

Injection site reactions typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pain**: Commonly reported and can vary from mild discomfort to severe pain [^46eb5a29].

- **Erythema**: Redness at the injection site due to local inflammation [^46eb5a29].

- **Swelling**: Localized edema or induration at the injection site [^46eb5a29].

- **Pruritus**: Itching sensation at the injection site [^46eb5a29].

- **Nodules or induration**: Formation of firm, palpable nodules or hardened areas at the injection site, particularly with depot formulations [^1a81e95e].

---

## Common medications associated with injection site reactions

Several classes of medications are frequently associated with **injection site reactions**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Incidence of injection site reactions** |
|-|-|-|
| Biologic agents | - Etanercept [^caaaeb19] <br/> - Adalimumab [^32cd4e69] <br/> - Ixekizumab [^ab974a66] | 0.5%–40% [^46eb5a29] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | - Exenatide [^e7072a93] <br/> - Liraglutide [^e93bf32a] <br/> - Dulaglutide [^e93bf32a] | 1%–13% [^e7072a93] |
| Long-acting antiretrovirals | - Cabotegravir [^bcadb567] <br/> - Rilpivirine [^18c416d7] <br/> - Lenacapavir [^1a81e95e] | 47%–90% [^18c416d7] |
| Insulin | - Various formulations | 2%–4% [^notfound] |
| Interferon beta | - Rebif [^d8893130] | 89%–92% [^d8893130] |

## Pathophysiology of injection site reactions

Injection site reactions arise from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Local inflammation**: Mechanical trauma from needle insertion and irritation from the injected solution can provoke a localized inflammatory response [^43b65f7a].

- **Immune-mediated reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including IgE-mediated immediate reactions and delayed-type hypersensitivity, can occur [^9e1a554f].

- **Formulation-specific factors**: Certain formulations, such as depot injections, may cause persistent local reactions due to prolonged drug release and local tissue irritation [^1a81e95e].

---

## Clinical significance and impact on patient adherence

Injection site reactions can significantly affect **patient adherence** and treatment outcomes. They are a common reason for discontinuation of therapy, particularly with biologic agents and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^43b65f7a]. Persistent or severe reactions may necessitate dose adjustments, alternative formulations, or switching to different medications [^4dba7bc1].

---

## Management strategies for injection site reactions

Effective management of injection site reactions includes:

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about the possibility of injection site reactions and providing instructions on proper injection technique, site rotation, and hygiene [^46eb5a29].

- **Topical treatments**: Application of topical corticosteroids or antihistamines to reduce local inflammation and pruritus [^48c1049c].

- **Analgesics**: Use of over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain management [^9eb3bf65].

- **Injection technique modifications**: Adjusting needle size, injection depth, and site rotation to minimize tissue trauma and irritation [^cbbe2922].

- **Alternative formulations**: Considering alternative formulations or delivery methods if reactions persist despite conservative measures [^e93bf32a].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek medical attention if any of the following occur:

- **Severe pain or swelling**: Particularly if accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise [^notfound].

- **Signs of infection**: Purulent discharge, increasing erythema, warmth, or systemic signs of infection [^d8893130].

- **Persistent or worsening reactions**: Reactions that do not resolve within a few days or continue to worsen despite conservative management [^notfound].

- **Ulceration or necrosis**: Development of skin breakdown, ulceration, or necrosis at the injection site [^d8893130].

---

Injection site reactions are common, usually mild, and manageable; recognizing and addressing them promptly helps maintain adherence and optimize therapeutic outcomes [^46eb5a29].

Injection site reactions with biologic medications are encountered with variable frequency. Although there is no clear definition, they commonly manifest with pain and irritation at the injection site. Previously proposed reaction classification systems may be impractical or insufficient, and more intuitive nomenclature may benefit clinical dermatologists and patients. Negative injection experiences (NIE) are common reasons for biologic medication nonadherence. Here we provide clinical classifications and recommendations for mitigating these reactions. We categorized NIEs into the following: (a) physical, due to the needle and injection process, (b) irritant, related to properties of the injected solution, and (c) allergic, both immediate and delayed.

Injection‐site Reactions

It is difficult to compare injection‐site reactions among the studies because of differences in methods of reporting outcomes. Overall, once‐weekly GLP‐1RAs appear to be associated with higher incidences of injection‐site reaction than exenatide twice daily 40, 54, 55, 56 or liraglutide once daily 14, 67.

For example, in HARMONY‐7, injection‐site reactions occurred more frequently with albiglutide (13%) than with liraglutide (5%; p = 0.0002) 14. A similar observation was made in DURATION‐6 67, in which participants treated with exenatide once weekly versus liraglutide showed higher incidences of injection‐site nodules (10% vs 1%, respectively), injection‐site pruritus (3% vs <1%, respectively) and injection‐site erythema (2% vs <1%, respectively). The exception appears to be dulaglutide once weekly, in AWARD‐6, which was associated with low rates (<1%) of injection‐site reactions, similar to those observed with liraglutide 13. The higher rates of injection‐site reactions reported in these studies is consistent with results seen with other sustained‐release injectable drug formulations that undergo in vivo degradation 83, 84. In a similar pattern, in the GetGoal‐X study 12, lixisenatide once daily was associated with more injection‐site reactions than exenatide twice daily (8.5% vs 1.6%).

### Injection site reactions with the use of biological agents [^46eb5a29]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Injection site reactions (ISRs) are a local phenomenon defined as a constellation of symptoms, including swelling, erythema, pruritus, and pain around the site of injection. This article reviews the different aspects of ISRs, including their epidemiology and pathogenesis, and provides practical guidance to diagnose and treat such reactions. More focus is given to food and drug administration (FDA)-approved biological agents and biosimilars, which are licensed mainly for the treatment of dermatological conditions, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and chronic urticaria. ISRs are major complications of all FDA-approved self-injectable biological agents, both in adults and children, with studies showing an incidence rate of 0.5-40%. The article emphasizes that ISRs are not correlated with drug efficacy or development of antidrug antibodies. Therefore, misunderstanding of the pathophysiology of the ISRs, most of them not being allergic or immunogenic reactions, might result in unnecessary discontinuation of the treatment. Almost all local reactions to subcutaneously administered biological agents can be prevented by changing the injection techniques, patient education, and training.

The role of the healthcare professional

Healthcare professionals are at the frontline of vaccine provision, often responsible for recommending and administering vaccines, and for managing those seeking medical advice for symptoms after vaccination. Healthcare professionals involved in vaccine delivery are in an ideal position to promote the benefits of vaccination, particularly in settings where the fear of side-effects plays a role in influencing decisions to vaccinate,, setting expectations for vaccinees about what might occur post vaccination, and reducing anxiety by managing the vaccination setting.Correct immunisation procedures including appropriate needle length and site of administration can impact reactogenicity, potentially reducing pain on injection and the occurrence of other delayed symptoms. Reporting AEs, should they occur, even if they are already in the prescribing information, is an important mechanism by which healthcare professionals contribute to the continuous monitoring of vaccine safety.

### A review of practical issues on the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the management of type 2 diabetes [^e93bf32a]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Injection-site reactions have been described with GLP-1 RAs; however, it is difficult to compare the incidence between the GLP-1 RAs as data are limited. In one head-to-head comparison, injection-site nodules were less frequent with liraglutide than with once-weekly exenatide (1% vs. 10%), while in another trial dulaglutide and liraglutide were associated with a similar frequency of injection-site reactions (< 1%). In one randomized, open-label trial, the frequency of injection-site reactions was reported in 1% of patients with dulaglutide at a dose of 0.75 mg and semaglutide at a dose of 0.5 mg; at a higher dose of dulaglutide (1.5 mg) and semaglutide (1.0 mg), 3% and 2% of patients reported injection-site reactions, respectively. Patients moving from twice-daily exenatide to once-weekly exenatide reported more injection-site reactions (5.4%) than did patients on continuous once-weekly treatment (0%). In another trial, injection-site reactions were more frequent with once-weekly exenatide than twice-daily exenatide (5.4% vs. 2.4%, respectively).

There has been some concern—based on results from animal studies—regarding a potential association between the use of GLP-1 RAs and the occurrence of medullary thyroid tumors. However, a meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs showed that, compared to other antidiabetic drugs, once-weekly GLP-1 RAs did not increase the risk of any tumor.

Dehydration, sometimes leading to renal impairment and acute renal failure, has been reported in patients treated with GLP-1 RAs. Therefore, patients treated with these drugs should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration, which usually occurs in association with gastrointestinal adverse effects but may occur without these adverse effects, and should take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. In patients with diabetic retinopathy, an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy complications when treated with insulin and semaglutide has been observed. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing semaglutide in combination with insulin to patients with diabetic retinopathy.

For a detailed description of other tolerability or safety issues of specific GLP-1 RAs, practicing physicians are referred to the corresponding SPCs.

TNF-α inhibitors—hypersensitivity patterns and injection-site reactions are outlined. TNF-α inhibitors are used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis and include infliximab, certolizumab, adalimumab, golimumab, and etanercept. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to infliximab occur in about 10% of patients, present with features suggesting mast cell/basophil activation and other nonspecific symptoms, and may occur with the first exposure but peak around the seventh infusion. Injection-site reactions occur in about 20% of patients treated with adalimumab or etanercept and in 2% to 6% of patients treated with certolizumab or golimumab; with etanercept, reactions occur in median on the fourth injection, have their onset 1 to 2 days after injection, last 2 to 3 days, and may be accompanied by recall.

5.6 Risk of Serious Injection Site Reactions

Injection site reactions are most commonly manifested by pain, erythema and pruritus. In some post-marketing case reports injection site reactions have involved abscess, ulceration, and necrosis. Some cases resulted in surgical depot removal, debridement, antibiotic administration, and SUBLOCADE discontinuation. The likelihood of serious injection site reactions may be increased with inadvertent intramuscular or intradermal administration. Carefully review injection technique [see Instructions for Use (2.5)] . Evaluate and treat serious injection site reactions as appropriate.

5.7 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with SUBLOCADE of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . This risk should be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.

5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

### Adverse reactions to biologic therapy [^53c366d1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Biologic therapies are emerging as a significant therapeutic option for many with debilitating inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. As expansion in the number of FDA-approved agents continue to be seen, more unanticipated adverse reactions are likely to occur. Currently, the diagnostic tools, including skin testing and in vitro testing, to evaluate for immediate hypersensitivity reactions are insufficient. In this review, management strategies for common acute infusion reactions, injection site reactions, and immediate reactions suggestive of IgE-mediated mechanisms are discussed. Desensitization can be considered for reactions suggestive of IgE-mediated mechanisms, but allergists/immunologists should be involved in managing these patients.

### What is the future of targeted therapy in rheumatology: biologics or small molecules? [^3c2c8d91]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Oral administration is a major advantage for small molecules

Despite the outstanding efficacy and good safety/tolerability profile of the currently used biologics in rheumatology, the requirement for long-term injections or infusions can impose a burden on patients leading to reduced adherence. Needle phobia is not uncommon: twenty-two percent of participants in the general population reported a fear of needles in a recent survey. In multiple sclerosis, for which no effective oral treatment was available until recently, injection anxiety or needle phobia could prevent patients from self-injecting their biologics. Misunderstanding about the risks of self-injection or a lack of knowledge about how best to manage injection pain and side effects may also result in an inability to self-inject.

Advances in injection technology, such as the introduction of auto-injectors have improved patient satisfaction and reduced the incidence of injection-site reactions; however, patients’ resistance to self-injection still exists. According to the RAISE (Rheumatoid Arthritis: Insights, Strategies and Expectations, 2009) survey, about 25% of survey participants with RA currently treated with a subcutaneous injection rely on caregivers or healthcare providers to administer the medication, and 24% of patients who self-inject experience pain upon injection and 20% experience irritation at the injection site. Injection-site reactions or patients’ negative feelings towards any therapy administered via needles may negatively affect patient acceptance of treatment and often result in non-compliance.

Non-adherence to a treatment regimen is a prevalent and major problem of patients with chronic disorders. Approximately half of the patients with a chronic disease have problems following their prescribed regimen to the extent that they are unable to obtain the desired clinical benefit, and poor adherence attenuates optimal clinical benefit. The World Health Organization has recognized the lack of adherence as a major problem in the management of chronic diseases and concluded that improving adherence would have an even more beneficial effect on health outcome than improving the efficacy of specific treatments. It is often assumed that the population is generally adherent but in many chronic conditions, on average, only about half of the patients comply with care recommendations over the long term.

Overall, oral therapies with new modes of action have the potential to expand the current treatment repertoire, increase patient satisfaction and adherence, and thereby improve efficacy. Patients express greater satisfaction with the convenience of oral therapies, and oral medications are known to be preferred to injected therapies that have similar efficacy. Thus, treatment efficacy can be improved simply through its effect on adherence.

### Enfuvirtide and cutaneous injection-site reactions [^189cee7d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Enfuvirtide belongs to a newer class of antiretroviral (ARV) agents called fusion inhibitors for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Enfuvirtide blocks attachment, binding, and entry of the viral capsid into the host CD4+ cell. Administration is only available subcutaneously in a twice-daily regimen particularly for those patients who have previously failed more than one ARV regimen. Common side effects of enfuvirtide administration include fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea; however, injection-site reactions are the most common side effect and present in nearly all individuals undergoing treatment. The spectrum of cutaneous manifestations ranges from little to no reaction to cysts, nodules, induration, or sclerodermalike lesions. These reactions are mostly variants of iatrogenically induced hypersensitivity and are self-limited.

### Safety and tolerability of ixekizumab: integrated analysis of injection-site reactions from 11 clinical trials [^93b7e6ab]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Injection-site reactions (ISRs) are reported with biologic therapies. The objective of this study was to comprehensively characterize ISRs among moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin (IL)-17A. METHODS: ISRs are presented from UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3 (12 weeks) and all ixekizumab-exposed patients in 11 controlled and uncontrolled trials (156 weeks). RESULTS: At week 12, reported ISR frequency with 80 mg ixekizumab every 2 weeks (IXE Q2W, 16.8%) was comparable with etanercept twice weekly (16.4%); both were significantly higher than placebo (3.3%). With IXE Q2W, ISRs were mild (12.3%), moderate (3.9%), or severe (0.7%), typically reported in the first 2 weeks (median onset, 6.6 days), and most commonly characterized as nonspecified, erythema, and pain. Generally, erythema onset was delayed, whereas pain occurred around drug administration. Discontinuation from ixekizumab due to ISRs (0.4%) occurred in the first 12 weeks. After 2 weeks, ISR frequency decreased and remained stable (≤4.2%) through week 156. No ISR-related serious adverse events were reported in ixekizumab-treated patients. ISR data were solicited if patients reported injection-associated events. Since nonspecified ISR was the most commonly reported term, specific types might be underreported. CONCLUSIONS: ISRs have been reported with ixekizumab during clinical trials. These reactions are typically tolerable, manageable, and decrease over time.

### The how's and what's of vaccine reactogenicity [^60d4beef]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

Reactogenicity represents the physical manifestation of the inflammatory response to vaccination, and can include injection-site pain, redness, swelling or induration at the injection site, as well as systemic symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, or headache. The experience of symptoms following vaccination can lead to needle fear, long-term negative attitudes and non-compliant behaviours, which undermine the public health impact of vaccination. This review presents current knowledge on the potential causes of reactogenicity, and how host characteristics, vaccine administration and composition factors can influence the development and perception of reactogenicity. The intent is to provide an overview of reactogenicity after vaccination to help the vaccine community, including healthcare professionals, in maintaining confidence in vaccines by promoting vaccination, setting expectations for vaccinees about what might occur after vaccination and reducing anxiety by managing the vaccination setting.

Acro-TSQ results

The mean domain scores (possible range of 0 to 100) in order from lowest (most interference) to highest (least interference) were symptom interference (51.4), treatment satisfaction (53.9), treatment convenience (62.9), emotional reaction (71.0), GI interference (71.4), and injection site interference (85.1).

Several statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in domain scores were observed when stratified by patient characteristics (data not shown). For instance, mean scores for symptom interference, GI interference, and treatment satisfaction were lower (worse) for those who self-reported a higher number of symptoms (of any severity as well as by the number of moderate and severe symptoms). Additionally, mean scores for symptom interference and treatment satisfaction were significantly lower for those who self-reported that their disease was not well controlled versus those who considered their disease to be well controlled. However, there were no significant differences in domain scores when evaluated by IGF-1 values, by gender, age group (<= 50 years vs 50 years and older), duration of disease, drug regimen, or practice setting.

LEN Initiation and Injection Site Reactions

LEN is initiated with two 300-mg oral tablets (total 600 mg) each on days 1 and 2 (loading doses), along with two 1.5-mL subcutaneous injections (total 927 mg in 3 mL) administered in immediate sequence at least 4 inches apart on day 1. Injection sites include the abdomen and anterior thigh. LEN forms a drug depot that might result in a subcutaneous nodule. Nodules are the most frequently reported injection site reaction. Nodules can be several centimeters in size and can last for several months to more than a year. Other injection site reactions include pain and induration. Incorrect injection technique, such as inserting the needle at an angle of ≤45° (resulting in intradermal rather than subcutaneous injection), is thought to contribute to injection site reactions. The manufacturer recommends an injection angle of 90°. Application of ice packs and use of topical and oral analgesics before and after injection might alleviate some signs and symptoms related to injection site reactions.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^5ff0cec0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone)—for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, this FDA-approved mixture of small polypeptides is administered as a 1-mL subcutaneous injection, either daily (20 mg/mL) or 3 times per week (40 mg/mL), and hypersensitivity reactions are common. Immediate injection-site reactions are very common, occurring in up to 60% of patients, presenting with erythema, edema, and pruritus. About 10% of patients experience an immediate postinjection systemic reaction with combinations of flushing, hives, chest pain, anxiety, subjective dyspnea, and throat constriction; these reactions can develop at any time during treatment, even after prolonged use, and their severity usually prompts discontinuation of treatment. Although some reactions may represent true IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, other immediate—and occasionally delayed—cases are associated with negative allergy testing and are likely due to alternative immunologic mechanisms.

### Injection site reactions to biologic agents used in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^1231c4a2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease that affects 2-3% of the general population. Up to 30% of patients with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, a chronic inflammatory and progressive arthritis. Although their precise pathogeneses remain unclear, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis involve altered expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23. The development of biologic agents that target these cytokines has greatly improved the treatment of psoriatic disease. Injection site reactions have been reported with many of these therapies. In this paper, we will present cases and review the literature on injection site reactions with the major biologic agents administered subcutaneously for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(7):695-698.</em>.

The patient presented at her next appointment with a new red, inflamed lesion on the right medial thigh of unknown etiology, suspicious for an injection site reaction (Fig 2, A). At subsequent visits, red, nonscaly patches at recent injection sites and multiple scattered hyperpigmented patches at sites of previous injections on the bilateral anterior thighs confirmed the diagnosis (Fig 2, B and C). The application of ice and topical steroids to the injection sites had only modest symptomatic benefits. No new lesions developed after switching injection sites to the abdomen (Fig 2, D). At 21 months of treatment, the patient is off of systemic steroids and continues to improve slowly while tapering MTX (currently, 15 mg weekly).

### Lipodystrophy in insulin-treated subjects and other injection-site skin reactions: are we sure everything is clear? [^cbbe2922]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Bruising

Another original aspect of insulin injection-related skin lesions is bruising at the level of the injection site, as shown in Fig. 1. Bruising is mentioned in several published studies on insulin injections. It is a problematic side-effect of insulin injections which disturbs diabetic patients due to the resulting blemishes, for which there are as yet no solutions. Unfortunately, in terms of both patient and healthcare provider perspectives, injection-related problems negatively affect the overall number of shots diabetic patients are willing to take. In fact, in some studies one-half of the patients reported mentioning injection-related problems to their healthcare providers who were unable to resolve the associated pain and bruising.

Fig. 1 
Two examples of bruising due to insulin injection, in the absence of any antiplatelet and/or anticlotting agents

In a series of 780 insulin-treated adults with type 2 (n = 556) or type 1 (n = 223) diabetes mellitus on a multiple daily injection regimen (4 shots/day), we identified 46.2% of patients had areas affected by LH, with a mean lesion diameter of 4.8 + 3.1 cm, but LA was quite uncommon (3.2%) (unpublished data). In this same series, 33.2% of patients showed bruising, either associated with LH (n = 178, 53.9%) or isolated (n = 156, 46.6%), independent of the use of antiplatelet and/or anticlotting drugs (unpublished data).

It is important to note that injection site-related adverse events, such as pain, redness, bruising, and bleeding, are significant barriers to patient adherence to treatment regimens involving multiple daily injections. This is especially important when physicians and/or healthcare providers are not sufficiently experienced or possess insufficient knowledge to provide assistance or when the doctor–patient relationship is unsatisfactory.

To fill this gap, during the last few years an interesting exchange of experiences has developed among patients through various networks, beginning with the American Diabetes Association Community. Such forums have enabled diabetic patients themselves to propose several interesting solutions, including a sufficiently long injection time, very thin and short needles, and a careful injection site rotation technique. However, specific investigations are still warranted to assess reasons behind such complications associated with the injection site and to identify scientifically sound solutions aimed at improving patient adherence to insulin therapy.

5.4	Injection Site Reactions Including Necrosis

Injection site reactions, including injection site necrosis, can occur with the use of interferon beta products, including REBIF. In controlled clinical trials, injection site reactions occurred more frequently in REBIF-treated patients (92% in the 44 mcg group and 89% in the 22 mcg group) than in placebo-treated patients (39%) and at a higher frequency in REBIF treated patients (83%) than in AVONEX-treated patients (28%). Injection site necrosis also occurred more frequently in REBIF-treated patients (3% in the 44 mcg group and 1% in the 22 mcg group) than in placebo- treated patients (0) during the two years of therapy.

Injection site reactions including injection site pain, erythema, edema, cellulitis, abscess, and necrosis have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Some occurred more than 2 years after initiation of REBIF. Necrosis occurred at single and at multiple injection sites. Some cases of injection site necrosis required treatment with intravenous antibiotics and surgical intervention (debridement and skin grafting). Some cases of injection site abscesses and cellulitis required treatment with hospitalization for surgical drainage and intravenous antibiotics.

Patient understanding and use of aseptic self-injection techniques and procedures should be periodically evaluated, particularly if injection site necrosis has occurred. Patients should be advised of the importance of rotating sites of injection with each dose and not reusing syringes. Patients should be advised against injecting an area which is inflamed, edematous, erythematous, ecchymotic, or has any other signs of infection. These signs should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately. If multiple lesions occur, change injection site or discontinue therapy until healing occurs.

### Lenacapavir sodium (Sunlenca) [^1a81e95e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Injection Site Reactions

Administration of SUNLENCA may result in local injection site reactions (ISRs). If clinically significant ISRs occur, evaluate and institute appropriate therapy and follow-up.

Manifestations of ISRs may include swelling, pain, erythema, nodule, induration, pruritus, extravasation or mass. Nodules and indurations at the injection site may take longer to resolve than other ISRs. In clinical studies, after a median follow-up of 553 days, 30% of nodules and 13% of indurations (in 10% and 1% of participants, respectively) associated with the first injections of SUNLENCA had not fully resolved. Measurements and qualitative assessments of ISRs were not routinely reported. Where described, the majority of the injection site nodules and indurations were palpable but not visible, and had a maximum size of approximately 1 to 4 cm [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

The mechanism driving the persistence of injection site nodules and indurations in some patients is not fully understood, but based on available data, they may be related to the presence of the subcutaneous drug depot. In some patients who had a skin biopsy performed of an injection site nodule or induration, dermatopathology revealed foreign body inflammation or granulomatous response.

Improper administration (intradermal injection) has been associated with serious injection site reactions, including necrosis and ulcer [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Ensure SUNLENCA is only administered subcutaneously in the abdomen [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^8545006c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Infliximab immediate hypersensitivity—when treatment is indicated, patients with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab should preferably be reexposed through desensitization if skin testing result is positive or if the initial reaction was severe or recurrent despite premedication and/or a slowed infusion rate. The risk of a recurrent reaction with subsequent exposures is around 33% on the first reexposure and progressively decreases thereafter. Anti-infliximab antibodies do not cross-react with adalimumab, although patients who develop anti-infliximab antibodies are more prone to develop adalimumab antibodies and have a higher treatment failure rate with adalimumab; despite these caveats, switching to adalimumab after a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab can be attempted. For TNF-α inhibitor injection-site or systemic reactions, desensitization could be considered, but desensitization is not a safe method of preventing nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions to TNF-α inhibitors; switching to another TNF-α inhibitor has not been adequately studied, and some reports note that reexposure to the suspected culprit drug may not necessarily lead to a recurrent reaction.

### Patient reported outcome data from acromegaly patients treated with injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs) in routine clinical practice [^c2a9caf9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromegaly patients managed on Somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs), the most common first-line pharmacotherapy for acromegaly, may still experience acromegaly symptoms such as headache, sweating, fatigue, soft tissue swelling, and joint pain, even those with normal IGF-1. Additionally, treatment with SRLs may cause injection site reactions and other side effects such as gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms. This study utilized patient-reported outcome measures to examine the burden associated with acromegaly and its treatment for patients receiving a stable dose of long-acting SRLs in routine clinical practice.

Methods

US acromegaly patients on a stable dose of SRL seen by their treating healthcare provider in the past 12months completed a one-time online survey including the Acro-TSQ, an acromegaly-specific tool for assessing symptom burden and treatment satisfaction and convenience.

Results

One hundred five patients were enrolled (mean age 49.9years, 79.1% female). Patients experienced numerous symptoms, including >80% who experienced joint pain, acro-fog, swelling of soft tissue, and fatigue/weakness. Many symptoms occurred constantly, while some occurred at the end of the injection cycle, even among those with IGF-1<= 1.0 ULN. Injection site reactions were common. Patients were moderately satisfied with their current treatment; symptoms and side effects often affected daily activities. On average, patients reported >3 acromegaly provider visits/year.

Conclusions

Despite receiving a stable dose of SRL and regular visits with an acromegaly healthcare provider, US acromegaly patients in routine clinical practice, and even the subgroup with normal IGF-1, report significant burden of disease and treatment.

### Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) [^7728e497]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of systemic injection-related reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from acute hypersensitivity reactions. A hypersensitivity reaction may occur with any injection. New or more severe symptoms compared to those experienced with previous injections should prompt consideration of a potential hypersensitivity reaction.

Only limited benefit of premedication with corticosteroids, antihistamines, or acetaminophen was observed in RMS clinical studies. The first injection of KESIMPTA should be performed under the guidance of an appropriately trained healthcare professional. If systemic injection-related reactions occur, initiate appropriate therapy. Patients who experience symptoms of systemic injection-related reactions or hypersensitivity reactions with KESIMPTA should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention.

If a hypersensitivity reaction or life-threatening systemic injection-related reaction occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue KESIMPTA [see Contraindications (4)] . If restarting KESIMPTA after a severe (but not life-threatening) systemic injection-related reaction or other event after which rechallenge is considered appropriate, administer the next KESIMPTA injection under clinical observation. If a mild to moderate injection-related reaction occurs, consider rechallenge under clinical observation.

Local injection-site reaction symptoms observed in clinical studies included erythema, swelling, itching, and pain. If local injection-related reactions occur, symptomatic treatment is recommended.

5.3     Reduction in Immunoglobulins

As expected with any B-cell depleting therapy, decreased immunoglobulin levels were observed. Decrease in immunoglobulin M (IgM) was reported in 7.7% of patients treated with KESIMPTA compared to 3.1% of patients treated with teriflunomide in RMS clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Treatment was discontinued because of decreased immunoglobulins in 3.4% of patients treated with KESIMPTA and in 0.8% of patients treated with teriflunomide. No decline in immunoglobulin G (IgG) was observed at the end of the study. Monitor the levels of quantitative serum immunoglobulins during treatment, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, and after discontinuation of therapy until B-cell repletion. Consider discontinuing KESIMPTA therapy if a patient with low immunoglobulins develops a serious opportunistic infection or recurrent infections, or if prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia requires treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins.

Hypersensitivity to insulin preparations, ranging from a minor local injection site allergy to severe generalized and at times life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, currently affects <4% of diabetic patients treated with insulin. The insulin peptide itself and the various additives present in the formulations are proposed to be the allergens responsible. A faulty injection technique and the resulting intradermal insulin administration can facilitate the development of such allergic reactions.

We present a 42-year-old woman who experienced a systemic reaction (SR) after a subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) injection. Her physician must make a decision, along with the patient, on how to proceed. We consider the medical evidence pertinent to specific risk factors for SRs to SCIT, including asthma control, concomitant medications and new medical diagnoses, the influence of pollen season, adjustments for large local reactions, initial testing results, type of buildup protocol, and administration and dosing errors. We next discuss the potential risk-mitigating actions that the patient and provider should consider and the available evidence that supports various approaches, including cessation of SCIT, decreasing allergen dose or altering the timing of injections, initiating or changing the medical pretreatment regimen, and changing to sublingual immunotherapy, and also the role for anaphylaxis preparedness. Finally, we highlight the key knowledge gaps identified in this review and provide management recommendations for this 42-year-old woman.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (Apokyn) [^32c062a1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use)

Administration with the APOKYN Pen

Instruct patients and caregivers that the APOKYN Pen is dosed in milliliters, not milligrams.

Inform patients and caregivers that it is possible to dial in their usual dose of APOKYN even though the cartridge may contain less than that amount of drug. In this case, they will receive only a partial dose with the injection, and the amount left to inject will appear in the dosing window. To complete the correct dose, patients/caregivers will need to "re-arm" the device and dial in the correct amount of the remaining dose. Patients and caregivers should be alerted to the fact that there may be insufficient drug left in the cartridge to deliver a complete dose (for example, patients and caregivers should be urged to keep records of how many doses they have delivered for each cartridge, so that they can replace any cartridge that has an inadequate amount of drug remaining).

Instruct patients to rotate the injection site and to observe proper aseptic technique.

Advise patients that APOKYN is intended only for subcutaneous injection and must not be given intravenously because of the risk of serious complications such as thrombus formation and pulmonary embolism due to crystallization [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hypersensitivity / Allergic Reactions

Advise patients that hypersensitivity/allergic reaction characterized by urticaria, rash, pruritus, and/or various manifestations of angioedema may occur because of APOKYN or any of its excipients including a sulfite (i.e., sodium metabisulfite). Inform patients with a sulfite sensitivity that they may experience various allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening asthmatic attacks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Advise patients who experience any hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to APOKYN that they should not take APOKYN again [see Contraindications (4)].

### Preventing unsafe injection practices | Injection safety-CDC (...) [^178a1724]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Unsafe injection practices put patients and healthcare providers at risk. This harm is preventable.
- A good rule to remember is One Needle, One Syringe, Only One Time. Why it matters Safe injection practices are every provider's responsibility. A safe injection does not harm the person, expose the provider to risks or result in hazardous waste for the community. Improper use and disposal of syringes, needles, and medications imposes risks on patients and healthcare providers. Unsafe injection practices may result in serious consequences like:
- Administration of sedatives and anesthetics for surgical, diagnostic and pain management procedures.
- Administration of IV medications for chemotherapy, cosmetic procedures and alternative medicine therapies.
- Use of saline solutions to flush IV lines and catheters.
- Administration of joint injections. Despite these recommendations, outbreaks and patient exposures due to unsafe injection practices continue.

Practices that have resulted in spread of viruses, bacteria, and fungi include:
- Always use facemasks when injecting material or inserting a catheter into the epidural or subdural space. Draw up medications in a designated clean medication preparation area that is not adjacent to potential sources of contamination, including sinks or other water sources. Clean and disinfect the medication preparation area on a regular basis and any time there is evidence of soiling.

Safety of anti-IL-1 agents

Anti-IL-1 agents are in general safe drugs, which have now been prescribed for years. If we consider only randomized controlled clinical trials, anti-IL-1 agents have been associated with an increased risk of any adverse events compared to placebo [risk ratio (RR) 5.38, 95% CI 2.08–13.92, I 2 = 0%], including injection site reactions (RR 14.98, 95% CI 2.09–107.09, I 2 = 0%) and infections (RR 3.93, 95% CI 1.33–11.66; Figure 4).

Figure 4 
Drug-related adverse events in patients treated with or without anti-IL-1 agents.

The most common reported side effect is injection site reactions, which occur in the majority of patients treated with anakinra (>50%),, a significant proportion of those treated with rilonacept (up to 60%),, and approximately 10% of those treated with canakinumab.Patients receiving anakinra usually report stinging during injection, but injection site reactions usually occur after 1–2 weeks of therapy. Multiple prior injection sites may simultaneously become red and painful (Figure 5). These adverse events usually resolve within 1–2 months. They are typically transient and do not evolve. In order to minimize and resolve this side effect, it is recommended to allow the syringe to come to room temperature before injection (the drug is stored in a refrigerator at 2–8°C). Oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids can be used for treatment. It is important to inform the patients of this common adverse event and reassure them that the reaction is transient and passes without sequelae in the large majority of patients.

### Subcutaneous injectable drugs hypersensitivity and desensitization: insulin and monoclonal antibodies [^f2fb5bd4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Injectable drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, are becoming crucial components in the management of chronic diseases. The most common side effects are local reactions at the site of administration. With the increased and prolonged use of these medications, we are seeing increased reports of hypersensitivity reactions. The aim of this article is to discuss the signs and symptoms of these reactions as well as management, which may involve desensitization for 3 commonly encountered injectable drugs: tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (etanercept and adalimumab), insulin, and omalizumab.

2.6 Product discontinuation

Study product was withheld in any woman with a reactive HIV test, a positive pregnancy test or anyone who expressed a desire to become pregnant. All clinical adverse events (AEs) were solicited and recorded at each site visit. AEs were graded using the DAIDS toxicity table version 1.0 and assessed to be product related or not by site staff according to version 2.0. Any related AE assessed as Grade (Gr) ≥ 2 or unrelated Gr ≥ 3 was reported to the Clinical Management Committee (CMC) for evaluation and assessment of product continuation. Participants who presented with a Gr ≥ 2 AE related to study product or Gr ≥ 3 unrelated AE also had product withheld. Permanent product discontinuations were discussed with the CMC to reach that decision. On a case-by-case basis, participants with Gr 3 or 4 unrelated AEs were permitted to move into the injection phase after consultation with the clinical management team and some participants with Gr 3 or 4 unrelated AEs could resume study product after approval from the CMC.

2.7 Outcomes

The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of women in each treatment arm who experienced any Gr ≥ 2 clinical or laboratory AE from the time of the first injection to eight weeks after the last injection (week 52) amongst participants receiving at least one injection. Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) were evaluated in two ways: participant self-report and site clinician evaluation. The participant's self-report occurred after each injection, starting on the evening of the injection day, and then daily for the next seven days. ISRs were assessed as none, mild, moderate, or severe by the participant on the post-injection symptom log, which served as a memory aid. Women were free to provide this information or not, partially or for the entire assessment period. At each post-injection clinic visit, the site clinician entered all ISRs reported by the participant in an AE log. An ISR based on symptoms and signs which were visible or still ongoing at the clinic visit was documented according to the clinician's judgment. These observations were graded for pain upon and without touch, itching, and measurable assessments for redness, swelling, induration, and bruising. All gradable objective assessments made by the clinician were reported in the AE log, in a similar way to the self-assessed gradable symptoms.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^9e1a554f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors—hypersensitivity reactions and diagnosis include that serum sickness–like reactions have been described with infliximab and adalimumab and onset is typically from 5 to 7 days after infusion with features such as fever, malaise, arthralgia/arthritis, and an erythematous (sometimes) urticarial eruption; IgE-mediated reactions account for a subset of immediate reactions to infliximab and may be the cause of some injection-site reactions and also of rare systemic reactions to adalimumab and etanercept. In reactive patients, a positive immediate skin test response to infliximab and anti-infliximab IgEs were seen in 28% (range, 4%-67%) and 41% (range, 13%-70%), respectively. Patients with anti-infliximab IgGs are at increased risk, with relative risk varying from 2.4 to 4.0 for immediate hypersensitivity reactions compared with patients without such antibodies.

### Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease: strategies and research directions [^81183ab4]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Infusion and injection site reactions

Infusion reactions can occur with anti-amyloid MABs, and patients must be monitored carefully during the infusion and for up to 2 ​h following. Most reactions occur in the first or second infusion and include flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, generalized aches, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation. Delayed reactions can occur. Acute reactions can be treated and prophylactic therapy can be administered with antihistamines, acetaminophen, or corticosteroids.

Infusion reactions occurred in 26.4 ​% of participants receiving lecanemab in the Phase 3 Clarity AD study and in 7.4 ​% of participants receiving placebo. In the Phase 3 Trailblazer-ALZ2 study, infusion-related reactions occurred in 8.7 ​% participants receiving the donanemab and in 0.5 ​% of participants receiving placebo.

None of the currently approved anti-amyloid MABs are available in subcutaneous formulations, but several subcutaneous anti-amyloid MABs are in development, and injection site reactions must be anticipated. In trials with gantenerumab --- an anti-amyloid MAB that was delivered subcutaneously --- injection site reactions occurred in 16.8 ​% of participants in the active therapy group compared to 7.7 ​% of those on placebo. Reactions were typically mild.

Vaccines—adverse events and hypersensitivity are characterized as follows: The reported incidence of any adverse effect after vaccine administration is 11.4 per 100,000; a retrospective US study reported 33 of 25,173,965 cases of anaphylaxis with no deaths (1.31 cases/ million doses), and another study reported immediate hypersensitivity to be 1 of 450,000 vaccines administered. Thirty-one percent of reactions occurred after the first administration of the vaccine. Immediate reactions occur minutes to hours after vaccination, whereas delayed reactions occur more than 60 minutes after vaccination and include rash, fever, and joint pain. Symptoms such as fever and injection-site edema are not considered manifestations of hypersensitivity and should not preclude future doses of the vaccine. IgE-mediated reactions are more likely to be directed at vaccine components than the active ingredient, and causative components include gelatin, egg protein, latex, and yeast.

### The how's and what's of vaccine reactogenicity [^b883c3ee]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

Factors that can influence reactogenicity

Extrinsic and intrinsic factors can impact the reactogenicity profile, tolerability and immunogenicity of vaccines in a given individual (Fig. 3). They include host characteristics, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass, general health and pre-existing immunity, and vaccine administration and composition factors, such as route and site of administration, injection technique, type of antigen, vaccine formulation, and type of adjuvant. The sections below provide some specific examples of the concepts being discussed.

Fig. 3 
Summary of vaccination and host factors that can influence reactogenicity. As a general concept, all the conditions that can influence the immune, the endocrine or the hormonal systems of the host (intrinsic factors), all the conditions that can increase tissue stress (administration factors) and the components that activate innate immunity contained in the vaccines (vaccine factors) could theoretically impact the incidence and severity of local and general symptoms induced after vaccination

Host characteristics that can influence reactogenicity

Age

Physiological functions of the immune and nervous systems evolve throughout life. These changes have implications for defence against infectious diseases at different ages, and can also influence susceptibility to adverse reactions to vaccination. While infants and toddlers tend to exhibit fewer injection-site reactions after vaccination than adults, they are more prone to experience fever episodes due to vaccination or other co-incidental infections.

Reporting rates of AEs following immunisation increase during childhood and adolescence as the immune system matures. Reporting rates of AEs reduce during adult life, possibly due to higher tolerance to pain and illness symptoms gained with life experience and/or the waning of innate immune defence mechanisms. The latter is supported by the observation that older people display lower systemic levels of IL-6, IL-10 and CRP after vaccination,which could contribute to their tendency to report fewer systemic AEs, in particular fever.

Gender

Compared to men, women tend to experience higher incidences of injection site, but not systemic symptoms after vaccination, – and may experience higher rates of immediate hypersensitivity reactions.Possible explanations could be related to genetic or hormonal differences.For example, anatomical differences in skin thickness, blood flow and nervous system structure between men and women may favour the development of injection-site inflammation in women.Further, sex hormones have been shown to influence immune responses and cytokine levels, with androgens and high doses of oestrogens being immunosuppressive.

Medication-specific issues

Several studies captured medication-specific reasons for participant’s non-adherence to treatment, and injection anxiety (n = 3) and injection-related reactions (n = 4) were commonly reported. Arroyo et al. carried out a descriptive analysis of reasons participants gave for lack of adherence and found that the second most common reason was injection-related reactions (43.2%) at baseline (which included tired of self-injection, skin reactions, needle phobia, injection site pain, not feeling the need to inject and nobody available to administer the injections). Injection-related reactions were also the most common reason for lack of adherence at year 1 and year 2 (89.5% and 72%, respectively) in this study. Devonshire et al. also found that injection-site reactions were the second most common reason for non-adherence and was reported by 32% of participants. The reactions included injection anxiety, skin reaction, not feeling the need for every injection and having nobody available to administer the injection. Similarly, Paolicelli et al. found that injection-site reactions were the third most common reason for missing doses (20.9%). Higuera et al. reported that those taking self-injectable medications, whose most common side effect was injection site reactions, were 9.1 percentage- points less adherent than those whose common side effect was flu-like symptoms. Injection anxiety was explored by Turner et al. who found that those who were nonadherent at any follow-up time point endorsed significantly higher injection anxiety at baseline, after adjusting for demographic characteristics, MS disability, medication type and time on DMD (t (88) = 2.65, p < 0.01).

### Don't play with your nodule: case report of tachycardia and other adverse reactions from manipulation of an exenatide injection site nodule [^e542f202]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) is an increasingly prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality among U.S. adults, with increasing prevalence in emergency department (ED) visits. Multiple medications, such as exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, have been developed in the past decade to combat this growing problem. This medication is well documented to cause gastrointestinal upset and skin nodules at the injection site. However, currently no documented cases exist regarding manipulation of injection nodules causing increased absorption or reports demonstrating an increase in adverse drug reactions.

Case Report

We report an interesting case of an adult male patient who likely experienced increased systemic absorption of exenatide by manipulating an injection nodule, which ultimately resulted in nausea, retching, diarrhea, and a tachycardic heart rate of 130-140 beats/min. These symptoms are known side effects of exenatide. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Given the high frequency of DM patients presenting to the ED, emergency physicians should be familiar with diabetic maintenance medications and their adverse reactions. Treating these side effects and properly educating patients can alleviate discomfort, prevent future adverse reactions, and decrease return visits to the ED.

### A complication of cosmetic medical tourism [^c6ba16ef]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers: 
A: Injection site reaction – Incorrect. Injection site reactions, such as erythema, swelling, pain, and bruising, are common immediate reactions, which generally resolve spontaneously within a week.
B: Acne fulminans – Incorrect. Acne fulminans is a rare disorder presenting as an acute, painful, ulcerating, and hemorrhagic lesions on face and trunk. It usually affects young males. It may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, polyarthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, etc. X-rays may show osteolytic bone lesions.
C: Acute facial cellulitis – Incorrect. Acute facial cellulitis is mostly unilateral acute infection, caused by Group A Streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus, and is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Routine laboratory tests may show leukocytosis. Fourteen days treatment with systemic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ciprofloxacin is expected to improve symptoms of this condition.
D: Delayed inflammatory reaction to dermal filler – Incorrect. Delayed inflammatory reactions are immune mediated reactions to dermal fillers. They appear weeks to years after injection of resorbable or permanent fillers. Such reactions are usually not accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy, neither start on day 4 after the injection.
E: Mycobacterium abscessus infection – Correct. Inflammatory nodules, presenting within 3 to 7 days after filler injection are suspected as infection. In spite Staphylococci and Streptococci are the most identified organisms, limited response to first-line antibiotics and lack of growth from routine bacterial culture should raise suspicion of nontuberculous mycobacteria. The most common nontuberculous mycobacteria species causing postcosmetic procedures skin infection are M abscessus, followed by Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium fortuitum.

Given the mass scale of COVID-19 vaccinations occurring globally, clinicians will likely see many patients who complain of both immediate and delayed injection-site reactions. Most reactions will be mild and be characterized by pain, edema, and redness; however, some reactions, as seen in our patient, can be severe. Nevertheless, the average person will not experience such reactions, and the risk-benefit ratio overwhelmingly favors vaccination in spite of these rare, often inconsequential (with rare exception) vaccine reactions.

Melanoma: Cutaneous—Interleukin-2 (IL-2) intralesional injection is supported by clinical studies, with the complete response rate in IL-2 injected lesions may be as high as 70%. Although response rates are higher in cutaneous lesions, good response rates have been observed in subcutaneous lesions as well. Intralesional injection of IL-2 is far less toxic than high-dose IV IL-2; Grade 1-2 adverse effects are common but manageable, and grade 3–4 toxicities are extremely rare. IL-2 is usually associated with an injection site inflammatory reaction (local swelling, erythema, pain, sometimes necrosis) and mild systemic flu-like symptoms that often respond to analgesics.

### The advisory committee on immunization practices' interim recommendation for use of pfizer-bioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-United States, December 2020 [^a19d5ac3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The body of evidence for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was primarily informed by one large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial that enrolled >43,000 participants (median age = 52 years, range = 16–91 years). Interim findings from this clinical trial, using data from participants with a median of 2 months of follow-up, indicate that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was 95.0% effective (95% confidence interval = 90.3%–97.6%) in preventing symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in persons without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consistent high efficacy (≥92%) was observed across age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions as well as among participants with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although numbers of observed hospitalizations and deaths were low, the available data were consistent with reduced risk for these severe outcomes among vaccinated persons compared with that among placebo recipients. Among vaccine recipients, reactogenicity symptoms, defined as solicited local injection site or systemic reactions during the 7 days after vaccination, were frequent and mostly mild to moderate. Systemic adverse reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were generally more frequent and severe in persons aged 18–55 years than in those aged >55 years. Systemic adverse reactions had a median onset of 1–2 days after vaccine receipt and resolved in a median of 1 day. Severe local and systemic adverse reactions (grade ≥3, defined as interfering with daily activity) occurred more commonly in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients. Among vaccine recipients, 8.8% reported any grade ≥3 reaction; the most common symptoms were fatigue (4.2%), headache (2.4%), muscle pain (1.8%), chills (1.7%), and injection site pain (1.4%). Generally, grade ≥3 reactions were more commonly reported after the second dose than after the first dose and were less prevalent in older than in younger participants. Serious adverse events ¶ were observed in a similar proportion of vaccine (0.6%) and placebo (0.5%) recipients and encompassed medical events occurring at a frequency similar to that within the general population. No specific safety concerns were identified in subgroup analyses by age, race, ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A detailed summary of safety data, including information on reactogenicity, is available at.

### Methotrexate injection site reactions: case report and literature review [^4dba7bc1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Table I 
Reported cases of methotrexate injection site reactions

In most previously reported cases of MTX injection site reactions, the lesions have improved significantly with MTX discontinuation and/or the application of topical steroids. Three cases have reported the discontinuation of subcutaneous MTX. Two of these 3 patients initiated oral MTX administration, and one concomitantly utilized topical antibiotics and steroids. Two additional patients noted improvement with topical steroid use.For our patient, however, topical steroids only resulted in mild improvements in the lesions. A consistent treatment regimen has not been identified, and further research is necessary to determine the best practices for addressing MTX injection site reactions.

To our knowledge, this is only the sixth report of an injection site reaction associated with the subcutaneous administration of MTX and the first reported in a patient with eosinophilic fasciitis. The subcutaneous administration of MTX has been found to be an effective alternative to oral administration. The initiation of subcutaneous MTX should be considered in patients intolerant of or unresponsive to oral MTX therapy. Although rare, injection site reactions can occur. Topical steroid treatment and/or alterations in MTX regimens may improve the lesions. Providers should consider close monitoring for injection site reactions following the initiation of subcutaneous MTX.

Acceptability Measures

All participants were administered a baseline face-to-face acceptability questionnaire that assessed participants’ initial attitudes towards PrEP characteristics, including what they think they would like (e.g. nothing; HIV prevention; ease of use; long duration; discretion; offered by provider; no interruption of sex) and dislike (e.g. nothing; no HIV prevention; painful; side effects; no reversibility; offered by provider; no discretion; cost) about the method. Prompts to “likes” and “dislikes” were not read, but interviewers coded spontaneous responses into pre-established options or an “other” category. One week after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd (both cohorts) and 4th and 5th (C2 only) injection visit, participants responded to a questionnaire that assessed acceptability of five product attributes on a scale of 1 = highly unacceptable to 6 = highly acceptable. Product attributes included: receiving two (C1) or one (C2) injection at a visit; size/quantity of each injection; receiving injections every three (C1) or two (C2) months; injection site in the buttocks and degree of privacy. We also assessed the acceptability of three physical experiences of injection, also rated on a 6-point scale: pain at injection site; rash or reaction at injection site; and side effects experienced since last injection. Participants could indicate that they did not experience any pain, rash/reaction or side effects, in which case their acceptability rating related to the physical symptom was recoded from missing to 6 = highly acceptable. We used the average of the five items related to “product attributes” and the average of the three items related to “physical experiences” as two separate time-varying covariates.

Any injection site reactions (ISR) that were either reported or observed during study visits were recorded on a separate adverse event log. These ISRs were further graded by clinic staff as mild, moderate or severe. We included a count variable of the number of reported ISRs, regardless of grade, in this analysis.

Methods

Guideline Development Process

This recommendation was drafted according to CDC’s guideline development standards. The work group developed the LEN PrEP recommendations as an update to the 2021 CDC PrEP Clinical Practice Guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The CDC 2024–2025 PrEP Guidelines Work Group comprised members from CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention who convened and met regularly during May 2024–January 2025. Members were selected for their experience (including clinical practice or research), expertise in PrEP-related topics, or experience in CDC guideline development. The work group generated a research question, conducted a systematic literature review, and synthesized evidence to guide work group discussions (–).

The focused research question for evidence synthesis was, “Should injectable LEN be included as an option for persons who would benefit from HIV PrEP?” The population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) framework was used, and the components were as follows: adults and adolescents weighing ≥77 lbs (≥35 kg) (weight criterion per LEN FDA label indication) who would benefit from PrEP for HIV (the population); LEN PrEP (the intervention); no or daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) PrEP (the comparison groups); and PrEP efficacy (HIV incidence rate ratio) compared with no PrEP use or daily oral TDF/FTC use, adverse events (excluding injection site reactions), injection site reactions, and grade 3–5 adverse events (severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse events) (the outcomes). LEN compared with injectable cabotegravir PrEP was not evaluated in the absence of randomized evidence comparing the two. All outcomes were deemed critical by the CDC 2024–2025 PrEP Guidelines Work Group to develop the LEN PrEP recommendations. The work group also considered acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and harms and benefits while developing the recommendations. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. *

Case presentation

A 17-year-old Latina female presented to our clinic with severe AD affecting the face, neck, trunk, and upper extremities. She had previously been treated with short courses of cyclosporine and managed her condition for many years with topical corticosteroids; subsequently, she developed cutaneous atrophy. She was initiated on FDA-approved dupilumab with a 600-mg loading dose, followed by a 300-mg biweekly maintenance dose. She reported clearance of her AD after an initial dose to her abdomen at the office without any complications. She did not report complications after her at-home administration of the second dose to her abdomen. Upon at-home administration of the third injection, the patient developed erythema, pain, and swelling, which progressed to an ulcer at her abdominal injection site over the following few days. Nine days later, the patient arrived at the office for an examination, where she noted decreased redness and swelling, but her pain persisted. To rule out hematoma from an improper injection technique, the patient received her fourth dose on the upper portion of the arm at the office by a trained nurse, 5 days following her recent office visit. The patient reported that she developed what she described as a “hematoma” at the site of the injection later that day. Over the next 5 days, the lesion progressively became tender and erythematous and began oozing purulent fluid, leading her to the emergency department.

### Measuring competing outcomes of a single-molecule reaction reveals classical arrhenius chemical kinetics [^1f3ae2fb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Programming matter one molecule at a time is a long-standing goal in nanoscience. The atomic resolution of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) can give control over the probability of inducing single-outcome single-molecule reactions. Here we show it is possible to measure and influence the outcome of a single-molecule reaction with multiple competing outcomes. By precise injection of electrons from an STM tip, toluene molecules are induced to react with two outcomes: switching to an adjacent site or desorption. Within a voltage range set by the electronic structure of the molecule-surface system, we see that the branching ratio between these two outcomes is dependent on the excess energy the exciting electron carries. Using known values, ab initio DFT calculations and empirical models, we conclude that this excess energy leads to a heating of a common intermediate physisorbed state and gives control over the two outcomes via their energy barriers and prefactors.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^faf1d14e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma—SCIT administration, safety, and monitoring: Clinicians should administer SCIT in their offices and provide direct supervision because of the risk of systemic reactions, and individuals with asthma should not administer SCIT at home. Before administering each SCIT injection, clinicians should assess individuals with asthma for uncontrolled asthma symptoms that suggest recent loss of asthma control, and physicians should consider withholding SCIT injections temporarily in patients whose asthma symptoms have worsened until their asthma control is restored. Local and systemic reactions of SCIT include a range of anaphylactic symptoms involving multiple organ systems, and although rare, deaths after injections have been reported. Before initiating immunotherapy, clinicians must review travel and time needs and the requirement for at least a 30-minute observational period after each injection.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^cefa58c5]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

Cabotegravir preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) injections—patients considering PrEP should be informed of all FDA approved options, and cabotegravir should not be administered to persons with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to cabotegravir. For adults at risk of acquiring HIV, 600 mg of cabotegravir injected into gluteal muscle every 2 months is recommended (conditional on FDA approval) for PrEP in adults at risk of acquiring HIV, and 30 mg daily oral cabotegravir is optional for a 4-week lead-in prior to injections. Other than those recommended in this guideline, no other injectable antiretrovirals, injection sites, or dosing schedules should be used as their efficacy is unknown. Do not administer or prescribe other antiretroviral medications in combination with CAB for PrEP. Do not administer CAB injections at any site other than gluteal muscle because the pharmacokinetics of drug absorption with injection at other sites is unknown. Do not dispense CAB injections for use by patients for home administration (unless and until self-administration is FDA approved). Do not prescribe ongoing daily oral CAB (other than for lead-in prior to initiating or restarting injections).

### Safety and tolerability of astegolimab, an anti-ST2 monoclonal antibody: a narrative review [^c290d3f3]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Injection site reactions

Injection site reactions occurred in 0–6% of patients receiving astegolimab and 1–10% of patients receiving placebo (Table 1). Injection site reactions were the most common treatment-related AE in ZENYATTA and occurred more frequently in the astegolimab arm than the placebo arm ; this contrasts with ZARNIE and COPD-ST2OP, in which injection site reactions were more common in the placebo arm than in the astegolimab arm (data on file). No dose-dependent response was observed in ZENYATTA (astegolimab 70 mg, n = 10 [8%]; astegolimab 210 mg, n = 8 [6%]; astegolimab 490 mg, n = 6 [5%]). All injection site reactions in ZENYATTA and ZARNIE were non-serious.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^831cfa43]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025—Melanoma: Cutaneous intralesional interleukin-2 (IL-2) is supported by clinical studies, with complete response rates in injected lesions reported as high as 70%; responses are higher in cutaneous lesions but have also been observed in subcutaneous lesions. Intralesional injection of IL-2 is far less toxic than high-dose IV IL-2; grade 1-2 adverse effects are common but manageable, grade 3-4 toxicities are extremely rare, and therapy is usually associated with local inflammatory reactions and mild systemic flu-like effects that often respond to analgesics.
