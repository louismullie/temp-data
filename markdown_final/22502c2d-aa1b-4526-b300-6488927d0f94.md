## Question

What antibiotic options can be used as alternatives for patients with penicillin allergies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic options can be used as alternatives for patients with penicillin allergies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the allergy label and risk stratification. Then, I should consider de-labeling strategies and direct challenges. Next, I will review cross-reactivity evidence and preferred beta-lactams, followed by when to reserve non–beta-lactam alternatives. After that, I need to cover special populations and inpatient pathways. Finally, I will integrate stewardship and summarize a pragmatic decision flow aligned with contemporary guidelines [^113xhrcn].

> Let me first confirm why verifying the penicillin allergy label is foundational, because if most labels are spurious, the downstream antibiotic choices and outcomes will be improved by correction. The prevalence of inaccurate penicillin allergy labels is high, on the order of 90–95%, and these labels are associated with broader-spectrum substitutions, higher costs, antimicrobial resistance, and worse outcomes including MRSA and C. difficile, so I need to ensure we start by validating the history before defaulting to alternatives [^1121QAt9] [^113DLCHE] [^116nTYfo].

> I need to check the history elements that distinguish true hypersensitivity from non-allergic adverse effects and then risk stratify. Wait, let me verify the key discriminators: immediate IgE-mediated symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory compromise, hypotension, and timing consistent with IgE within minutes to hours suggest true allergy, whereas isolated gastrointestinal upset, headache, or a family history alone are not consistent with allergy and should not preclude beta-lactam use; if the patient is anxious, a one-step amoxicillin challenge can be considered to reassure and de-label safely, and PEN-FAST can help identify low-risk patients suitable for direct challenges without prior skin testing, especially when the index reaction was benign and remote [^117RcH4t] [^115HSywW] [^115gvBEc] [^115ygF4x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk categories; I initially wrote that delayed hypersensitivity syndromes such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome belonged in a low-risk group, but wait, that cannot be right. I should double-check: severe T-cell–mediated delayed reactions including SJS/TEN, DRESS, hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia are high-risk contraindications to re-exposure to related beta-lactams, and these patients should avoid cefazolin and most within-class rechallenges, with specialist input for any future therapy considerations [^114FqJSb] [^115jhoxq].

> Let me consider delabeling pathways next, because restoring access to first-line beta-lactams improves efficacy and stewardship. For low-risk patients with distant, benign cutaneous reactions, a direct oral amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing is guideline-supported and highly safe, with direct drug provocation testing showing very low rates of mild immediate reactions and more than 99% negative predictive value; structured programs are fast and relatively inexpensive, which I should confirm to support routine implementation in ambulatory and inpatient settings [^115HSywW] [^1151izqc] [^113DLCHE].

> Next, I should review pregnancy because the peripartum indications frequently demand beta-lactams and alternatives are inferior. I need to ensure antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is encouraged: approximately 95% of unverified allergies are delabeled upon evaluation in pregnancy, ACOG supports expansion of testing, and delabeling enables first-line intrapartum GBS prophylaxis and cesarean prophylaxis with better maternal-neonatal outcomes compared with clindamycin or vancomycin strategies [^1157TKDX] [^112bGYXM] [^114mFugh].

> I will now examine cross-reactivity and preferred beta-lactams if avoidance is still in play or while awaiting testing, starting with cefazolin. Let me verify the structural argument: cefazolin's R1 side chain is unique and not shared with penicillins, which drives near-zero immunologic cross-reactivity, making cefazolin the preferred agent for most surgical prophylaxis and many obstetric indications unless there was a severe delayed hypersensitivity reaction; using cefazolin instead of vancomycin or clindamycin reduces surgical site infections and improves outcomes [^113Gvo9M] [^114FqJSb] [^113o9UXs] [^113RxJV8].

> But wait, what about monobactams and carbapenems if cephalosporins are questionable or the clinical scenario demands broad coverage. I should confirm that AAAAI 2022 supports using aztreonam and carbapenems without prior testing in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, and systematic review data suggest very low rates of IgE-mediated cross-reactivity for carbapenems even among penicillin skin test–positive patients, which supports their use when indicated for severe infections [^114cHE93] [^113xhrcn] [^113RYC9R].

> Let me think about other cephalosporins beyond cefazolin and how to match them safely. Hold on, I should verify that cross-reactivity is primarily driven by R1 side chain similarity rather than the beta-lactam core, and that in non-anaphylactic, unverified penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be administered without testing, whereas in anaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin with a non–cross-reactive side chain is acceptable without prior testing; for patients with a non-anaphylactic cephalosporin history, direct challenges to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains can clarify tolerance [^113Gvo9M] [^116jHpS8] [^116QU3xv] [^117U3K23].

> Now, I need to ensure we only reserve non–beta-lactam alternatives when there is a true contraindication to all relevant beta-lactams or a pathogen-specific need, because the harms are not trivial. I should confirm that routine substitution with vancomycin, clindamycin, or fluoroquinolones in penicillin-allergic patients increases risks of MRSA and C. difficile infection and is associated with treatment failure, longer length of stay, and higher costs, so these should be last-resort options rather than defaults [^113DLCHE] [^117LycsR].

> Let me review surgical prophylaxis as a special population where practice frequently deviates from evidence. I should double-check that cefazolin should remain first-line for most procedures in patients with reported penicillin allergy, except in those with prior severe delayed reactions, with multiple health-system interventions showing improved cefazolin use, lower SSI rates, and extremely low rates of mild allergic reactions in penicillin-allergic arthroplasty cohorts, which supports safety and efficacy [^113o9UXs] [^115QEy9w] [^114FqJSb].

> Next, I should review inpatient protocols that operationalize safe beta-lactam use. I need to check that test-dose or graded challenge pathways, combined with standardized histories, increase penicillin and cephalosporin use two- to threefold without increasing adverse reactions and decrease vancomycin, aztreonam, fluoroquinolone, and carbapenem use, which is precisely the stewardship signal we want to see on the wards [^1155cqDA] [^111HVDs8].

> I should confirm the stewardship integration components that sustain this practice beyond isolated consults. Hold on, I should verify that institutional guidelines aligned with AAAAI parameters, provider education on cross-reactivity, EMR-embedded tools like PEN-FAST, expanded access to direct challenges, and outcome monitoring are the backbone of effective programs that reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum use and improve patient outcomes [^116ZpxGL] [^1155cqDA] [^115gvBEc].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision flow while keeping the self-checks explicit. First, verify the history and apply risk stratification; if the history is inconsistent with allergy, remove the label and use first-line penicillin therapy. If low risk, proceed to a direct oral amoxicillin challenge to delabel, then use penicillins as indicated. If high risk or testing is not feasible, preferentially use cefazolin for surgical and many obstetric indications unless there was a severe delayed reaction; otherwise consider aztreonam or carbapenems when clinically indicated, and reserve non–beta-lactams for true contraindications or pathogen-specific needs. I need to ensure the overarching principle is the narrowest effective beta-lactam whenever possible, because that strategy improves efficacy, safety, and resistance outcomes and is reinforced by inpatient protocol data and population-level analyses [^113DLCHE] [^1155cqDA].

For patients with penicillin allergy, **cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains** (e.g. cefazolin, ceftriaxone) [^114FqJSb] are safe for most patients, including those with prior anaphylaxis, except in severe delayed reactions [^116QU3xv]. Carbapenems [^113xhrcn] and aztreonam [^114cHE93] can be used **without prior testing**. Select non–beta-lactam options — macrolides, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides — based on infection and susceptibility. Avoid cephalosporins with similar side chains in severe delayed reactions [^116QU3xv]; use clindamycin and fluoroquinolones cautiously due to C. difficile and resistance risks [^113DLCHE] [^117LycsR]. Risk stratification and allergy testing enable **safe beta-lactam use** [^1162mEkJ] and reduce adverse outcomes [^1155cqDA].

## Beta-lactam alternatives

### Cephalosporins

- **Cross-reactivity**: Low (≤ 2%) with penicillins; higher with similar side chains [^116QU3xv] [^113Gvo9M].
- **Safe options**: Cefazolin [^114FqJSb] and ceftriaxone (dissimilar side chains) are safe even after penicillin anaphylaxis, except in severe delayed reactions [^116QU3xv].
- **Avoid**: Cephalosporins with similar side chains in severe delayed reactions (e.g. SJS, TEN, DRESS) [^116QU3xv].

---

### Carbapenems

Carbapenems have **very low cross-reactivity** (< 1%) with penicillins, and agents such as meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, and doripenem can be given without prior testing [^113xhrcn].

---

### Monobactams

Aztreonam has **no cross-reactivity** with penicillins — except with ceftazidime (shared side chain) — and is safe without prior testing [^114cHE93] [^113xhrcn].

---

## Non-beta-lactam alternatives

### Macrolides

Agents include **azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin**; uses include **respiratory and skin/soft-tissue infections** and coverage of atypical pathogens.

---

### Clindamycin

### Cefazolin as the mainstay for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy in obstetrics and gynecology [^114FqJSb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common antibiotic used for prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology. Among those with a penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics are often chosen for prophylaxis due to fears of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cefazolin. However, alternative antibiotics in this setting are associated with adverse sequelae, including surgical site infection, induction of bacterial resistance, higher costs to the healthcare system, and possible Clostridium difficile infection. Given the difference in R1 side chains between penicillin and cefazolin, cefazolin use is considered safe and should be recommended for patients with a penicillin allergy, including those who have Immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis. Cefazolin should only be avoided in individuals who have a history of severe, life-threatening delayed hypersensitivity reactions manifested as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia in response to penicillin administration.

In addition, more than 90% of individuals with a documented penicillin allergy do not have true allergies on skin testing. Increased referral for penicillin allergy testing should be incorporated into routine obstetric care and preoperative assessment to reduce suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis use. More education is needed among providers regarding penicillin allergy assessment and cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins to optimize antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology.

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: population based matched cohort study [^113DLCHE]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, patients with documented penicillin allergy had an increased incidence of broad-spectrum antibiotic use, including the extended Gram-positive spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and linezolid, which should be reserved for patients with suspected or known MRSA (or vancomycin-resistant enterococci for linezolid). Use of the most narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is effective for a given infection is a cornerstone of evidence-based treatment for infection and is responsible antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship committees enforce this aim in the hospital setting, with evaluations for penicillin allergy occasionally included in stewardship efforts. This analysis emphasizes the importance of performing outpatient antibiotic stewardship and the role that penicillin allergy evaluations might play.

Although diagnostic testing for penicillin allergy was developed in the 1960s and has recently garnered the support of a variety of professional organizations, less than 0.1% of patients with a penicillin allergy label undergo confirmatory testing. Evaluation of penicillin allergy often involves a skin test, and if the result of skin testing is negative, a challenge dose of penicillin or amoxicillin is administered under medical observation. With these evaluation tools, evaluation of penicillin allergy has a more than 99% negative predictive value, takes less than three hours to perform, and costs about $220 (£165; €188; 2016 currency conversion). Previous observational cohorts have shown that more than 90% of patients with listed penicillin allergies can be safely treated.

### Inpatient β-lactam test-dose protocol and antimicrobial stewardship in patients with a history of penicillin allergy [^1155cqDA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in hospitalized patients, resulting in increased second-line antibiotic use, nosocomial infections, and increased health care utilization. Given that most patients are not truly allergic, a safe strategy that empowers the admitting physician is needed.

- **Objective**: To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing practices for hospitalized patients with penicillin allergy using a validated intervention.

- **Methods**: An intervention was implemented to educate health care professionals on the management of patients with penicillin allergy. This involved using a validated risk stratification algorithm to guide testing and antibiotic use. Thirty days of control data using the standard of care were compared with 60 days of post-intervention data, measuring documentation of penicillin allergy history and antibiotic selection.

- **Results**: The relative use of cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics increased by 121.2% (P = 0.03) and 256% (P = 0.04), respectively, without an increase in adverse drug reactions. There was a decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin decreased by 67.2% (P = 0.04), quinolones by 33.3% (P = 0.31), carbapenems by 81.9% (P = 0.08), and aztreonam by 73.8% (P = 0.18).

- **Conclusion**: Antibiotic choice in patients admitted to the hospital with a reported penicillin allergy can be improved by better evaluation of the allergy history and the use of a risk stratification guideline.

### Impact of antimicrobial stewardship interventions on peripartum antibiotic prescribing in patients with penicillin allergy [^113RxJV8]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). High credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems) are preferred for group B streptococcus prophylaxis, intra-amniotic infection, and cesarean surgical site infection prophylaxis. Non-beta-lactam alternatives are associated with inferior efficacy and contribute to higher rates of surgical site infection and longer lengths of stay. Most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate penicillins without any adverse reaction. There are low rates of cross-reactivity between penicillins and other beta-lactams, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. Efforts to evaluate penicillin allergy and promote the use of beta-lactams are needed.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate whether an antimicrobial stewardship intervention improved the use of first-line antibiotics for peripartum indications in patients with a reported penicillin allergy, following updates to institutional guidelines.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective study of adult patients presenting for vaginal or cesarean delivery at two hospitals within a healthcare system. Patients received at least one dose of antibiotics for a peripartum indication between May 1, 2018, and October 31, 2018 (preintervention group) and May 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020 (postintervention group). The stewardship intervention bundle, which was implemented between March 2019 and April 2020, included updates to institutional antibiotic guidelines, reclassification of severe penicillin allergy, development of obstetrical prophylaxis and treatment order sets, and promotion of allergy referral services.

### A systematic review: Can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins [^113RYC9R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta-lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

- **Results**: Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval, 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%); this included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

In conclusion, the cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions is not well-defined and varies depending on the patient's history.

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^113iGmtF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

To evaluate the choice of antibiotic used for intrapartum Group B Streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis in pregnant individuals with reported penicillin allergies compared to those without reported penicillin allergies, and investigate whether there are associated differences in neonatal outcomes, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study included mother-infant dyads of GBS-positive pregnant individuals who labored and delivered newborns at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation at a high-volume urban hospital between 2005 and 2018.

The type of antibiotic administered to the mothers for GBS prophylaxis (beta-lactam prophylaxis defined as penicillin-class drug or cefazolin; alternative prophylaxis defined as vancomycin or clindamycin) was compared between those with a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record versus those who did not. Neonatal outcomes included the number of postnatal blood draws, antibiotic administration, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, bacteremia, and hospital length of stay, and were compared between groups. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed.

Of 11,334 mother-infant pairs, 1,170 (10.3%) mothers had a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record. Of them, 49 (4.2%) received penicillin, 259 (22.1%) received cefazolin, 449 (38.4%) received clindamycin, and 413 (35.3%) received vancomycin. Patients with a reported penicillin allergy were significantly more likely to receive alternative GBS prophylaxis compared to those without a penicillin allergy (73.7% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.01).

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: Implications for clinical practice [^113vz5NC]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with a beta-lactam antibiotic (BA) allergy label, avoidance of the whole group of BAs leads to displacement of first-line therapies, potentially influencing patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Studies previously published on BA cross-reactivity use different sets of BA and seem to contain conflicting recommendations on safe BA alternatives in case of (suspected) BA allergy.

- **Methods**: The objectives were (i) to identify discrepancies between studies regarding cross-allergy in BA and (ii) to identify research gaps. The tables and errata of four studies (Romano et al, Trubiano et al, Zagursky et al, swab-guideline by Wijnakker et al.) were evaluated and compared head-to-head.

- **Results**: A total of 51 antibiotics were covered by the four authors, theoretically leading to 2550 potential recommendations regarding alternatives in case of specific allergies. Internal discrepancies existed in two tables. Since none of the tables included all 51 BAs, in 356 situations data were lacking regarding specific alternatives. In 1104 situations, only one author gave advice about a specific alternative. Harmony and disharmony between authors could be evaluated in 1090 cases. The advice regarding alternative BAs was in harmony 696 times (482 safe, 214 unsafe), while discrepancies were found in 394 cases. This led to different advice (safe vs. unsafe) in 272 cases or 69%.

- **Conclusion**: Disharmony between authors was identified in 36% of the cases. In 69%, this led to clinically relevant, different advice. This indicates the need for synchronization of cross-reactivity interpretations among different authors and studies to provide consistent clinical guidance.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^114nudbf]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are vital in combating bacterial infections, yet their effectiveness is diminishing due to increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR), partly stemming from overuse and misuse. The susceptibility of an infection to antibiotics is typically determined through microbiological testing, a process that can take several days. Consequently, a common scenario contributing to antibiotic misuse arises when patients are treated with antibiotics before the causative pathogen and its AMR profile are identified — an approach known as empiric therapy. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, they are reported as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) — the minimum concentration of an antibiotic required to inhibit the growth of the pathogen — or categorized into susceptible, intermediate, or resistant groups based on established MIC thresholds. To enhance the responsible prescription of antibiotics, guidelines have been developed that facilitate treatment decisions based on anticipated pathogens, resistance profiles, and related healthcare costs of different antibiotics.

AMR arises from both individual and population-level antibiotic use. At the population level, the overall volume and patterns of antibiotics play a significant role in driving resistance, as resistant pathogens spread between individuals. At the individual level, antibiotic use selects for infection and colonization with resistant bacterial strains. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the potential of different antibiotics to induce future resistance on an individual level.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^113ydjgQ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Potential confounders, such as the indication for antibiotic use, illness severity at presentation, and patient demographics, present substantial challenges for retrospective studies in this field; researchers often struggle to access these variables. However, advances in causal inference theory have substantially improved our ability to discern causal effects from observational data. In particular, the use of instrumental variables (IVs) can provide reliable estimates of causal effects when the appropriate methodology and falsification tests are applied, emulating natural-experiment-like conditions.

Here, we propose to employ the reported allergy to penicillin as such an IV. Reported penicillin allergy satisfies the essential conditions needed for a valid IV analysis. First, it causally influences prescription practices, leading physicians to opt for non-penicillin antibiotics upon presentation of penicillin allergy. Second, reported penicillin allergy also inherently does not directly affect the AMR of bacterial populations.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^114ebG1B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically with respect to the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering the confirmation of a negative cephalosporin skin test before administering a parenteral cephalosporin with a non-identical R1 side chain in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a cephalosporin.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^112bGYXM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The potential benefits of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women with a suspected allergy include adherence to guideline-directed antibiotic therapy in the setting of group B streptococcus prophylaxis or cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis and reduction in exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin allergy testing to document those who truly require alternative treatments supports antibiotic stewardship to mitigate emerging drug resistance. Penicillin allergy testing should ideally occur preconception or at the time of initial allergy reaction.

Obstetricians can also use preconception encounters as well as postpartum visits to counsel women regarding the benefits of penicillin allergy testing. Recent publications, as well as the latest Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the consideration of penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Given the low incidence of anaphylaxis, this study highlights the ability to perform allergy testing in the outpatient setting. In light of the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship and demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of testing, women with a reported penicillin allergy can undergo allergy testing in pregnancy.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, rather than just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test. This was even the case when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shows that it has two side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin. This suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of non-confirmed penicillin allergy also had the label.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from the available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations for which penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended first-line agents, the problem of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative but potentially less effective agents.

Use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth. Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin.

The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^112CRMFf]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The most common cause of drug‐induced allergic reactions is penicillins, with allergies manifesting as a variety of symptoms. These symptoms can range from non‐compatible allergic reactions and mild allergic symptoms, such as widespread erythema, urticaria, or periorbital edema, to severe anaphylaxis, which includes circulatory failure, cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, and potentially death.

The diagnosis of reactions to penicillins is complex. According to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the first step involves obtaining a detailed clinical history. However, patient-provided information is often inaccurate, especially after long delays and when details regarding symptoms and the suspected antibiotic are incomplete. As a result, in vitro and skin tests (STs) are usually necessary. If these tests are negative, a drug provocation test (DPT) should be considered.

Evidence suggests that many patients with a history of penicillin allergy show negative STs and even tolerate the suspected antibiotic in DPT. This may be due to a loss of specific IgE (sIgE) to penicillins after avoiding exposure to the drug that caused the allergic reaction. In serum tests, sIgE to penicillin and/or amoxicillin (AX) was not detected in 50% of patients three years after the reaction, and in no patient after four years. Regarding the basophil activation test, negativization occurred in 60% of patients after 18 months. For STs, it has been reported that up to 30% of patients with IgE‐mediated hypersensitivity become test-negative.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^1157LxWK]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

This study exploits a unique phenomenon, namely purported penicillin allergy, to estimate the causal effects of prior antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance, in real-world primary care settings. Our analysis quantifies the impact of previous use of penicillins on resistance rates of future infections to the three penicillins. The largest effect was observed in resistance to ampicillin, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and finally piperacillin/tazobactam. The low NNH values estimated for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin suggest that consumption of penicillins may frequently lead to AMR to these antibiotics upon infections. In contrast, the higher NNH for piperacillin/tazobactam indicates a comparatively lower cost of resistance, suggesting that only a small number of patients exposed to penicillins would lose the ability to be effectively treated with this antibiotic due to resistance.

In line with both biological reasoning and previous knowledge, all three outcomes demonstrated a gradual decrease in the RD for antibiotic resistance with each subsequent time point, reflecting the diminishing impact of prior antibiotic use. In contrast, gentamicin, the negative-control antibiotic, displayed no such effect nor trend, further affirming the validity of our analysis. In our additional analysis, we compared past usage of penicillin with that of quinolones on corresponding AMR tests within the 180-day post-exposure. The past use of penicillins was linked to resistance rates for penicillins, but this association was lower than the association between quinolones and resistance.

### Safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation: A systematic review [^1157TKDX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 8–13% of pregnant patients report a penicillin allergy. Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy but are often avoided in these patients, leading to suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare, with 95% of unverified penicillin allergies being delabeled upon evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few are assessed. Research concerning antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, prompting this systematic review to summarize the growing body of evidence for obstetric providers.

- **Data sources**: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed ahead-of-print and non-Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There was no restriction on study language, date, or design.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: All peer-reviewed studies of pregnant people reporting unverified penicillin allergy undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with ≥ 5 participants were included. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies regarding desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: Title/abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors, with conflicts resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^11351ZsH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with documented penicillin allergy, a clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone-containing regimen may represent an initial empirical approach. Culture and an antimicrobial susceptibility test, if available before any treatment attempt, could be an alternative option.

H. pylori eradication is a challenge in patients allergic to penicillin. This leads to suboptimal choices and an increased risk of treatment failure using regimens that omit amoxicillin. It may be speculated that the rate of resistance to antibiotics other than β-lactam antibiotics could be even higher in such patients, especially regarding macrolides and particularly clarithromycin. Therefore, if the history is ambiguous, it seems appropriate to refer patients for allergy testing before any initial therapeutic approach since the vast majority can ultimately be safely given amoxicillin-containing regimens. There is a lack of data from clinical trials addressing the issue of H. pylori eradication in penicillin-allergic patients in Greece. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and culture, if available, could be the initial approach; if not, the initial therapeutic step should be an empirical one. The substitution of metronidazole for amoxicillin in a triple combination (PPI–clarithromycin–metronidazole) is not an effective option given the well-known prevalence of resistance to either or both antibiotics. As empirical first-line treatment, one could use the combination PPI–levofloxacin–clarithromycin for 10 days.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^116TJFdo]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our findings have implications for both guidelines and clinical practice, and methodological approaches to the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Clinically, our results provide causal estimates of the additional risk and number needed to harm (NNH) impacted by prior use of penicillins and quinolones in the outpatient settings, over different periods since exposure. Such estimates should also play a substantial role in the cost-benefit considerations when determining empiric antibiotic treatment guidelines. Specifically, penicillins induce substantial future resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, and, to a lower extent, piperacillin tazobactam. Moreover, penicillins, compared to quinolones, appear to induce lower respective antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thereby enhancing their utility in subsequent treatments.

Methodologically, we propose a novel approach, built on an original instrumental variable (IV), that opens a venue for further research on antibiotic groups inducing allergic reactions, such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and sulfonamides.

### Is spurious penicillin allergy a major public health concern only in high-income countries [^1121QAt9]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The burden and adverse impact of penicillin allergy labels in high-income countries

Penicillin allergy labels (PALs) occur in 6% and 10% of the general population in England as well as the United States, respectively, and in 15%–20% of inpatients in the United States and England (local audit data). Importantly, 90%–95% of PALs are spurious (or inaccurate) and present a significant impediment to prompt and effective antimicrobial stewardship. This issue is related to multiple factors, including gaps in knowledge and skills among prescribers, and inaccurate documentation and interpretation of side effects leading to mislabeling as penicillin allergy.

PALs lead to increased prescribing of alternative second-line antibiotics such as quinolones, glycopeptides, and carbapenems. Apart from increased antibiotic costs, this enhances the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, iatrogenic infections such as Clostridioides difficile and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, surgical site infections, delayed treatment of sepsis, and contributes to longer hospital stays.

To put AMR into a global perspective, it results in an estimated 700,000 deaths per year, and the burden is higher in low-income countries (LICs; as per World Bank classification; gross national income (GNI) per capita on 1 July 2020, < US$1036) and low-middle-income countries (LMICs; GNI, US$1036–US$4045). It has been suggested that if there are no mitigation strategies in place to address AMR by 2050, an estimated loss of 10 million lives alongside a cost of US$100 trillion has been predicted.

### Penicillin allergy as an instrumental variable for estimating antibiotic effects on resistance [^114z9bWq]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Our outcomes were the binary results of antibiotic susceptibility tests, with resistance coded as 1, at various follow-up times (90, 180, 270, and 365 days). We considered antibiotic resistance results within the penicillin group, comprising ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as ciprofloxacin within the fluoroquinolones group. We note that piperacillin/tazobactam was added as a penicillin-group outcome but not exposure because susceptibility to it is routinely tested, while it is very rarely prescribed in community settings in Israel. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, served as an NCO for the IV independence assumption (explained below). We chose gentamicin due to its lack of association with the penicillin/beta-lactam family, its relative frequency in AMR test panels, and its infrequent use in outpatient settings. The bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were conducted using the automated VITEK 2 system, following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Intermediate results were considered as resistant.

Our analysis focused exclusively on Escherichia coli isolates, which accounted for 71.6% of the total samples. Utilizing IV analysis, we estimated the risk difference of antibiotic resistance between individuals exposed to penicillins and those exposed to alternative antibiotic groups at the various post-antibiotic use follow-up times.

- **IV framework**: We assert that antibiotic allergies, particularly penicillin, can serve as an IV in studying antibiotic use and future antibiotic resistance outcomes.

### Antibiotic choice for group B streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines. There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS-positive mothers.

Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact on neonates.

### A simple algorithmic approach allows the safe use of cephalosporin in "penicillin-allergic" patients without the need for allergy testing [^115tN7yA]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2021). Low credibility.

Patients who report a penicillin allergy are often given second-line antibiotic prophylaxis during total joint arthroplasty (TJA), with only a minority of patients undergoing additional consultations and allergy testing. To increase the use of cephalosporin prophylaxis in TJA, the present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a simple, protocol-driven penicillin allergy screening program without the need for additional work-up.

- **Methods**: Following implementation of a questionnaire-based screening protocol in May 2019, all patients scheduled for primary TJA were risk-stratified into low or high-risk categories. The low-risk cohort received cefazolin, and the high-risk cohort received non-cefazolin antibiotics. Patients were monitored prospectively, and data on antibiotic usage and adverse outcomes were documented. The protocol group (n = 2,078) was propensity score matched 1:1 with a control group that included patients who underwent TJA in the same institution prior to implementation of the protocol. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of the protocol in reducing unnecessary use of non-cephalosporin antibiotics for prophylaxis. Secondary outcomes included the rate of surgical site infections and allergic reactions to the administered antibiotic.

- **Results**: A total of 357 patients (17.2%) reported a penicillin allergy in the protocol group compared with 310 patients (14.9%) with a recorded allergy in the control group (p = 0.052). The number of patients who received non-cephalosporin antibiotics was significantly lower in the protocol group.

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^116b5sMa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the choice of antibiotic used for intrapartum group B Streptococcus (GBS) prophylaxis in pregnant individuals with reported penicillin allergies compared to those without reported penicillin allergies, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. The study also aimed to investigate whether there are associated differences in neonatal outcomes.

- **Study design**: The study included mother-infant dyads of GBS-positive pregnant individuals who labored and delivered newborns at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation at a high-volume urban hospital from 2005 to 2018. The type of antibiotic administered to the mothers for GBS prophylaxis, defined as beta-lactam prophylaxis (penicillin-class drug or cefazolin) or alternative prophylaxis (vancomycin or clindamycin), was compared between those with a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record versus those who did not. Neonatal outcomes, including the number of postnatal blood draws, antibiotic administration, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, bacteremia, and hospital length of stay, were compared between groups using bivariable and multivariable analyses.

- **Results**: Among 11,334 mother-infant pairs, 1,170 (10.3%) mothers had a penicillin allergy documented in their medical record. Of these, 49 (4.2%) received a penicillin, 259 (22.1%) received cefazolin, 449 (38.4%) received clindamycin, and 413 (35.3%) received vancomycin. Patients with a reported penicillin allergy were significantly more likely to receive alternative GBS prophylaxis compared to those without a penicillin allergy (73.7% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.01). Neonates of patients who received alternative GBS prophylaxis were also evaluated for differences in neonatal outcomes.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases healthcare costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. However, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternative drugs is necessary. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for the reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Pen-fast-ed: Utilizing the PEN-FAST decision tool to guide antibiotic prescribing in the emergency department [^115gvBEc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED), often leading to the use of non-beta-lactam antibiotics despite beta-lactams' status as first-line therapy for most bacterial infections. The PEN-FAST clinical decision tool was developed and validated to identify patients with a low risk of true penicillin allergies that do not require formal skin testing for rechallenging. The tool comprises four questions, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 5. Scores of 0–2 indicate a low risk of true penicillin allergy (< 5% risk of true reaction), scores of 3 denote a moderate risk (< 20% risk), and scores of 4–5 indicate a high risk (50% risk). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our facility's implementation of pharmacist utilization of the PEN-FAST screening tool to assess claimed penicillin allergies and rechallenge patients with low to moderate risk in the ED.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study conducted from October 2023 to March 2024. Adult ED patients with a documented penicillin allergy and an order for aztreonam, levofloxacin, clindamycin, or a consult for pharmacy assistance with antibiotic selection were included. Patients were excluded if the order or consult was placed by a non-ED physician, no penicillin allergy was documented, the patient had previously tolerated penicillin or a cephalosporin per chart review, was unable to participate in the interview, or the completion of the assessment would delay patient care. The primary outcome was

### The economic burden of antibiotic treatment of penicillin-allergic patients in internal medicine wards of a general tertiary care hospital [^117BkDXV]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy poses a major problem in the management of infectious diseases.

- **Objective**: We estimated the costs and usage of antibiotic treatment of 'penicillin-allergic' patients in comparison to non-allergic patients in a tertiary care hospital.

- **Materials and methods**: The study was based on the records of 118 randomly chosen in-hospital patients labeled as being 'allergic to penicillin' and who were treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic selection and cost of the patients with alleged penicillin allergy were compared to 118 matched patients without an antibiotic allergy (controls).

- **Results**: During in-hospital treatment, the mean antibiotic cost for penicillin-allergic patients was 63% higher than the cost for the controls. In addition, there was a 38% higher cost of the recommended antimicrobial treatment regimen to be followed upon discharge by the former compared to the latter.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin-allergic patients were more likely to receive broader spectrum antibiotics compared to the non-allergic ones. Since many of the patients who are labeled as being 'allergic to penicillin' are, in fact, not allergic to it, inaccurate reporting of penicillin allergies may have costly economic and epidemiologic repercussions in addition to more toxic effects which can occur when choosing alternative drugs in case of penicillin allergy.

### Safety of direct drug provocation for the evaluation of penicillin allergy in low-risk adults [^1151izqc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

About 10% of patients have a penicillin allergy label, but less than 5% of them are actually allergic. Unnecessary penicillin avoidance is associated with serious medical consequences. Given the growing number of these labels, it is imperative that our diagnostic strategy for penicillin allergy be as efficient as possible. The validity of traditionally used skin tests (STs) has been questioned, whereas drug provocation testing (DPT), the criterion standard, without previous ST appears very safe in most cases.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of direct DPT without consideration for ST results and the validity of ST in the diagnosis of penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: In this prospective cohort study without a control group, we recruited patients consulting an allergist for penicillin allergy. Patients underwent ST followed by DPT regardless of ST results. Patients with anaphylaxis to penicillin within the past 5 years or a severe delayed reaction were excluded, as were those with significant cardiorespiratory comorbidity.

- **Results**: None of the 1002 recruited patients had a serious reaction to DPT. Ten (1.0%) had a mild immediate reaction, of whom only 1 (0.1%) was considered likely IgE-mediated. The positive and negative predictive values of ST for an immediate reaction were 3.6% and 99.1%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: In a low-risk adult population reporting penicillin allergy, ST has a very poor positive predictive value. Direct DPT without ST is safe and appears to be an ideal diagnostic strategy to remove penicillin allergy labels that could be implemented in fir.

Penicillins are the most common antibiotic class prescribed globally in primary, secondary, and tertiary care for common and serious bacterial infections, including sepsis. They are cost-effective medications available in parenteral and oral formulations and have an excellent safety profile. The downside to the use of penicillins is that they are most commonly implicated in adverse drug reactions, including allergy or hypersensitivity, due to a greater chance of sensitization following frequent exposure.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^111SzC4K]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Balancing drug allergy with antibiotic stewardship is a difficult and ever-present challenge for the obstetrician. Antibiotics are administered to 30–74% of women during pregnancy for a wide variety of indications. The most commonly used antibiotics include penicillin and other beta-lactams, clindamycin and other macrolides, and aminoglycosides.

Pregnant women with a self-reported penicillin allergy typically receive alternative antibiotics that are broader spectrum (e.g. cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin), increasing the risk for antibiotic resistance and maternal morbidity. In the general population, self-reported penicillin allergy occurs in 10% of patients; however, when tested, fewer than 2% have a proven (or true) allergic reaction. Penicillin allergy also decreases over time, with up to 80% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy losing sensitization 10 years later.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourages the consideration of allergy testing in women who self-report a penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergy can be confirmed through skin testing, but there are limited data to inform allergy testing in pregnancy. Two studies using skin testing with 27 and 56 pregnant women reported that only 3% and 7% of women, respectively, had a true penicillin allergy, and none had anaphylaxis. Neither of these studies in pregnant women included a graded oral challenge, which is important because an oral drug challenge is the gold standard for determining true drug allergy.

Our aim was to estimate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of outpatient pen…

### Cephalosporins can be given to penicillin-allergic patients who do not exhibit an anaphylactic response [^1135Ysag]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the risk of intraoperative allergic reactions to cephalosporins in patients who claim to be allergic to penicillin, a retrospective chart review was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital. The study reviewed 2,933 intraoperative anesthesia records of all adult orthopedic patients treated at the institution during a 14-month period (from July 1996 to August 1997), focusing on antibiotic use and allergic reactions.

Most of the 2,933 orthopedic patients, including 413 patients who reported penicillin allergies, received a cephalosporin (usually cefazolin) during their procedures. Only one penicillin-allergic patient may have experienced an allergic reaction to the cephalosporin, as evidenced by the administration of diphenhydramine and hydrocortisone at the beginning of the case. However, there was no mention on the chart of itching, rash, or hives. One patient who was not allergic to penicillin developed a rash during cephalosporin infusion, necessitating the discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Given the low incidence of allergic reactions, it appears safe to administer cephalosporins to patients claiming penicillin allergies. However, no conclusions can be drawn regarding patients who report severe or anaphylactic reactions to penicillin, as they were likely excluded from the study.

### A closer look at penicillin allergy history: Systematic review and meta-analysis of tolerance to drug challenge [^1162mEkJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

True allergy to penicillin is rare, despite the high frequency with which it is reported. While most patients reporting penicillin allergy are not prone to anaphylaxis, it is currently unknown what percentage of these patients will tolerate dose challenges of penicillin-based antibiotics. This review aims to determine the rate of tolerance in patients reporting penicillin allergy when challenged with penicillin-based antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We searched MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Library for publications with English language translations between the years 2000 and 2017. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies of participants reporting penicillin allergy who received at least one systemic dose of a penicillin in the form of a drug challenge. At least two independent reviewers extracted data from included studies and assessed the quality of each included study. To generate primary outcome data, we calculated a summary estimate rate of penicillin tolerance from a pooled proportion of participants receiving penicillin with no adverse effects.

- **Results**: The initial literature search yielded 2,945 studies, of which 23 studies were ultimately included in our review. A total of 5,056 study participants with a reported history of penicillin allergy were challenged with a penicillin. After weighting for study sample size, a pooled average of 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.7%-95%) of participants tolerated the dose challenge without any adverse reaction.

- **Conclusion**: Misrepresented penicillin allergy drives unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1157buWX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and pediatric allergy and other clinicians practicing allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence-based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a web-based process, and all comments were carefully considered.

Included in the guideline are:

- **Epidemiology**: Discusses allergic reactions to beta-lactams.
- **Molecular structure**: Details formulations available in the UK and known beta-lactam antigenic determinants.
- **Clinical considerations**: Explores the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing, and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins.
- **Cross-reactivity**: Provides an in-depth discussion of the cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins.
- **Procedures**: Offers recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures.
- **Pediatric guidance**: Contains guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children in a separate section.

An algorithm to assist clinicians in diagnosing patients with a history of penicillin allergy has also been included.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after vs. before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs. 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .05) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs. 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs. 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs. 3.3%, P < .001).

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To perform a pharmaco-economic analysis of prescribing alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and assess whether collation of information from a structured history and liaison with the family physician could reduce costs, a prospective pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physician was used to assess the validity of the diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy'. Cost analysis of prescription of alternative antibiotics was performed and compared with first-line agents.

A total of 102 patients were assessed. Only 40% (n = 41) were found to have a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity, 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy was 1.82–2.58 times higher than for first-line antibiotics.

In conclusion, obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician alone can enable an accurate identification of penicillin allergy status. The total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and pose a threat to the appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is enormous, as SSIs are the most common and costly health care-associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. Administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis aims to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multi-drug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures due to its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by a reduction in the use of first-line antibiotics, most often cefazolin. When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are demonstrably higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multi-drug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, there is good evidence that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely, and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled because either a patient was mislabeled at the time of the inciting event, or because, in cases of true allergy, most cases will be outgrown within 10 years.

### Perioperative cefazolin for total joint arthroplasty patients who have a penicillin allergy: Is it safe [^115QEy9w]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Low credibility.

Cefazolin is the standard of care for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in the United States. The potential allergic cross-reactivity between cefazolin and penicillin causes uncertainty regarding the optimal antibiotic choice in patients who have a reported penicillin allergy (rPCNA). The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of perioperative cefazolin in PCNA patients undergoing primary TJA.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients (n = 49,842) undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (n = 25,659) or total knee arthroplasty (n = 24,183) from 2016 to 2022 who received perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients who had an rPCNA (n = 5,508) and received cefazolin (n = 4,938, 89.7%) were compared to rPCNA patients who did not receive cefazolin (n = 570, 10.3%), and to patients who did not have an rPCNA (n = 43,359). The primary outcome was the rate of allergic reactions within 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the rates of superficial infections, deep infections, and Clostridioides difficile infections within 90 days.

- **Results**: The rate of allergic reactions was 0.1% (n = 5) in rPCNA patients who received cefazolin, compared to 0.2% (n = 1) in rPCNA patients who did not receive cefazolin (P = 0.48), and 0.02% (n = 11) in patients who have no rPCNA (P = 0.02). Allergic reactions were mild in all 5 rPCNA patients who received cefazolin and were characterized by cutaneous symptoms (n = 4) or dyspnea in the absence of respiratory distress (n = 1) that resolved promptly with antibiotic discontinuation and administration of antihistamines.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^117RcH4t]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, the 2022 AAAAI guidelines specifically address the evaluation of penicillin allergy. It is recommended not to obtain any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy, such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea. Consider obtaining a one-step amoxicillin challenge in patients who are anxious or request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^111ZfDBJ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing using a cephalosporin with a different side chain. If the skin test is negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude allergy to the specific cephalosporin. This approach is advised if a cephalosporin is required in a patient with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests.

### An economic evaluation of direct oral penicillin challenge for de-labelling low risk patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115LUF9z]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the coverage rate and the cost per de-labelled patient. As more patients are approached for participation, the technical efficiency of direct penicillin challenge (DPC) increases, decreasing the cost per de-labelled participant. There is greater scope for economies of scale in Leeds compared to the other study sites. For instance, a 10% increase in coverage rate (from 46% to 51%) at Leeds would reduce the cost per de-labelled patient by 3.8% (from £695 to £669), whereas at Birmingham (69%–76%) it would do so by 2.1% (from £1332 to £1304) and at Oxford (from 78% to 86%) by 1.2% (from £722 to £714).

Figure 4 provides a visual representation of the cost per de-labelled patient as a function of the proportion of eligible patients approached at each study site. The placement of the red dot indicates the proportion of eligible patients approached per site in the SPACE study and the respective cost per de-labelled patient, estimated through probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

Small variations in costs resulted from exploring alternative staff skill mix scenarios or including the costs of training. However, when assuming zero opportunity costs of screening and day 5 follow-up, the pathway at Birmingham is 26% less costly at £1001 per de-labelled patient, and 16% and 39% less costly in Oxford (£607) and Leeds (£414), respectively.

### Is a reported penicillin allergy sufficient grounds to forgo the multidimensional antimicrobial benefits of β-lactam antibiotics [^116nTYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

The majority of patients with reported penicillin allergy are not allergic when tested or challenged. Penicillin allergy testing has been shown to significantly reduce annual healthcare expenditures. Data have emerged showing that β-lactams possess multidimensional antibacterial effects in vivo, far beyond what is appreciated in standard bacteriological susceptibility testing media. These effects include enhancing bacterial killing by the innate immune system. Supporting the clinical relevance of these underappreciated secondary effects are recent clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses that demonstrate worse outcomes in patients with reported penicillin allergies who receive non-β-lactam antibiotics compared to their non-penicillin-allergic counterparts. This is particularly relevant in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The article reviews the tremendous advantages offered by β-lactam therapy and makes a strong case that debunking false penicillin allergies through a detailed allergy history and penicillin allergy testing should be a vital component of antimicrobial stewardship practices.

### Nafcillin [^1125QnEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Nafcillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. The use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

The liver/biliary tract is the primary route of nafcillin clearance. Caution should be exercised when patients with concomitant hepatic insufficiency and renal dysfunction are treated with nafcillin. Serum levels should be measured and the dosage adjusted appropriately to avoid possible neurotoxic reactions associated with very high concentrations.

Prescribing nafcillin for injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including nafcillin for injection, USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold).

### Introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing improves the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy [^1173cYwQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing would increase the appropriateness of skin testing and reduce antibiotic costs for patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have infections caused by penicillin-susceptible pathogens. We measured the appropriateness of skin testing and daily antibiotic costs before and after the introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing. For patients who had negative results of skin testing and were subsequently treated with a penicillin instead of an alternative antibiotic, we calculated the difference between the actual costs and the projected costs of continuing alternative antibiotics without skin testing.

After the guideline was introduced, appropriateness of skin testing increased from 17% to 64%, but daily antibiotic costs did not change. For patients who had negative results of skin testing and who were subsequently treated with a penicillin, there was no difference between actual costs and the projected costs if they had not been skin tested. We conclude that introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing increases the percentage of eligible patients who have a skin test, and it does so without increasing costs.

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: Population based matched cohort study [^117LycsR]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Compared with patients who did not receive penicillins, patients receiving penicillins did not have an increased risk of MRSA (adjusted risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.20) but had an increased risk of C. difficile (1.18, 1.06 to 1.31; supplemental table 4). Patients receiving macrolide antibiotics had an increased risk of MRSA (1.72, 1.54 to 1.91) and C. difficile (1.30, 1.18 to 1.43). Patients receiving clindamycin had an increased risk of MRSA (2.97, 2.11 to 4.16) and C. difficile (2.76, 2.00 to 3.81). Patients receiving fluoroquinolones had an increased risk of MRSA (2.38, 2.12 to 2.67) and C. difficile (1.72, 1.54 to 1.93).

- **Mediation effects of alternative antibiotic use**: The effect of a penicillin allergy on the risk of MRSA was 55% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 55% mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 54% mediated through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 26% mediated through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone. The effect of penicillin allergy on C. difficile was 35% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 26% mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 20% mediated through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 16% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone.

### Enhancing antibiotic stewardship by tackling "spurious" penicillin allergy [^116ZpxGL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 90–99% of patients labeled with penicillin allergy (PenA) are not actually allergic when comprehensively investigated. An inaccurate label of PenA has major public health implications, including a longer hospital stay, more frequent hospital admissions, and greater use of fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, cephalosporins, and other expensive antibiotics. This results in significantly higher costs to the health service and predisposes to Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

We describe lessons learned from recent studies regarding possible reasons contributing to an inaccurate label of PenA, as well as propose a concerted multidisciplinary approach to address this important public health problem. Given the unmet need for allergy services in the UK and several other countries and knowledge gaps regarding PenA among healthcare professionals, we describe the potential role for a computerized clinical decision support system. This system would enable non-specialists to rapidly identify and de-label "low-risk" hospitalized patients with a label of PenA, thereby obviating the need for allergy tests. However, this approach needs rigorous evaluation for feasibility, safety, patient and physician acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and its compatibility with information technology systems currently employed in the health service.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113P9GHM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

On the subject of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the practice parameter suggests stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite the simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent to which this approach is incorporated into allergy practice remains unclear. Therefore, we surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real-case examples.

### Documented penicillin allergies on antibiotic selection at pediatric emergency department visits [^115XQx9g]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Penicillin or amoxicillin are the recommended treatments for the most common pediatric bacterial illnesses. Allergies to penicillin are commonly reported among children but are rarely true. We evaluated the impact of reported penicillin allergies on broad-spectrum antibiotic use overall, and for the treatment of common respiratory infections among treat-and-release pediatric emergency department (ED) visits.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients receiving antibiotics during a treat-and-release visit at a large pediatric ED in the northeast from 2014 to 2016. Study exposure was a reported allergy to penicillin in the electronic medical record. Study outcomes were the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics and alternative (second-line) antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. We used unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models to analyze the impact of reported penicillin allergies on the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to determine the probability of children with a documented penicillin allergy receiving alternative antibiotic treatments for AOM and GAS.

- **Results**: Among 12,987 pediatric patients, 810 (6.2%) had a documented penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergies increased the odds of children receiving a broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34–16.18).

### Penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic allergy label: Influence on length of stay and hospital readmission [^113WGV9o]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2024). High credibility.

The presence of a penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic allergy label can significantly impact patient outcomes in hospitals. This study evaluates how these allergy labels influence the length of hospital stay and rates of hospital readmission. Patients labeled with either of these antibiotic allergies often experience longer hospital stays due to the need for alternative therapies, which may not be as effective or could pose additional risks.

- **Impact on length of stay**: Patients with these allergy labels generally have extended hospitalization periods. This is attributed to the limited treatment options available, necessitating the use of second-line drugs that may have longer administration times or require additional monitoring.

- **Hospital readmission rates**: The study highlights an increased rate of readmission for patients with these allergy labels. The use of less effective alternative antibiotics can lead to suboptimal treatment of infections, increasing the likelihood of readmissions.

These findings underscore the importance of accurate allergy documentation and the potential need for reevaluating existing allergy labels to ensure they reflect true allergies and not mislabelings that could adversely affect patient care and hospital resources.

### Safety of direct drug provocation testing in adults with penicillin allergy and association with health and economic benefits [^1148HMe1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Nonprescription of penicillin-containing antibiotics in patients diagnosed with penicillin allergy is associated with morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions to penicillins comprise type A and B reactions. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of penicillin allergy evaluation without penicillin skin testing (PST) for adult patients with type B reactions, as well as the health and economic benefits of this process.

- **Methods**: Inpatients at an Australian tertiary hospital between April 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, with a diagnosis of type B penicillin allergy, requiring a penicillin-containing antibiotic for treatment, were included. All patients underwent clinical history review, PST, and drug provocation testing (DPT).

- **Results**: Seventy-one patients were enrolled. Sixty-three reported a history of type B or unknown adverse reactions. No patients had a history of anaphylaxis requiring intubation or epinephrine within the last 10 years or a history suggesting Gell and Coombs type 2, 3, or 4 (severe) hypersensitivity reaction. Seven did not complete DPT because the treating team used a β-lactam antibiotic other than amoxicillin. Fifty-four of the 56 remaining patients (96%) completed a 3-day DPT to amoxicillin with no adverse reaction. Two experienced mild cutaneous reactions. Penicillin allergy evaluation was significantly associated with reduced length of stay, reduced hospital expenditure on bed and second-line antibiotics, and reduced readmission rates.

- **Conclusion**: Penicillin allergy evaluation with DPT without PST may be feasible for all adult patients.

### An economic evaluation of direct oral penicillin challenge for de-labelling low risk patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115iTPKR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). High credibility.

After risk stratification, 'high‐risk' patients meeting the BSACI referral criteria received an outcome letter sent to their general practitioner (GP) recommending onward referral to an allergy specialist. Patients deemed 'low‐risk' were offered a direct penicillin challenge (DPC). This study offered two types of de-labelling.

- **Opportunistic de-labelling**: Involved administration of DPC at a time when the patient did not require antibiotics; i.e. intervention was offered primarily for de-labelling. A 500 mg amoxicillin oral tablet was given, followed by 250 mg amoxicillin twice daily for three days. There are no validated protocols regarding the dose and duration of DPC. The protocol for DPC employed in this study was based on consensus within the research team at the time of funding acquisition and was adapted from specialist clinical practice.

- **Therapeutic de-labelling**: Involved exclusion of type‐1 hypersensitivity with 500 mg of amoxicillin followed by a full therapeutic course of amoxicillin or a penicillin-containing antibiotic based on clinical indication for treatment of infection.

Those who underwent DPC were followed up to day 5 to assess for a delayed/nonimmediate hypersensitivity reaction. On day 5, for inpatients who were still on the ward, a direct clinical review was undertaken; no patient was kept in hospital because of the 5‐day review. Those discharged or who underwent DPC in an elective setting were contacted via telephone. Any emergent or severe adverse events were fully evaluated by the study team; if deemed unrelated to DPC, the patient was de-labelled. Otherwise, the penicillin allergy label (PAL) was retained.
