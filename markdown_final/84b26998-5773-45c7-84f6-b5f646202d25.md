## Question

Do these patients get an NG tube set to suction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether these patients get an NG tube set to suction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "these patients" refers to in the provided context. Then, I should verify the clinical scenarios where NG suction is indicated versus where it is not. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guideline positions for routine versus selective use. After that, I need to check special populations and exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with caveats and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the patient context. The documents repeatedly discuss postoperative patients, particularly after colorectal surgery, and emphasize that routine NG decompression should be avoided; they also address small-bowel obstruction, malignant bowel obstruction, and critically ill patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation, so "these patients" most plausibly refers to routine postoperative colorectal patients unless otherwise specified, with the other scenarios as exceptions where NG suction may be appropriate [^112X4Cp7] [^117X57Kk] [^111UJNoy] [^116YMe1A].

> Now, I should verify the core answer for routine postoperative colorectal patients. The 2023 ASCRS/SAGES guideline issues a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence to avoid routine NG tubes after colon and rectal surgery, noting delayed oral intake, more complications, and no benefit in nausea, vomiting, or length of stay; this aligns with the 2007 Cochrane review showing earlier return of bowel function and fewer pulmonary complications when NG tubes are not used routinely after abdominal surgery, so for "these patients", the answer is no, they do not get an NG tube set to suction by default [^112X4Cp7] [^1175aXRb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the exceptions where NG suction is appropriate. In small-bowel obstruction, nonoperative management hinges on nil per os and decompression with NG or long intestinal tube, typically for up to 72 hours if no signs of ischemia or peritonitis, so here NG suction is indicated for decompression rather than feeding [^111UJNoy] [^116Kvuu2]. In acute malignant bowel obstruction, MASCC recommends temporary NG decompression to relieve symptoms, again not for chronic use due to poor tolerability and complications, so NG suction is appropriate short term in this setting [^111xRM93] [^114fcsHq]. For critically ill adults at high aspiration risk undergoing rapid sequence intubation, SCCM advises NG decompression when benefits outweigh risks, which is a selective, pre-intubation decompression strategy rather than routine postoperative care [^116YMe1A] [^113txca2].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about tube type and suction strategy because I initially thought "single-lumen NG on low continuous suction" might be standard; that was imprecise. After esophagectomy, a randomized trial showed a sump-type NG on continuous suction reduced tracheal acid aspiration compared with a single-lumen tube with intermittent aspiration, supporting selective use of sump suction in that specific postoperative context, but this does not generalize to routine colorectal surgery where routine NG is discouraged [^115PDVqM]. I should also note that some ERAS pathways after esophagectomy still use NG suction briefly for conduit decompression, again a procedure-specific exception rather than a universal postoperative rule [^112TtsrH].

> Next, I should review the risks of routine NG suction to ensure I'm not underestimating harm. Routine NG decompression increases pharyngolaryngitis, delays feeding by about two days, and does not reduce nausea, vomiting, or length of stay after colorectal surgery; in children with perforated appendicitis, routine NG use delayed feeding without improving outcomes, reinforcing that NG suction can worsen recovery trajectories when used indiscriminately [^112X4Cp7] [^111u33AY]. Mechanistically, NG tubes may impair lower esophageal sphincter function and increase reflux risk in tube-fed patients, which is why selective rather than routine use is prudent [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address the practicalities if NG suction is used selectively. For decompression, a large-bore tube facilitates drainage; for feeding, a small-bore tube is preferred to reduce pharyngeal irritation and reflux risk, and placement must be verified before use, ideally by pH ≤ 5.5 in adults or chest radiograph when high risk, with attention to safety checks to avoid misplacement and complications [^111MwDZo] [^113nzYs7]. But wait, what if the stomach is full and the patient is about to be intubated? In that high-aspiration-risk scenario, pre-intubation NG decompression can be considered, recognizing it does not guarantee an empty stomach and RSI precautions remain mandatory [^116YMe1A].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principle to avoid overgeneralization. The modern standard is selective NG use: avoid routine postoperative NG decompression, reserve NG suction for specific indications such as small-bowel obstruction, acute malignant obstruction, or pre-intubation decompression, and prefer postpyloric feeding in high-aspiration-risk patients rather than relying on gastric suction to mitigate risk, consistent with ASPEN and AGA guidance [^114yBgtN] [^117JosMm]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with both guideline direction and the cited trials, and yes, the evidence base consistently supports selective rather than routine NG suction across these scenarios [^1175aXRb] [^111xRM93].

> Final answer: For routine postoperative colorectal patients, no, they do not get an NG tube set to suction; NG decompression should be avoided unless a specific indication arises such as refractory ileus, small-bowel obstruction, acute malignant bowel obstruction, or as a pre-intubation decompression maneuver in high-aspiration-risk patients, in which cases NG suction may be appropriate and beneficial when used selectively and monitored carefully [^112X4Cp7] [^111UJNoy] [^111xRM93] [^116YMe1A].

Not all patients need an NG tube on suction; use it only for **specific indications** such as gastric decompression for ileus or obstruction [^111UJNoy], preoperative aspiration risk reduction [^113txca2], or postoperative decompression after esophagectomy [^115PDVqM]. Routine NG suction is not recommended for most postoperative patients [^1175aXRb] because it increases discomfort and delays feeding without proven benefit [^112X4Cp7]. For feeding, use **small-bore NG tubes without suction** to minimize aspiration risk [^notfound] and confirm placement with pH testing or radiography before use [^111MwDZo] [^113nzYs7]. NG suction is contraindicated in patients with severe coagulopathy, esophageal varices, or recent esophageal surgery, and should be used cautiously in those with electrolyte imbalance or respiratory compromise [^116j6Gxp].

---

## Indications for NG tube suction

NG tube suction is indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Gastric decompression**: For patients with ileus, bowel obstruction [^111UJNoy], or severe gastric distension to prevent vomiting and aspiration [^116YMe1A].

- **Preoperative aspiration risk reduction**: In patients at high risk of aspiration, such as those with gastric outlet obstruction or delayed gastric emptying [^113txca2].

- **Postoperative decompression**: After esophagectomy or other upper gastrointestinal surgeries to prevent anastomotic disruption and reduce respiratory complications [^115PDVqM] [^112TtsrH].

- **Acute pancreatitis**: In severe cases with vomiting or ileus, NG suction may be used temporarily to decompress the stomach and reduce pancreatic stimulation [^115oB5Qi].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

NG tube suction should be avoided or used with caution in the following situations:

- **Severe coagulopathy**: Due to the risk of nasal or esophageal bleeding.

- **Esophageal varices**: Risk of variceal bleeding during insertion or suction.

- **Recent esophageal surgery**: Risk of anastomotic disruption or esophageal perforation.

- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Prolonged NG suction can cause electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis [^notfound].

- **Respiratory compromise**: NG tubes may worsen respiratory distress in patients with small nasal passages or severe respiratory conditions [^116j6Gxp].

---

## Risks and complications

NG tube suction carries several potential risks and complications, including:

- **Nasal trauma and discomfort**: Common with prolonged use or improper insertion technique [^111yQTeX].

- **Esophageal perforation**: Rare but serious complication, particularly in patients with underlying esophageal disease or recent surgery [^116YMe1A].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Prolonged suction can lead to hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis [^notfound].

- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Risk of aspiration if the NG tube is misplaced or if suction is not functioning properly [^117FhqF3].

- **Tube blockage or kinking**: Can lead to ineffective suction and require tube replacement [^115KMoBa].

---

## Alternative methods

In some cases, alternative methods may be preferred over NG tube suction:

- **Small-bore feeding tubes**: For patients requiring enteral nutrition, small-bore NG tubes without suction may be used to minimize aspiration risk [^notfound].

- **Post-pyloric feeding**: Nasojejunal or nasoduodenal tubes may be preferred in patients at high risk of aspiration or with delayed gastric emptying [^112mhuYR].

- **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)**: For long-term enteral feeding or decompression, PEG tubes may be preferred over NG tubes [^114F4Pt4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Several clinical guidelines provide recommendations on the use of NG tube suction:

- **Routine postoperative use**: NG tube suction should not be used routinely after abdominal surgery, as it does not improve outcomes and may delay feeding and increase patient discomfort [^1175aXRb] [^112X4Cp7].

- **Selective use**: NG tube suction should be reserved for specific indications, such as gastric decompression in ileus or obstruction, preoperative aspiration risk reduction, or postoperative decompression after specific surgeries [^113txca2] [^115PDVqM].

- **Confirmation of placement**: NG tube placement should always be confirmed using pH testing or radiography before initiating suction or feeding [^111MwDZo] [^113nzYs7].

## Indications and contraindications for NG tube suction

| **Indications** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|
| Gastric decompression (ileus, obstruction) | Severe coagulopathy |
| Preoperative aspiration risk reduction | Esophageal varices |
| Postoperative decompression (esophagectomy) | Recent esophageal surgery |
| Acute pancreatitis (severe cases) | Electrolyte imbalance |
| ∅ | Respiratory compromise |

---

NG tube suction is a valuable clinical tool for specific indications, such as **gastric decompression**, preoperative aspiration risk reduction, and postoperative decompression. However, it is not appropriate for all patients and carries **risks of complications**. Clinicians should carefully assess each patient's clinical situation and use NG tube suction selectively, following **established guidelines and best practices**.

Rechecking the position of the nasogastric tube after oropharyngeal suction is not common practice. Our patient deteriorated after oropharyngeal suction was performed, whilst nasogastric feeding continued. We suggest that nasogastric feeding should be stopped during oropharyngeal suction and the tube position should be checked every time an oropharyngeal suction is performed.

### Bronchiolitis: evidence-based management in high-risk infants in the intensive care setting [^113jmry7]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on bronchiolitis management and diagnosis in children were published in 2015 and serve as a cumulative management protocol developed from over 90 RCTs grouped based on treatment intervention. Using the findings of the RCTs, recommendations were made regarding the use of different management techniques. For example, regarding oxygen supplementation for babies and children with bronchiolitis, it is recommended that supplemental oxygen be administered to children aged 6 weeks and above, and to babies under 6 weeks of age or children of any age with underlying health conditions, if their measured oxygen saturations are persistently below 90% and 92%, respectively. However, the best method of oxygen delivery could not be determined. The recommendation of an oxygen saturation threshold of 90% in infants and children > 6 weeks, for the provision of supplemental oxygen and discharge from the hospital, was largely based on the results of an RCT which compared an oxygen saturation threshold of 90% to a threshold of 94%. This RCT was conducted in patients > 6 weeks of age with fewer comorbidities and less risk of poor outcomes compared to those children with bronchiolitis typically seen in a hospital setting. The NICE guideline notes that there was no evidence available on oxygen saturation targets for patients at higher risk of severe disease (patients aged < 6 weeks and children of any age with underlying health conditions). Therefore, the decision to recommend a 92% threshold for high-risk patients was not evidence-based, but instead was made on professional judgement. Additionally, it is recommended to give fluids via nasogastric or orogastric tube when oral hydration is inadequate and escalate to isotonic intravenous fluids in those with impending respiratory failure. It states that chest physiotherapy should not be performed, however, consideration should be given when the child presents with comorbidities that lead to difficulties clearing secretions. It was also found that there was no clear benefit for the routine use of antibiotics. The available evidence on the use of hypertonic saline was also assessed, but it was found to not offer any reduction in hospital stay when compared to no treatment and therefore was not recommended. It was advised that upper airway suctioning should not be routinely performed for bronchiolitis in children but can be considered to alleviate distress when feeding difficulties are present. Additionally, in those presenting with apnoea, it is stated that upper airway suctioning is always recommended. Finally, two management techniques, Heliox - the gas mixture of helium and oxygen and Montelukast, were found to have limited and contradictory evidence and therefore further research was recommended.

Care immediately after administering the trial supplements

We administered the trial medication as a single daily dose for convenience. Many infants with CGISC will have nasogastric tubes (NGTs) on free drainage or suction for gastric decompression. We clamped the NGT for at least 1 h and preferably 3–4 h to prevent the retrograde flow of the administered probiotics/placebo into the free-drain container.

### Determination of a practical pH cutoff level for reliable confirmation of nasogastric tube placement [^111MwDZo]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Enteral feeding is a common method of nutrition support when oral intake is inadequate. Confirmation of correct nasogastric (NG) tube placement is essential. Risks of morbidity/mortality associated with misplacement in the lung are well documented. Studies indicate that pH ≤ 4 confirms gastric aspirate, but in pediatrics, a pH of gastric aspirate is often > 4. The goal of this study was to determine a reliable and practical pH value to confirm NG tube placement, without increasing the risk of not identifying a misplaced NG tube.

Methods

Pediatric inpatients older than 4 weeks receiving enteral nutrition (nasogastric or gastrostomy) were recruited over 9 months. Aspirate samples were pH tested at NG tube placement and before feedings. If pH > 4, NG tube position was confirmed by chest radiograph or further investigations. In addition, intensive care unit (ICU) patients who required endotracheal suctioning were recruited, and endotracheal aspirate samples were pH tested.

Results

A total of 4,330 gastric aspirate samples (96% nasogastric) were collected from 645 patients with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 1.0 years (0.3–5.2 years). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) pH of these gastric samples was 3.6 (1.4) (range, 0–9). pH was > 4 in 1,339 (30.9%) gastric aspirate samples, and of these, 244 were radiographed, which identified 10 misplaced tubes (1 with pH 5.5). A total of 65 endotracheal aspirate samples were collected from 19 ICU patients with a median (IQR) age of 0.6 years (0.4–5.2 years). The mean (SD) pH of these samples was 8.4 (0.8) (range, 6–9.5).

Conclusion

Given that the lowest pH value of endotracheal aspirate sample was 6, and a misplaced NG tube was identified with pH 5.5, it is proposed that a gastric aspirate pH ≤ 5 is a safer, reliable, and practical cutoff in this population.

### Securing the nasogastric tube in head and neck cancer patients [^113EXnEz]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The nasogastric tube (NGT) remains an important method of enteral feeding in head and neck cancer patients and those who are critically ill. The NGT is normally secured to the skin with adhesive tapes. This method carries a high risk of accidental dislodgement, either by the patient or during nursing care. Replacement of the tubes is costly, time and effort intensive, uncomfortable to the patient, and potentially dangerous. We present a technique that is effective and safe. This entails securing the NGT to a fine bore suction catheter looped around the nasal septum.

Summary

* The NGT is an important method of enteral feeding in the short and intermediate term.* Various methods of securing the NGT have been described, but the risk of accidental extubation is high.* We describe a simple method of securing the NGT to a fine bore suction catheter looped around the nasal septum.* This method should be considered for patients in the critical care setting or head and neck cancer patients, in whom accidental extubation and repeated re-insertion of NGT may be hazardous.

### Methods for decreasing risk of aspiration pneumonia in critically ill patients [^111GEvEu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a significant clinical concern in critically ill hospitalized patients, leading to increase in the use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and the risk of mortality. Pneumonia caused by aspiration of gastric contents is of particular concern in patients who need mechanical ventilation and feeding through a nasogastric tube. Therefore, methods for decreasing the risk of aspiration are very important.

Methods

This review article summarizes factors that might influence the development of aspiration pneumonia, such as the position of the patient's body or type of hospital bed, methods of feeding, medications administered, suctioning of subglottic secretions, and bacterial decontamination.

Results

Elevating the head of the bed (45 degrees), continuous subglottic suctioning, and oral decontamination seem to be effective in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia.

Airway management after tracheal intubation and trouble shooting

Use an HME filter close to the patient, instead of a heated humidified circuit (wet circuit) but take care this does not become wet and blocked.
Monitor airway cuff pressure carefully to avoid airway leak. If using high airway pressures, ensure the tracheal tube cuff pressure is at least 5 cmH₂O above peak inspiratory pressure. Cuff pressure may need to be increased before any recruitment manoeuvres to ensure there is no cuff leak.
Monitor and record tracheal tube depth at every shift to minimise risk of displacement.
Managing risk of tracheal tube displacement. This is a risk during patient repositioning including: prone positioning; turning patients; nasogastric tube aspiration or positioning; tracheal suction; and oral toilet. Cuff pressure and tracheal tube depth should be checked and corrected both before and after these procedures. There is a risk of tracheal tube displacement during sedation holds and this should be considered when planning these (e.g. timing, nursing presence etc.).
Suction. Closed tracheal suction is mandatory wherever available.
Tracheal tube cuff leak. If a cuff leak develops to avoid aerosol‐generation pack the pharynx while administering 100% oxygen and setting up for re‐intubation. Immediately before re‐intubation, pause the ventilator.
Airway interventions. Physiotherapy and bagging, transfers, prone positioning, turning the patient, tube repositioning. If the intervention requires a disconnection of the ventilator from the tracheal tube before the airway intervention: a Ensure adequate sedation. b Consider administering neuromuscular blockade. c Pause the ventilator so that both ventilation and gas flows stop d Clamp the tracheal tube e Separate the circuit with the HME still attached to the patient f Reverse this procedure after reconnection
Avoid disconnections. push‐twist all connections to avoid risk of accidental disconnections.
Accidental disconnection. Pause the ventilator. Clamp the tracheal tube. Reconnect promptly and unclamp the tracheal tube.
Accidental extubation. This should be managed as usual, but management should be preceded by full careful donning of PPE before attending to the patient, irrespective of clinical urgency.
Tracheostomy. This is a high‐risk procedure due to aerosol‐generation, and this should be taken into account if it is considered. It may be prudent to delay tracheostomy until active COVID‐19 disease is resolved.

Question 3: How to achieve enteral access?

Decisions regarding enteral access are often determined by local expertise, anticipated duration of feeding, and evidence of gastroparesis or impaired gastrointestinal transit.

Short-term feeding may be facilitated by blind bedside placement of a nasogastric tube. Reliable aids to confirm location within the stomach include an abdominal radiograph, continuous CO₂ monitor, or differential esophageal/tracheal compliance to intermittent suction.

The decision to switch from gastric to postpyloric feeding is based on perceived intolerance or delayed gastric emptying. The placement of a postpyloric tube can be achieved endoscopic techniques, blind corkscrew technique, or GPS-guided or optically-guided tubes. Use of a magnet-directed or flanged Tiger tube should be avoided. Surgical or radiologic techniques require transport to the operating room or radiologic suite, respectively. Randomized trials show a switch to postpyloric feeding reduces pneumonia significantly, but arguably no other outcome benefits are incurred, thereby underlying controversial views. The decision to switch from nasoenteric to percutaneous access is predicated on an anticipated duration of feeding of greater than four weeks. A size of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube larger than 18–20 French should be avoided, as torsion on the side wall leading to enlarged stomal diameter is more likely. Surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube is preferred in the presence of ascites, excluded stomach following bariatric surgery, or altered postoperative anatomy. Radiologic placement of a gastrostomy tube utilizes a variant of the "Introducer" technique.

The decision to attain deep jejunal access, such as converting a PEG to a PEGJ, is based on evidence of delayed gastric emptying. A new PEG can be converted even at initial placement by shortening the length of the PEG and placing a second smaller jejunostomy tube (J-tube) through the PEG into the small bowel. A mature tract (> 7–10 days since initial placement) is required to place a one-piece PEGJ, which affords a larger lumen for both feeding and aspiration.

### "You wanna do what?! " modern indications for nasogastric intubation [^111S7jhs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Through the years, patients have asked their physicians why they needed nasogastric inbutation (NGI), a painful test. Some recent studies have also questioned the utility of NGI for several indications, enabling physicians to use judgment in offering it to patients. This article reviews the use of NGI for its traditional indications: gastrointestinal bleeding, presenting with or without hematemesis; gastric decompression; and the administration of treatment. It concludes with suggestions for limiting the pain of the procedure for patients who need it.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (nasogastric tube), BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to avoid using nasogastric tubes in severely ill pediatric patients and especially in infant patients with small nasal passages, as nasogastric tubes may compromise breathing. Use the smallest tube passed down the smallest nostril if use cannot be avoided.

### Clinical momentum in the care of older adults with advanced dementia: what evidence is there in the medical record? [^115B1h6E]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Patients with advanced dementia who received a permanent feeding tube spent more time in the hospital, had more events, and were more likely to have received a nasogastric tube despite having more goals of care conversations, palliative care consultations, and fewer baseline comorbid conditions. Our previously reported qualitative study showed behavioral components of clinical momentum, for example, recognition primed decision‐making and sunk costs, drive clinicians to prioritize a biomedical fix that initiates a care trajectory that is difficult to disrupt. In this light, these results suggest that prolonged exposure to a system designed to intervene on isolated problems can produce guideline‐discordant care. Momentum increases the longer patients stay in the system, leading to additional tests and interventions that are difficult to withdraw once they are in place. For example, clinicians place a temporary nasogastric tube to address a problem, like aspiration, leading to a permanent tube when reinforced by downstream forces, for example, nursing home rules require patients have a permanent tube. Less prognostic uncertainty, resulting from more comorbid conditions among control patients, may facilitate earlier recognition that usual patterns of care are inappropriate.

This study is limited by the small nondiverse sample and the EHR data source, making it difficult to ascertain dementia diagnosis and stage due to coding variations, and limiting our ability to understand context, unique situations, and patients' acute illness severity. Future efforts to measure clinical momentum at scale may reveal novel targets to improve end‐of‐life care.

Predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis — route of enteral tube feeding: In patients with predicted severe or necrotizing pancreatitis requiring enteral tube feeding, the AGA suggests either nasogastric or nasoenteral route (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence). Trials did not demonstrate a mortality benefit with either modality (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.44–2.30), and the panel recognizes that safety concerns regarding the risk of aspiration may preclude practitioners from using nasogastric tubes in patients with severe AP.

### Relationship between feeding tube site and respiratory outcomes [^112mhuYR]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear if placing feeding tubes postpylorically to prevent respiratory complications is worth the extra effort. This study sought to determine the extent to which aspiration and pneumonia are associated with feeding site (controlling for the effects of severity of illness, degree of head-of-bed elevation, level of sedation, and use of gastric suction).

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on a large data set gathered prospectively to evaluate aspiration in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. Feeding site was designated by attending physicians and confirmed by radiography. Each patient participated in the study for 3 consecutive days, with pneumonia assessed by the simplified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score on the fourth day. Tracheal secretions were assayed for pepsin in a research laboratory; the presence of pepsin served as a proxy for aspiration. A total of 428 patients were included in the regression analyses performed to address the research objectives.

Results

As compared with the stomach, the percentage of aspiration was 11.6% lower when feeding tubes were in the first portion of the duodenum, 13.2% lower when in the second/third portions of the duodenum, and 18.0% lower when in the fourth portion of the duodenum and beyond (all significant at P < .001). Pneumonia occurred less often when feedings were introduced at or beyond the second portion of the duodenum (P = 0.020).

Conclusions

The findings support feeding critically ill patients with numerous risk factors for aspiration in the mid-duodenum and beyond to reduce the risk of aspiration and associated pneumonia.

### Continuous suction isoperistaltic gastroesophagostomy for esophageal perforation [^117Uc9pe]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency with significant morbidity. Management of this condition is complex and constantly evolving. To our knowledge, this is the first case series describing repair of esophageal perforation with the use of an isoperistaltic gastroesophagostomy tube connected to continuous suction. We present three patients successfully managed using this technique.

### An evidence-based recommendation on bed head elevation for mechanically ventilated patients [^111wBoQt]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Data extraction, analysis and quality of evidence

The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data on the study population, interventions and outcomes were independently extracted and cross-checked by six reviewers. Only trial data related to the question posed in the review were considered.

For the dichotomous outcomes we calculated the overall relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) by means of Review Manager (Version 5; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK), using the standard random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird. When appropriate, meta-analyses were undertaken using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates and their 95% CIs. Subgroup meta-analyses were planned according to feeding via gastric tubes or not; continuous subglottic suctioning of oropharyngeal secretions via modified tubes or not; use of selective digestive tract decontamination or not; use of antacids or not; and presence of hiatal hernia or not. Baseline risks were defined as the risk for a certain outcome in the control arm of the individual trials - that is, the risk for a certain outcome without treatment (total number of patients with a certain outcome in the control group/total number of patients in the control group). Publication bias was examined by visual inspection of a funnel plot. The quality of the available evidence for each outcome was assessed by the GRADE method.

### Decreasing aspiration risk with enteral feeding [^11592Qaz]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Aspiration is a clinical concern in patients receiving enteral tube feeding. Aspiration can result in pneumonia leading to increases in the use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and the risk of mortality. Pneumonia caused by aspiration of gastric contents is of particular concern in patients who require mechanical ventilation and feeding by nasogastric tube. This article summarizes factors that might influence the development of aspiration pneumonia and minimize risk, such as the position of the patient's body, method of feeding, and size of the feeding tube.

### Risk factors for aspiration [^116etWoa]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

There are numerous risk factors for aspiration in tube-fed critically ill patients. However, there is confusion about the extent to which these factors actually contribute to aspiration. The purpose of this literature review was to summarize findings from selected research studies.

Methods

A nonexhaustive literature search was conducted to identify risk factors for aspiration in tube-fed, critically ill patients. The most commonly cited factors were decreased level of consciousness, supine position, presence of a nasogastric tube, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, bolus or intermittent feeding delivery methods, high-risk disease and injury conditions, and advanced age.

Results

Many studies of aspiration risk factors have relatively small sample sizes and used equivocal definitions of aspiration. Although some addressed aspiration as an outcome, others considered gastroesophageal reflux or pneumonia as outcomes. Despite these variations, authors almost uniformly agree that a decreased level of consciousness and a sustained supine position are major risk factors for aspiration. There is less agreement regarding the effect of a nasogastric tube (or its size) on aspiration and on the effect of various formula delivery methods.

Conclusions

A decreased level of consciousness is a major risk factor for aspiration, as is a sustained supine position. Although some authors favor using small-bore feeding tubes to prevent aspiration, there seems to be insufficient data to warrant this action. Although strong data are lacking regarding feeding delivery methods, there are more data to support continuous feedings than bolus/intermittent feedings in high-risk patients.

Nasogastric tube

Suggestion: Nasogastric tube may be used for temporary decompression in acute MBO (level of evidence: V; grade: D).

Temporary decompression via a wide bore nasogastric tube can evacuate a large amount of pooled gastric secretions, particularly during acute MBO episodes, and may improve symptoms. Based on clinical expertise and existing guidelines, it is not suggested for chronic MBO management because the nasogastric tubes are not well tolerated when placed for a prolonged time. Nasogastric tubes can become occluded or displaced, which may require flushing or replacement. Other potential complications include nasal cartilage erosion, otitis media, aspiration pneumonia, esophagitis, and bleeding.

Endoscopic or percutaneous gastrostomy tube

Suggestion: Endoscopic or percutaneous gastrostomy tube may be used for gastric decompression in MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade B evidence).

A more permanent decompression of gastric contents can be achieved through the placement of an endoscopic or percutaneous gastrostomy tube, also known as "venting gastrostomy". This review identified 29 studies that suggest gastrostomy insertion is generally feasible, with a high reduction in symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Major complications were rare, with most complications classified as minor wound infections or leakage of fluid around the tube. The presence of ascites is not an absolute contraindication to the insertion of percutaneous venting gastrostomy in patients with MBO; however, it is reasonable to suggest that ascitic drainage with paracentesis or placement of an intraperitoneal catheter is performed to reduce potential complications.

Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing

Suggestion: Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing may be used for gastric decompression in MBO (level of evidence: IV; grade: C).

The placement of percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG) may be used to decompress gastric contents. This review identified four studies with a limited number of patients with MBO that are not candidates for surgical decompression or percutaneous/endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. A Japanese randomized controlled trial assessed PTEG or nasogastric (NG) tube in 40 patients with inoperable MBO. The PTEG resulted in fewer symptoms and higher quality of life compared with NG tube. The primary endpoint was symptom palliation for two weeks (non-validated questionnaire), and showed lower symptom burden in those patients with PTEG. Secondary endpoints included quality of life measures (EQ-5D and SF-8 scores), which were significantly higher in the PTEG group. No differences in overall survival were detected between the two groups.

### Minimally invasive ivor lewis esophagectomy in 10 steps [^112TtsrH]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Postoperative Course

Our patients are managed according to a specific early recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Extubation takes place in the operating room. The nasogastric tube remains on suction for two days, and the patient is nil per os to help prevent distension of the gastric conduit and tension on the new anastomosis immediately after surgery. On postoperative day (POD) 2, tube feeds are started and slowly advanced per protocol. The nasogastric tube is removed by POD 3 to 4, unless output is abnormal or there is significant conduit distension on the radiograph. The chest tube is also removed on POD 3 to 4 unless a chyle leak is present. Diuresis starts on POD 3 and continues while clinically indicated, usually until discharge. A clear liquid diet is started on POD 5. Discharge typically takes place on POD 7. Diet is advanced in the outpatient setting, along with a wean from tube feeds. The jejunostomy is typically removed at the 3-week follow-up visit.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^111ss5vM]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

To start with urinary (UC) and nasogastric (NGT) catheters, a pilot study of enhanced recovery protocols in Cape Town showed early removal of UC and NGT was possible, with a 2.5‐day reduction in hospital LOS; however, the study only included patients not requiring ICU‐admission. In similar studies from India and Brazil with a small‐cohort randomized control trial, early removal of catheters and NGT were possible with shorter hospital stays; however, they also excluded ICU‐requiring patients and there is evidence that nurse‐led ICU urine catheter removal protocols are effective in earlier removal. For patients in ICU, the UC may be needed for either drainage (bladder repair) or for monitoring output, whereas the NGT may be retained in ventilated intubated patients to allow for early enteral feeding, often in combination with prokinetic agents and supplemental parenteral nutrition. Furthermore, for patients with discontinuous bowel, the NGT may be important for decompression. These patients have a higher ileus risk as well. Comments on these two aspects in the emergency laparotomy ERAS also apply to trauma.

Drainage for biliary or pancreatic leakage has been supported and also debated for many years. In the major trauma patient, the current opinion is guided mainly by retrospective single center studies and strong personal views; however, there is some moderate‐to‐low quality guidance available. Trauma pancreatectomy carries higher fistula risks compared with nontrauma pancreas resection. Nonoperative management of major pancreatic injury is associated with pseudocyst, so early resection and drainage are advocated (see Section 8). Late drain removal is associated with more complications, although this is usually in sicker patients. For pancreas injury, an optimally placed closed suction external drain is preferred and should remain in situ until the drainage contains less than 5000 IU/mL of amylase‐containing effluent. Other studies from the nontrauma pancreas surgery group suggest less than 30 mL/day, provided amylase is less than 300 IU/mL, are suggested as safe drain removal criteria. For biliary leaks, these typically occur toward the end of the first week and drains should be left until after that time and less than 50 mL for 2 days drains — this is discussed in detail in Section 7 of Paper 1. Drains do portend to higher complication rates but are also used in more severely injured patients. This is certainly true for combined pancreas and duodenal injury.

### Randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of nasogastric drainage on tracheal acid aspiration following oesophagectomy [^115PDVqM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to investigate tracheal acid aspiration after oesophagectomy and to determine whether it is influenced by nasogastric (NG) drainage.

Methods

Thirty-four patients undergoing oesophagectomy were randomized to one of three methods of NG drainage: a single-lumen tube with free drainage and 4-hourly aspiration, a sump-type tube on continuous suction drainage, or no NG tube. A tracheal pH probe was used to collect information on acid aspiration for 48 h after surgery. A pH < 5.5 was considered abnormal (normal pH 6.8–7.2). Total time with tracheal pH < 5.5, number of reflux episodes and longest reflux time were compared between groups.

Results

There was significant and persistent tracheal acid aspiration in all patients. Patients with a sump-type tube had a significantly shorter total time with tracheal pH < 5.5 than those in the other groups (sump-type tube versus single-lumen tube, P = 0.0069; sump-type tube versus no tube, P = 0.0071). Patients randomized to no NG tube experienced more respiratory complications after surgery than those who had either single-lumen or sump-type tubes (seven of 12 versus four of 22 patients; P = 0.023). Insertion of a NG tube was necessary in the first week after surgery in seven of 12 patients in this group.

Conclusion

Routine NG drainage after oesophagectomy is necessary. A sump-type NG tube is better at preventing tracheal acid aspiration and may reduce the incidence of respiratory complications.

### Does routine nasogastric tube placement after an operation for perforated appendicitis make a difference? [^111u33AY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Divergent opinions exist regarding the routine use of nasogastric (NG) tubes in the postoperative management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Empiric use of an NG tube after abdominal surgery is presumed to prevent abdominal distension, vomiting, and ileus, which may complicate the postoperative course. To investigate the validity of this assumption, we compared the postoperative course of patients who underwent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis who subsequently either had or did not have an NG tube placed postoperatively.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all children operated for perforated appendicitis between 1999 and 2004 was performed. Patients with prolonged hospitalizations were excluded to eliminate bias created by patients with multiple operations and opportunities for NG placement. The use of an NG tube, time to first and to full oral feeds, length of hospitalization, and complications were compared between groups.

Results

Patients with NG tubes left in place (N = 105) were compared with those who did not receive an NG tube (N = 54) following appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Mean time to first oral intake was 3.8 d in those with NG tubes compared with 2.2 d in those without NG tubes (P < 0.001). Similarly, mean time to full feeds was 4.9 d when an NG tube was left compared with 3.4 d in those without tubes (P < 0.001). Mean length of stay was 6.0 d in those with NG tubes compared to 5.6 d in those without (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of NG decompression after an operation for perforated appendicitis does not appear to improve the postoperative course and we recommend that it is not routinely used in this patient population.

### Management of patients with circumferential intramural esophageal dissection [^116tN7RM]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

A novel minimally invasive endoscopic drainage technique using a double-tube system improves the feasibility and safety of conservative treatment in spontaneous esophageal intramural dissection (EID). Two patients with spontaneous EID underwent double-tube system placement through esophagogastroduodenoscopy. One tube was inserted into the submucosal layer with continuous suction, and another nasoduodenal tube was simultaneously inserted for enteral nutritional support. Given the ease of placement and the success of this simple double-tube system method, this technique may provide a new, low-risk, and cost-effective treatment modality for patients with EID.

### Nasogastric versus nasojejunal tube feeding for severe acute pancreatitis [^112PySR7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutrition is an important aspect of management in severe acute pancreatitis. Enteral nutrition has advantages over parenteral nutrition and is the preferred method of feeding. Enteral feeding via nasojejunal tube is often recommended, but its benefits over nasogastric feeding are unclear. The placement of a nasogastric tube is technically simpler than the placement of a nasojejunal tube.

Objectives

To compare the mortality, morbidity, and nutritional status outcomes of people with severe acute pancreatitis fed via nasogastric tube versus nasojejunal tube.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 17 October 2019 without using any language restrictions. We also searched reference lists and conference proceedings for relevant studies and clinical trial registries for ongoing trials. We contacted authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing enteral feeding by nasogastric and nasojejunal tubes in participants with severe acute pancreatitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias of the included studies, and extracted data. This information was independently verified by the other review authors. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane to assess the risk of bias and perform data synthesis. We rated the certainty of evidence according to GRADE.

Main Results

We included five RCTs that randomised a total of 220 adult participants from India, Scotland, and the United States. Two of the trial reports were available only as abstracts. The trials differed in the criteria used to rate the severity of acute pancreatitis, and three trials excluded those who presented in severe shock. The duration of onset of symptoms before presentation in the trials ranged from within one week to four weeks. The trials also differed in the methods used to confirm the placement of the tubes and in what was considered to be nasojejunal placement. We assessed none of the trials as at high risk of bias, though reporting of methods in four trials was insufficient to judge the risk of bias for one or more of the domains assessed. There was no evdence of effect with nasogastric or nasojejunal placement on the primary outcome of mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 5 trials, 220 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Similarly, there was no evidence of effect on the secondary outcomes for which data were available. These included organ failure (3 trials, 145 participants), rate of infection (2 trials, 108 participants), success rate (3 trials, 159 participants), complications associated with the procedure (2 trials, 80 participants), need for surgical intervention (3 trials, 145 participants), requirement of parenteral nutrition (2 trials, 80 participants), complications associated with feeds (4 trials, 195 participants), and exacerbation of pain (4 trials, 195 participants). However, the certainty of the evidence for these secondary outcomes was also very low due to indirectness and imprecision. Three trials (117 participants) reported on length of hospital stay, but the data were not suitable for meta-analysis. None of the trials reported data suitable for meta-analysis for the other secondary outcomes of this review, which included days taken to achieve full nutrition requirement, duration of tube feeding, and duration of analgesic requirement after feeding tube placement.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is superiority, inferiority, or equivalence between the nasogastric and nasojejunal mode of enteral tube feeding in people with severe acute pancreatitis.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^112Ptw9E]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

### Prophylactic nasogastric decompression after abdominal surgery [^1175aXRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of nasogastric tubes after abdominal operations is intended to hasten the return of bowel function, prevent pulmonary complications, diminish the risk of anastomotic leakage, increase patient comfort and shorten hospital stay.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy of routine nasogastric decompression after abdominal surgery in achieving each of the above goals.

Search Strategy

Search terms were nasogastric, tubes, randomised, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), and references of included studies, from 1966 through 2006.

Selection Criteria

Patients having abdominal operations of any type, emergency or elective, who were randomised prior tot he completion of the operation to receive a nasogastric tube and keep it in place until intestinal function had returned, versus those receiving either no tube or early tube removal, in surgery, in recovery or within 24 hours of surgery. Excluded will be randomised studies involving laparoscopic abdominal surgery and patient groups having gastric decompression through gastrostomy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted onto a form that assessed study eligibility, as defined above, quality related to randomizations, allocation concealment, study size and dropouts, interventions, including timing and duration of intubation, outcomes that included time to flatus, pulmonary complications, wound infection, anastomotic leak, length of stay, death, nausea, vomiting, tube reinsertion, subsequent ventral hernia.

Main Results

33 studies fulfilled eligibility criteria, encompassing 5240 patients, 2628 randomised to routine tube use, and 2612 randomised to selective or No Tube use. Patients not having routine tube use had an earlier return of bowel function (p < 0.00001), a decrease in pulmonary complications (p = 0.01) and an insignificant trend toward increase in risk of wound infection (p = 0.22) and ventral hernia (0.09). Anastomotic leak was no different between groups (p = 0.70). Vomiting seemed to favour routine tube use, but with increased patient discomfort. Length of stay was shorter when no tube was used but the heterogeneity encountered in these analyses make rigorous conclusion difficult to draw for this outcome. No adverse events specifically related to tube insertion (direct tube trauma) were reported. Other outcomes were reported with insufficient frequency to be informative.

Authors' Conclusions

Routine nasogastric decompression does not accomplish any of its intended goals and so should be abandoned in favour of selective use of the nasogastric tube.

### Improving the documentation of nasogastric tube insertion and adherence to local enteral nutrition guidelines [^116HnNFY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) has issued guidance to NHS organisations in England and Wales, relating to adults, children and infants, entitled "Reducing the harm caused by misplaced nasogastric feeding tubes". This was followed in 2011 by an update in response to further clinical incidents. In 2005, the NPSA stated that 11 deaths and one case of serious harm due to misplaced nasogastric (NG) tubes had occurred over a two-year period. The 2011 NPSA update revealed that the NPSA's National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) had received reports of a further 21 deaths and 79 cases of harm since September 2005. Noble's Hospital is the main hospital on the Isle of Man, a crown dependency distinct from the UK; it has local guidelines based on the above NPSA guidelines.

The NPSA 2005 guidelines state that for standard NG tube insertions in adult patients, the first-line method of checking the placement of NG tubes should be by obtaining an aspirate of between pH 1 and 5.5. This reliably shows the NG tube to be in the stomach, rather than the lung. If this is unsuccessful, the second-line method of checking placement is to perform a chest x ray. Additional methods such as "the whoosh test" and the colour of aspirate and litmus paper should be avoided.

For high risk NG tube insertions, such as unconscious patients in ITU or for patients with swallowing difficulties or absent gag reflex, these should be confirmed by chest x ray in the first instance, though this decision depends on clinical judgement. The NPSA 2011 update reinforced the above guidelines, while also setting out a specific set of steps each time an NG tube is inserted, to ensure the following were considered:

### Routine use of nasogastric tubes does not reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1179g7b3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Routine use of a nasogastric (NG) tube has been suggested to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) despite conflicting data. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that routine use of a NG tube does not reduce PONV. Our work is based on data from a large trial of 4055 patients initially designed to quantify the effectiveness of combinations of antiemetic treatments for the prevention of PONV. This analysis uses propensity scores for case matching to ensure group comparability on baseline factors. Intraoperative NG tube use patients and perioperative NG tube use patients were respectively matched to nonuse patients on all available potential confounders. Matched-pairs were identified using propensity scores for 1032 patients with or without intraoperative NG tube use and 176 patients with or without perioperative NG tube use. The incidences of PONV in the intraoperative group were 44.4% vs 41.5% (P = 0.35) with and without tube use, respectively, and 27.8% vs 31.3% (P = 0.61) in the perioperative group. Our results provide evidence that routine use of a NG tube does not reduce the incidence of PONV.

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

Drug Interactions

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^116Kvuu2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy

The role of colonoscopy is limited to the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction. The goal is to exclude other causes for obstruction. Biopsy should be performed in cases of suspected malignancy when emergency surgery has not been indicated or endoscopic stent placement can be expected. In this case, carbon dioxide insufflation may be an acceptable alternative to conventional air insufflation to avoid prolonged abdominal bloating, excessive abdominal pain, and discomfort during colonoscopy. Besides, CO₂ is absorbed from the colon 150 times faster than nitrogen and reduces the risk of the bowel ischemia resulting in reduced spasm and pain.

Therapy

Conservative (non-surgical) therapy

Conservative treatment is the cornerstone of non-operative management in all patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction unless there are signs of intestinal ischemia/perforation. Evidence for the ideal duration of non-operative is lacking, but most authors consider a 72-h cutoff safe and appropriate. The mainstay of non-operative management is nil per os and decompression with naso-gastric suction or long intestinal tube. There has been some discussion in the literature about the use in adhesive small bowel obstruction of long intestinal tubes: long trilumen naso-intestinal tubes are more effective than naso-gastric tubes, but they require endoscopic insertion.

Water-soluble contrast administration is a valid and safe treatment that correlates with a significant reduction in the need for surgery in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction with also a significant reduction in the time to resolution and length of stay. The administration of water-soluble contrast is a secure treatment with no significant differences in complications or mortality. Adhesive small bowel obstruction recurrence is possible after non-operative management: 12% of non-operatively treated patients are readmitted within 1 year, and this value increases to 20% after 5 years.

### Reliability of gastric suctioning compared with ultrasound assessment of residual gastric volume: a prospective multicentre cohort study [^117SjTfx]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

We aimed to compare the reliability of aspiration via a nasogastric tube with ultrasound for assessment of residual gastric volume. Sixty-one adult patients who were mechanically ventilated and received continuous enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube for > 48 h were included. A first qualitative and quantitative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum was followed by gastric suctioning, performed by an operator blinded to the result of the ultrasound examination. A second ultrasound examination was performed thereafter, followed by re-injection of the aspirated gastric contents (≤ 250 ml) into the stomach. A third ultrasound assessment was then immediately performed. If the suctioned volume was ≥ 250 ml, 250 mg erythromycin was infused over 30 min. A fourth ultrasound was performed 90 min after the third. Sixty (98%) patients had a qualitatively assessed full stomach at first ultrasound examination vs. 52 (85%) after gastric suctioning (p = 0.016). The calculated gastric volume significantly decreased after gastric suctioning, without a significant decrease in the number of patients with volume ≥ 250 ml. Four of the nine patients with calculated gastric volume ≥ 250 mL had vomiting within the last 24 h (p = 0.013). The antral cross-sectional area significantly decreased between the third and the fourth ultrasound examination (p = 0.015). Erythromycin infusion did not make a significant difference to gastric volume (n = 10). Our results demonstrate that gastric suctioning is not a reliable tool for monitoring residual gastric volume. Gastric ultrasound is a feasible and promising tool for gastric volume monitoring in clinical practice.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^116YMe1A]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nasogastric tube decompression — critically ill adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) with aspiration risk: We advise nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression when the benefit outweighs the risk in patients who are undergoing RSI and are at high risk of regurgitation of gastric contents. When the stomach is decompressed with an NGT, the intragastric pressure and the gastric content volume may be decreased, hence, lowering the likelihood and severity of emesis and pulmonary aspiration during RSI, and in patients with a full stomach or gastric distention, a clinical assessment, in addition to point-of-care ultrasound, can help to determine the need for and effectiveness of NGT. The literature suggests an increased risk of regurgitation when point-of-care ultrasound demonstrates the presence of solid gastric contents, an estimated total gastric fluid volume greater than 1.5 mL/kg (with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position), or the presence of clear fluids (with the patient in both supine and lateral decubitus positions). Complications of NGT insertion, including nasal bleeding, gagging and vomiting, esophageal perforation, and tracheal placement can occur and should be factored into the decision-making process. In patients at high risk of regurgitation during RSI, and when risks are not prohibitive, insertion of an NGT and decompression of the stomach before RSI should be considered. Because the use of an NGT does not guarantee removal of all gastric contents, RSI should proceed with the assumption that the stomach will not be completely empty, and resources required for gastric decompression are readily available in most critical care settings, and the costs are negligible and should not affect implementation; further evaluation is warranted, including in select subgroups of critically ill patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^117X57Kk]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery — nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains: The routine use of intra-abdominal drains and nasogastric tubes for colorectal surgery should be avoided. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Nasogastric tubes should not be routinely used and should be reserved for patients with postoperative ileus refractory to more conservative management; RCTs show that patients without nasogastric tubes have no difference in nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function, or increased length of stay versus those with tubes and tolerate oral intake 2 days earlier, while tube use is associated with a significantly higher risk of complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis. For intra-abdominal drains, there are no data to support routine use to identify and prophylactically treat anastomotic leaks; available RCTs show no significant difference in mortality, leak, or composite postoperative complications with drainage, and meta-analyses show no added benefit in benign or malignant disease. The location of the anastomosis in relation to the peritoneal reflection does not appear to impact the use of drainage.

Enteral nutrition during high-flow ventilation — aspiration risk and tolerance management: Consider carefully the indication for EN in the patient receiving high-flow modes of ventilation, especially if that patient is concomitantly receiving any sedation, because high-flow ventilators and bag-valve-mask ventilations increase likelihood of aspiration. Meeting EN volume targets in patients with gastrostomy tubes who are receiving respiratory therapies, especially high-pressure settings, is challenging; patients who are receiving high-pressure respiratory support via noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may experience gastric insufflation, and venting the gastric tube may relieve this condition and increase feeding tolerance toward goals.

### Management of acute pancreatitis: current knowledge and future perspectives [^1157Wmck]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

As in other diseases, the pathophysiological aspects of acute pancreatitis should guide our therapeutic approach. On the other hand, we should also consider that the treatment needs to be tailored to each individual patient and we should also take into account the available resources of each Institution.

Since 1994, many papers have been published suggesting good medical therapy for patients with acute pancreatitis, but unfortunately there is no congruence in the various guidelines regarding stratification of severity, diagnosis, treatment and presence of Pancreas Units. In the same way, there are no homogeneous evidence levels in the various guidelines. These differences are quite surprising because most of the participants are the same experts who decide on the various guidelines. In addition, as suggested by Bradley, there is the need to unify the various guidelines. In brief, there is the need to address the efforts of the guideline writers in order to unify the various guidelines. One example of the rapid evolution of the knowledge of acute pancreatitis is the following: the UK guidelines were released in 1998, revised in 2005 and, after just a few weeks, some researchers asked to change the new 2005 UK guidelines. Another problem with the guidelines is that many clinical practitioners in the same country follow different guidelines and others do not fully apply them in clinical practice; moreover, in most of the guidelines, the basic management of acute pancreatitis is not reported: some examples are control of pain and control of nausea, vomiting and ileus. First of all, there are no extensive studies on the pharmacological control of pain in acute pancreatitis; this is quite surprising due to the importance of this symptom. Second, there are many therapeutic procedures performed on patients who are not included in the practical guidelines: for example, continued gastric suction is often used in treating patients with acute pancreatitis, even if most of the published studies limit this approach only to patients with severe disease. Finally, gastric acid secretion inhibition is largely used in patients with acute pancreatitis, even if there are very few studies on this issue and the results are not conclusive. The reason for these discrepancies is that there is poor homogeneity in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.

### AARC clinical practice guidelines: artificial airway suctioning [^115rtQ1c]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

Artificial airway suctioning — suction catheter size and applied vacuum pressure: Research that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of various catheter sizes and applied vacuum pressures is scarce, and the optimal suction catheter outer diameter size to artificial airway inner diameter size ratio is not known at this time; the optimal applied vacuum pressure that is both safe and effective at clearing secretions is also not known. The 2010 AARC CPG recommended that suction catheters should occlude < 50% of the endotracheal tube (ETT) lumen in pediatric and adult patients, and < 70% in neonates, and no new evidence convincingly refutes this recommendation (evidence level C, all the committee members rated the appropriateness score at 7). There was no formal recommendation on applied vacuum pressure in the previous guideline; current minimal evidence states suction pressures should be kept below −200 mm Hg in adults and between −80 and −100 mm Hg in neonates (evidence level C, all the committee members rated the appropriateness score at 7), and efforts to set the suction pressure as low as possible to effectively clear secretions should be made (evidence level C, all the committee members rated the appropriateness score at 7).

### Evaluation of the revised laryngeal tube suction: the laryngeal tube suction II in 100 patients [^115pdvKn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We prospectively assessed the performance of the laryngeal tube suction mark II (LTS II).

Methods

LTS II was assessed during controlled and spontaneous ventilation during total i.v. anaesthesia. Ventilation adequacy, functional and anatomical positioning and airway seal were evaluated.

Results

One hundred healthy patients (30F:70M) aged 18–85-yr-old were studied. Insertion of the LTS II was successful in 71 at first attempt, in 24 at second attempt and in five at third/fourth attempt. Median insertion time was 15 s (range 5–120 s). Temporary obstruction occurred in six patients. A median of one manipulation per patient was required to establish an airway (range 0–5). During maintenance, temporary airway obstruction occurred in eight patients. Use of the device was abandoned once during insertion, once during maintenance and once because of complications unrelated to the study. The airway was clear in 89 of 97 patients during maintenance and partially obstructed in eight. Median seal pressure was 29.5 (range 15–85) cm H₂O. A gastric tube was passed via the posterior channel in 97 of 99 patients. The glottis was visible using a fibrescope passed via the device in 51% of patients. Via the drain tube the upper oesophagus was visible in 22% and this was open in 50%. Blood was visible on the device after removal in 12 patients. After the operation 14 patients reported mild sore throat.

Discussion

The LTS II appears to be an improvement on its predecessor and merits further investigation comparing it with its competitors during use for anaesthesia and emergency airway management.

### The aerator: novel innovation of a gastrostomy / jejunostomy tube for tackling persistent peristomal leak [^116gZfX1]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We describe the modification of a gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube at the initial site to prevent and treat persistent peristomal leakage. The materials required are readily accessible in endoscopy suites, and the device assembly is straightforward. The combination of using a gastrostomy tube with a small-caliber suction tube for the drainage of extravasated contents and providing aeration to the wound promotes wound healing and thereby halts the continuous cycle of leakage and inflammation. This approach is suitable for patients in whom conservative management of peristomal leakage has failed, and its use could avoid unnecessary PEG-tube replacement.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^111UJNoy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Non-operative management

The cornerstone of non-operative management is nil per os and decompression using a naso-gastric tube or long intestinal tube. Non-operative management is effective in approximately 70–90% of patients with ASBO. There has been some debate in the literature over the use of long intestinal tubes or naso-gastric tubes. In an older trial, no significant difference in failure rates was found between naso-gastric tubes and long intestinal tubes. In a more recent trial, 186 patients were randomized between a newly designed trilumen long tube and a naso-gastric tube. Long tubes seemed more effective in this trial with a failure rate of 10.4% in this group compared with 53.3% in the naso-gastric tube group. Results from this trial should be interpreted with care, because the failure rate of naso-gastric tube compression is much higher than would be expected from other literature. Moreover, a drawback of trilumen tubes is the need for endoscopic placement. Non-operative management should further include fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte disturbances, nutritional support, and prevention of aspiration.

Duration of the period in which non-operative management can be tried is subject to debate. Several retrospective series and databases have shown that delays in surgery increase morbidity and mortality. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative treatment is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Continuing non-operative treatment for more than 72 h in cases with persistent high output from a decompression tube, but no other signs of clinical deterioration, however, remains subject to debate. Common medical complications in patients with small bowel obstruction are dehydration with kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, malnutrition, and aspiration.

Non-operative management: summary

The panel recommends a trial of non-operative management in all patients with ASBO, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Further recommendations are found in Table 5.

### Bubble continuous positive airway pressure for children with high-risk conditions and severe pneumonia in Malawi: an open label, randomised, controlled trial [^1168FpNW]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Fourth, we used a validated bCPAP device whose components are deemed single use by the manufacturer. Because of budgetary constraints and supply chain issues in Malawi and other LMICs, respiratory supplies are in our experience almost always disinfected and reused during routine care, and we took this approach. Single use supplies are usually unsustainable during programmatic conditions. Since most bCPAP mortality occurred within 3 days and the odds of bCPAP mortality, relative to oxygen mortality, did not change by study year, equipment contamination was unlikely to be a mortality driver in this trial.

There are other possible explanations for our findings. Infants and children with respiratory danger signs might be at an increased risk of swallowing impairment and aspiration. Evidence regarding whether nasal CPAP increases aspiration risk is scarce. Nevertheless, to reduce aspiration risk, high-resource setting CPAP recipients are often fed continuously through nasogastric or post-pyloric tubing, a practice rare in LMICs. Before this trial, Malawian children with respiratory danger signs were fed orally; only comatose children were bolus fed through nasogastric tubing. Additionally, in our clinical experience in Malawi, errors related to the volume or type of intravenous fluid administered are common and can have serious health consequences. Given these safety concerns and that enteral feeds is standard of care in most settings for children on CPAP, we opted to administer maintenance hydration and enteral feeds to children using nasogastric tubes when respiratory distress was substantial. Although study staff were trained to use nasogastric tubes, the proportion of eligible children with a tube placed was low and bCPAP recipients, compared with oxygen recipients, were even less likely to have a tube inserted. An analysis of outcomes for patients with or without a nasogastic tube is given in the appendix (p 18). Unfortunately, our routine supervisory visits did not appreciate the degree to which nasogastric tubes were not used by providers or refused by parents. Notably, these data are unable to establish whether tube insertion was low because of inaccurate documentation, parental refusal, or health-care provider reluctance (possibly owing to difficulty inserting the tube when the CPAP nasal interface was in place), nor is it clear whether the tube was used once inserted. Although speculative, these trial data might suggest that more unrecognised aspiration-related events occurred and could have differentially contributed to bCPAP mortality. Although we did not observe frequent issues with gastric distension and vomiting, it is also possible that the combination of higher initiating CPAP pressures, enteral feeding, and low proportion of nasogastric tube use among bCPAP recipients predisposed patients to unrecognised aspiration events. Our findings might not be applicable to settings that have more widely adopted the use of nasogastric tubes.

### North American summit on aspiration in the critically ill patient: consensus statement [^117FhqF3]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Aspiration is the leading cause of pneumonia in the intensive care unit and the most serious complication of enteral tube feeding (ETF). Although aspiration is common, the clinical consequences are variable because of differences in nature of the aspirated material and individual host responses. A number of defense mechanisms normally present in the upper aerodigestive system that protect against aspiration become compromised by clinical events that occur frequently in the critical care setting, subjecting the patient to increased risk. The true incidence of aspiration has been difficult to determine in the past because of vague definitions, poor assessment monitors, and varying levels of clinical recognition. Standardization of terminology is an important step in helping to define the problem, design appropriate research studies, and develop strategies to reduce risk. Traditional clinical monitors of glucose oxidase strips and blue food coloring (BFC) should no longer be used. A modified approach to use of gastric residual volumes and identification of clinical factors that predispose to aspiration allow for risk stratification and an algorhythm approach to the management of the critically ill patient on ETF. Although the patient with confirmed aspiration should be monitored for clinical consequences and receive supportive pulmonary care, ETF may be continued when accompanied by appropriate steps to reduce risk of further aspiration. Management strategies for treating aspiration pneumonia are based on degree of diagnostic certainty, time of onset, and host factors.

Colorectal surgery — nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains: The routine use of nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains for colorectal surgery should be avoided (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Small randomized trials show no benefit of routine nasogastric tube decompression on nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function, or LOS, and routine nasogastric decompression delays tolerance of oral intake by an average of 2 days with higher risk of complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis. For drains, randomized trials show no significant differences in mortality, leak, or composite postoperative complications with drains, and a US Rectal Cancer Consortium review found higher leak rates with drains with no difference in intervention for leak; however, a Dutch TME analysis suggested that intra-abdominal drains with a diverting stoma may be associated with lower rates of surgical intervention in anastomotic failure.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^114yBgtN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — gastric versus post-pyloric feeding and aspiration risk: Conversion to a post-pyloric feeding tube should be carried out only when gastric feeding has been shown to be poorly tolerated or the patient is at high risk for aspiration (strong recommendation, moderate-to-high level of evidence). Simultaneous aspiration/decompression may be accomplished using a dual lumen aspirated nasoenteric tube, a combined percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (GJ) tube, or both gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). The incidence of reflux, regurgitation, and aspiration all decrease significantly as infusion is diverted from the stomach to the proximal jejunum, and a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs showed a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia with small bowel compared with gastric feeding while duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and mortality did not change. Although gastrointestinal dysfunction occurs in 30–70% of ICU patients, most will tolerate gastric feeding, and small bowel placement may delay initiation because it requires greater expertise.

### Retrograde jejunogastric decompression after esophagectomy is superior to nasogastric drainage [^112SYaNq]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Nasogastric tubes (NG) are commonly used for maintaining conduit decompression after esophagectomy. We investigated the use of retrograde tube gastrostomy (RG) after esophagectomy.

Methods

Patients underwent either NG or RG placement for postoperative conduit decompression. Both tubes were maintained on low continuous suction.

Results

Between 2000 and 2008, 306 patients underwent esophagectomy with reconstruction. One hundred ninety-three patients underwent NG and 113 underwent RG placement. The 2 groups were comparable in age, gender, tumor stage, and smoking status. Patients in the NG group were more likely to have received neoadjuvant therapy and to have a thoracotomy for esophagectomy. The incidence of respiratory complications was lower in the retrograde group compared with the NG group: Pneumonia, 9 of 113(8.0%) vs 50 of 193 (25.9%), p < 0.001; respiratory failure requiring bronchoscopy or reintubation, 12 of 113 (10.8%) vs 46 of 193 (23.8%), p = 0.004; aspiration, 4 of 113 (3.5%) vs 20 of 193 (10.4%), p = 0.045. The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was also lower in the retrograde group (18 of 113 [15.9%] vs 69 of 193 [35.8%], p < 0.001). The incidence of wound complications, myocardial infarction, stroke, and conduit necrosis-anastomotic leak was similar between groups. In a multivariate regression model an NG tube was the strongest predictor for postoperative pneumonia (odds ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 7.12). The other predictors were prior chest surgery, smoking, and thoracotomy incision. There were 4 minor complications related to the retrograde tube (wound infection n = 1, broken tube requiring endoscopy n = 2, tube caught in anastomosis detected intraoperatively n = 1).

Conclusions

Retrograde gastrostomy decompression of the conduit after esophagectomy is effective and diminishes complications compared with NG tube drainage.

### Ondansetron [^113Q5r9W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction. The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension.

Information for Patients

Phenylketonurics:

Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 4 mg and 8 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 1.5 mg and 3 mg of phenylalanine, respectively.

Patients should be instructed not to remove ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets from the blister until just prior to dosing. The tablet should not be pushed through the foil. With dry hands, the blister backing should be peeled completely off the blister. The tablet should be gently removed and immediately placed on the tongue to dissolve and be swallowed with the saliva. Peelable illustrated stickers are affixed to the product carton that can be provided with the prescription to ensure proper use and handling of the product.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^117WLGeg]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Enteral feeding indications in specific non-gastrointestinal diseases — recommendations are as follows: Evaluate all patients who have had a stroke for dysphagia as early as possible to establish route of nutrition support. Initiate enteral nutrition (EN) using a nasogastric tube (NGT) in a patient who has had a stroke, for whom oral intake has been deemed unsafe, and who is not likely to recover within 7 days, and evaluate the patient for a nasal tube retaining system to reduce the risk of tube displacement. Consider placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in patients with persistent inability to swallow safely for > 2–4 weeks. Initiate EN support in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and malnutrition who are unable to meet their nutrition needs with diet and oral supplements alone. Initiate EN in malnourished patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are unable to meet nutrition needs with diet and oral supplements alone, including patients who are not on dialysis and patients on either intermittent hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116QNZXx]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Stroke — enteral nutrition (EN) decisions after acute stroke indicate that if the gut is functional and there are no other contraindications, EN is preferred; dysphagia is common after a stroke, occurring in about 25%–50% of all patients, and pneumonia in hospitalized acute stroke patients is reported at 5.6%, increasing hospital cost per patient by $15,000. About 10%–30% of all patients are tube fed in the early phase of stroke. Guidelines recommend considering EN using an nasogastric tube (NGT) if oral intake is not likely to be recovered within 7 days, and stroke guidelines recommend time-limited trials of NGT feeding, typically 2–4 weeks, prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. Practice data show variation: a retrospective observational study of 34,623 patients with acute ischemia and stroke found more than half (53%) received PEG within 7 days of admission, with age the greatest determinant of early PEG tube placement (≥ 85 vs 18–54 years); another study reported later placement of PEG tubes (median 17 days from admission to tube placement) associated with a lower 30-day mortality but higher severe disability at discharge. A Cochrane review analyzing 33 RCTs (n = 6779) stated limited data are available of the effects of nutrition, and suggest that PEG and NGT feedings do not differ in terms of case fatality, death, or dependency, while PEG is associated with fewer treatment failures, less GI bleeding, and greater nutrition delivery. For tube security, patients should be considered for a naso tube retaining system or nasal bridle when they are at risk of inadvertent NGT removal or require frequent tube replacement.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113r4Evy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1), OVERDOSAGE (10)].

5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction. Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116nHuvB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

### Routine oro / nasopharyngeal suction versus no suction at birth [^113TQwZF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oro/nasopharyngeal suction is a method used to clear secretions from the oropharynx and nasopharynx through the application of negative pressure via a suction catheter or bulb syringe. Traditionally, airway oro/nasopharyngeal suction at birth has been used routinely to remove fluid rapidly from the oropharynx and nasopharynx in vigorous and non-vigorous infants at birth. Concerns relating to the reported adverse effects of oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning led to a practice review and routine oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning is no longer recommended for vigorous infants. However, it is important to know whether there is any clear benefit or harm for infants whose oro/nasopharyngeal airway is suctioned compared to infants who are not suctioned.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction compared to no suction on mortality and morbidity in newly born infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to April 18, 2016), Embase (1980 to April 18, 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to April 18, 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised trials that evaluated the effect of routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction compared to no suction on mortality and morbidity in newly born infants with and without meconium-stained amniotic fluid.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors extracted from the reports of the clinical trials, data regarding clinical outcomes including mortality, need for resuscitation, admission to neonatal intensive care, five minute Apgar score, episodes of apnoea and length of hospital stay.

Main Results

Eight randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and only included term infants (n = 4011). Five studies included infants with no fetal distress and clear amniotic fluid, one large study included vigorous infants with clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and two large studies included infants with thin or thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Overall, there was no statistical difference between oro/nasopharyngeal suction and no oro/nasopharyngeal suction for all reported outcomes: mortality (typical RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.94 to 5.53; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.01; I² = 0%, studies = 2, participants = 3023), need for resuscitation (typical RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; I² = 0%, studies = 5, participants = 3791), admission to NICU (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.01; I² = 27%, studies = 2, participants = 997) and Apgar scores at five minutes (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; I 2 not estimated, studies = 3, participants = 330).

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence does not support or refute the benefits or harms of routine oro/nasopharyngeal suction over no suction. Further high-quality studies are required in preterm infants or term newborn infants with thick meconium amniotic fluid. Studies should investigate long-term effects such as neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Long-term enteral access — gastrostomy preference and NG vs PEG outcomes: The use of gastrostomy tubes (balloon and nonballoon tubes) has become routine practice worldwide and is currently the method of choice for medium-term and long-term enteral feeding. In studies of adult patients with persistent dysphagia due to neurological disease randomly assigned to feedings via NG or PEG tube placement, patients with PEG tubes gained more weight and missed fewer feedings, and NG-fed patients received significantly less because of tube difficulties; in one study that allowed crossover for repeated NG tube difficulties, only 1 of 19 patients had an NG tube in place for 4 weeks.

### Efficacy of voluntary nasogastric tube feeding in female inpatients with anorexia nervosa [^1126NUqL]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This investigation assesses the efficacy of a voluntary nasogastric tube feeding protocol on the weight gain of patients with anorexia nervosa, tube feeding's effect on recovery from the psychologic aspects of anorexia, patient satisfaction with treatment, and medical complications.

Methods

The study included a nonrandomized retrospective review of 381 female inpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, both subtypes. A total of 155 patients received tube feeding and oral refeeding; 226 received oral refeeding alone. Recovery from the psychologic aspects of anorexia was measured by the change in Eating Disorder Inventory-2 scores between admission and discharge. Patient satisfaction with treatment was measured with a patient satisfaction questionnaire completed at discharge. Repeated measures and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

When severity-of-illness and caloric intake differences between patients with and without tube feeding were controlled, patients who received tube feeding gained significantly more weight per treatment week than those who received oral kilocalories alone. Patients who received tube feeding for at least one-half their length of stay gained 1 kg/week versus 0.77 kg/week for patients receiving oral refeeding alone. Tube-fed patients evidenced no differences in recovery from anorexia's psychologic aspects, satisfaction with treatment, or medical complication frequency.

Conclusions

In residential psychiatric treatment settings in which intensive therapeutic interventions and appropriate medical monitoring can manage potential psychologic and medical risks, tube feeding's weight gain benefits may be a viable and safe option in treating anorexia.

a) Is NG feeding the right decision for this patient?

b) Is this the right time to place the NG tube and is the appropriate equipment available?

c) Is there sufficient knowledge/expertise available at this time to test for safe placement of the NG tube?

In response to further clinical incidents where chest x rays were wrongly interpreted, it was also suggested that:

i) X ray request forms clearly state that the purpose of the x ray is to establish the position of the NG tube for the purpose of feeding

ii) The radiographer takes responsibility to ensure that the NG tube can be clearly seen on the x ray to be used to confirm tube position

iii) Documentation of the tube placement checking process includes confirmation that any x ray viewed was the most current x ray for the correct patient, how placement was interpreted, and clear instructions as to required actions. Any tubes identified to be in the lung are removed immediately, whether in the x ray department or clinical area.

The above guidelines have a broad scope. As such, it was realised during the course of the quality improvement project that it should have a specifically focus, ie initial insertion of NG tubes and confirmation of placement, using the NPSA 2005 guidelines as the agreed standard. We were aiming for 100% attainment. A time frame of 90 days was initially proposed, however, this was later extended to 120 days as the project developed.

### Nasogastric tube knotting: a rare and potentially overlooked complication among healthcare professionals [^115KMoBa]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Nasogastric tube placement is a common procedure performed in surgical and medical specialities. The occurrence of knot formation is perhaps one of the least well-recognised complications associated with its usage. We present a case of nasogastric tube knotting to remind colleagues of this rare but important complication. A 75-year-old woman with adhesional bowel obstruction was admitted under the general surgery team. A wide bore nasogastric tube was inserted for drainage and decompression. Although placement of the tube was deemed to be successful, there was no drainage of gastric content evident. On removal of the 'non-functioning' tube a simple knot was seen at its proximal end. A further nasogastric tube was placed and the patient's symptoms resolved with conservative management. Nasogastric tube knotting is a rare and often overlooked complication with the potential to cause significant trauma on tube removal if unrecognised.

Gastroparesis is a complex chronic debilitating condition of gastric motility resulting in the delayed gastric emptying and multiple severe symptoms, which may lead to malnutrition and dehydration. Initial management of patients with gastroparesis focuses on the diet, lifestyle modification and medical therapy. Various endoscopic and surgical interventions are reserved for refractory cases of gastroparesis, not responding to conservative therapy. Pyloric interventions, enteral access tubes, gastric electrical stimulator and gastrectomy have been described in the care of patients with gastroparesis. In this article, the authors review current management, indications, and contraindications to these procedures.

### Continued enteral nutrition until extubation compared with fasting before extubation in patients in the intensive care unit: an open-label, cluster-randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial [^116hoRJK]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Fasting is frequently imposed before extubation in patients in intensive care units, with the aim to reduce risk of aspiration. This unevaluated practice might delay extubation, increase workload, and reduce caloric intake. We aimed to compare continued enteral nutrition until extubation with fasting before extubation in patients in the intensive care unit.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial in 22 intensive care units in France. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible for enrolment if they had received invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h in the intensive care unit and received prepyloric enteral nutrition for at least 24 h at the time of extubation decision. Centres were randomly assigned (1:1) to continued enteral nutrition until extubation or 6-h fasting with concomitant gastric suctioning before extubation, to be applied for all patients within the unit. Masking was not possible because of the nature of the trial. The primary outcome was extubation failure (composite criteria of reintubation or death) within 7 days after extubation, assessed in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The non-inferiority margin was set at 10%. Pneumonia within 14 days of extubation was a key secondary endpoint. This trial is now complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03335345.

Findings

Between April 1, 2018, and Oct 31, 2019, 7056 patients receiving enteral nutrition and mechanical ventilation were admitted to the intensive care units and 4198 were assessed for eligibility. 1130 patients were enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat population and 1008 were included in the per-protocol population. In the intention-to-treat population, extubation failure occurred in 106 (17·2%) of 617 patients assigned to receive continued enteral nutrition until extubation versus 90 (17·5%) of 513 assigned to fasting, meeting the a priori defined non-inferiority criterion (absolute difference -0·4%, 95% CI -5·2 to 4·5). In the per-protocol population, extubation failure occurred in 101 (17·0%) of 595 patients assigned to receive continued enteral nutrition versus 74 (17·9%) of 413 assigned to fasting (absolute difference -0·9%, 95% CI -5·6 to 3·7). Pneumonia within 14 days of extubation occurred in ten (1·6%) patients assigned to receive continued enteral nutrition and 13 (2·5%) assigned to fasting (rate ratio 0·77, 95% CI 0·22 to 2·69).

Interpretation

Continued enteral nutrition until extubation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit was non-inferior to a 6-h fasting maximum gastric vacuity strategy comprising continuous gastric tube suctioning, in terms of extubation failure within 7 days (a patient-centred outcome), and thus represents a potential alternative in this population.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^116cyQaZ]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Gastroparesis-related enteral access — Proper and early management of mild gastroparesis through diet modifications can effectively divert these risks, and when diet changes are inadequate to manage symptoms and malnutrition is observed, a more aggressive approach is warranted; rehydration and electrolyte replacement are priorities, followed by intravenous (IV) antiemetics and prokinetics, and patients who are unable to maintain hydration, electrolytes within range, and adequate perfusion are candidates for feeding through NJT or jejunostomy tube, with consideration of gastric tubes for decompression or newer combination (gastrostomy with jejunal extension) tubes, while separate tubes for feeding and decompression, although more cumbersome for patients and caregivers, may be beneficial because of the risk of tube migration with compromised peristalsis when using a gastrostomy-jejunostomy tube.

To the Editor — During the past five years, we too have avoided nasogastric suction in approximately 50 to 60 patients with mild to moderately severe alcoholic pancreatitis. Our observations have been uncontrolled, but, in general, confirm the findings of Levant et al. Our policy has been to insert a nasogastric tube on admission only if the patient has repetitive vomiting, severe pain, or marked distension. The stomach contents are aspirated and the tube is removed unless bleeding is present. The patients are then permitted nothing by mouth until they express marked hunger, whereupon oral feedings are resumed. The nasogastric tube is reinserted if severe vomiting, abdominal distension, or pain recur. Only a few patients have required reintubation. As in Levant's series, anticholinergics, antibiotics, and antacids were not used.

Occasionally, a nasojejunal tube is placed instead. This tube is inserted into the part of the small bowel called the jejunum. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including a condition called gastroparesis, in which the stomach is not working but the rest of the intestine is. The pylorus is the valve that separates the stomach from the rest of the small bowel. Therefore, nasojejunal tubes are also referred to as postpyloric tubes. These types of tubes can be inserted at the bedside by a nurse or a doctor. Placement might be slightly uncomfortable, but most patients can ignore the tube once in place. There is a risk of the tube being pulled out unintentionally. If this occurs, the tube may need to be replaced by a health care practitioner.

Long-term Nutrition If patients are expected to require enteral nutrition for longer than a couple of weeks, a long-term solution is needed. This may involve use of tubes that go directly through the abdominal wall into the gut. A gastrostomy tube or a jejunostomy tube can be placed into the stomach or the jejunum, respectively. There are 3 main ways to place these tubes: surgically by a surgeon using general anesthesia; fluoroscopically via x-ray guidance by a radiologist using sedation; or endoscopically by a gastroenterologist or a surgeon using sedation. These types of tubes can be left in place for months to years. If these tubes become dislodged and come out, the patient, family members, or other caregivers can replace them at home once the tract that the tube has been in is well formed.

If a patient regains the ability to eat and no longer needs the tube, it can be removed. The hole usually closes on its own. Baiu I, Spain DA. Enteral Nutrition. JAMA. 2019; 321:

### Diagnosis and management of a misplaced nasogastric tube into the pulmonary pleura… [^113JULoX]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

A significant number of patients undergoing surgery for disorders of the head and neck will receive a Dobbhoff tube or a nasogastric tube. The tube placement may be used for the short term, to get patients through a critical illness, or for the long term, when patients need nutritional supplementation for an extended period. The feeding tube may be placed in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia or at the bedside in a regular hospital setting. Many methods of monitoring the correct placement of the feeding tube have been described. Recently, in our institution, feeding tubes were placed into the lungs or pleural space in 3 cases, including 1 case on the otolaryngology service. Lo JO, Wu V, Reh D, Nadig S, Wax MK.

### Patient-centered outcomes: a way forward when evidence is lacking… [^111UdAeS]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

1, 11 In contrast to more robustly studied interventions, nasal suctioning was left completely out of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, despite its frequent use, because of a lack of high-quality data to support or disprove its use. Because bronchiolitis remains the leading cause of hospitalization of patients < 2 years old at a direct cost of > $700 million annually, 12 the challenge of how to treat this common condition and our inherently human "need to do something" is juxtaposed with what seems like an inadequate toolbox of low-quality, poorly studied interventions. In this edition of Hospital Pediatrics, Lane and Foster 17 examined the impact of levels of respiratory support and NG tube use in hospitalized children with bronchiolitis, across 13 domains using a previously validated questionnaire. 18 Three out of 13 questions highlighted statistically significant differences in mean impact score across varying levels of support.

These areas included caregiver holding, caregiver bonding, and breastfeeding disruption. Mean impact scores decreased between no support and low support, but steadily increased in moderate support, high support, and positive pressure across the 3 domains. Furthermore, their use of open-ended questions for qualitative responses identified tubes and lines as the most often-cited barriers to holding, bonding, and breastfeeding. There were no patients who required LFNC and NG tube support, and the impact of IV fluids was not explored in this study. Though maybe counterintuitive, the authors posit that the decrease in mean impact score between no support and low support might be because of a placebo effect provided by some degree of intervention, but that at increasing levels of support, the interventions become more of a barrier to holding, bonding, and breastfeeding.

This is supported by the identification of oxygen and NG tube supplementation as specific therapies they felt helped their child recover more quickly, in another open-ended question. This study provides an important first step in evaluating the impact of respiratory support and NG tube supplementation on hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. However, there are some important limitations. First, the groups that made up their levels of support were not determined a priori, but rather on the basis of balanced patient distribution across the groups. Despite its limitations, this study highlights the important notion that, even when we limit our care to supportive care interventions, we have the potential to create impact. Though it's common for supporters of unproven therapies or more aggressive monitoring parameters to cite improved comfort.
