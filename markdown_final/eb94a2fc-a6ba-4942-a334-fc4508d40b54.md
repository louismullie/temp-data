## Question

Which one of the diabetic medication is both beneficial for renal protection and diabetes management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diabetic medication is both beneficial for renal protection and diabetes management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "beneficial for renal protection" means clinically and whether that benefit must be independent of glycemic effects. Then, I should verify which antihyperglycemic classes have robust, guideline-endorsed renal outcome data. Next, I will compare leading candidates, especially SGLT2 inhibitors versus GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin, for both glycemic control and kidney protection. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-supported answer and note practical caveats like eGFR thresholds and safety considerations [^113XVPnH] [^112TtxQw].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "renal protection" should refer to slowing CKD progression and reducing hard renal endpoints such as sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, or renal death, ideally with benefits demonstrated in randomized trials and reflected in major guidelines; importantly, I need to check whether this protection is independent of HbA1c lowering, because that changes how we interpret mechanisms and applicability across kidney function strata [^1132wMib] [^112TtxQw].

> Next, I should review which medication classes have credible renal protection signals. SGLT2 inhibitors have consistent, large reductions in renal outcomes across multiple trials and are strongly recommended in diabetes with CKD by ADA, KDIGO, and VA/DoD; GLP-1 receptor agonists have supportive but less consistent renal data and are generally positioned as second-line for kidney protection when SGLT2 inhibitors are not suitable; metformin remains first-line for glycemic control but lacks definitive renal outcome benefit beyond its glucose-lowering effects, so I need to be careful not to overstate its renoprotection [^112TtxQw] [^115Xn7Ro] [^113fNY3E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — let me verify the strength of evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors. CREDENCE showed a 30% reduction in the primary renal composite with canagliflozin in T2D with CKD, and DAPA-CKD demonstrated a 39% reduction in a composite renal outcome that included patients with and without diabetes; EMPA-KIDNEY extended benefits across a broad CKD spectrum, and meta-analyses confirm class-wide reductions in kidney failure and related outcomes, supporting a robust, reproducible effect that is largely independent of HbA1c change [^111GVaiv] [^113EfrRK] [^114nYaQA] [^113FkUgv].

> I will now examine GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide in FLOW reduced kidney outcomes in people with CKD, including many with diabetes, indicating meaningful renoprotection; however, the magnitude and consistency of renal benefits across the GLP-1 class are less uniform than with SGLT2 inhibitors, and guidelines generally position GLP-1 RAs as alternatives when SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated or not tolerated, so I should be cautious about claiming equivalence for primary renal protection [^115BL3Nb] [^112MMxZH].

> Let me consider metformin carefully. It remains foundational for glycemic control and is safe down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² in most guidance, with observational data suggesting lower cardiovascular events versus sulfonylureas in CKD, but there are no large, dedicated renal outcome trials proving hard renal endpoint reduction; thus, while metformin is excellent for diabetes management, I should not ascribe proven renoprotection to it beyond indirect effects via glycemia and cardiometabolic risk reduction [^114rULsB] [^114uqKz2] [^116qdivk].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism point because it matters for clinical application. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce intraglomerular pressure via tubuloglomerular feedback, lower albuminuria, and blunt inflammatory and oxidative pathways — these effects persist even when eGFR is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² where glycemic efficacy wanes, which explains why renal protection is observed independent of HbA1c lowering; this mechanistic independence strengthens the case for SGLT2 inhibitors as the preferred renoprotective antihyperglycemic class in T2D with CKD [^1132wMib] [^116RVn4p] [^113FkUgv].

> I should double-check guideline concordance to ensure my conclusion aligns with current standards. ADA 2025 recommends initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit in T2D with CKD when eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73 m² to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events; KDIGO 2022 similarly prioritizes SGLT2 inhibitors for kidney and cardiovascular protection in diabetes with CKD; VA/DoD issues a strong recommendation for SGLT2 inhibitors to improve renal outcomes in T2D with CKD, reinforcing the hierarchy of evidence and consensus [^112TtxQw] [^116nFGVo] [^115Xn7Ro].

> But wait, what if someone argues GLP-1 RAs are equally "the answer"? I need to ensure balance: GLP-1 RAs are reasonable alternatives for glycemic control and can reduce albuminuria and slow eGFR decline in some trials, yet their renal benefits are less consistent across the class and are generally considered when SGLT2 inhibitors are unsuitable; thus, while GLP-1 RAs are beneficial, they are not the primary renoprotective choice when both glycemic and renal benefits are required in tandem [^113fNY3E] [^112MMxZH].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The medication that best fulfills both criteria — robust glycemic control and proven, guideline-endorsed renal protection — is the SGLT2 inhibitor class, with representative agents including empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, given their consistent reductions in kidney failure and CKD progression independent of HbA1c and their central role in contemporary diabetes-with-CKD care pathways [^112TtxQw] [^116nFGVo] [^115Xn7Ro].

SGLT2 inhibitors are the **preferred diabetes medications** for both glycemic control and renal protection, with robust evidence of slowing CKD progression and reducing renal events independent of glucose lowering [^112TtxQw] [^113FkUgv]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are a **strong second-line option**, especially when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated, offering additional renal and cardiovascular benefits [^112MMxZH] [^113fNY3E]. Metformin remains first-line for glycemic control but offers **limited direct renal protection** compared to SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^114rULsB] [^117BKQM2].

## SGLT2 inhibitors: primary choice for renal protection

SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin) are the **preferred class** for patients with T2DM and CKD because they provide robust renal protection and glycemic control [^112TtxQw] [^115Xn7Ro].

- **Renal benefits**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce CKD progression, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and renal death, with benefits independent of glycemic control [^112TtxQw] [^113FkUgv].
- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduced heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular events, further supporting their use in CKD patients [^112TtxQw] [^115uKkyx].
- **Glycemic control**: Effective HbA1c reduction, though attenuated at lower eGFR levels [^111CwBAi] [^116RVn4p].

---

## GLP-1 receptor agonists: secondary option with renal benefits

GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide) are a **strong second-line option**, particularly when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated [^112MMxZH] [^113fNY3E].

- **Renal benefits**: GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce albuminuria and slow CKD progression, though to a lesser extent than SGLT2 inhibitors [^112MMxZH] [^113fNY3E].
- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Significant reductions in cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease [^112MMxZH] [^113fNY3E].
- **Glycemic control**: Effective HbA1c reduction and weight loss benefits [^112MMxZH] [^113fNY3E].

---

## Metformin: foundational therapy with limited renal protection

Metformin remains a **foundational therapy** for T2DM but offers limited direct renal protection compared to SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^114rULsB] [^117BKQM2].

- **Renal benefits**: Limited evidence of direct renal protection; primarily beneficial for glycemic control [^114rULsB] [^117BKQM2].
- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Associated with reduced cardiovascular events, though less pronounced than SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^114uqKz2].
- **Glycemic control**: Effective HbA1c reduction and weight neutrality [^117BKQM2].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors** for patients with T2DM and CKD:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ADA 2025 | Initiate SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^112TtxQw] [^113NtASN] |
| KDIGO 2022 | Prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and CKD, considering eGFR thresholds [^116nFGVo] [^115Z5FJZ] |
| VA/DoD 2023 | Strongly recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2DM and CKD to improve renal outcomes [^115Xn7Ro] [^11362voc] |

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Medication class** | **Renal protection** | **Glycemic control** | **Cardiovascular benefits** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Strong evidence | Moderate (attenuated at low eGFR) | Strong evidence |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | Moderate evidence | Strong evidence | Strong evidence |
| Metformin | Limited evidence | Strong evidence | Moderate evidence |

---

SGLT2 inhibitors are the **preferred diabetes medications** for patients with T2DM and CKD, providing robust renal protection and glycemic control. GLP-1 receptor agonists are a strong second-line option, while metformin remains foundational but offers limited direct renal protection.

### Could metformin be used in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease? [^111xtg5n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an important cause of end stage renal failure worldwide. As renal impairment progresses, managing hyperglycaemia can prove increasingly challenging, as many medications are contra-indicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Whilst evidence for tight glycaemic control reducing progression to renal failure in patients with established renal disease is limited, poor glycaemic control is not desirable, and is likely to lead to progressive complications. Metformin is a first-line therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes, as it appears to be effective in reducing diabetes related end points and mortality in overweight patients. Cessation of metformin in patients with progressive renal disease may not only lead to deterioration in glucose control, but also to loss of protection from cardiovascular disease in a cohort of patients at particularly high risk. We advocate the need for further study to determine the role of metformin in patients with severe renal disease (chronic kidney disease stage 4–5), as well as patients on dialysis, or pre-/peri-renal transplantation. We explore possible roles of metformin in these circumstances, and suggest potential key areas for further study.

### SGLT2 inhibitors-the new standard of care for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic protection in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^116iK4iJ]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

A substantial evidence base supports the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This class of medicines has demonstrated important benefits that extend beyond glucose-lowering efficacy to protective mechanisms capable of slowing or preventing the onset of long-term cardiovascular, renal and metabolic (CVRM) complications, making their use highly applicable for organ protection and the maintenance of long-term health outcomes. SGLT2is have shown cost-effectiveness in T2DM management and economic savings over other glucose-lowering therapies due to reduced incidence of cardiovascular and renal events. National and international guidelines advocate SGLT2i use early in the T2DM management pathway, based upon a plethora of supporting data from large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials, renal outcomes trials and real-world studies. While most people with T2DM would benefit from CVRM protection through SGLT2i use, prescribing hesitancy remains, potentially due to confusion concerning their place in the complex therapeutic paradigm, variation in licensed indications or safety perceptions/misunderstandings associated with historical data that have since been superseded by robust clinical evidence and long-term pharmacovigilance reporting. This latest narrative review developed by the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee (IDSC) outlines the place of SGLT2is within current evidence-informed guidelines, examines their potential as the standard of care for the majority of newly diagnosed people with T2DM and sets into context the perceived risks and proven advantages of SGLT2is in terms of sustained health outcomes. The authors discuss the cost-effectiveness case for SGLT2is and provide user-friendly tools to support healthcare professionals in the correct application of these medicines in T2DM management. The previously published IDSC SGLT2i Prescribing Tool for T2DM Management has undergone updates and reformatting and is now available as a Decision Tool in an interactive pdf format as well as an abbreviated printable A4 poster/wall chart.

The Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors-the new standard of care for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic protection in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^112T9jwf]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The Role of the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee

The Improving Diabetes Steering Committee (IDSC) is a multi-disciplinary group of healthcare professionals (HCPs) convened to offer evidence-informed practical guidance for the appropriate use of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) class of medicines in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The Committee aims to produce materials that provide balanced review of the evidence and guidelines relating to use of SGLT2is in the management of T2DM, including their risk–benefit profile in reducing the risk of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic (CVRM) complications.

This narrative review summarises the key topics that were discussed during a Steering Committee meeting held in July 2023. The article is based upon previously conducted trials and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects. Some authors were involved in studies discussed within the paper that included human subjects, all of which complied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and used protocols that had received Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee approval, with written informed consent provided by participants.

This paper aims to provide HCPs working in the field of T2DM with a practical understanding of the place, value and advantages of appropriate SGLT2i use in the T2DM treatment pathway. The main objectives for SGLT2i use are discussed alongside information on guideline-directed selection of suitable recipients and the cost–benefit case supporting these agents. As with the previous reviews published by the IDSC in Diabetes Therapy, the Committee has developed a range of pragmatic tools and materials to support HCPs. These are provided within the body of the article as well as in the associated supplementary materials and include key practice points for HCPs prescribing SGLT2is, common frequently asked questions (FAQs) relating to SGLT2is (from the perspective of HCPs and people with T2DM) and a summary of helpful resources that are available for HCPs, people living with T2DM and those who care for them. Finally, the IDSC SGLT2i Prescribing Tool for T2DM Management has undergone an update and format change. It is now available as an SGLT2i Decision Tool, provided in an interactive pdf format, which can be downloaded as a supplementary material associated with this review paper.

### HbA1c and beyond [^113XbrYM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease from 2020 comes at an opportune time when progress in diabetes technology and therapeutics offers new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. Management of haemoglobin A1c is important in diabetes, but an enlarging base of evidence from large clinical trials has demonstrated important new treatments offering organ protection and not just glucose management, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. It is the ambition that the guideline can help to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies based on high-quality evidence. Here, the focus has been on comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycaemic monitoring and targets, antihyperglycaemic therapies in patients with diabetes and CKD, and new developments since the guideline was published offering new opportunities and a wider target population for the new interventions.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^117BKQM2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Since metformin was approved by the FDA in 1994 it has quickly risen to front-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin has been associated with improvement in glycemic control, weight neutrality, and low cost as well as low risk for hypoglycemia. However, recent GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor outcomes trials have impacted the guidelines for diabetes management.

Appropriately, diabetes management has recently become more outcomes-focused, shifting from concentrating exclusively on glycemic control to considering the impact these medications have on complications from diabetes. Results from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials are already influencing current guidelines. The ADA Standards of Care still recommends metformin as first-line therapy while considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c in high-risk patients. Alternatively, the EASD recently recommended considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors as the first line for patients who have certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and renal disease. The difference in the optimal diabetes treatment in high-risk, drug-naïve patients will not resolve until we have more data from a head-to-head trial comparing metformin with newer glycemic-lowering medications or conclusive evidence from previous cardiovascular outcomes trials suggesting that metformin mitigates the beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

While they might seem different, the two guidelines are actually similar in recommending diabetes medications with beneficial cardiovascular effects for certain high-risk patients as early as possible. Despite the current recommendations, there is still only a small portion of eligible patients who are receiving these cardio-protective medications, probably due to cost and clinical inertia. Our focus should be on expanding the use of optimal medication with cardiovascular benefits.

In summary, there are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c, yet cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^114EX8Le]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial burden of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, an aggressive approach to treatment is required. Despite the benefits of guideline-directed therapy, there remains a high residual risk of continuing progression of chronic kidney disease and of cardiovascular events. Historically, a linear approach to pharmacologic management of chronic kidney disease has been used, in which drugs are added, then adjusted, optimized, or stopped in a stepwise manner based on their efficacy, toxicity, effects on a patient's quality of life, and cost. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, which may result in missing a window of opportunity to slow chronic kidney disease progression. Instead, a pillar approach has been proposed to enable earlier treatment that simultaneously targets multiple pathways involved in disease progression. Combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes is being investigated in several clinical trials. In this article, we discuss current treatment options for patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and provide a rationale for tailored combinations of therapies with complementary mechanisms of action to optimize therapy using a pillar-based treatment strategy. [This article includes a plain language summary as an additional file].

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Approach to the patient with type 2 diabetes requiring add-on medication [^115p3jJX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)-lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c level from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. The goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.

### Pleiotropic effects of type 2 diabetes management strategies on renal risk factors [^1154rzFe]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

In parallel with the type 2 diabetes pandemic, diabetic kidney disease has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, and is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As established in landmark randomised trials and recommended in clinical guidelines, prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease focuses on control of the two main renal risk factors, hyperglycaemia and systemic hypertension. Treatment of systemic hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is advocated because these drugs seem to exert specific renoprotective effects beyond blood pressure lowering. Emerging evidence shows that obesity, glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria, and dyslipidaemia might also adversely affect the kidney in diabetes. Control of these risk factors could have additional benefits on renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, despite multifactorial treatment approaches, residual risk for the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes remains, and novel strategies or therapies to treat the disease are urgently needed. Several drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes are associated with pleiotropic effects that could favourably or unfavourably change patients' renal risk profile. We review the risk factors and treatment of diabetic kidney disease, and describe the pleiotropic effects of widely used drugs in type 2 diabetes management on renal outcomes, with special emphasis on antihyperglycaemic drugs.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors: Do we need them for glucose-lowering, for cardiorenal protection or both? [^11213fcA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors are the newest addition to our treatment armamentarium for the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Glucose-lowering per se reduces the risk of microvascular complications, but not the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Also, even when embedded in optimal cardiovascular prevention, a large residual risk remains with respect to progression of diabetic kidney disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors lower blood glucose levels by inducing glucosuria. Through various proposed mechanisms, among which diuretic and natriuretic effects, SGLT-2 inhibitors decrease heart failure hospitalization, reduce cardiovascular mortality, and mitigate progression of diabetic kidney disease. In this perspective, we will discuss the glucose-lowering and other protective effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardiorenal axis, both in primary and secondary prevention. By comparing the glycemic and pleiotropic effects of these agents to other glucose-lowering drugs, we will address questions around whether SGLT-2 inhibitors should be considered primarily as glucose-lowering agents, cardiorenal drugs or both.

### Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: implications for managing glycaemic control, cardiovascular and renal risk [^111w3o2R]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This review examines the current literature relating to diabetes related kidney disease (DKD) and the optimal management of cardio-renal risk. DKD develops in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mainstay of therapy is to reduce the progression of DKD by optimising hyperglycaemia, blood pressure, lipids and lifestyle. Evidence supports the role for renin-angiotensin system blockade in limiting the progression of DKD. Recent data from diabetes related cardiovascular outcome trials and renal specific trials have provided a novel insight on the additional benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in reducing the progression of DKD as well as cardiovascular risk. Lessons have been learnt from CREDENCE and there are expectations that DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY will further support the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition in relation to DKD. As a consequence, international guidelines have been updated to reflect the positive benefits. In addition, novel steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists offer a potential role in future years. The review examines the current evidence and future approach to optimising outcomes for renal protection in patients with diabetes.

### Recommendations for early and comprehensive management of type 2 diabetes and its related cardio-renal complications [^116U7zgk]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global health problem accompanied by an elevated risk of complications, the most common being cardiac and renal diseases. In Lebanon, the prevalence of T2D is estimated at 8–13%. Local medical practice generally suffers from clinical inertia, with gaps in the yearly assessment of clinical manifestations and suboptimal screening for major complications. The joint statement presented here, endorsed by five Lebanese scientific medical societies, aims at providing physicians in Lebanon with a tool for early, effective, and comprehensive care of patients with T2D. Findings from major randomized clinical trials of antidiabetic medications with cardio-renal benefits are presented, together with recommendations from international medical societies. Optimal care should be multidisciplinary and should include a multifactorial risk assessment, lifestyle modifications, and a regular evaluation of risks, including the risks for cardiovascular (CV) and renal complications. With international guidelines supporting a shift in T2D management from glucose-lowering agents to disease-modifying drugs, the present statement recommends treatment initiation with metformin, followed by the addition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists due to their CV and renal protection properties, whenever possible. In addition to the selection of the most appropriate pharmacological therapy, efforts should be made to provide continuous education to patients about their disease, with the aim to achieve a patient-centered approach and to foster self-management and adherence to the medical plan. Increasing the level of patient engagement is expected to be associated with favorable health outcomes. Finally, this statement recommends setting an achievable individualized management plan and conducting regular follow-ups to monitor the patients' glycemic status and assess their risks every 3–6 months.

### SGLT2 inhibitors-the new standard of care for cardiovascular, renal and metabolic protection in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^116gzh7p]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Putting the evidence in to practice, the IDSC supports the implementation of a rapid sequential approach to T2DM management comprising early combination therapy with metformin and an SGLT2i agent for most people with T2DM, rather than gradual stepwise intensification of treatment over an extended period. Using this method, metformin should be initiated and titrated to an appropriate dose during the first month, with the SGLT2i agent added (unless contraindicated) after 4 weeks (supported by a telephone appointment, where possible) or by a review after 12 weeks (at latest). For high-risk individuals (high CV risk, CVD or kidney disease), an SGLT2i should be started at diagnosis, with or without other diabetes therapies, in line with ADA/EASD and KDIGO guidelines.

It is important to discuss the relative risks and benefits with the person being prescribed an SGLT2i to ensure that they broadly understand how these treatments work and have an opportunity to ask questions. To minimise the chances of experiencing an AE that will discourage an individual from persisting with newly initiated SGLT2i medication, advice should be given regarding the importance of maintaining good daily hydration and genital hygiene. Information about genital infections and the signs and symptoms of DKA should be communicated with an emphasis on the fact that ketoacidosis and FG are very rare events in usual practice. Counselling the individual about the importance of avoiding very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diets and ensuring continued hydration while taking an SGLT2i will help to reduce the risk of rare but serious events. Sick day guidance should be given, with clear instructions on pausing SGLT2i therapy while the person is unwell and they must be encouraged to contact their HCP if they need assistance in restarting treatment once they have recovered. Box 1 provides a summary of key practice points to guide a T2DM consultation in which an SGLT2i agent is initiated. The answers to common FAQs are also provided in Box 2 to support HCPs in answering their own questions about SGLT2is. Box 3 provides responses to queries that a person with T2DM may have when they are prescribed an SGLT2i. Finally, Box 4 contains links to key resources for HCPs and people with T2DM relating to SGLT2i treatment. Variation in approved SGLT2i product licences continues to be a cause for confusion among prescribers, particularly relating to eGFR, and the IDSC advocates the use of recently published summaries, such as those provided in 'Prescribing SGLT2i therapy' section in Box 4, which give a useful and practical overview. Other areas covered by the links in Box 4 include current guidelines and information relating to DKA, genital infections and sick day guidance. Links to many of these materials are also provided via the SGLT2i Decision Tool (supplementary materials).

### What have we learned about renal protection from the cardiovascular outcome trials and observational analyses with SGLT2 inhibitors? [^111GVaiv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the past 5years, sodium-glucose cotransport 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been increasingly regarded as glycaemic agents with cardiovascular (CV) and renal protective effects. The CV benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have been well established in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a range of CV comorbidities at baseline. Subsequently, the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were established in the CREDENCE trial, a dedicated renal outcome trial where canagliflozin reduced the primary composite renal outcome by 30%. In light of these trials, clinical practice guidelines have rapidly evolved, recommending the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as renal and cardioprotective agents in appropriate patient populations. Accordingly, it is important to have an in-depth understanding of the evidence underlying the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D based on published clinical trials and real-world evidence (RWE) studies, as well as information related to potential safety concerns. To accomplish this, we reviewed the evidence for renal protection and safety with SGLT2 inhibitors in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program and DECLARE-TIMI 58 CV safety trials, and in the growing body of evidence emerging from real-world studies. This body of work has shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of surrogate renal endpoints such as albuminuria and mitigate the risk of hard renal endpoints including doubling of serum creatinine and end-stage kidney disease in patients with T2D.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline update [^114sMRip]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease is an update of the 2020 guideline from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

Methods

The KDIGO Work Group updated the guideline, which included reviewing and grading new evidence that was identified and summarized. As in the previous guideline, the Work Group used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of recommendations and expert judgment to develop consensus practice points. New evidence led to updating of recommendations in the chapters Comprehensive Care in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 1) and Glucose-Lowering Therapies in Patients With T2D and CKD (Chapter 4). New evidence did not change recommendations in the chapters Glycemic Monitoring and Targets in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle Interventions in Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to Management of Patients With Diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5).

Recommendations

The updated guideline includes 13 recommendations and 52 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). A focus on preserving kidney function and maintaining well-being is recommended using a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventions, self-management, and first-line pharmacotherapy (such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes. To this are added additional drugs with heart and kidney protection, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and interventions to control risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, such as blood pressure, glycemia, and lipids.

Current Guidelines for SGLT2i Use in T2DM

While the NICE NG28 recommendations are used by the majority of UK HCPs to guide T2DM treatment decisions, there are some gaps in the current NICE guidelines that are considered in the ADA/EASD and KDIGO guidance. The NG28 guideline recommends initiation of SGLT2i therapy in combination with metformin (once metformin tolerability has been confirmed) for individuals with high CV risk, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), comorbid HF and comorbid CKD. SGLT2i monotherapy is also advocated for use in high-risk individuals with T2DM who are unable to tolerate metformin. NICE recommends the use of the QRISK2 ® tool (QRISK ® 3 is also available as an updated version to use online but is currently less widely integrated in primary care systems) to assess a person's risk of CVD. People with T2DM who are under the age of 40 years and therefore unsuitable for QRISK assessment should be considered at high risk if they have one or more CV risk factor, defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, obesity, and family history (in a first-degree relative) of premature CVD. According to ADA/EASD guidelines, SGLT2is may be used as a first-line treatment in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies (or alone) where the treatment goal is to achieve and maintain glycaemic and weight management targets, with early combination therapy endorsed to optimise outcomes and extend the time to therapeutic failure. Under the same guidelines, SGLT2is are the recommended first-line therapy (in addition to comprehensive CV risk-management strategies) when the goal of treatment is cardiorenal risk reduction in high-risk people with T2DM, comprising those with known cardiorenal disease (established CVD/HF/CKD) or indicators of high ASCVD risk. The Primary Care Diabetes Europe position statement recommends combining SGLT2i therapy with metformin for individuals with T2DM and HF or CKD, ensuring both glycaemic control and cardiorenal protection. The KDIGO 2022 recommendations include SGLT2is within their comprehensive care strategy to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression and CVD in people with diabetes. KDIGO supports combination therapy with metformin and an SGLT2i and advises that SGLT2is may be initiated when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥ 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and continued (as tolerated), until dialysis or transplantation is initiated. Likewise, the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) recommends SGLT2is for people with T2DM and eGFR ≥ 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2 attributed to diabetic nephropathy and in people with T2DM and coronary disease or stable symptomatic HF (irrespective of ejection fraction).

### New perspectives in management of cardiovascular risk among people with diabetes [^113ogyJh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Beyond Diabetes

The cardioprotective and kidney‐protective effects of SGLT2is have been demonstrated to be independent of glycemic control, raising the question of their benefits in individuals without T2D. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have each demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of people with HF and treatment of CKD independent of diabetes status, leading to product‐labeled indications for their use in such patients; sotagliflozin is also indicated for the treatment of HF independent of diabetes status. As such, multiple guidelines, including guidelines on chronic coronary disease, CKD, and HF, recommend use of SGLT2is independent of T2D status. A meta‐analysis of SGLT2i trials and HF and kidney outcomes using patient‐level data showed similar risk reduction in CKD progression, HF hospitalization, and cardiovascular death in patients with and without T2D. The meta‐analysis demonstrated no risk reduction in noncardiovascular death in both patients with and without T2D.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^113aYFLh]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Three large clinical trials have consistently shown that SGLT‐2 inhibition on top of standard of care (RAS inhibition) significantly reduces the risk of progression of CKD in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The observed kidney and cardiovascular benefits of SGLT‐2 inhibitors are independent of the HbA1c‐lowering effects of these agents in people with type 2 diabetes. In people with diabetes and eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, treatment with SGLT‐2 inhibitors does not lower HbA1c significantly. SGLT‐2 inhibitors can be initiated for kidney protection above an eGFR > 20 mL/min/1.73m 2, however, if the GFR is below 45 and further glucose lowering is required adding another class of medications to optimise diabetes control is recommended.

Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses suggest a clear beneficial class effect GLP‐1RA on the CVD risk and albuminuria reduction. Currently, there is one primary kidney end point study showing cardio‐renal benefits of semaglutide compared to placeboon top of standard of care (RASi). Of note ~15.6% of the cohort were on SGLT‐2 inhibitors at baseline and no major heterogeneity of treatment effect was observed in those on this combination. The available data to date from secondary or sub‐analyses of trials, simulation‐type analyses from recent studies and real‐world data suggest potential complementary and additive effects and in our opinion combination treatment GLP‐1 RA and SGLT‐2 inhibitors should be considered early in the management of CKD in people with diabetes. Such a combination approach may aid cardio‐renal risk reduction by targeting residual risk and also improve glycaemic control with low risk of hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

9 CONCLUSION

Given the multiple concerns about the use of several antihyperglycaemic agents for the treatment of diabetes in patients with established DKD, we believe a strong effort towards patients and physician education should be implemented. Besides this education, we recommend individualizing each patient's treatment, focusing on the potential long‐term benefits of each agent and prospectively proceed to adjusting the dosage and use depending on the DKD stage to avoid any renal damage or stage progression. Considering the superiority of certain class of agents over others in protecting the kidney in the context of DKD, we also suggest a stronger interaction between nephrologists and endocrinologists to grant the selection of appropriate antihyperglycaemic agents in patients with established DKD at high risk for DKD progression. Nonetheless, positive results on renal outcome with certain class of agents warrant further investigation in these areas, as understanding the specific mechanisms driving renoprotection may lead to the discovery of new treatments focusing mainly on patients with established DKD.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^113qLMDb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.

### Comparative efficacy of novel antidiabetic drugs on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117RPFc2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 463 million people live with diabetes worldwide, with type 2 diabetes mellitus accounting for 90% of that total. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the major complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, occurring in approximately 25% to 50% of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DKD manifests clinically as persistent microalbuminuria, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or both, eventually leading to renal impairment and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD). The incidence of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus substantially increases both cardiovascular (CV) and all‐cause mortality risk; DKD is the primary cause of the excess mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Intensive glycemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of development of microalbuminuria; however, there was little or no benefit with regard to the risk of kidney disease progression compared with standard control. The renal protective effects of traditional antidiabetic drugs such as insulin, sulphonylureas and metformin have not been specifically studied in large clinical studies. In the past two decades, only renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade has been shown to be effective for renoprotection in DKD. Consequently, progression to ESKD and CV mortality have been two major unmet medical needs in patients with DKD.

The commentary notes that the discovery of the cardiorenal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors has been a turning point for the treatment and prognosis of patients with T2D and CKD and that the magnitude of their mitigating effect on cardiorenal end points and consistency across trials is a rarity in clinical research; it also states that the CVOT with ertugliflozin did not meet statistical significance for its primary cardiovascular or kidney outcomes.

KDIGO 2022 diabetes management in chronic kidney disease — key take-home directives are to initiate a multistep approach with lifestyle intervention and agents approved to improve cardiorenal metabolic clinical outcomes; prescribe a renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (either an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and persistent albuminuria and titrate to the maximally tolerated dose; initiate a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in T2DM with CKD at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 with indication to reduce risk of CKD progression, heart failure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases regardless of whether blood glucose is already controlled; use a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) in T2DM with CKD with elevated albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30 mg/g, consistently normal potassium, and already on standard of care therapies including an SGLT2 inhibitor, and monitor serum potassium and kidney function; use metformin in T2DM with CKD when eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; use a long-acting GLP1-RA when individualized glycemic targets persist despite metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor or if these are not tolerated, noting that long-acting GLP1-RA therapies are also indicated for weight loss; and employ a team-based integrated approach focused on regular assessment, control of multiple risk factors, and structured education in self-management to protect kidney function and reduce risk of complications.

### Clinical practice guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in adults with diabetic kidney disease [^114BHsSY]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A significant percentage of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease and diabetes is also a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The term diabetic kidney disease (DKD) includes both diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (DM CKD). DKD is associated with high morbidity and mortality, which are predominantly related to cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycaemia is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular complications and progression of DKD. Recent clinical trials of people with DKD have demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes with sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. SGLT-2 inhibitors have significantly reduced progression of DKD and onset of ESKD and these reno-protective effects are independent of glucose lowering. At the time of this update Canagliflozin and Dapagliflozin have been approved for delaying the progression of DKD. The Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) and UK Kidney Association (UKKA) Diabetic Kidney Disease Clinical Speciality Group have undertaken a literature review and critical appraisal of the available evidence to inform clinical practice guidelines for management of hyperglycaemia in adults with DKD. This 2021 guidance is for the variety of clinicians who treat people with DKD, including GPs and specialists in diabetes, cardiology and nephrology.

### Renoprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [^112a9K3P]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past two years, our understanding of anti-hyperglycemic medications used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has fundamentally changed. Before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, agents used to lower blood glucose were felt to prevent or delay the development of microvascular complications, but were not known to definitively reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality. Previous studies with then novel sodium-glucose cotransport-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors demonstrated improvements in several cardiovascular and renal risk factors, including HbA1c, blood pressure, weight, renal hyperfiltration, and albuminuria. However, as with other antihyperglycemic drugs, it could not be known if these salutary effects would translate into improved cardiorenal outcomes. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, SGLT2 inhibition with empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while also reducing mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of diabetic kidney disease. In the CANVAS Program trials using canagliflozin, the rates of the 3-point MACE endpoint, the risk of heart failure and the renal composite endpoint were also reduced, albeit with an increased risk of lower extremity amputation and fracture. As a result, clinical practice guidelines recommend the consideration of SGLT2 inhibition in high-risk patient subgroups for cardiovascular risk reduction. Ongoing primary renal endpoint trials will inform the cardio-metabolic-renal community about how to optimally treat patients with chronic kidney disease - including those with and without diabetes. Our aim is to review the rationale for renal protection with SGLT2 inhibitors, and their current place in the clinical management of patients with kidney disease.

The renoprotective benefits of the SGLT-2 inhibitors have thus been shown in the cardiovascular outcome trials but the level of benefit is substantially less than that seen in CREDENCE, which enrolled CKD patients with a mean eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and 60% of patients had eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. As a consequence, there were 176 sustained renal replacement therapy events adjudicated in CREDENCE, whereas only 11 and 19 similar events were seen in EMPA-REG and CANVAS-R, respectively. What was unclear until the recent publication of Dapagliflozin in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) was whether the renal benefit shown in CREDENCE was a class effect, or specific to canagliflozin, and whether benefits extended to non-diabetic CKD.

DAPA-CKD has clarified that other SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This trial involved 4304 participants and was stopped early due to clear efficacy. Over a median follow-up of 2.4 years a clear renal benefit was illustrated with the HR for a renal outcome (defined as sustained decline of eGFR of at least 50%, ESKD or death from a renal cause) of 0.56 (95% CI 0.45–0.68). The HR for a cardiovascular outcome was 0.71 (95% CI 0.55–0.92). Of note, the benefit was similar in those with or without diabetic CKD.EMPA-KIDNEYis due to be completed in 2022, and it will be interesting to see whether it shows similar results. It should also be noted that CREDENCE and the other SGLT-2 RCT demonstrated an improvement in heart failure hospitalisation (a secondary end point in CREDENCE) and this benefit has been conclusively demonstrated in DAPA-HF, in which dapagliflozin was shown significantly to reduce heart failure hospitalisation and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with reduced left ventricular function, irrespective of whether the patients had diabetes (which affected 42%).

### Combination therapy for kidney disease in people with diabetes mellitus [^115R8znD]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), defined as co-existing diabetes and chronic kidney disease in the absence of other clear causes of kidney injury, occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients with diabetes mellitus. As the global prevalence of diabetes has increased, DKD has become highly prevalent and a leading cause of kidney failure, accelerated cardiovascular disease, premature mortality and global health care expenditure. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to DKD, and single lifestyle or pharmacological interventions have shown limited efficacy at preserving kidney function. For nearly two decades, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were the only available kidney-protective drugs. However, several new drug classes, including sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist and a selective endothelin receptor antagonist, have now been demonstrated to improve kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, emerging preclinical and clinical evidence of the kidney-protective effects of glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists has led to the prospective testing of these agents for DKD. Research and clinical efforts are geared towards using therapies with potentially complementary efficacy in combination to safely halt kidney disease progression. As more kidney-protective drugs become available, the outlook for people living with DKD should improve in the next few decades.

ABSTRACT

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue affecting an estimated 850 million people globally. The leading causes of CKD is diabetes and hypertension, which together account for > 50% of patients with end-stage kidney disease. Progressive CKD leads to the requirement for kidney replacement therapy with transplantation or dialysis. In addition, CKD, is a risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, particularly from structural heart disease and heart failure (HF). Until 2015, the mainstay of treatment to slow progression of both diabetic and many non-diabetic kidney diseases was blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin system inhibition; however, neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) nor angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in major trials in CKD. The emergence of cardiovascular and renal benefits observed with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) from clinical trials of their use as anti-hyperglycaemic agents has led to a revolution in cardiorenal protection for patients with diabetes. Subsequent clinical trials, notably DAPA-HF, EMPEROR, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated their benefits in reducing risk of HF and progression to kidney failure in patients with HF and/or CKD. The cardiorenal benefits — on a relative scale — appear similar in patients with or without diabetes. Specialty societies' guidelines are continually adapting as trial data emerges to support increasingly wide use of SGLT2i. This consensus paper from EURECA-m and ERBP highlights the latest evidence and summarizes the guidelines for use of SGLT2i for cardiorenal protection focusing on benefits observed relevant to people with CKD.

There is no evidence that the use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, or other interventions prevent CKD without hypertension or albuminuria, and the American Diabetes Association does not recommend routine use of these medications solely for prevention. In the GRADE study comparing liraglutide, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and insulin glargine, a total of 5,047 participants were enrolled from July 2013 to August 2017 and were followed for an average of 5 years; almost all participants did not have signs of kidney disease at enrollment, and no differences between the examined medications were observed, suggesting no unique reno-protective effects for prevention. Of note, the SGLT2 inhibitors were not included because they were not routinely available at study initiation.

### SGLT2i for evidence-based cardiorenal protection in diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a comprehensive review by EURECA-M and ERBP working groups of ERA [^111KQHHe]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue affecting an estimated 850 million people globally. The leading causes of CKD is diabetes and hypertension, which together account for > 50% of patients with end-stage kidney disease. Progressive CKD leads to the requirement for kidney replacement therapy with transplantation or dialysis. In addition, CKD, is a risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, particularly from structural heart disease and heart failure (HF). Until 2015, the mainstay of treatment to slow progression of both diabetic and many non-diabetic kidney diseases was blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin system inhibition; however, neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) nor angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in major trials in CKD. The emergence of cardiovascular and renal benefits observed with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) from clinical trials of their use as anti-hyperglycaemic agents has led to a revolution in cardiorenal protection for patients with diabetes. Subsequent clinical trials, notably DAPA-HF, EMPEROR, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated their benefits in reducing risk of HF and progression to kidney failure in patients with HF and/or CKD. The cardiorenal benefits-on a relative scale-appear similar in patients with or without diabetes. Specialty societies' guidelines are continually adapting as trial data emerges to support increasingly wide use of SGLT2i. This consensus paper from EURECA-m and ERBP highlights the latest evidence and summarizes the guidelines for use of SGLT2i for cardiorenal protection focusing on benefits observed relevant to people with CKD.

Metformin has been used as a first‐line oral drug for people with type 2 diabetes for over 60 years. The dose of metformin should be decreased to 500 mg twice a day if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and omitted in the majority of circumstances if eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Of note limitations of eGFR measurements need to be appreciated especially in those at extremes of body weight and individualised treatment decisions may need to be considered in people with eGFR 25–30 mL/min/1.73m 2.

The guidelines acknowledge that there is a lack of high‐quality clinical trial evidence for the use of metformin as a cardio‐renal protective agent in people with CKD but in most countries worldwide it remains the most widely used first‐line agent for type 2 diabetes.

4.3 Mechanism of action ofinhibitors

Overall, this study proves the superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of CV and renal events, not only compared to placebo, but also compared to GLP‐1RAs and DPP‐4 inhibitors. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors block SGLT2 cotransporters in the renal proximal tubule, resulting in increased glycosuria and a mild natriuretic and diuretic effect. This leads to metabolic benefits including improved glycemic control, weight loss and blood pressure improvements that confer CV and renal protection. It has been proposed that SGLT2 inhibitors improve ventricular loading conditions (due to natriuretic and diuretic effects), optimize cardiac metabolism, thus improving cardiac efficiency and output and inhibit the Na + /H + exchanger (NHE 1) in the myocardium, thus providing favourable effects on the risk of heart failure. The net result of these processes is a reduced risk of CV and renal outcomes with SGLT2 inhibition, as seen in major CVOTs, and renal outcome trials, and confirmed in this meta‐analysis. SGLT2 inhibitors also lower the reabsorption of sodium in the renal proximal tubule, thus restoring glomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure. While this may result in an acute decrease in eGFR levels, eGFR stability is seen in the long run, leading to a nephroprotective effect.

4.4 Latest updates in guideline recommendations for the management of

The latest Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with stage 3 CKD or higher and type 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of glycemic control, to slow the progression of CKD and to reduce CV risks. The results of this meta‐analysis lend further support to these recommendations. The ADA suggests the use of GLP‐1RAs with proven CV benefit if SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contradicted. GLP‐1RAs are suggested "for CV risk reduction if such risk is a predominant problem, as they reduce risks of CV events and appear to possibly slow CKD progression". The results of this meta‐analysis do not confirm the CV risk reduction benefits of GLP‐1RAs in patients with DKD; although GLP‐1RAs slightly reduced CV and renal risks compared to placebo, the decrease was not statistically significant for most outcomes.

Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit cardiovascular benefits, including reduced heart failure risk and improved outcomes in patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Expanding evidence supports their use in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD, heart failure, and potentially type 1 diabetes.

Current indications for SGLT2 inhibitors include CKD, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Emerging evidence indicates these drugs are also prescribed to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Approved SGLT2 inhibitors include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The latter is the first dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor and is approved in Europe for both type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM.

As a result, SGLT2 inhibitors have become indispensable in managing CKD, DKD, and associated cardiovascular risks, underscoring their growing importance in nephrology. However, careful patient selection, monitoring, and management of potential side effects are essential.

Review Points.

Verify the latest clinical guidelines regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology.
Include recent trial data and ensure that the draft incorporates the most current evidence.

Pharmacotherapy for cardiovascular and renal comorbidity — For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, we recommend glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits to decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (i.e., chronic kidney disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure), we suggest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits to decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure, we recommend a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor to prevent hospital admissions for heart failure.

### SGLT2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a review [^117LBhtp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States and the world alike, and there is a great unmet need for treatments to reduce DKD development and progression. Inhibition of sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule of the kidney has emerged as an effective antihyperglycemic treatment, leading to regulatory approval of several first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In follow-on clinical trials for the cardiovascular safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors, secondary effects to prevent or reduce albuminuria and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate spurred further investigation into their potential application in DKD. This review summarizes the current understanding of mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule and improve systemic glucose homeostasis, the hypothesized mechanisms for kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition, and current recommendations for use of this class of antihyperglycemic agents in diabetic patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates. Results of ongoing clinical trials in patients with DKD are eagerly awaited to expand knowledge of how SGLT2 inhibitors might be used for prevention and treatment.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^1119vw2p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

SGLT-2 inhibitors — risk mitigation, perioperative management, and kidney function — patients at increased risk of adverse effects include those at baseline increased risk for genitourinary infections or diabetic ketoacidosis; additionally, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be held for at least 3 days before surgery to decrease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis; SGLT-2 inhibitors might increase the risk of hypotension and dehydration, and antihypertensive or diuretic medications or both might require adjustment; a reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after initiation might occur, but therapy can be continued unless the decline is significant and persistent; the glucose-lowering effect is attenuated when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73m², but renal protective benefits are retained with lower eGFR with evidence supporting safety if eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73m²; select SGLT-2 inhibitors are indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart failure (HF), and primary and specialty care providers are empowered to prescribe these agents for appropriate patients.

### Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition and cardiorenal protection: JACC review topic of the week [^117TrJsM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with the development of cardiovascular and renal complications, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Intensive glycemic control has been a major focus for clinical trials and novel drug development. However, narrow treatment strategies developed strictly for glycemic control did not confer a large risk reduction in cardiovascular events. There were also only modest effects in reducing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Recent cardiovascular safety trials and the dedicated renal protection trial CREDENCE (Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants with Diabetic Nephropathy) have shown that the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a newer generation of antihyperglycemic agents, improve both cardiovascular and renal outcomes when added to guideline-recommended treatment. This review examines the current evidence on the mechanism underlying the cardiorenal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and summarizes clinical trial evidence and safety data related to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular and renal protection.

Guideline recommendations relating to combination therapy in CKD with T2D

Three treatment guidelines — Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (2022), American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2024), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) (2022) — provide recommendations that relate to drug combinations for specific clinical scenarios in the management of CKD associated with T2D (Fig. 3). The KDIGO also recently published their 2024 update to the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD.

Fig. 3
Current practice guideline recommendations for combination therapies in patients with T2D at risk of CKD. KDIGO 2022, ADA 2024 Chap. 11, and AACE 2022 and KDIGO 2024 S/R = strong support/recommended by at least one of the practice guidelines; PP = Practice Point (by KDIGO, not a formal recommendation); NG = not graded AACE, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology; ADA, American Diabetes Association; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; ns-MRA, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; T2D, type 2 diabetes

Before discussing the specific combinations, the base therapy for the combinations, or first-line drug therapies, needs to be considered. The glucose-lowering agents metformin and SGLT2is are recommended by the KDIGO 2022 guidelines as first-line therapies in patients with T2D, and all three guidelines recommend a RAAS inhibitor, at the maximum tolerated dose, as a standard of care for patients with T2D and albuminuria.

SGLT2is are recommended if eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD, with the KDIGO and ADA guidelines also adding that patients are to have a UACR ≥ 200 mg/g. Where the combination of metformin and SGLT2i is insufficient to control blood glucose or cannot be tolerated by patients, GLP-1 RAs are recommended; AACE guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs in patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for glycemic control and to reduce risk of atherosclerotic CV disease and progression of albuminuria. GLP-1 RAs are generally preferred after consideration of several factors when selecting additional drugs to manage glycemia, such as patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR, and cost.

### Medications for gout and its comorbidities: mutual benefits? [^116sV6wp]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent literature with relevance to the management of multimorbid patients with gout, i.e., gout medication repurposed for comorbidities and vice versa.

Recent Findings

Adding to the previous success of interleukin-1 inhibition, two trials on low-dose colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrated potential benefits in patients with or without gout. In Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial, a composite CVD endpoint was reduced by 23% among patients who had experienced a recent myocardial infarction. In Low-Dose Colchicine 2, the composite CVD endpoint was reduced 31% among those with stable coronary artery disease. Use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for renal protection in patients without gout produced null results. Allopurinol did not benefit the glomerular filtration rate in two trials (Controlled trial of slowing of Kidney Disease progression From the Inhibition of Xanthine oxidase and Preventing Early Renal Function Loss) among patients with chronic kidney disease (with or without hyperuricemia, but not gout). SGLT-2 inhibitors, a medication recommended for patients with diabetes and CVD, diabetic kidney disease, or heart failure, demonstrated a protective effect against gout flares in a secondary trial analysis and a large observational study.

Summary

The role of colchicine may expand beyond gout flare prevention to patients with existing CVD. The renal benefit of ULT among patients with gout remains unclear. SGLT-2 inhibitors may benefit diabetic patients who have gout as a comorbidity.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: a position statement by kasralainy nephrology group (KANG) [^111BB4oq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a revolutionary drug class that delivers benefits exceeding those of diabetes management alone. Initially approved for type 2 diabetes management, research continually demonstrates their protective effects on kidney function across several nephrological conditions, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis-dependent kidney failure, anemia, metabolic bone disease, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), glomerulonephritis, and kidney transplantation.

Purpose

This study aims to identify how SGLT2 inhibitors modify nephrological care by investigating their mechanisms of action, therapeutic outcomes, and potential applications in multiple kidney diseases. It summarizes clinical trial data alongside mechanistic insights to provide a comprehensive assessment of therapeutic outcomes beyond diabetes mellitus.

Findings

Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with or without diabetes. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors provide kidney protection by enhancing tubuloglomerular feedback, improving renal blood flow, and reducing inflammation and ischemic tissue damage. They also provide cardiovascular benefits to dialysis patients while maintaining effective blood flow during dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) outside clinical trials. The potential impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone mineral health, particularly regarding bone mineral density (BMD) reduction and fracture risk, requires careful consideration, especially in patients with pre-existing bone health concerns. Kidney transplant recipients benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors' protective effects on kidney health and assistance with diabetes management; however, further research is needed on drug compatibility with immunosuppressants and infection prevention.

### Diabetes and gout: another role for SGLT2 inhibitors? [^113DdgGT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Thus, having emerged as agents to manage T2DM, particularly in people who are overweight, SGLT2 inhibitors have recently expanded their indications to include heart failure and CKD for people with or without diabetes. Because the lowering of serum urate by SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of existing treatments for hyperuricaemia and additive to such treatments, SGLT2 inhibitors offer an extra resource for the management of hyperuricaemia and symptomatic gout. Moreover, the opportunity for improved long-term control of serum urate is anticipated to further reduce the risk of CV and renal disease associated with hyperuricaemia. Also, the independent cardiorenal protection provided by an SGLT2 inhibitor should afford additional health gains for individuals with hyperuricaemic gout.

Treatment recommendations in relation to HF and renal benefits

The prevalence of renal impairment across diabetes CVOTs varied considerably, being particularly high in CARMELINA (linagliptin), hampering conclusions about how renal effects may compare between GLDs (Fig. 3 B). However, the totality of evidence from CVOTs and renal outcomes studies shows conclusively that patients with T2D experience superior renal benefits with SGLT2 inhibitors than with DPP-4 inhibitors and currently approved GLP-1 RAs.

Moreover, despite the limitations of CVOTs for assessing HF and renal outcomes, the evidence for HF and renal benefits with SGLT2 inhibitors was deemed sufficient by professional societies to update guidelines, even before the emergence of results from dedicated HF and renal studies. As such, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as either first add-on, concomitant to metformin, or as a monotherapy in patients with T2D and HF or CKD in guidelines that include the ADA and EASD joint Consensus Report on the Management of Hyperglycaemia 2019, the ADA's Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2022, the European Renal Association (ERA) — European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EDTA) 2019 guidelines, and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2020 guidelines on diabetes management in CKD (Figs. 2 C, 3 C).

Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Renal physiology of glucose handling and therapeutic implications [^116RVn4p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The rationale for using sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has evolved over the last decade. Due to the effects on glucosuria and body weight loss, SGLT2 inhibitors were originally approved for glycemic control in T2D. Since glucosuria is attenuated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 3–5, initial regulatory approval for SGLT2 inhibitor use was limited to patients with T2D and preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate. Over time, however, it has become increasingly apparent that these therapies have a variety of important pharmacodynamic and clinical effects beyond glycemic lowering, including antihypertensive and antialbuminuric properties, and the ability to reduce glomerular hypertension. Importantly, these sodium-related effects are preserved across CKD stages, despite attenuated glycemic effects, which are lost at CKD Stage 4. With the completion of cardiovascular (CV) outcome safety trials-EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program and DECLARE TIMI-58-in addition to reductions in CV events, SGLT2 inhibition consistently reduces hard renal endpoints. Importantly, these CV and renal effects are independent of glycemic control. Subsequent data from the recent CREDENCE trial-the first dedicated renal protection trial with SGLT-2 inhibition-demonstrated renal and CV benefits in albuminuric T2D patients, pivotal results that have expanded the clinical importance of these therapies. Ongoing trials will ultimately determine whether SGLT2 inhibition will have a role in renal protection in other clinical settings, including nondiabetic CKD and type 1 diabetes.

Conclusions

With the increase in the DM medications at the clinician's disposal comes an even greater responsibility to carry out more robust scrutiny and customized T2D management. Hence, given our present but still evolving knowledge about SUs, it has become increasingly clear that the newer-generation SUs have the same glucose-lowering potency as their predecessors. These newer-generation SUs are often superior to other drug classes in terms of speed in achieving in glycemic control, offer better protection against adverse cardiac and renal outcomes, and show low incidences of untoward side effects that can rival those of other DM drugs, making them the safer option among SUs. Most endocrinologists in the region, including the experts in this therapeutic area who were involved in the present consensus, are fully aware that not all SU drugs are the same, and continue to prescribe SUs — gliclazide MR specifically — as one of the top options for second-line treatment in patients with no known cardiovascular and renal diseases. Newer-generation SUs, specifically gliclazide MR and glimepiride, have been shown to be a cost-effective option for reducing the disease burden in T2D patients, providing efficient glycemic control, cardiovascular safety, and renal benefits, and are the preferred SUs for diabetes therapy during Ramadan. Lastly, despite the provision of universal health care coverage in the GCC, cost is always an issue to consider in the selection of medications. This is an additional advantage of SUs that sets them apart from newer agents for T2D management.

Integrated management of CMR disease

Since T2D, HF and CKD share a common pathophysiologic background and often coexist, adopting a holistic therapeutic strategy targeting CMR comorbidities would have a synergistic effect on patient health, resulting in significant outcome improvements. Data from large-scale clinical trials have consistently shown that the beneficial effects of novel glucose-lowering drugs, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), extend far beyond glycemic control, reducing important cardiovascular and renal endpoints in populations with T2D. Similarly, the selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist Finerenone has exhibited cardiorenal protective effects in individuals with T2D and CKD. The CMR abnormalities on which these classes of drugs have been shown to have favorable impact are summarized in Table 1. The putative mechanisms responsible for CMR benefits of these medications have been deeply revised elsewhere. Briefly, while SGLT2i are believed to exert cardiorenal protection prominently via a hemodynamic action sustained by their natriuretic and osmotic effects, anti-atherogenic and immune-modulating mechanisms may be responsible for GLP-1 RA-mediated protective effects. The novel bireceptor agonist Tirzepatide simultaneously activates two incretin-dependent pathways, and this duality acts synergistically on glycemic and weight control, significantly improving metabolic outcomes when compared to selective GLP-1 RA. On the other hand, Finerenone exerts its cardiorenal protection at a different level, targeting MR overactivation, a major pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic driver of cardiorenal complications in T2D.

Table 1
Medications with proven CMR benefits and their respective targeted CMR abnormalities. CMR, cardio-metabolic-renal; T2D, type 2 diabetes; HF, heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease

While SGLT2i are now popular drugs for the management of T2D, they appear to exert their beneficial effects against HF and ESKD largely independently from glycemic control. Indeed, protection from hospitalization for HF, as well as from the progression of CKD have been demonstrated even in people without diabetes. In addition, the glucose lowering capacity of SGLT2i reduces together with the decline in renal function, though the protection against ESKD is preserved until the later CKD stages. On the other side, the cardiovascular or renal benefits of GLP-1RA in non-diabetic individuals still needs to be demonstrated and mediation analyses found the change in HbA1c to be a predictor of the end-organ protection.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: a consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^115VJfVK]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

Methodology

The therapeutic strategies for managing CKD in people with T2DM using SGLT2i are presented in this consensus statement in the form of recommendations.

In order to generate these recommendations, we performed a literature search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases using combinations of the following key terms: "SGLT2i", "composite renal outcomes", "T2DM", "chronic kidney disease", "CKD", "Diabetes", "renoprotection", "eGFR", "ACR", "creatinine", "death", "mortality", and "nephropathy". Key experts in the field of endocrinology and nephrology critically reviewed the results presented in the literature, and the recommendations were developed. The type of source evidence, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analysis of RCTs, and nonrandomized controlled trials, were mapped for each of the recommendations. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology Protocol guidelines were used to assess the quality of evidence. The recommendations were reviewed once again and modified to incorporate the clinical practice experience to generate the consensus recommendations presented here.

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^113DKG2Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with DKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antihyperglycemic drugs form the mainstay of DKD management and aim to restrict progression to more severe stages of DKD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) control hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption in addition to preventing inflammation, thereby improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress; consequently, this class of prescription medicines is emerging as an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE TIMI 58, and CANVAS trials demonstrated the renoprotective effects of SGLT2i, such as restricting decline in glomerular filtration rate, in the progression of albuminuria, and in death due to renal causes. The renoprotection provided by SGLT2i was further confirmed in the CREDENCE study, which showed a 30% reduction in progression of chronic kidney disease, and in the DELIGHT study, which demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria with dapagliflozin compared with placebo (− 21.0%, confidence interval [CI] − 34.1 to − 5.2, p = 0.011). Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (relative risk 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; p = 0.0019) and a 45% risk reduction in worsening of renal function, end-stage renal disease, or renal death (hazard ratio 0.55, CI 0.48–0.64, p < 0.0001) with SGLT2i, irrespective of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Thus, there is emerging evidence that SGLT2i may be used to curb the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with DKD. However, clinicians need to effectively select candidates for SGLT2i therapy. In this consensus statement, we have qualitatively synthesized evidence demonstrating the renal effects of SGLT2i and proposed recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i to effectively manage and delay progression of DKD.

### Barriers to early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for renal protection: a comprehensive review and call to action [^1163nfiX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 13% of people globally, including 20%-48% with type 2 diabetes (T2D), resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. There is an urgent need to increase early screening and intervention for CKD. We are experts in diabetology and nephrology in Central Europe and Israel. Herein, we review evidence supporting the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for kidney protection and discuss barriers to early CKD diagnosis and treatment, including in our respective countries. SGLT2 inhibitors exert cardiorenal protective effects, demonstrated in the renal outcomes trials (EMPA-KIDNEY, DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE) of empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin in patients with CKD. EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated cardiorenal efficacy across the broadest renal range, regardless of T2D status. Renoprotective evidence also comes from large real-world studies. International guidelines recommend first-line SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2D and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20mL/min/1.73m 2, and that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may also be administered if required for additional glucose control. Although these guidelines recommend at least annual eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio screening for patients with T2D, observational studies suggest that only half are screened. Diagnosis is hampered by asymptomatic early CKD and under-recognition among patients with T2D and clinicians, including limited knowledge/use of guidelines and resources. Based on our experience and on the literature, we recommend robust screening programmes, potentially with albuminuria self-testing, and SGLT2 inhibitor reimbursement at general practitioner (GP) and specialist levels. High-tech tools (artificial intelligence, smartphone apps, etc.) are providing exciting opportunities to identify high-risk individuals, self-screen, detect abnormalities in images, and assist with prescribing and treatment adherence. Better education is also needed, alongside provision of concise guidelines, enabling GPs to identify who would benefit from early initiation of renoprotective therapy; although, regardless of current renal function, cardiorenal protection is provided by SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

Type 2 diabetes with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA renal guidance: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults with kidney failure have DM, and SGLT2 inhibitors show an approximately 38% reduction in composite adverse renal outcomes; use of an SGLT2i with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy to reduce progression of DKD and CV risk for persons with T2D and DKD with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² if HF is also present. Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Renal effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic drugs: clinical relevance and potential risks [^1141btti]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease affecting an increasing percentage of general population worldwide. Patients with T2DM are frequently characterized by impaired renal function, primarily as a result of diabetic kidney injury, but also by other contributing factors, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and medications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors have emerged as a new, promising class of antidiabetic agents with actions that seem to extend beyond their hypoglycemic effect.

### Editorial: the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^117KWjtd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

These initial signals of potential kidney protective effects are now confirmed in large cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials. Since 2015, three cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high-cardiovascular risk demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibition causes a profound reduction in the rate of kidney function decline. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes and Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation trial, which was specifically designed to test the kidney protective effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, demonstrated that in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CKD, canagliflozin substantially reduces the risk of major kidney outcomes.

This supplement of Nephrology Dialysis and Transplantation (NDT) aims to provide a series of comprehensive and up-to-date reviews on recent advances in the field of SGLT2 inhibition. Cherney et al. summarize recent studies that have shown that the kidney-specific benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are unlikely mediated by improving glycaemic control but are most likely a result of multiple non-glycaemic effects directly or indirectly related to increased natriuresis. Specifically, they review recent clinical and experimental studies that used in vivo intrarenal imaging to show that the restoration of TGF during SGLT2 inhibition is dependent on adenosine signalling.

Given the multiple mechanisms of action, it is important to address the position of SGLT2 inhibitors in the pharmacotherapeutic management of patients with type 1 diabetes or patients without type 2 diabetes. In this NDT supplement, Bjornstad and van Raalte review the pathophysiology and treatment of CKD in patients with type 1 diabetes. They review the results of three large clinical trial programmes on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes that reported haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reductions of ∼0.4% with SGLT2 inhibition compared with control treatment. Unfortunately, long-term clinical trials in this patient population have not been performed and thus the effects on important patient outcomes are unknown. However, in a pooled analysis of two clinical trials it was shown that sotagliflozin reduces albuminuria and blood pressure and causes an acute decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that renoprotective mechanisms in patients with type 1 diabetes are similar as those observed in type 2 diabetes.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

### Overcoming disparities in using SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal protection in persons with and without type 2 diabetes [^115BL3Nb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Disparities in the Use of SGLT2i in People With CKD

Diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States and across the globe. For more than 3 decades, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors remained the cornerstone (and the only option) for the management of kidney disease. Several clinical trials in both diabetic and nondiabetic CKD have demonstrated the benefits of SGLT2i on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes over the past few years. Several landmark studies including CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD, have shown the additive benefit of SGLT2i in the presence of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use. In addition, the recently released FLOW CKD trial demonstrated the benefits of semaglutide on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in those with preexisting CKD. Therefore, the 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice management guidelines for CKD recommended the use of SGLT2i and GLP-RA to confer protection on the kidneys and cardiovascular system. Specifically, SGLT2i is currently recommended for all diabetic and nondiabetic adults with albuminuria and an eGFR greater than 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Other societies such as the American Diabetes Association have issued similar recommendations supporting the use of these agents and recommend SGLT2i in individuals with T2D with ASCVD or indicators of high CVD risk, CKD 3 to 5 or albuminuria, regardless of HbA1c levels or background use of metformin.

Despite clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of SGLT2i, similar to other chronic conditions discussed previously, their use remains suboptimal compounded by significant disparities in their access and use. In a recent study, we examined the factors associated with SGLT2i prescription, disparities by race and sex, and facility-level variation in prescription patterns among the US veteran population. Among the 174 443 patients with CKD, T2D, and CVD, only 11.5% were prescribed an SGLT2i. Black or African American patients had lower odds of receiving SGLT2i compared to White patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.87 [95% CI 0.83–0.91]) and women were less likely to be prescribed these medications than men (OR = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.52–0.67]). Additionally, substantial variation in SGLT2i prescription patterns was observed across Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, with disparities evident across all racial groups. These findings highlight the low prescription rates among eligible patients, with marked disparities by race, sex, and VA facility.

### Glucose targets for preventing diabetic kidney disease and its progression [^1161Ecuc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) around the world. Blood pressure lowering and glucose control are used to reduce diabetes-associated disability including kidney failure. However there is a lack of an overall evidence summary of the optimal target range for blood glucose control to prevent kidney failure.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intensive (HbA1c < 7% or fasting glucose levels < 120 mg/dL versus standard glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7% or fasting glucose levels ≥ 120 mg/dL for preventing the onset and progression of kidney disease among adults with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 31 March 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating glucose-lowering interventions in which people (aged 14 year or older) with type 1 or 2 diabetes with and without kidney disease were randomly allocated to tight glucose control or less stringent blood glucose targets.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risks of bias, extracted data and checked the processes for accuracy. Outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular complications, doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), ESKD and proteinuria. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 29,319 people with diabetes were included and 11 studies involving 29,141 people were included in our meta-analyses. Treatment duration was 56.7 months on average (range 6 months to 10 years). Studies included people with a range of kidney function. Incomplete reporting of key methodological details resulted in uncertain risks of bias in many studies. Using GRADE assessment, we had moderate confidence in the effects of glucose lowering strategies on ESKD, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and progressive protein leakage by kidney disease and low or very low confidence in effects of treatment on death related to cardiovascular complications and doubling of serum creatinine (SCr). For the primary outcomes, tight glycaemic control may make little or no difference to doubling of SCr compared with standard control (4 studies, 26,874 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11; I² = 73%, low certainty evidence), development of ESKD (4 studies, 23,332 participants: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.12; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (9 studies, 29,094 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.13; I² = 50%; moderate certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (6 studies, 23,673 participants: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.92; I² = 85%; low certainty evidence), or sudden death (4 studies, 5913 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; I² = 85%; very low certainty evidence). People who received treatment to achieve tighter glycaemic control probably experienced lower risks of non-fatal myocardial infarction (5 studies, 25,596 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; I² = 46%, moderate certainty evidence), onset of microalbuminuria (4 studies, 19,846 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93; I² = 61%, moderate certainty evidence), and progression of microalbuminuria (5 studies, 13,266 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93; I² = 75%, moderate certainty evidence). In absolute terms, tight versus standard glucose control treatment in 1,000 adults would lead to between zero and two people avoiding non-fatal myocardial infarction, while seven adults would avoid experiencing new-onset albuminuria and two would avoid worsening albuminuria.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that people who receive intensive glycaemic control for treatment of diabetes had comparable risks of kidney failure, death and major cardiovascular events as people who received less stringent blood glucose control, while experiencing small clinical benefits on the onset and progression of microalbuminuria and myocardial infarction. The adverse effects of glycaemic management are uncertain. Based on absolute treatment effects, the clinical impact of targeting an HbA1c < 7% or blood glucose < 6.6 mmol/L is unclear and the potential harms of this treatment approach are largely unmeasured.

### Key results from observational studies and real-world evidence of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor effectiveness and safety in reducing cardio-renal risk [^113snog1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally designed to manage blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), have emerged as a crucial class of drugs for managing cardio-renal diseases. These drugs work by targeting the SGLT2 protein in the kidneys, promoting the excretion of glucose and influencing metabolic pathways beyond glucose control. The relationship between cardio-renal diseases and SGLT2 inhibitors has been explored through landmark trials and real-world evidence (RWE) studies, demonstrating significant reductions in cardio-renal complications. This review discusses the importance of RWE studies alongside randomized controlled trials in understanding the real-world effectiveness and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. It outlines the advantages and disadvantages of RWE compared to RCTs, highlighting their complementary roles in providing comprehensive insights into treatment outcomes. By examining a range of RWE studies, the review underscores the cardio-renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors across various patient populations. Safety assessments indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, with severe adverse events being rare. Common issues, such as genital mycotic infections and urinary tract infections, are acknowledged, alongside less frequent but significant adverse events including diabetic ketoacidosis, lower-limb amputations, and bone fractures. In summary, SGLT2 inhibitors show promising cardio-renal protective effects in real-world scenarios across diverse populations in T2D, indicating their potential as early intervention measures. Continued research is essential for gaining a thorough understanding of their long-term effects and safety profiles.

### The new biology of diabetic kidney disease-mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^113BqM9y]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease remains the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the world. Despite reductions in incidence rates of myocardial infarction and stroke in people with diabetes over the past 3 decades, the risk of diabetic kidney disease has remained unchanged, and may even be increasing in younger individuals afflicted with this disease. Accordingly, changes in public health policy have to be implemented to address the root causes of diabetic kidney disease, including the rise of obesity and diabetes, in addition to the use of safe and effective pharmacological agents to prevent cardiorenal complications in people with diabetes. The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapies that are either in clinical practice or that are emerging in clinical development programs for potential use to treat diabetic kidney disease.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^116bWx9U]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering drugs that have beneficial effects on blood pressure and bodyweight, indirectly exerting renoprotection. They also reduce albuminuria and are postulated to have direct hemodynamic effects on the kidney. Large-scale CV outcome trials (CVOTs) of SGLT2i, conducted to meet regulatory requirements and ensure CV safety, have shown promising effects on a range of albuminuria and kidney outcomes in the populations studied.

With this background, in this consensus statement, we discuss the treatment approaches and the role of SGLT2i in managing as well as delaying the progression of DKD in people with T2DM.

As the SGLT2-i therapy progressively carves out a forte in the management of diabetes, multiple equally significant questions justly occupy the medical mind. Aspects pertinent to the influence of this therapy on the renal pathophysiology, the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and considerations for their safe use, hold immense relevance to clinical practice. This review attempts to make an appropriate clinical interpretation of the existing evidence, to evolve a practical perspective on some of these yet unanswered aspects.

### Comparison of the renal outcomes of novel antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114KhMVU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the renal outcomes of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with chronic renal disease (CKD).

Materials and Methods

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through July 2025 for randomized controlled trials with ≥ 24weeks of follow-up in patients with T2DM and CKD. Outcomes included composite renal outcome, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). A network meta-analysis was conducted, and the certainty of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation used to evaluate evidence certainty (GRADE).

Results

Twenty RCTs enrolling 80,670 participants were included. Compared with placebo, several agents significantly reduced composite renal outcomes, with dapagliflozin 10mg showing the greatest efficacy (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42–0.72; high-certainty evidence), followed by canagliflozin, empagliflozin, efpeglenatide, sotagliflozin 400mg, semaglutide, and dulaglutide 1.5mg. Canagliflozin 100–300mg significantly reduced UACR, whereas dapagliflozin had no effect. None of the novel antidiabetic agents significantly altered eGFR. Certainty of evidence ranged from high for placebo-controlled comparisons to low or very low for indirect estimates.

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors provide the most consistent renal protection, while GLP-1 receptor agonists offer additional but variable benefits. Dapagliflozin showed the greatest efficacy, and canagliflozin most strongly reduced albuminuria, highlighting meaningful heterogeneity across agents. DPP-4 inhibitors conferred no renal benefit. Overall, evidence from placebo-controlled trials was robust, whereas certainty was lower for indirect estimates, highlighting the need for drug-specific evaluation in clinical practice.

### Benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAAS-I) versus SGLT2-is alone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1121mjrn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.4 Implications of findings

Our overall study findings show that the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors may have similar cardiovascular and renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with SGLT2 inhibitors alone. There is a likelihood that the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors may be superior compared to SGLT2‐Is alone in the prevention of renal deterioration in addition to improving body weight and blood pressure, though further data are needed to confirm this. With the rapid increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes globally because of increasingly poor lifestyle choices, morbidity and deaths attributable to diabetes will experience a steep increase. A large armamentarium of therapeutic options is urgently needed for the management of type 2 diabetes. For the last two decades, pharmacological inhibition of the RAAS using RAAS‐Is has been the major focus for the management of diabetes nephropathy, which has been associated with good results. The RAAS‐Is have also been used for their cardioprotective effects. Previous studies have shown that combined therapy of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors is superior to RAAS‐I therapy alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. Taken, the overall results together suggest that SGLT2 inhibition has superior cardio and reno‐protective effects over RAAS inhibition in type 2 diabetes treatment. The use of SGLT2 inhibition as a first line therapy in type 2 diabetes or its early use in the prevention of renal deterioration and cardiovascular complications in addition to its glycaemic control deserves further study. The absence of a significant benefit of the combination of SGLT2‐I and RAAS‐Is on both composite cardiovascular outcome and composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization leaves room for the use of only SGLT2‐Is in populations that may be struggling with polypharmacy and de‐prescribing of some agents necessary. In these situations, the use of only SGLT2‐Is could yield similar outcomes as the combination.

Antidiabetics with Cardio-Renal Benefits

While DPP-4 inhibitors have not been shown to reduce hospitalization for HF or CV events in patients with T2D, novel antidiabetic agents like SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA have been proven to have cardio-renal benefits in robust evidence-based clinical trials. However, unlike SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA has been shown to have a neutral effect on hospitalization due to HF. Tables 1 and 2 summarize evidence from T2D-dedicated randomized clinical trials that show beneficial effects of those therapeutic classes on CV and renal outcomes, with a reduction of hospitalization due to HF. In particular, the benefits of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in lowering the risks of CV events, hospitalization due to HF, and all-cause mortality in patients with T2D have also been evidenced through real-world studies in routine clinical care. Interestingly, the cardio-renal benefits of these two agents extend beyond the risks of T2D, as they are now indicated for the management of HF regardless of the patient's T2D status. In addition, dapagliflozin is indicated for the management of CKD regardless of the patient's T2D status, while canagliflozin is indicated for the management of CKD in patients with T2D. And although not approved as anti-hypertensive agents, SGLT2i have shown to significantly reduce systolic BP by 4 to 10 mmHg.

### Non-linear relationship between urinary creatinine and diabetic kidney disease: implications for clinical practice [^116spWXA]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, and hypertension, several unadjusted factors may influence the observed relationship. For instance, the use of ACE inhibitors or diuretics could impact urinary creatinine excretion and confound the association between UCr and DKD. Furthermore, longer duration of diabetes is known to increase DKD risk, and the presence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease could also influence kidney function. Although we did not fully adjust for these factors, we believe that our large sample size and rigorous methodology mitigate the potential for significant confounding bias. However, future research should consider more comprehensive data collection on medication use, diabetes duration, and the prevalence of various comorbidities to provide a more nuanced understanding.

In discussing the treatment and management strategies for DKD, it is important to highlight the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, incretin-related drugs such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). These drugs have been demonstrated in several clinical studies to slow the progression of DKD. Firstly, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown protective effects on the glomerular endothelium damaged by diabetes, although this effect might be inhibited by the activation of PKCβ. Additionally, incretin-based therapy is widely recognized for its benefits in preventing vascular complications associated with diabetes. Secondly, SGLT2 inhibitors not only alleviate renal burden by lowering blood glucose levels but also provide renal protection by reducing intraglomerular pressure and mitigating inflammatory pathways. Moreover, MRAs such as finerenone have shown efficacy in improving renal outcomes in diabetic patients with low eGFR. Overall, existing and emerging therapeutic strategies confer renal protection through various mechanisms, and an optimal combination of these medications might enhance therapeutic benefits for high-risk patients.

### Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors for prevention and treatment of cardiorenal complications of type 2 diabetes [^113EfrRK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease

Up to 40% of individuals of the US adult diabetic population have some form of kidney disease. In 4 outcome trials (EMPA-REG, CANVAS, DECLARE and CREDENCE), SGLT-2i reduced by 33% the risk of dialysis, transplantation or death due to kidney disease, reduced by 35% ESKD and by 25% acute kidney injury. The benefits were consistent across studies and for all eGFR subgroups, including participants with a baseline eGFR 30–45 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Moreover, in the DAPA-CKD trial, which assessed the effect of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD, with or without T2D, the primary outcome (a composite of a sustained decline in the eGFR of at least 50%, ESKD, or death from renal or CV causes) was reduced by 39% (HR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72, P < 0.001).

At the present, SGLT2-i, at least empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, are the glucose-lowering agents that are associated with the most impressive overall renal protection, with a positive combined effect on albuminuria, eGFR decline and progression to ESKD within the context of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade therapy. Treatment with these SGLT-2i could be useful for early as well as late prevention of DKD. On the other hand, both VERTIS-CV trial with ertugliflozin and SCORED trial with sotagliflozin failed to show any significant effect on kidney endpoints, casting some doubt about a class effect of SGLT-2i for renal protection.

### Defining the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in primary care: time to think differently [^116NRvui]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, are now widely approved antihyperglycaemic therapies that can reduce glucose levels independent of insulin, when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is sufficient. Their main mechanism of action is the inhibition of SGLT2 function which results in a reduction of glucose absorption from the glomerular filtrate in the proximal renal tubule, and an increase in urinary glucose excretion (Fig. 1). Given their glucose-lowering effects, SGLT2is were firstly licensed as treatments for the management of glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and as such are increasingly employed for this purpose in primary care. Beyond the glucose control benefits, in recent years there has been a wealth of evidence indicating that SGLT2is exert cardiac and renal protective effects across the cardiorenal metabolic continuum.

Fig. 1
SGLT2 inhibitor cardiorenal metabolic effects. The figure summarizes main mechanisms of action and beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors across the cardiorenal metabolic spectrum, including reduction of CV events, renal protection, and improvement of metabolic control in diabetes. CKD chronic kidney disease, CV cardiovascular, CVD cardiovascular disease, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, ESKD end-stage kidney disease, HbA1c glycated haemoglobin, HHF hospitalisation for heart failure, MACE major adverse cardiovascular event, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus

This has led to new treatment paradigms for SGLT2is including secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease and delaying progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with T2DM, as well as managing heart failure (HF) and CKD, regardless of the presence of diabetes.

The mechanisms behind the CV and renal protection associated with SGLT2is are likely to be multifactorial and are not yet fully elucidated. However, it has been suggested that osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, with subsequent reduction in volume overload and reduced blood pressure, together with a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration, may play a role. In addition, metabolic effects (e.g. increases in glucosuria and reductions in HbA1c, glucotoxicity, weight gain and adiposity), improved cardiac remodelling, cardiac contractility and ion-homeostasis, as well as reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress are also likely to contribute to the observed cardiorenal benefits (Fig. 1).

### Renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a review of cardiovascular and renal outcome trials [^1167eM7M]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is commonplace, and is frequently associated with a significant and unfavourable impact on patient outcomes along with a substantial economic burden. With the development of novel classes of drug therapies in diabetes, there has been a recent focus on cardiovascular safety measures, with dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) carried out for all new diabetes medications. More recently, there has been a growing regulatory view that such trials should report more specific renal outcomes to ensure simpler comparability between drugs and drug classes. This article explores some of the possible mechanisms by which these drugs may improve renal function in people with diabetes, and it reviews important CVOTs that have reported renal outcomes to date. These include CVOTS of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, CANVAS study, CREDENCE trial, DECLARE-TIMI trial and DAPA-HF study), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (EXAMINE trial, SAVOR-TIMI 53, TECOS trial and CARMELINA trial) and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues (ELIXA trial, LEADER trial, SUSTAIN-6 trial, PIONEER-6 trial, EXSCEL trial, HARMONY Outcomes study and the REWIND study). Ongoing cardiovascular and renal outcome studies such as Dapa-CKD, EMPA-KIDNEY, EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPEROR-Reduced are also discussed. The heterogeneity of patient characteristics and reported renal outcomes, which hinders comparisons between trials and drug classes, is highlighted. Novel classes of diabetes therapies present an important opportunity for nephroprotection beyond the blockade of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in this high-risk group. Clinicians should be aware of such benefits when prescribing these medications for people with, and possibly those without, type 2 diabetes.

### Renoprotective effect of enalapril in diabetic patients… [^115R9aSU]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The long-term effects of poorly controlled diabetes are well known and have a significant adverse impact on the quality of life of those affected. One such adverse effect is diabetic nephropathy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to have a renoprotective effect in hypertensive patients with diabetes. Although evidence indicates that diabetic nephropathy cannot be cured, persuasive data exist indicating that its clinical course can be modified by tighter control of blood glucose levels, lifestyle modifications and normalization of blood pressure. Ahmad and colleagues conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the long-term efficacy of enalapril in reducing the progression of microalbuminuria to clinical albuminuria in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study included 103 nonobese, normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes who were followed for five years.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 10 mg enalapril daily. Albumin excretion, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, HbA. 1, serum creatinine, and serum and urinary electrolytes in 24-hour urine samples were checked every three to four months. In patients who received enalapril, albumin excretion decreased from a mean of 55 mg per minute at baseline to 20 mg per minute after five years; in the placebo group, albumin excretion increased from a mean of 53 mg per minute at baseline to 85 mg per minute after five years. Within five years, 7. 7 percent of enalapril-treated patients and
23. 5 percent of placebo-treated patients progressed to clinical albuminuria. This study corroborates previous evidence of the renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and persistent microalbuminuria.

The authors conclude that normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria experienced a significant reduction in urinary protein excretion that should slow the progression to end-stage renal disease. editor's note: Physicians should screen patients with diabetes for diabetic nephropathy according to the guidelines published by the American Diabetes Association and prescribe ACE inhibitors for normotensive diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. — j. n.

### Metformin or sulfonylurea use in kidney disease… [^114uqKz2]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Monotherapy treatment with metformin, compared with a sulfonylurea, was associated with a lower risk of MACE among patients with diabetes and reduced kidney function. Importance Before 2016, safety concerns limited metformin use in patients with kidney disease; however, the effectiveness of metformin on clinical outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function remains unknown. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with diabetes and reduced kidney function persisting with monotherapy, treatment with metformin, compared with a sulfonylurea, was associated with a lower risk of MACE. Large clinical trials that investigated diabetes treatment effects on cardiovascular outcomes excluded patients with reduced eGFR, rendering this population understudied.

2, 5, 9–12 The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that among patients with diabetes who develop reduced kidney function, continued metformin use is associated with lower risk of fatal or nonfatal major adverse cardiovascular events than sulfonylureas. For smaller subgroups, HR confidence intervals were wide. Among patients with diabetes who developed reduced kidney function, persistent use of metformin compared with sulfonylurea use was associated with a decreased hazard of MACE. This study and the results add to the limited observational evidence for the beneficial association of metformin compared with sulfonylurea and cardiovascular outcomes among those who develop reduced kidney function.
32. The second study was conducted in the United States by Masoudi et al39 and examined heart failure readmission in patients with reduced kidney function. They demonstrated lower readmission risk for metformin compared with sulfonylurea or insulin use. The current study adds to the body of evidence from these 2 prior studies by examining important cardiovascular outcomes in a large population who persisted with their initial diabetes treatment once they reached reduced kidney function threshold. Among patients with diabetes and reduced kidney function persisting with monotherapy, treatment with metformin, compared with a sulfonylurea, was associated with a lower risk of MACE.

### Antihypertensive agents for prevention of diabetic nephropathy… [^115Z9rxC]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are the only antihypertensive agents with proven effectiveness for the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy caused by type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, ACE inhibitors have not been shown to decrease all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes. Based on limited data, ACE inhibitors have not been shown to reduce end-stage renal disease significantly when compared with placebo.

1. The review clearly identified ACE inhibitors as having the most substantial evidence for their usefulness in preventing diabetic nephropathy compared with placebo. It also demonstrated that, compared with calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors reduced progression to microalbuminuria but did not reduce all-cause mortality. The few data available do not show a significant reduction in end-stage renal disease with ACE inhibitor therapy.

The number of patients with diabetes who need to be treated with an ACE inhibitor to prevent microalbuminuria in one patient is 25. Cochrane Abstract Background. Twenty to 60 percent of patients with diabetes are affected by hypertension, and antihypertensive agents are used to treat this condition. These agents also are used to prevent the onset of kidney disease in patients with diabetes who are normotensive or hypertensive. Objectives To evaluate the comparative effects of antihypertensive agents in patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria. Primary Results. Sixteen trials were identified, six of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus placebo, six of ACE inhibitors versus calcium channel blockers, one of ACE inhibitors versus calcium channel blockers or combined ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, and three of ACE inhibitors versus other agents.

Compared with calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors significantly reduced progression to microalbuminuria. Reviewers' Conclusions. A significant reduction in the risk of developing microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria has been demonstrated for ACE inhibitors only. It appears that the effect of ACE inhibitors is independent of baseline blood pressure, renal function, and type of diabetes, but data are too sparse to be confident that these are not important effect modifiers, and an individual patient data meta-analysis is required.

### ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy can prevent diabetic kidney disease… [^116g9fsX]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Use of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy reduces progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with diabetic kidney disease. 1 Neither ACE inhibitor nor ARB therapy has been associated with reduced all-cause or cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo in patients with diabetic nephropathy. PRACTICE POINTERS Family physicians routinely treat patients with diabetes and kidney disease.

Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy, is defined by the presence of persistent albuminuria on two separate occasions at least 3 months apart in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, with or without a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. 1, 2 Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease globally and is highly associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. 2 End-stage kidney disease is defined as requiring kidney replacement therapy or kidney transplantation. 3 As a precursor to overt diabetic nephropathy, microalbuminuria is presented in this review as an important early indicator and clinical outcome pertinent to diabetic kidney disease.
