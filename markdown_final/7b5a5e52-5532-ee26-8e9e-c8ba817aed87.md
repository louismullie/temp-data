## Question

In an older, clinically stable patient hospitalized with acute MI and anemia, would you favor a restrictive transfusion strategy based on REALITY, and what outcomes should you expect over 30 days?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a restrictive transfusion strategy is favored in an older, clinically stable patient hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and anemia, and what outcomes to expect over 30 days based on REALITY. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and how it maps to the REALITY trial population. Then, I should verify the trial design, interventions, and primary outcome. Next, I will examine the results and whether noninferiority was met and what that means clinically. After that, I need to check safety signals and subgroup considerations, including age and stability. Finally, I will integrate guideline context and synthesize a practical recommendation with expected 30-day outcomes and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario alignment. REALITY enrolled adults with acute myocardial infarction and hemoglobin between 7 and 10 g/dL, excluding shock, ongoing massive bleeding, recent transfusion, and malignant hematologic disease; the median age was 77 years, which fits an older, clinically stable patient without hemodynamic compromise, so the external validity for this case is strong [^40d8bbe2] [^e291a49f].

> I need to verify the intervention arms. The restrictive strategy transfused only when hemoglobin was 8 g/dL or lower with a target of 8–10 g/dL, whereas the liberal strategy transfused when hemoglobin was 10 g/dL or lower with a target of at least 11 g/dL; strategies were maintained until discharge or 30 days, which frames the 30-day outcome horizon we are discussing [^40d8bbe2] [^6be224ef].

> Next, I should review the primary outcome and analytic approach. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, stroke, recurrent MI, or emergency revascularization at 30 days, analyzed as a noninferiority comparison with a one-sided 97.5% CI and a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25 for the relative risk; I should confirm that both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were reported and that the adjudication was blinded to allocation, which they were [^40d8bbe2] [^9cf33101].

> Now, let me examine the results carefully. MACE at 30 days occurred in 11.0% with restrictive versus 14.0% with liberal strategies, yielding a relative risk of 0.79 with a one-sided 97.5% CI upper bound of 1.19, which meets the prespecified noninferiority criterion; importantly, the absolute difference was −3.0% with a 95% CI that included zero, so noninferiority does not imply proven superiority of restrictive therapy, and the confidence interval also includes potential harm up to about a 19% relative increase, which I should keep in mind [^40d8bbe2] [^e291a49f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the component outcomes and safety. All-cause death was 5.6% restrictive versus 7.7% liberal, recurrent MI 2.1% versus 3.1%, emergency revascularization 1.5% versus 1.9%, and stroke 0.6% versus 0.6%, with no statistically significant differences in individual components; transfusion exposure was markedly lower in the restrictive arm, which is expected and operationally relevant, but this does not by itself establish clinical superiority [^40d8bbe2] [^e291a49f].

> I should confirm age-related considerations. REALITY's median age was 77, and while the trial was not powered for age-stratified outcomes, the population is representative of older adults; broader meta-analytic data in older patients suggest that restrictive strategies may be associated with higher mortality in some settings, but those data are not specific to AMI and should be interpreted cautiously here, so I need to avoid overgeneralization while acknowledging uncertainty in the very elderly [^44fdea67] [^40d8bbe2].

> Next, I should review the guideline context to ensure my interpretation aligns with evolving standards. The 2023 AABB guideline, published after REALITY, declined to recommend for or against restrictive versus liberal thresholds in AMI, citing insufficient evidence; however, the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline issued a 2b recommendation that transfusion to achieve hemoglobin at least 10 g/dL may be reasonable in ACS with anemia, reflecting concern for potential harm with restrictive thresholds in this population, which tempers enthusiasm for a purely restrictive approach despite REALITY's noninferiority finding [^372343b4] [^f4409116] [^57ba0f40].

> Let me synthesize the clinical meaning. REALITY demonstrates that a restrictive strategy with an 8 g/dL trigger is noninferior to a 10 g/dL liberal strategy for 30-day MACE in older, stable AMI patients, with fewer transfusions and no excess stroke or bleeding signal; however, the trial was underpowered for superiority and the confidence interval allows for clinically important harm, so a restrictive approach is acceptable but not definitively superior, and shared decision-making is prudent, especially in patients with ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or frailty [^40d8bbe2] [^e291a49f].

> I should now translate this into expected 30-day outcomes. In an older, stable AMI patient managed with a restrictive strategy, the expected MACE rate at 30 days is about 11% based on REALITY, with approximately 5.6% mortality, 2.1% recurrent MI, 1.5% emergency revascularization, and 0.6% stroke; compared with a liberal strategy, the absolute risk difference is about 3% lower for MACE, though the 95% CI crosses zero, so the true effect could be smaller or even slightly unfavorable in some patients [^40d8bbe2] [^e291a49f].

> But wait, what if the patient has evolving ischemia or heart failure? I need to ensure I incorporate clinical context. REALITY excluded shock and massive bleeding, and contemporary guidance suggests that in ACS with anemia, a more liberal threshold around 10 g/dL may be reasonable when there are signs of ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic instability, or heart failure, so a blanket restrictive approach may not be optimal in those subgroups despite the trial's noninferiority result [^f4409116] [^57ba0f40].

> Final recommendation: Yes, in an older, clinically stable patient with acute MI and anemia, a restrictive transfusion strategy with an 8 g/dL trigger is reasonable based on REALITY's noninferiority for 30-day MACE and reduced transfusion exposure, with expected outcomes of roughly 11% MACE and 5.6% mortality at 30 days; however, I should confirm there is no ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or hemodynamic compromise, and if present, consider a more liberal approach targeting hemoglobin around 10 g/dL in line with current ACS guidance, documenting shared decision-making given the uncertainty and the confidence interval that includes potential harm [^40d8bbe2] [^f4409116] [^57ba0f40].

---

In older, clinically stable patients with acute MI and anemia, a **restrictive transfusion strategy** (trigger ≤ 8 g/dL) is reasonable and supported by REALITY [^40d8bbe2], which showed noninferior 30-day MACE versus a liberal strategy (≤ 10 g/dL) [^e291a49f]. Expected 30-day outcomes include **MACE ~11%** (death ~5.6%, recurrent MI ~2.1%, stroke ~0.6%, emergency revascularization ~1.5%) and fewer transfusions (~1.0 vs ~2.3 units) [^40d8bbe2]. However, MINT [^04add051] suggested possible harm with restrictive thresholds, so decisions should be individualized to symptoms, ischemia, and comorbidities, and transfusion is appropriate for hemodynamic compromise or refractory ischemia despite medical therapy [^f4409116].

## Evidence from REALITY trial

- **Design**: multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial in 35 hospitals in France and Spain [^40d8bbe2].
- **Population**: 668 patients ≥ 18 years with acute MI and hemoglobin 7–10 g/dL; median age 77 years [^40d8bbe2].
- **Interventions**: restrictive (transfuse if ≤ 8 g/dL; target 8–10 g/dL) vs liberal (transfuse if ≤ 10 g/dL; target ≥ 11 g/dL) [^40d8bbe2].
- **Primary outcome**: 30-day MACE (death, stroke, recurrent MI, emergency revascularization) [^40d8bbe2].

### Key results

| **Outcome** | **Restrictive strategy** | **Liberal strategy** | **Relative risk (95% ci)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MACE at 30 days | 11.0% (36/342) | 14.0% (45/324) | 0.79 (0.00–1.19) [^40d8bbe2] |
| All-cause death | 5.6% (19/342) | 7.7% (25/324) | 0.73 (0.41–1.30) [^40d8bbe2] |
| Recurrent MI | 2.1% (7/342) | 3.1% (10/324) | 0.68 (0.27–1.72) [^40d8bbe2] |
| Stroke | 0.6% (2/342) | 0.6% (2/324) | 1.00 (0.14–7.14) [^40d8bbe2] |
| Emergency revascularization | 1.5% (5/342) | 1.9% (6/324) | 0.79 (0.24–2.58) [^40d8bbe2] |
| Mean RBC units transfused | 1.0 unit | 2.3 units | N/A [^40d8bbe2] |

---

The restrictive strategy met **noninferiority** for 30-day MACE and reduced transfusions by ~57% [^40d8bbe2]. Individual components trended lower but were not statistically significant, likely due to sample size [^40d8bbe2].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Noninferiority**: restrictive transfusion is noninferior to liberal transfusion for 30-day MACE in older, stable AMI patients with anemia [^40d8bbe2].
- **Reduced transfusions**: restrictive strategy significantly reduces transfusion exposure and resource use [^40d8bbe2].
- **Individualization**: decisions should consider symptoms, ischemia severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^f4409116].
- **Exceptions**: transfuse at higher thresholds for hemodynamic instability, ongoing ischemia, or refractory symptoms despite medical therapy [^f4409116].

---

## Conflicting evidence and guidelines

- **MINT trial**: suggested possible harm with restrictive thresholds (higher 30-day death/MI), though not statistically significant [^04add051] [^fcd1ed34].
- **Guidelines**: AABB 2023 [^372343b4] offers no firm recommendation for AMI; ACC/AHA 2025 suggests a liberal strategy may be reasonable in ACS with anemia [^f4409116].

---

## Summary of recommendations

In older, clinically stable patients with acute MI and anemia, a **restrictive transfusion strategy** (≤ 8 g/dL) is reasonable and supported by REALITY, with expected 30-day outcomes similar to liberal thresholds and fewer transfusions. However, given conflicting data (e.g. MINT) [^04add051], decisions should be individualized, with a lower threshold for transfusion if there is hemodynamic compromise, ongoing ischemia, or refractory symptoms [^f4409116].

Importance

The optimal transfusion strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether a restrictive transfusion strategy would be clinically noninferior to a liberal strategy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, noninferiority, randomized trial conducted in 35 hospitals in France and Spain including 668 patients with myocardial infarction and hemoglobin level between 7 and 10 g/dL. Enrollment could be considered at any time during the index admission for myocardial infarction. The first participant was enrolled in March 2016 and the last was enrolled in September 2019. The final 30-day follow-up was accrued in November 2019.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo a restrictive (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 8; n = 342) or a liberal (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL; n = 324) transfusion strategy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary clinical outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; composite of all-cause death, stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia) at 30 days. Noninferiority required that the upper bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI for the relative risk of the primary outcome be less than 1.25. The secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome.

Results

Among 668 patients who were randomized, 666 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 77 [69–84] years; 281 [42.2%] women) completed the 30-day follow-up, including 342 in the restrictive transfusion group (122 [35.7%] received transfusion; 342 total units of packed red blood cells transfused) and 324 in the liberal transfusion group (323 [99.7%] received transfusion; 758 total units transfused). At 30 days, MACE occurred in 36 patients (11.0% [95% CI, 7.5%-14.6%]) in the restrictive group and in 45 patients (14.0% [95% CI, 10.0%-17.9%]) in the liberal group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -8.4% to 2.4%]). The relative risk of the primary outcome was 0.79 (1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00–1.19), meeting the prespecified noninferiority criterion. In the restrictive vs liberal group, all-cause death occurred in 5.6% vs 7.7% of patients, recurrent myocardial infarction occurred in 2.1% vs 3.1%, emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia occurred in 1.5% vs 1.9%, and nonfatal ischemic stroke occurred in 0.6% of patients in both groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia, a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy resulted in a noninferior rate of MACE after 30 days. However, the CI included what may be a clinically important harm.

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^f964f8ef]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is an independent predictor of mortality. The optimal transfusion strategy in these patients is unclear.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that a "restrictive" transfusion strategy (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 8g/dL) is clinically noninferior to a "liberal" transfusion strategy (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 10g/dL), but is less costly.

Methods

REALITY is an international, randomized, multicenter, open-label trial comparing a restrictive vs a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with AMI and anemia. The primary outcome is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at 30days, using the primary composite clinical outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; comprising all-cause death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia) as the effectiveness criterion. Secondary outcomes include the ICER at 1year, and MACE (and its components) at 30days and at 1year.

Results

The trial aimed to enroll 630 patients. Based on estimated event rates of 11% in the restrictive group and 15% in the liberal group, this number will provide 80% power to demonstrate clinical noninferiority of the restrictive group, with a noninferiority margin corresponding to a relative risk equal to 1.25. The sample size will also provide 80% power to show the cost-effectiveness of the restrictive strategy at a threshold of €50000 per quality-adjusted life year.

Conclusions

REALITY will provide important guidance on the management of patients with AMI and anemia.

### Restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy in myocardial infarction and anemia [^04add051]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

A strategy of administering a transfusion only when the hemoglobin level falls below 7 or 8 g per deciliter has been widely adopted. However, patients with acute myocardial infarction may benefit from a higher hemoglobin level.

Methods

In this phase 3, interventional trial, we randomly assigned patients with myocardial infarction and a hemoglobin level of less than 10 g per deciliter to a restrictive transfusion strategy (hemoglobin cutoff for transfusion, 7 or 8 g per deciliter) or a liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin cutoff, < 10 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction or death at 30 days.

Results

A total of 3504 patients were included in the primary analysis. The mean (± SD) number of red-cell units that were transfused was 0.7 ± 1.6 in the restrictive-strategy group and 2.5 ± 2.3 in the liberal-strategy group. The mean hemoglobin level was 1.3 to 1.6 g per deciliter lower in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group on days 1 to 3 after randomization. A primary-outcome event occurred in 295 of 1749 patients (16.9%) in the restrictive-strategy group and in 255 of 1755 patients (14.5%) in the liberal-strategy group (risk ratio modeled with multiple imputation for incomplete follow-up, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99 to 1.34; P = 0.07). Death occurred in 9.9% of the patients with the restrictive strategyand in 8.3% of the patients with the liberal strategy (risk ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.47); myocardial infarction occurred in 8.5% and 7.2% of the patients, respectively (risk ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.49).

Conclusions

In patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia, a liberal transfusion strategy did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or death at 30 days. However, potential harms of a restrictive transfusion strategy cannot be excluded. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; MINT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02981407.).

### Effect of a restrictive vs liberal blood transfusion strategy on major cardiovascular events among patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: the REALITY randomized clinical trial [^e291a49f]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study REALITY was published by Gregory Ducrocq and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Transfusion strategies in critical care, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Red blood cell transfusion. In the REALITY study, the trial question was: is a restrictive blood transfusion strategy noninferior to a liberal blood transfusion strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia? In the REALITY study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REALITY study, the population was: 666 patients (281 female, 385 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with myocardial infarction and anemia. The key exclusion criteria were shock; myocardial infarction occurring after PCI or CABG; life-threatening or massive ongoing bleeding; blood transfusion in the past 30 days; and malignant hematologic disease. In the REALITY study, the interventions were: n = 342 a restrictive strategy (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL) n = 324 a liberal strategy (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL). In the REALITY study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite outcome of death, stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia at 30 days (11% vs. 14%; ARD -3, 95% CI -8.4 to 2.4). In the REALITY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the REALITY study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with myocardial infarction and anemia, a restrictive strategy was noninferior to a liberal strategy with respect to the composite outcome of death, stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia at 30 days.

1 INTRODUCTION

Anemia is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 1 and is an independent predictor of cardiac events and increased mortality. 1, 2, 3, 4 The association with increased mortality is strong, with a relative increase in mortality exceeding 20% for each 1 g/dL decrement in hemoglobin below 14 g/dL. 2 The antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs used for the treatment of patients with AMI increase the risk of bleeding, which in turn increases the risk of ischemia and death. Whether this risk can be overcome by transfusion is debated.

Clinical data on the effects of blood transfusion in patients with AMI are observational 5, 6 or based on small, underpowered randomized trials. 7, 8 Previous results have been inconsistent, which prompted a call for large randomized trials. 9, 10 As a consequence, only low levels of evidence are available to guide international guidelines on blood transfusion in patients with AMI and anemia, which are somewhat inconsistent. 11, 12, 13

Randomized trials comparing transfusion strategies in patients undergoing noncardiac 14 or cardiac surgery, 15, 16 and in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 17 have generally found benefit from a restrictive transfusion strategy. However, these trials excluded patients with AMI. In the specific context of acute myocardial ischemia, the effect of transfusion strategies may differ markedly from what is observed in other settings. Apart from the clinical benefit of either strategy, other issues should be considered: blood is a costly and scarce resource; transfusion can be associated with adverse events (infectious and noninfectious); and transfusion mobilizes substantial resources and healthcare professional time, such that even if a restrictive strategy were noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy, there may be value in preferring the former.

Given the high prevalence of anemia, its strong association with death and adverse cardiac outcomes, the cost implications of transfusion, and the lack of high‐quality data to guide clinical practice in patients with AMI and anemia, we conducted an international, randomized clinical trial comparing a "restrictive" (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL) vs a "liberal" (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy in patients with AMI and anemia (defined as 7 g/dL < hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL). We hypothesized that a restrictive transfusion strategy would be clinically noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy but more cost effective.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study organization

The REstrictive And LIberal Transfusion strategies in patients with AMI (REALITY) trial (Identifier: NCT02648113) is a European (France and Spain), randomized, multicenter, open‐label trial designed by an independent academic group (French Alliance for Cardiovascular Trials [FACT]) and sponsored by Assistance Publique − Hôpitaux de Paris in France and by Sociedad Espanola de Farmacologia Clinica in Spain. The study was conducted in 35 clinical sites (26 in France, 9 in Spain).

The steering committee is responsible for the medical, scientific, and operational conduct of the study, and vouches for the integrity of the data analysis and the reporting of the results. The study adheres fully to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The duration of participation for each patient was 1 year.

2.2 Study population

Patients ≥ 18 years with AMI and anemia who met the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (Table 1) were enrolled at 35 sites between 23 March 23 2016 and 10 October 2019. We aimed to enroll 630 patients in the main study and 100 in the ancillary study. Inclusions in the main study could be extended to attain this goal. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Active prevention and treatment of post-critical illness anemia… [^8c5381d0]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Anemia is prevalent following critical illness and is associated with delayed recovery, functional impairments, and reduced quality of life. 1 Evidence tells us that restrictive transfusion practice in the intensive care unit is at least as effective as liberal transfusions for most patients. One consequence of restrictive transfusion is a high prevalence of post–critical illness anemia, which can persist for months. 1, 2 There is remarkably little high-quality research exploring whether interventions to prevent anemia and/or promote its recovery are effective for increasing hemoglobin concentration, and whether these interventions benefit patients' health. This trial was well conducted, powered at 80% to detect a clinically relevant difference in hemoglobin concentration of 1 g/dL at 1-month posthospital discharge, with conservative estimates for dropout rates due to death or loss to follow-up. As only 3 patients died during the study, and only 12 were lost to follow-up at 1 month, the power of the trial was effectively over 80%. However, the authors followed their local evidence-based RBC transfusion guidelines during hospitalization, and only 7 patients received postdischarge RBC transfusions. Only 6 patients received IV iron later during hospitalization as part of standard care. It seems unlikely that these factors were major confounders to the observed effect, and any bias would most likely have deflated rather than inflated the observed difference in the primary outcome. This conjecture is supported by all patients fulfilling the iron-responsive definition at baseline and the high number of postoperative patients in the trial population whose anemia resulted in part from acute blood loss.

Other trials of iron therapy with or without erythropoietin support an effect on hemoglobin recovery following critical illness. 6, 7 The trial by Warner and colleagues3 provides further evidence that care bundles that minimize iatrogenic blood loss and promote anemia recovery are effective for increasing hemoglobin concentration compared with existing or laissez-faire approaches. We now need adequately powered trials to determine the clinical effectiveness of these interventions for patient-centered outcomes and evaluation of the economic benefits of implementing them at scale as part of best practice.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion in myocardial infarction – A patient-level meta-analysis [^ff3236ae]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines have concluded that there are insufficient data to provide recommendations for the hemoglobin threshold for the use of red cell transfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia. After the recent publication of the Myocardial Infarction and Transfusion (MINT) trial, we performed an individual patient-level data meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of restrictive versus liberal blood transfusion strategies.

Methods

We conducted searches in major databases. Eligible trials randomly assigned patients with MI and anemia to either a restrictive (i.e., transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dl) or liberal (i.e., transfusion threshold of 10 g/dl) red cell transfusion strategy. We used individual patient data from each trial. The primary outcome was a composite of 30-day mortality or MI.

Results

We included 4311 patients from four trials. The primary outcome occurred in 334 patients (15.4%) in the restrictive strategy and 296 patients (13.8%) in the liberal strategy (relative risk [RR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97 to 1.30). Death at 30 days occurred in 9.3% of patients in the restrictive strategy and in 8.1% of patients in the liberal strategy (RR 1.15, 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.39). Cardiac death at 30 days occurred in 5.5% of patients in the restrictive strategy and in 3.7% of patients in the liberal strategy (RR 1.47, 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.94). Heart failure (RR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.13) was similar in the transfusion strategies. All-cause mortality at 6 months occurred in 20.5% of patients in the restrictive strategy compared with 19.1% of patients in the liberal strategy (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.11).

Conclusions

Pooling individual patient data from four trials did not find a definitive difference in our primary composite outcome of MI or death at 30 days. At 6 months, a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with increased all-cause mortality.

In the field of cardiac surgery, two randomized trials did not find improved outcomes with either restrictive or liberal strategies. 15, 16 However, a meta‐analysis of randomized trials in cardiac surgery showed a trend towards benefit of a liberal transfusion strategy, whereas in observational studies, transfusion (vs no transfusion) was associated with higher mortality. 31 In critical care patients, a randomized trial found that a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusion started when hemoglobin was < 9 g/dL) had no significant benefit compared to a restrictive strategy (transfusion allowed when hemoglobin was < 7 g/dL) in terms of 30‐day death (23.3% vs 18.7%; P = 0.11). 32 However, patients with ischemic heart disease were the only subgroup where the restrictive strategy had a numerically (although not statistically significant) lower absolute 30‐day survival rate (21% vs 26%; P = 0.38), 33 suggesting that this group may respond differently to transfusion compared with other patients. A similar signal was observed in a meta‐analysis of trials including critically ill patients randomized to restrictive vs liberal strategies, which found a numerical increase in death in the subgroup of patients with AMI treated with a restrictive strategy. 34

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^844da5ff]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The two randomized trials that compared restrictive vs liberal transfusion strategies in patients with ACS were small and underpowered. 7, 8 The CRIT randomized pilot study 7 randomized 45 patients with AMI and hematocrit ≤ 30% to a liberal vs a conservative transfusion strategy. The primary composite outcome (in‐hospital death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or new or worsening heart failure) occurred in eight patients (38%) in the liberal arm vs three (13%) in the conservative arm (P = 0.046). Conversely, another pilot trial 8 included patients with ACS or stable angina and hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. In that study, the primary outcome (death, myocardial infarction, or unscheduled revascularization at day 30) occurred in six patients (10.9%) in the liberal arm vs 14 (25.5%) in the restrictive arm.

As a consequence of the lack of solid evidence, international guidelines are not fully consistent: the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend to consider blood transfusion only in case of compromised hemodynamic status or hemoglobin < 7 g/dL 11, 12; the US guidelines do not recommend blood transfusion in patients with non‐STEMI with hemoglobin > 8 g/dL. 13 British guidelines recommend to consider a transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL and a hemoglobin target of 8‐10 g/dL for patients with ACS. 39 However, the American association of blood banks stated that, given the available evidence, they cannot recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold in patients with ACS. 40

There is also currently a wide variation in clinical practice, including in France: in an unpublished web poll performed in 2013 among 227 French sites managing AMI patients, 42% of sites declared using a liberal transfusion policy or having a variable strategy according to physician preference, whereas 58% of sites indicated using a restrictive transfusion policy. Therefore, practice is almost evenly split in France with respect to transfusion strategies in the setting of AMI and anemia, suggesting clinical equipoise. This finding highlights the need for adequately powered randomized trials to establish the role of transfusion during AMI. 9, 10 In addition to REALITY, a North American trial is ongoing: the MINT multicenter randomized trial (NCT02981407) is currently recruiting 3500 patients with anemia and AMI, to test the hypothesis that a liberal transfusion strategy reduces the risk of death or nonfatal AMI within 30 days compared with a restrictive strategy.

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^0d7adf78]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical data regarding transfusions in AMI are mainly observational and yield inconsistent results. An analysis of the Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications (CADILLAC) trial found that transfusion was independently associated with 30‐day and 1‐year death, and concluded that transfusion may be harmful after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. 35 Similarly, a pooled analysis of three international ACS trials found that blood transfusion was associated with higher death after adjustment for confounding factors. 36 Conversely, a retrospective analysis of nearly 80 000 elderly patients hospitalized with AMI reported lower 30 day death in those with hematocrit < 33% who received transfusions vs those who did not (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.53‐0.89). 5 A meta‐analysis (> 200 000 patients) reported a higher risk of death and recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with AMI who received transfusions (OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.46‐3.44). 6 However, another meta‐analysis of observational studies in post‐ACS patients suggested that transfusion had a neutral or beneficial effect when undertaken at hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL, whereas it could be harmful at hemoglobin > 11 g/dL. These apparently contradictory observations are likely related to the limitations of observational studies. The majority of patients undergoing blood transfusion cannot be matched with nontransfused patients due to their markedly different clinical profiles, 37 indicating that observational studies cannot reliably establish the benefits or risks of transfusion because they are hopelessly influenced by selection bias. In addition, in an observational setting, it is difficult to unravel the effect of anemia, bleeding, and transfusion on outcomes. 1 There may also be a differential effect of transfusion according to hemoglobin nadir or the presence of overt bleeding. 38

2.3 Study outcomes

The primary outcome is the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) at 30 days, using major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (composite of all‐cause death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, or emergency revascularization prompted by ischemia) as the effectiveness criterion. The primary and various secondary outcomes are listed in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Outcomes of the REALITY trial

All clinical outcomes (deaths, including cause of death, AMIs, strokes, ischemia‐driven emergency revascularizations, and heart failures) will be reviewed and adjudicated by a CEC. The CEC will be given all relevant clinical and biochemical information and will be blinded to the randomization assignment. In addition, AMIs will be categorized by the CEC according to the Third Universal Definition. 18 Each triggered event will be reviewed by two CEC members. In case of discrepancy between the two adjudicators, an ad hoc committee with at least three CEC members will reach a final decision based on consensus.

Safety outcomes of special interest, which will be monitored during the index hospitalization, include hemolysis, infections, multiorgan system dysfunction, acute lung injury, acute heart failure, acute renal failure, and severe allergic reactions.

2.4 Health‐economic analysis

A cost‐effectiveness primary outcome (30 day ICER) was chosen due to its frequent use in cardiology and the availability of benchmarks for the cost‐effectiveness results. 19, 20 The BASKET trial has provided a benchmark for the acceptable cost per MACE averted with an ICER of 64 732 euros to prevent one major adverse cardiac event. 21 The secondary health outcome for the cost‐utility analyses is quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) at 1 year. These are calculated for both groups using health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) scores from the EuroQoL five dimensions (EQ‐5D) questionnaire and converted to utility scores using country weights. 22, 23

The cost‐effectiveness analysis of the costs and outcomes for patients in the restrictive and liberal transfusion groups will be conducted from the perspectives of both the French and Spanish governments (providing a healthcare system perspective for both countries). This perspective allows comparisons with the results of other economic evaluations in cardiology. The economic evaluation will be based on the entire population of patients in the trial. Unit costs are undiscounted and are presented in Tables S1 and S2. Resources will be collected prospectively at the patient level. Prespecified subgroup analyses by country are necessary due to potential differences in unit costs and resource utilization. 24

2.5 Transfusion strategies and randomization

A centralized, blocked randomization list with blocks of varying size, stratified by center, was used. The investigators at each site obtained the randomized strategy allocation using the internet (CleanWeb, Telemedecine Technologies, S. A.S). CleanWeb assigned each patient a unique randomization number that corresponded to one of the two transfusion strategies (Figure 1):
A restrictive transfusion strategy, where transfusions are withheld unless hemoglobin is ≤ 8 g/dL, with a target hemoglobin of 8‐10 g/dL;
A liberal transfusion strategy, where transfusions are allowed as soon as hemoglobin is ≤ 10 g/dL, with a target hemoglobin of ≥ 11 g/dL.

FIGURE 1
REALITY trial flow chart. AMI, acute myocardial infarction; RBC, red blood cell

The strategies should be maintained until discharge from hospital or for 30 days, whichever comes first. Special steps are being taken to ensure adherence to the strategy assigned by randomization (particularly if patients are moved to another hospital department): patients receive colored bracelets delineating the transfusion strategy, colored reminder stickers are included in the patients' files, and posters are displayed in the intensive care units. Of note, all medications are left to the discretion of the treating physician and are not dictated by the study protocol.

2.6 Follow‐up

After randomization, the following data are being collected in each group: number of RBC units, type of RBC (autologous or homologous), duration of RBC conservation, and associated transfusion of non‐RBC blood products (platelets, coagulation factors, etc.). The collection of outcome data is being performed by the investigator at discharge or 30 days, whichever occurs first. After discharge, patient follow‐up is scheduled at Day 30 (± 5 days) and follow‐up data are collected by the investigator, either by direct contact (if the patient is still hospitalized) or by a visit, phone call, or mail. The EQ‐5D HRQoL questionnaire is completed by the patients.

At 6 months (± 30 days) and 1 year (± 30 days), patients are contacted to collect clinical event and HRQoL (EQ‐5D questionnaire) data.

### Individualized transfusion decisions to minimize adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia [^bb6414c3]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Risk-benefit tradeoffs between restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies may vary across individuals. This exploratory analysis aimed to derive and evaluate individualized treatment effects of defined transfusion strategies in patients with acute MI and anemia with the goal of minimizing adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods

This study analyzed 3,447 (98.4%) patients randomized in the MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) trial between April 2017 to April 2023. Outcomes for this analysis included 30-day death or recurrent MI, death, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of death, MI, stroke, and ischemia-driven unscheduled revascularization). Machine learning methods were used to identify baseline patient characteristics that informed the individualized treatment effect of a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for each patient. The expected population risk of an outcome under a scenario in which patients received their optimal treatment, as indicated by the individualized treatment effect, was contrasted with expected risks for universally applying a restrictive strategy or a liberal strategy to all patients.

Results

Baseline characteristics did not inform individualized treatment effects on 30-day death and death or MI, suggesting minimal heterogeneity in treatment effect on these outcomes. An algorithm for estimating the individualized treatment effect on 30-day MACE included 12 baseline factors. If all patients received the optimal treatment as indicated by their estimated individualized treatment effect, the predicted risk of 30-day MACE in the sample population was 15.2% (95% CI 14.2%-16.2%). This corresponded to 4.0 (difference: -4.0%, 95% CI -5.8, -2.1) and 2.3 (difference: -2.3%, 95% CI -3.7, -0.9) percentage point risk reductions compared to applying a restrictive or liberal strategy to everyone respectively.

Conclusions

The MINT trial average treatment effect, favoring a liberal strategy, may be optimal to minimize risk of 30-day death and death or MI for acute MI patients with anemia represented in the MINT sample as no individualized treatment effects were estimated on these outcomes. However, individualized transfusion strategy decisions have potential to reduce risk of 30-day MACE. External validation of the MACE algorithm is required before clinical use.

### Liberal versus restrictive transfusion thresholds for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease [^f77438e2]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prior trials suggest it is safe to defer transfusion at hemoglobin levels above 7 to 8 g/dL in most patients. Patients with acute coronary syndrome may benefit from higher hemoglobin levels.

Methods

We performed a pilot trial in 110 patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable angina undergoing cardiac catheterization and a hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. Patients in the liberal transfusion strategy received one or more units of blood to raise the hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL. Patients in the restrictive transfusion strategy were permitted to receive blood for symptoms from anemia or for a hemoglobin < 8 g/dL. The predefined primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unscheduled revascularization 30 days post randomization.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between groups except age (liberal, 67.3; restrictive, 74.3). The mean number of units transfused was 1.6 in the liberal group and 0.6 in the restrictive group. The primary outcome occurred in 6 patients (10.9%) in the liberal group and 14 (25.5%) in the restrictive group (risk difference = 15.0%; 95% confidence interval of difference 0.7% to 29.3%; P = 0.054 and adjusted for age P = 0.076). Death at 30 days was less frequent in liberal group (n = 1, 1.8%) compared to restrictive group (n = 7, 13.0%; P = 0.032).

Conclusions

The liberal transfusion strategy was associated with a trend for fewer major cardiac events and deaths than a more restrictive strategy. These results support the feasibility of and the need for a definitive trial.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^c24b43e1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this prespecified secondary analysis of the MINT trial, we observed that participants with acute anemia at the time of randomization had a higher risk of adverse outcomes at 30 days than those with chronic anemia. The effect of a restrictive transfusion strategy compared with a liberal one was not modified by anemia acuity. Therefore, anemia acuity did not appear to explain the potential harm of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy observed in the MINT trial. In patients with anemia and MI, clinicians should not be guided by the acuity of the anemia in selecting a transfusion strategy.

### Transfusion strategy effect on quality of life in patients with myocardial infarction and anemia: a secondary analysis of the MINT randomized clinical trial [^2e6fedca]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Both myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia have deleterious effects on health-related quality of life (QOL). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion may improve QOL after MI by relieving symptoms and/or increasing functional capacity.

Objective

To evaluate whether a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a more restrictive transfusion strategy affects QOL in patients with MI and anemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This analysis of QOL as a prespecified secondary outcome of the Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion (MINT) trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing a liberal vs restrictive RBC transfusion strategy, included participants from 144 sites across 6 countries. Hospitalized adults with acute MI and anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] less than 10 g/dL). The MINT trial randomized 3504 patients, and this analysis included those who had QOL data collected and those who died before the 30-day follow-up period. Data were collected from April 2017 to April 2023, and data were analyzed from February 2024 to January 2025.

Interventions

The MINT trial randomized patients to a restrictive (Hb of 7 to 8 g/dL) or a liberal (Hb of less than 10 g/dL) RBC transfusion strategy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

QOL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L 30 days after randomization.

Results

Of 2844 included patients, 1551 (54.5%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 71.9 (11.5) years. A total of 2525 (88.8%; 1254 [49.7%] in the restrictive group and 1271 [50.3%] in the liberal group) had QOL data, and 319 (11.2%) died before 30-day follow-up. Overall, there were no differences in mean or median scores for any EQ-5D-5L QOL outcome between assigned transfusion strategies at 30 days postrandomization. Although a higher percentage of patients in the liberal compared with the restrictive transfusion group reported no problems compared with any problem in usual activities (506 of 1268 [39.9%] vs 473 of 1247 [37.9%]), mobility (474 of 1270 [37.3%] vs 460 of 1254 [36.7%]), and self-care (858 of 1271 [67.5%] vs 803 of 1254 [64.0%]) domains, none of these differences were statistically significant. Adjusted mixed-effects linear regressions showed no association between assigned transfusion strategy and mean differences in any QOL outcome. Adjusted regressions in several prespecified subgroups showed an association between a liberal transfusion strategy and better QOL scores in domains related to functional capacity, but the effects were only statistically significant in patients with a history of heart failure (Health Today rating: β, 2.06 [95% CI, -0.23 to 4.35] vs -1.44 [95% CI, -3.81 to 0.92]; P = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

This secondary analysis of the MINT trial found that in patients with MI and anemia, a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy did not affect QOL outcomes 30 days after randomization. This suggests that higher Hb levels maintained with RBC transfusion may not offer significant benefits to QOL overall in patients with MI and anemia. Additional studies may be useful for further examining and validating transfusion's effect on QOL in patients with MI and heart failure.

### Counterpoint: the design and interpretation of blood transfusion randomized clinical trials [^2ebc42c8]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent perspective suggested that prior evidence from over a decade ago established that a liberal rather than a restrictive blood transfusion strategy results in better outcomes in patients with anemia and either acute myocardial infarction or stable cardiovascular disease. Their premise was that physiological evidence, and a different interpretation of the TRICC trial should have been sufficient to establish clinical practice. They also suggest that a more personalized approach to the administration of transfusions would have been made possible by including a usual care arm in all transfusion trials. In this Counter-Point perspective, we describe how and why two discrete and common blood transfusion thresholds were selected in the TRICC, FOCUS, REALITY, and MINT trials. We explain why a usual-care-arm would have been uninformative. We also propose that we still do not have evidence to provide firm transfusion recommendations in several specific subpopulations of patients including those with stable atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Finally, we provide our perspective on the state of existing evidence and on the clinical recommendations that should be adopted in practice.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^c3f9e5ee]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does acute anemia compared with chronic anemia modify the effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies on a composite 30-day outcome of death or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in adults with acute MI?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, acute anemia compared with chronic anemia was associated with a statistically significant 25% higher risk of a composite outcome of 30-day death or MI. However, anemia acuity did not significantly modify the effect of RBC transfusion strategies on the risk of this composite outcome.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that in patients with anemia who experience MI, the choice of RBC transfusion strategy should not be based on anemia acuity.

Discussion

In this planned subgroup analysis of the MINT trial, we observed that one-third of the participants had acute anemia. These participants had a more severe acute clinical course than patients with chronic anemia and had a higher risk of short-term adverse outcomes, even after adjustment for potential confounders. However, we did not find a differential effect of the randomized RBC transfusion strategy according to anemia acuity for any 30-day outcome

In previous studies, anemia at the time of hospital admission for acute MI or anemia at hospital discharge, either hospital-acquired (acute) or present at admission (chronic), was associated with worse short- and long-term all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. One study that compared post-MI outcomes in patients with acute hospital-acquired anemia with those in patients with chronic anemia observed similar poor 1-year cardiovascular outcomes in both conditions. In contrast and contrary to our a priori hypothesis, we observed that acute anemia prior to randomization, using our internally developed definition, was independently associated with a higher risk of 30-day adverse outcomes. When we used our alternative definition of pure hospital-acquired anemia as others did, we did not observe any significant difference in outcomes between acute and chronic anemia. This may be explained by a lack of power of our sensitivity analyses, the prevalence of acute anemia decreasing from 34.3% to 10.8%, or by the fact that different definitions capture different constructs. Nonetheless, the directionality of most of our secondary outcome point estimates did not change. In contrast to one study, we did not observe in any analysis that chronic anemia was associated with worse outcomes, possibly because our study was conducted in a clinical trial setting and a decade later, thus including a different study population. In addition, the comparison between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies on any outcomes was not modified by the presence of acute or chronic anemia.

### Transfusion for anemia in myocardial infarction… [^e1345bbc]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians understand the inherent risks of transfusion, and most hospitals have mechanisms in place to avoid overuse of this expensive intervention. In some situations, however, transfusions may decrease the mortality rate among hospitalized patients. Wu and colleagues report data from a retrospective analysis of 78, 974 elderly patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction. The authors attempted to discover whether transfusion has an effect on 30-day mortality. The study population was drawn from a larger group of 234, 769 patients whose discharge diagnosis was myocardial infarction. The authors excluded patients younger than 65 years, those whose entire hospitalization could not be followed because of transfer to another hospital, those with hematocrit levels above the upper limit of normal, and patients whose hospitalizations were readmissions after the acute myocardial infarction. Anemia was defined as a hematocrit measurement of 39 percent or lower.

The principal study outcome was mortality within 30 days after hospital admission. Anemia was present in 43. 4 percent of the study patients, and more severe degrees of anemia correlated with higher rates of 30-day mortality, congestive heart failure, and shock. Transfusions were performed in 4. 7 percent of patients. Curiously, family physicians were more likely than cardiologists to order transfusions. In patients with hematocrits of 33 percent or lower, the 30-day mortality rate was improved by use of transfusion, and the beneficial effect was more pronounced in those with greater degrees of anemia. In patients with hematocrits above 33 percent, transfusion was associated with an increased mortality rate. The authors conclude that in elderly patients with myocardial infarction, the use of blood transfusions in those with hematocrits of 33 percent or lower is associated with decreased mortality.

editor's note: Transfusion appears to be a relatively low-tech, low-cost means of reducing mortality in the substantial number of patients with myocardial infarction who are also anemic. The chief caution to mention about this article, before touting it as "evidence-based proof" of benefit, is that it is a retrospective analysis excluding 67 percent of the total study group. The possibility of an unrecognized bias factor is not small, and a prospective trial that confirms a beneficial effect to transfusion would be helpful. — b. z.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^cc6153d2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Future direction

At an academic level, a multidisciplinary think-tank from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened and agreed to the need for three adult trials evaluating RBC transfusion trigger strategies to improve overall outcome and to validate the following hypotheses: first, higher Hb levels resulting from a liberal transfusion strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will lead to lower incidence of 30-day all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, infection, and other complications as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold; second, in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization, a liberal transfusion strategy will be associated with a lower incidence of composite outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergent percutaneous intervention (angioplasty or stent insertion), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 30 days of enrollment when compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy; and third, in hemodynamically stable patients in the ICU with a history of ischemic heart disease, multiple organ dysfunction scores will be improved by maintaining Hb > 10 g/dl. That the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute would propose such studies suggests that the ideal Hb transfusion trigger has yet to be determined for some common clinical conditions, and Hb levels > 8 g/dl in some stable patients may be warranted.

At the level of the practicing physician, what are clinicians to do? Fundamentally, physicians should intelligently apply their skill set to their patients' needs, incorporating all physiological data at their disposal, and incorporate – as applicable – the scientific support from Practice Guidelines. Recent survey data demonstrating the lack of a substantial reduction in ICU RBC transfusion in one state has been interpreted to suggest that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds may not have 'fully translated into practice in different hospital settings'. Perhaps in assessing this lack of conformity the authors of such uncontrolled, hospital-derived datasets should in part acknowledge that experienced clinical decision-making may have presided over the selection for or against transfusion. After all, the primary methodology for evaluating the restrictive transfusion hypothesis in the TRICC and FOCUS trials has been itself criticized for lack of inclusion of a usual practice arm in the dichotomized trial protocols, thus encouraging practice misalignments and hence more limited data interpretability. As an optimal use of a practice guideline, trial data supportive of a restrictive transfusion strategy provide clinicians with a helpful metaphorical arm rest, to pause and carefully consider whether a transfusion is likely to be helpful, which in many cases it will not.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^82118528]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), limited physiologic adaptation to acute anemia might lead to greater benefit from a liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy. Data on such a possible benefit are lacking.

Objectives

To compare acute anemia with chronic anemia and post-MI outcomes and estimate the differential effect of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy compared with a liberal strategy on post-MI outcomes according to anemia acuity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prespecified subgroup analysis of the Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion (MINT) multicenter randomized clinical trial was conducted in 126 hospitals in 6 countries between April 26, 2017, and April 14, 2023, with 30-day follow-up and blinded adjudication of the primary outcome. The analysis included 3144 of 3504 MINT participants (89.7%) with acute MI, a hemoglobin (Hb) level less than 10 g/dL at randomization, and a first Hb measurement available on the day of or the day following hospital admission.

Intervention

The MINT trial randomized participants to a restrictive (Hb < 7–8 g/dL) or liberal (Hb < 10 g/dL) RBC transfusion strategy. Acute anemia was defined as having a first Hb value greater than 13 g/dL (men) or 12 g/dL (women), or as having a decrease greater than or equal to 2 g/dL between the first Hb measurement and measurement at randomization. Other Hb levels were categorized as chronic anemia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of death or recurrent MI up to 30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were death, recurrent MI, cardiac death, heart failure, pulmonary complications, and major bleeding events. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

Results

Among 3144 included participants (mean [SD] age, 72.3 [11.6] years; 1715 [54.5%] male; 1307 [41.6%] with type 1 MI), 1078 [34.3%]) had acute anemia. Acute anemia was associated with an increased risk of death or recurrent MI (adjusted risk ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05–1.48). The effect of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy compared with a liberal strategy was similar for participants with either acute or chronic anemia for all outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of the MINT trial, acute anemia was associated with less favorable post-MI outcomes than chronic anemia but did not modify the effects of the randomized transfusion strategy. In patients with anemia and MI, the acuity of anemia should not influence the choice of transfusion trigger.

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^9cf33101]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.7.5 Primary clinical outcome analysis

Noninferiority will be considered to have been demonstrated if the upper value of the 97.5% one‐sided CI of the relative risk is inferior to the noninferiority margin equal to 1.25, in both the PP and ITT populations. If noninferiority of the restrictive strategy is established, sequential testing of superiority of the restrictive strategy will be accepted if the upper value of the 97.5% one‐sided CI of the relative risk is inferior to one.

All individual components of the primary outcome will be analyzed by Chi‐square or Fisher's exact tests. As these analyses will be exploratory, no adjustment of the alpha value for multiplicity will be made.

Times to death and MACE during 1‐year follow‐up will be described by Kaplan‐Meier curves and tested by log‐rank test. The reference date is defined as the randomization date. All patients will be censored at the time of the last observation.

All safety endpoints will be analyzed by Chi‐square or Fisher's exact tests.

2.8 Subgroup analyses

Interactions between outcomes and prespecified subgroups will be analyzed according to the following variables: age, sex, body weight, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, hypertension, dyslipidemia, Killip class, type of AMI (ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non‐STEMI), renal function at baseline, use of revascularization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hemoglobin at randomization, and presence or absence of overt bleeding before randomization.

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^2dbea662]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transfusion is a costly treatment (RBC units cost more than 200 euros in France, 140 euros in Spain) and blood is a scarce resource. In addition, beyond the questions of clinical safety, efficacy, and RBC unit costs, blood transfusion is associated with an increased use of medical resources and increased length of stay; hence, the costs of RBC transfusion are probably underestimated. 41 Finally, blood bank organization, shortage of blood, and costs of storage, testing, and delivery remain major issues in the western world, but even more so in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 42 For those reasons, a testing strategy combining clinical noninferiority and cost‐effectiveness superiority is legitimate, as establishing clinical noninferiority of a restrictive strategy but reduced costs would be sufficient to establish dominance of this strategy and change clinical practice.

The choice of an open‐label design was justified by the difficulty in blinding the intervention (blood transfusion in the context of AMI). However, the primary clinical effectiveness outcome is a composite of objective clinical outcomes (death and nonfatal major cardiac events: stroke, AMI, and emergency coronary revascularization prompted by myocardial ischemia), which are adjudicated by a CEC blinded to randomization and hemoglobin levels, providing reassurance that these should not be affected by investigator bias.

### Restrictive vs liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: rationale and design of the REALITY trial [^a982e0b7]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.7.1 Power and sample size considerations

There is no established clinical superiority of either transfusion strategy at this stage. We hypothesized that a restrictive transfusion strategy would be clinically noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy but less costly. As our hypotheses are clinical noninferiority but superior cost‐effectiveness of the restrictive transfusion strategy, we based our power calculations on clinical grounds. We anticipated MACE rates of 11% in the restrictive transfusion strategy and 15% in the liberal transfusion strategy, based on observations from the nationwide French registry of acute ST‐Elevation or non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (FAST‐MI) program. 25 Based on these hypotheses, a sample size of 300 patients per group would provide 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority of the restrictive group, with a noninferiority margin corresponding to a relative risk equal to 1.25, using a confidence interval (CI) method with a 97.5% one‐sided CI. With a conservative hypothesis of 5% of patients with major protocol violations, a total of 630 patients (315 in each arm) are required for the trial to be adequately powered for both intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per‐protocol (PP) analyses. Using the formula for sample size calculation in economic evaluation, we estimated that this sample size would allow us to show cost‐effectiveness at a threshold of €50 000, a power of 80%, and a significance level of 5%, a €1000 difference in costs and 0.15 difference in QALYs. 26 where C and Q represent costs and utilities, W willingness to pay, and ρ the correlation between costs and quality of life (set at −0.1).

3 DISCUSSION

The primary hypothesis of the REALITY trial (NCT02648113) is that a restrictive transfusion strategy (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL) will be clinically noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy (triggered by hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL), but will be less costly.

Physiopathologic considerations suggest that the effect of RBC transfusion may differ between patients with vs without AMI. In theory, transfusion should increase oxygen delivery to the myocardium. However, recent data suggest that oxygen delivery is not increased in patients receiving transfusions, that RBCs are rapidly depleted of nitric oxide during storage, and that, conversely, transfusion may increase platelet activation and aggregation. 27 These consequences appear potentially even more deleterious in patients with cardiovascular disease. 28 RBC transfusion can also be associated with various noncardiac complications such as transfusion‐associated infections, acute lung injury, and circulatory overload. 29 All of these potential complications will be carefully monitored in the REALITY trial.

The issue of a restrictive vs a liberal transfusion strategy is not only relevant in cardiology, but is a common clinical problem encountered in many other settings. 30 A randomized trial conducted in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Spain showed that a restrictive vs liberal (when hemoglobin is < 7 vs < 9 g/dL) transfusion strategy was associated with improved 6‐week survival (95% vs 91%; P = 0.02). 17 However, patients with ischemic heart disease were excluded from enrollment. 17 A meta‐analysis of randomized trials comparing restrictive vs liberal strategies and including more than 3000 patients with cardiovascular disease 14 (not only patients with coronary artery disease) found that the risk of ACS was increased in patients managed with the restrictive strategy. However, the studies included in this meta‐analysis included patients in various contexts (eg, hip surgery), which is quite different from the scenario of patients with recent AMI and anemia.

### Restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy in myocardial infarction and anemia [^fcd1ed34]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study MINT was published by Jeffrey L Carson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Transfusion strategies in critical care and Red blood cell transfusion. In the MINT study, the trial question was: what is the role of restrictive transfusion strategy in patients with myocardial infarction and anemia? In the MINT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MINT study, the population was: 3504 patients (1593 female, 1911 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled bleeding; receipt of palliative treatment; scheduled for cardiac surgery during current admission; declined receipt of blood transfusion. In the MINT study, the interventions were: n = 1749 restrictive strategy (hemoglobin cutoff for transfusion 7–8 g/dL) n = 1755 liberal strategy (hemoglobin cutoff for transfusion < 10 g/dL). In the MINT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction or death at day 30 (16.9% vs. 14.5%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.34). In the MINT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death (9.9% vs. 8.3%; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.47) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (8.5% vs. 7.2%; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.49) No significant difference in death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, or rehospitalization (19.6% vs. 17.4%; RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29). In the MINT study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia, restrictive strategy was not superior to liberal strategy with respect to myocardial infarction or death at day 30.

### Association of in-hospital hemoglobin drop with decreased myocardial salvage and increased long-term mortality in patients with acute ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^ef5a5b44]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common in patients with acute MI and may: (1) be already present on admission (baseline anemia), or (2) develop during the hospital stay with possible contributions of periprocedural and postprocedural bleeding from invasive procedures and intensified anticoagulant therapy. However, lack of oxygen carriers/supply may further deteriorate cardiac function by exacerbating myocardial ischemia even after coronary flow is re‐established. Our data show that the prevalence of anemia was 10.5% on admission and anemia developed in 57.9% of the patients with STEMI at some point during hospitalization. These data are in line with previous studies which reported that anemia was present in ≈20% of patients with acute MI and the proportion of patients with anemia increased to 48% during hospitalization.

Anemia often triggers red blood cell transfusions, which are administered in up to 10% of patients with acute coronary syndrome, although a clear hemoglobin cutoff value mandating transfusion is not yet standardized. In most studies, a liberal blood transfusion strategy (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin levels < 9 g/dL) was compared with a restrictive blood transfusion strategy (transfusion triggered by hemoglobin levels < 7.0 g/dL). Since data from large randomized controlled trials including patients with acute coronary syndrome are missing, current guidelines recommend a restrictive policy of transfusion in patients with anemia with acute MI. This recommendation is substantiated by the recently published REALITY (Restrictive and Liberal Transfusion Strategies in Patients With AMI) trial. This trial enrolled patients with acute MI and anemia at any time during admission and randomly assigned them to either a restrictive (transfusion administered when hemoglobin was ≤ 8 g/dL) or a liberal (transfusion administered when hemoglobin was ≤ 10 g/dL) transfusion strategy. The study showed that a restrictive transfusion strategy was noninferior to the liberal strategy in preventing 30‐day major adverse cardiac events supporting the use of a restrictive strategy for blood transfusion in anemic patients with MI.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^165d3724]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

All outcomes were assessed at 30 days after randomization. The primary outcome was a composite of death or recurrent MI, as in the main study. Secondary outcomes were death, recurrent MI, cardiac death, heart failure, a composite of pulmonary complications (transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], transfusion-associated circulatory overload [TACO], pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure), and major bleeding. Recurrent MI was adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation. These outcomes were prespecified in the main trial except the composite outcome of pulmonary complications.

Data Source, Collection, and Management

All data were collected in the context of the MINT trial. Inclusion in this secondary analysis was based on the availability of a first Hb measurement from either the enrolling hospital or the referent hospital if the participant had been transferred to the enrolling institution. Participant's biological sex was based on hospital records. Electrocardiograms, Hb, and troponin measurements were required before randomization (within 24 hours), 12 hours after randomization (troponin levels only), and daily up to 3 days after randomization. Other Hb measurements from the hospital admission to randomization were obtained at clinical discretion.

Statistical Analysis

The sample size calculation of the main trial has been reported. We reported baseline variables at the time of randomization and crude distribution of study outcomes using standard measures of central tendency and dispersion, both by anemia acuity (acute and chronic anemia) and group allocation (liberal and restrictive RBC transfusion strategy). We assumed that no unobserved event occurred for those with incomplete 30-day follow-up (n = 50). We estimated the crude and adjusted association between anemia acuity and outcomes using mixed-effects log-binomial regressions with random effects for sites. Models were adjusted for the following potential confounders: baseline characteristics (age, sex, smoking status, Hb level at time of randomization), anemia-related comorbidities (cancer, kidney failure, and diabetes), and MI-related characteristics at the time of randomization (number of anticoagulants or antiplatelets prescribed, and MI type). We selected these variables based on their clinical potential associations with both anemia acuity and our outcomes. Missing values for smoking status (174 of 3144 [5.5%]) and medication data (1 [< 0.1%]) were addressed using mean imputation. We report risk ratios (RRs), 95% CIs, and P values for all outcomes.

2.7.2 Statistical analyses

Analyses will be performed in both the ITT and PP cohorts. The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients who have signed an informed consent form. In case of consent withdrawal, only data collected before withdrawal will be used. All patients will be analyzed in their randomized arm regardless of the strategy used during the trial. The PP population is defined as all patients randomized and treated without major protocol violations or deviations. Predefined major protocol violations/deviations are: (1) violation of the selection criteria; (2) receipt of the alternative transfusion strategy (apart from in the situations listed below); (3) missing data for the primary efficacy outcomes; (4) inclusion in another interventional study; and (5) major protocol deviation identified during a blinded data review before database lock. Crossover from the restrictive to the liberal strategy will be allowed, and thus not considered a major protocol deviation (so these patients will be included in the PP analysis), in the following documented cases: massive overt active bleeding, presumed important fall in hemoglobin level and no time to wait for hemoglobin testing, or shock occurring after randomization. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.4 software.

2.7.3 Cost‐effectiveness analysis

A joint comparison of costs and MACE will be performed by nonparametric bootstrapping with 1000 re‐samples. A distribution will be attributed to each variable according to accepted practice: normal distribution for MACE and log normal or Beta for costs. The results of the bootstrap replications will be presented on a cost‐effectiveness plane. In addition to the cost‐effectiveness plane, acceptability curves for French and Spanish values will be plotted.

2.7.4 Cost‐utility analysis

The cost‐utility analysis will be performed with French and Spanish utility values estimated from EQ‐5D scores.

Effect of a Restrictive Strategy Compared With a Liberal Strategy on 30-Day Outcomes

Results are presented for the full sample and in each group of anemia acuity. Risk ratio (RR) values greater than 1 favor a liberal strategy. Pulmonary complications were transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (never, ever, current, or unknown), anemia-related comorbidities (cancer, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes), baseline hemoglobin (grams per deciliter), myocardial infarction (MI) type (type 1, type 2, or other), number of anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, or other) and antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor) and included a random effect for clinical site.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion in patients with type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction: a prespecified analysis of the MINT trial [^4e044572]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The MINT trial (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) raised concern for harm from a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia. Type 1 and type 2 MI are distinct pathophysiologic entities that may respond differently to blood transfusion. This analysis sought to determine whether the effects of transfusion varied among patients with a type 1 or a type 2 MI and anemia. The authors hypothesized that the liberal transfusion strategy would be of greater benefit in type 2 than in type 1 MI.

Methods

The authors compared rates of death or MI at 30 days in patients with type 1 (n = 1460) and type 2 (n = 1955) MI and anemia who were randomly allocated to a restrictive (threshold, 7–8 g/dL) or a liberal (threshold, 10 g/dL) transfusion strategy.

Results

The primary outcome of death or MI was observed in 16% of type 1 MI and 15.4% of type 2 MI patients. The rate of death or MI was higher in patients with type 1 MI randomized to a restrictive (18.2%) versus liberal (13.8%) transfusion strategy (relative risk [RR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.04–1.67]) with no difference observed between the restrictive (15.8%) and liberal (15.1%) transfusion strategies in patients with type 2 MI (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.85–1.29]). The test for a differential effect of transfusion strategy by MI type was not statistically significant (P interaction = 0.16).

Conclusions

The concern for harm with a restrictive transfusion strategy in patients with acute MI and anemia raised in the MINT primary outcome manuscript may be more apparent in patients with type 1 than type 2 MI.

### Effect of red blood cell transfusion strategy on clinical outcomes among patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing revascularization: a prespecified analysis of the MINT trial [^b6a91f3b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The MINT trial (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion; N = 3504) randomized patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL to liberal (maintain hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL) or restrictive (maintain hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL) red blood cell transfusion. The results suggested a benefit on 30-day death or MI with a liberal transfusion strategy. The effect of transfusion in patients with acute MI undergoing revascularization is unclear.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis of the MINT trial, patients who underwent revascularization (n = 1002) before randomization but during index hospitalization were compared with those who did not (n = 2442). The primary outcome was 30-day death or MI; secondary outcomes included 30-day death, recurrent MI, the composite of death, recurrent MI, ischemia-driven unscheduled revascularization, or readmission for ischemic cardiac diagnosis, heart failure, and cardiac death. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to determine the relative risks of the primary and secondary outcomes by transfusion strategy for revascularized and nonrevascularized patients with interaction terms.

Results

Patients undergoing revascularization were younger, more often female, and had fewer comorbidities than those who did not. There was no significant interaction between revascularization and assigned transfusion strategy for any outcome except cardiac death. Compared with liberal transfusion, restrictive transfusion increased the risk of 30-day cardiac death among nonrevascularized patients (relative risk, 2.45 [1.58–3.81]) but not among revascularized patients (relative risk, 0.97 [0.59,-1.60]; interaction P = 0.006).

Conclusions

In this analysis of the MINT trial, revascularization did not alter the effect of the randomized transfusion strategy on 30-day death or MI. The hypothesis-generating finding that a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with an increased risk of cardiac death among patients with anemia and acute MI who do not undergo revascularization requires confirmation.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^a7d24214]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

The current study has several limitations. Our definition of acute anemia was empirical and limited by the absence of Hb levels prior to hospital admission. The classification of acute vs chronic anemia was based on Hb measurements made at only 2 time points (admission and randomization). Some patients were classified as having chronic anemia based on only 1 Hb measurement, and some patients who developed acute anemia prior to admission may have been classified as having chronic anemia. However, our definition was physiologically based and included different scenarios of acute anemia, including acute on chronic anemia. Despite this, and as suggested by our sensitivity analyses, our findings may not be transportable to other definitions of acute anemia, including acute anemia that developed prior to admission. Interaction testing has relatively low statistical power, and we may not have detected a differential effect while some existed. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons, increasing the risk of type I error regarding the association between acute anemia and outcomes. In addition, while excluded patients slightly differed from included patients, the number of excluded patients was small and likely did not have a substantial effect on the results.

### Effect of four hemoglobin transfusion threshold strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and anemia: a target trial emulation using MINT trial data [^1fd790f7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal hemoglobin threshold to guide red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and anemia is uncertain.

Objective

To estimate the efficacy of 4 individual hemoglobin thresholds (< 10 g/dL [< 100 g/L], < 9 g/dL [< 90 g/L], < 8 g/dL [< 80 g/L], and < 7 g/dL [< 70 g/L]) to guide transfusion in patients with acute MI and anemia.

Design

Prespecified secondary analysis of the MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) trial using target trial emulation methods. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02981407).

Setting

144 clinical sites in 6 countries.

Participants

3492 MINT trial participants with acute MI and a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL.

Intervention

Four transfusion strategies to maintain patients' hemoglobin concentrations at or above thresholds of 10, 9, 8, or 7 g/dL. Protocol exceptions were permitted for specified adverse clinical events.

Measurements

Data from the MINT trial were leveraged to emulate 4 transfusion strategies and estimate per protocol effects on the composite outcome of 30-day death or recurrent MI (death/MI) and 30-day death using inverse probability weighting.

Results

The 30-day risk for death/MI was 14.8% (95% CI, 11.8% to 18.4%) for a < 10-g/dL strategy, 15.1% (CI, 11.7% to 18.2%) for a < 9-g/dL strategy, 15.9% (CI, 12.4% to 19.0%) for a < 8-g/dL strategy, and 18.3% (CI, 14.6% to 22.0%) for a < 7-g/dL strategy. Absolute risk differences and risk ratios relative to the < 10-g/dL strategy for 30-day death/MI increased as thresholds decreased, although 95% CIs were wide. Findings were similar and imprecise for 30-day death.

Limitation

Unmeasured confounding may have persisted despite adjustment.

Conclusion

The 30-day risks for death/MI and death among patients with acute MI and anemia seem to increase progressively with lower hemoglobin concentration thresholds for transfusion. However, the imprecision around estimates from this target trial analysis precludes definitive conclusions about individual hemoglobin thresholds.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^43185cbf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), anemia has a prevalence ranging from 10% to 43% and has been associated with a 30% increase in 30-day mortality. Before publication of the Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion (MINT) trial, there was a lack of high-quality trial data regarding the effect of different red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies in patients with anemia and acute MI. In the MINT trial, 3504 patients with anemia and acute MI were randomized to either a liberal or restrictive RBC transfusion strategy. The risk of 30-day death or MI was higher in the restrictive strategy (16.9%) group than in the liberal strategy (14.5%) group. Despite not being statistically significant, these results suggested possible harm from a restrictive strategy. This primary finding did not consider the time course of the development of anemia, which may modify both the prognosis after MI and the response to transfusions.

Chronic anemia is often present in patients at the time of MI admission because of comorbidities such as advanced age, occult bleeding, kidney disease, cancer, nutritional deficiencies, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Alternatively, acute anemia may be present on admission when abrupt blood loss precipitates MI, or it may develop during MI hospitalization because of blood loss, acute inflammation, or hemodilution. In patients with chronic anemia, compensatory mechanisms, such as increases in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels, cardiac output, and coronary and cerebral blood flow, may have had time to become established, whereas this is less likely in those with acute anemia. Resulting physiologic differences related to anemia acuity might influence the effect of various RBC transfusion strategies on outcomes after acute MI.

We therefore performed a preplanned secondary analysis of MINT to assess the outcomes of participants with acute vs chronic anemia and estimate whether there was a differential effect of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy compared with a liberal strategy on post-MI outcomes in participants with acute or chronic anemia. We hypothesized that participants with acute anemia at the time of randomization would have fewer comorbidities than patients with chronic anemia, and consequently better post-MI outcomes. We also hypothesized that a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive one would be of greater benefit in patients with acute anemia compared with chronic anemia.

### The effect of age and clinical circumstances on the outcome of red blood cell transfusion in critically ill patients [^387dfd56]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In critically ill patients, anemia is common; about 95% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients have abnormally low hemoglobin levels by ICU day 3. The transfusion trigger of "30/10" (HCT, < 30%; hemoglobin, < 10 g/dl) was suggested in a case series of trauma patients as early as 1942. Several clinical trials conducted over the past two decades have shown at least equivalent outcomes when a more-conservative transfusion threshold of hemoglobin 7 g/dl is applied to a critically ill patient population, whereas other prospective and retrospective studies have shown a hazard associated with RBC transfusion > 7 g/dl in a variety of patient populations. This heterogeneity in outcomes suggests that the impact of RBC transfusion on mortality varies depending on the patient population studied, the transfusion threshold used, and the age of the RBCs transfused. Multivariate regression analysis, adjusting for illness severity, reported that RBC transfusion was not associated with an increase in mortality among ICU patients. In fact, a protective effect at 30 days was noted after propensity score matching. For patients with cardiovascular disease, the relation between RBC transfusion and clinical outcome is even more complex. Data from almost 79,000 patients older than 65 years who had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) found an association between the RBC transfusion and improved outcomes in elderly patients when admission hematocrit values were < 33%. Conversely, other retrospective trials have consistently shown that RBC transfusions are associated with adverse outcome in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or acute coronary syndrome. The recent randomized, single-center TRACS (Transfusion Requirements after Cardiac Surgery) trial compared a restrictive with a liberal strategy (transfusion for hematocrit < 24% or < 30%, respectively), and reported no difference in the composite end point of 30-day mortality and morbidity (cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute kidney injury).

We hypothesize that these varying results stem from a complex interplay between RBC transfusion, patient characteristics, and clinical context. Specifically, we aim to test whether age, comorbid conditions, and clinical context modulate the effect of RBC transfusion on mortality. We therefore analyzed the impact of RBC transfusion in the critical ill not only in the overall population but also in clinically important subgroups of patients in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^19b5973d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Acute and Chronic Anemia

Acute anemia was observed in 34.3% (n = 1078) of included participants and chronic anemia in 65.7% (n = 2066). The median time from admission to randomization was 5 (IQR, 3–8) days for patients with acute anemia and 2 (IQR, 1–4) days for those with chronic anemia (Table 1). The median (first and third quartiles) Hb decrease from admission to randomization was 3.6 (IQR, 2.6–5.3) g/dL in the acute anemia group and 0.7 (IQR, 0.2–1.3) g/dL in the chronic anemia group (among the 1816 participants with chronic anemia [87.9%] and at least 2 Hb measurements prior to randomization). Participants with acute anemia had fewer chronic comorbidities (eg, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes), were more often current smokers, more frequently had a type 1 MI, were more likely to have undergone a percutaneous intervention and be treated with a higher number of antithrombotic agents, and had a more severe clinical course prior to randomization (more bleeding episodes, requirements for at least 1 transfusion, use of mechanical ventilation, and days in critical care units). Participants with acute anemia and those with chronic anemia received a similar number of RBC units both before and after randomization (Table 1; eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

Association Between Acute Anemia and Outcomes

The crude and adjusted associations between anemia acuity and outcomes are reported in Table 2. After adjustment for potential confounders, acute anemia was associated with a 25% higher incidence of death or recurrent MI (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05–1.48), a 47% higher incidence of death (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16–1.86), and a 36% higher incidence of pulmonary complications (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.66) compared with chronic anemia at 30 days after randomization (Table 2; eTable 3 in Supplement 2). Risks of recurrent MI, heart failure, cardiac death, and major bleeding were similar among patients with acute anemia and chronic anemia.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^7052ae30]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Design and Population

This is a secondary analysis of the MINT trial reporting prespecified subgroup (effect modification) analyses of the randomized intervention. The main trial protocol and the statistical analytical plan are available in Supplement 1. Each site's institutional review board approved the study, and local research staff obtained informed consent from all participants before inclusion. We reported this secondary analysis using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline and interpreted the credibility of our results using the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) framework.

Briefly, the MINT trial randomized participants who were hospitalized with type 1, 2, 4b, or 4c MI and a hemoglobin (Hb) level less than 10 g/dL during hospitalization (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) in a 1:1 ratio to either a restrictive (RBC transfusion permitted for an Hb level < 8 g/dL and strongly encouraged for an Hb level < 7 g/dL) or a liberal (RBC transfusion required for any Hb level < 10 g/dL) RBC transfusion strategy. Patients were excluded if they had uncontrolled bleeding, were receiving palliative treatment, were already scheduled for cardiac surgery, or declined blood transfusion. For this secondary analysis, we included participants in whom a first Hb measurement was available prior to any transfusion on the day of or on the day after admission of the index hospitalization.

Acute and Chronic Anemia Definitions

The exposure of interest was acute (acquired during the hospitalization) vs chronic anemia at randomization. Since there is no established definition of acute anemia in this context, we internally developed a definition through expert consensus and prior to conducting any analyses. We considered participants to have acute anemia if they met the following criteria: having an admission Hb level above the World Health Organization (WHO) anemia definition thresholds (13 g/dL in men, 12 g/dL in women) followed by a decrease to the randomization threshold (< 10 g/dL) or having an admission Hb value below the WHO thresholds followed by a decrease of 2 g/dL or more prior to randomization. The remaining participants, those with an admission Hb level below the WHO thresholds and a decrease of Hb less than 2 g/dL prior to randomization, were considered to have chronic anemia. When only a single Hb measurement was available prior to randomization, participants were classified as having chronic anemia. An unobserved decrease of 1 g/dL was assumed for each RBC unit received between hospital admission and randomization.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^498d2baa]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome — restrictive versus permissive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion outcomes indicate a trend toward higher mortality with the restrictive approach without statistical significance, with pooled relative risk (RR) 1.13 (95% CI, 0.67–1.91). In trial data, 30-day mortality was 9.9% in the restrictive group versus 8.3% in the permissive group (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.96–1.47), and cardiac death rates were 5.5% versus 3.2% (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.40). One-year mortality was 23.1% versus 20.4% (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.74–4.69). Point estimates for myocardial infarction (MI) or death and for recurrent MI consistently favored the permissive strategy. No significant differences were identified for hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, or adverse events. In pooled ACS data (Table 4), 30-day mortality had RR 1.13 (0.67–1.91) with an absolute difference of 10 more per 1,000 (26 fewer-73 more); infections had RR 0.87 (0.17–4.40) with 10 fewer per 1,000 (61 fewer-252 more); thromboembolism had RR 0.75 (0.46–1.24) with 5 fewer per 1,000 (10 fewer-5 more). Other guidance noted suggested an RBC threshold of 9 to 10 g/dL in patients with ACS, while "the panel opted to suggest against a restrictive approach."

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes with anemia — MINT trial transfusion strategies and outcomes: The MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) trial randomly assigned 3504 patients with acute STEMI or NSTEMI and anemia with a blood hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL (13% with recent bleeding) to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusing if the hemoglobin level was < 7–8 g/dL) or a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusing if the hemoglobin level was ≤ 10 g/dL). The primary outcome of 30-day death or recurrent MI occurred in 16.9% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 14.5% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99–1.34]; P = 0.07); death occurred in 9.9% versus 8.3% (relative risk, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94–1.49]), and cardiac death occurred in 5.5% versus 3.0% (relative risk, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.26–2.40]). Although the trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in its primary endpoint, the results suggest that a liberal blood transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL may provide short-term clinical benefit over a restrictive transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL in patients with AMI and anemia.

Anemia management in acute coronary syndromes — the guideline assigns COR 2b and LOE B-R and states: "In patients with ACS and acute or chronic anemia, blood transfusion to achieve a hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL may be reasonable to reduce cardiovascular events." For ACS populations, randomized trial evidence "suggests possible clinical benefit for a more liberal transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 10 g/dL compared with targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL." In MINT, "3504 patients with acute STEMI or NSTEMI and anemia with a blood hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL" were assigned to restrictive transfusion "(transfusing if the hemoglobin level was < 7–8 g/dL)" versus liberal "(transfusing if the hemoglobin level was < 10 g/dL)." The primary outcome of 30‑day death or recurrent MI occurred in "16.9% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 14.5% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99–1.34]; P = 0.07)." Death occurred in "9.9%" versus "8.3%" (relative risk, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.95–1.49]) and cardiac death in "5.5%" versus "3.2%" (relative risk, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.26–2.40]). Although the trial's primary endpoint was not significantly reduced, "the results suggest that a liberal blood transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL may provide short-term clinical benefit over a restrictive transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL in patients with AMI and anemia."

### Rationale and design for the myocardial ischemia and transfusion (MINT) randomized clinical trial [^0877cf6c]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accumulating evidence from clinical trials suggests that a lower (restrictive) hemoglobin threshold (< 8 g/dL) for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, compared with a higher (liberal) threshold (≥ 10 g/dL) is safe. However, in anemic patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), maintaining a higher hemoglobin level may increase oxygen delivery to vulnerable myocardium resulting in improved clinical outcomes. Conversely, RBC transfusion may result in increased blood viscosity, vascular inflammation, and reduction in available nitric oxide resulting in worse clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that a liberal transfusion strategy would improve clinical outcomes as compared to a more restrictive strategy.

Methods

We will enroll 3500 patients with acute MI (type 1, 2, 4b or 4c) as defined by the Third Universal Definition of MI and a hemoglobin < 10 g/dL at 144 centers in the United States, Canada, France, Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia. We randomly assign trial participants to a liberal or restrictive transfusion strategy. Participants assigned to the liberal strategy receive transfusion of RBCs sufficient to raise their hemoglobin to at least 10 g/dL. Participants assigned to the restrictive strategy are permitted to receive transfusion of RBCs if the hemoglobin falls below 8 g/dL or for persistent angina despite medical therapy. We will contact each participant at 30 days to assess clinical outcomes and at 180 days to ascertain vital status. The primary end point is a composite of all-cause death or recurrent MI through 30 days following randomization. Secondary end points include all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent adjudicated MI, and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, nonfatal recurrent MI, ischemia driven unscheduled coronary revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting), or readmission to the hospital for ischemic cardiac diagnosis within 30 days. The trial will assess multiple tertiary end points.

Conclusions

The MINT trial will inform RBC transfusion practice in patients with acute MI.

### Blood transfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction, anemia, and heart failure: lessons from MINT [^10871636]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood transfusion may precipitate adverse outcomes, including heart failure (HF), among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). This study characterizes the effects of a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy on outcomes in patients with MI and anemia with and without baseline HF.

Methods

In the MINT trial (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion), 3504 patients with MI and anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) were randomized to a restrictive (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL) or liberal (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) transfusion strategy. We compared the effects of transfusion strategy on outcomes among patients with and without baseline HF. The primary outcome was death or HF at 30 days.

Results

Compared with patients without baseline HF (n = 1633), those with baseline HF (n = 1871) had higher rates of death or HF (18.0% versus 10.0%) at 30 days. Restrictive transfusion resulted in numerically higher rates of death or HF (rate ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.99–1.45] versus 0.94 [95% CI, 0.70–1.26]; P interaction = 0.18) in patients with than in those without baseline HF. Among secondary outcomes, death or recurrent MI and death were more frequent among those with baseline HF. Restrictive transfusion resulted in numerically higher rates of death or MI and death in patients with than in those without baseline HF. Rates of HF were similar between restrictive and liberal transfusion in patients with baseline HF but lower with restrictive transfusion (rate ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.29–0.92]; P interaction = 0.02) in patients without baseline HF.

Conclusions

A liberal transfusion strategy is safe for patients with MI and anemia, including those with baseline HF. Restrictive transfusion tended to result in worse outcomes, particularly in patients with baseline HF.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^6ceaea25]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^6e282390]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

RBC Transfusion Strategy Effect Modification by Anemia Acuity

The estimated effects of the restrictive transfusion strategy compared with the liberal one in the full sample as well as in subgroups of anemia acuity are reported in Figure 2. There was no differential effect of transfusion strategy with respect to anemia acuity for any outcome on either the RR or the additive scale (Figure 2; eTable 4 and eTable 5 in Supplement 2). For the primary composite outcome of death or recurrent MI, the effect of a restrictive strategy compared with a liberal one had a RR of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.97–1.48) in the chronic anemia stratum and an RR of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.85–1.40) in the acute anemia stratum (P = 0.57 for interaction).

Sensitivity Analyses

When using the alternative definition of acute anemia, 339 participants (10.8%) were classified as having pure hospital-acquired acute anemia. The association between acute anemia and the primary outcome became null (adjusted RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72–1.26), and the point estimates for death and pulmonary complications became nonsignificant (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). Results of the effect modification analyses were similar (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). The effect of the transfusion strategy on transfusion-related pulmonary complications only (TACO and TRALI) was not modified by anemia acuity (eTable 5 in Supplement 2), although the risk of this outcome was lower in the restrictive group. The results of our sensitivity analyses restricted to participants randomized 3 days or more after hospital admission and those who did not receive a transfusion prior to randomization are reported in eTable 6, eTable 7, eFigure 2, and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2. All results were similar to the main analyses (eTables 6 and 7, eFigures 2 and 3 in Supplement 2).

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^35e4308b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We estimated the intention-to-treat intervention effect (restrictive vs liberal transfusion strategies) on every outcome in the full sample and within each anemia acuity group. We used multivariable mixed-effects log-binomial regressions with a random effect for clinical sites, adjusted for the same prognostic factors and potential confounders mentioned above. We included a variable for anemia acuity, the randomized intervention, and an interaction term between the 2 to test whether anemia acuity modified the intervention effect. We reported RRs with 95% CIs and the P value for the interaction test (multiplicative scale [RR]). We also reported the relative excess risk due to the interaction with 95% clustered bootstrap CI with 1000 resamples to express the effect modification on the additive scale.

With unpaired testing, the α level was set at.05. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

We performed 4 sensitivity analyses. For the first, we used an alternative definition of acute anemia to only include patients with an Hb level at admission above the WHO threshold for anemia, thus creating a group with purely hospital-acquired acute anemia. In this modified definition, all patients with WHO-defined anemia at admission were classified as having chronic anemia. In a second sensitivity analysis, we restricted our analysis of pulmonary complications to only transfusion-related pulmonary complications (TACO and TRALI together). In a third sensitivity analysis, we restricted all analyses to participants randomized at least 3 days after hospital admission to allow sufficient time for acute anemia to develop and thus limit potential time bias. In a last sensitivity analysis, we excluded participants who received any RBC transfusion prior to randomization to evaluate whether our results were sensitive to the assumed Hb decrease concealed by transfusion.

### Red cell transfusion in acute myocardial infarction: AABB international clinical practice guidelines [^86b7636d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

Optimal transfusion strategies for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are uncertain. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations for red blood cell transfusion in patients with AMI.

Methods

These guidelines are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials of patients presenting with AMI and assigned to 2 different transfusion strategies (restrictive or liberal) based on hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit levels before receipt of a transfusion. A meta-analysis of eligible trials was performed using Cochrane methods. The international panel followed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to summarize evidence and formulate recommendations. This guideline's primary perspective is that of the patient, including medical, financial, and psychological effects, with secondary consideration of health care system issues, particularly conservation of the limited and costly blood supply.

Recommendation

For hospitalized patients with AMI, the panel suggests a liberal red cell transfusion strategy when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 10 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). A restrictive strategy of 7 to 8 g/dL may result in increased mortality in patients with AMI. The direction of the recommendation for the liberal strategy was based on the great importance of mortality for patients. The conditional recommendation was based on the low certainty of evidence and the competing consideration of blood supply conservation. Clinicians should adopt mitigation strategies to reduce potential adverse events associated with a liberal transfusion strategy, and all transfusion decisions should incorporate the clinical context rather than solely the hemoglobin concentration.

### Transfusion thresholds for acute coronary syndromes-insights from the TRICS-III randomized controlled trial, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^a1e41c42]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Our systematic review identified 274 distinct citations. A total of 3 RCTs met the eligibility criteria, yielding a total of 4 studies (1015 patients). The transfusion strategies were similar across all studies. Trials evaluating transfusion thresholds are unable to blind study staff and participants to treatment allocation; thus, all trials had a high risk for performance bias. Restrictive transfusion was associated with a trend toward an increased the risk of MACE (RD, 4% [95% CI, −1% to 9%]; I² = 0%) and MI (RD, 3% [95% CI, 0%–6%]; I² = 0%) at the longest available timepoint (Figure). These CIs exclude major benefits from restrictive transfusion (exclude > 1% reduction in absolute risk) and do not exclude important harm (do not exclude ≥ 6% increases in absolute risk). At 40% of the critical information size, the trial‐sequential analysis for MACE did not cross the boundary for superiority or futility, suggesting more evidence is needed to consider this association as conclusive.

Prior meta‐analyses demonstrating no clinical benefit of a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy in ACS have been limited by a lack of availability of data and ability to evaluate only short‐term outcomes. We provide new, high‐quality, randomized data on long‐term outcomes and synthesize the results across RCTs with low clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that liberal transfusion strategies may decrease the risk for long‐term MACE and MI. This effect was similar across trials evaluating patients primarily receiving nonsurgical and surgical management of ACS.

It is possible that differences in preexisting anemia or transfusion protocol suspensions may have led to bias in the effect estimates. Emerging evidence suggests that restrictive transfusion strategies are no longer cost‐effective after 1 year; therefore, adoption of liberal strategies may improve patient outcomes without increasing cost burden to the health care system. This unrealized benefit may be considerably large, as 5 of 6 respondents from a recent poll by the American College of Cardiology reported using a restrictive transfusion strategy in their current clinical practice for this patient population. Long‐term data from the ongoing MI and ischemia RCT (NCT02981407) will provide evidence for establishing the conclusiveness of our findings.

In summary, a liberal transfusion strategy versus restrictive strategy may improve long‐term cardiovascular outcomes in patients hospitalized for ACSs. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to this effect and confirm these findings.

### Hemoglobin-based transfusion strategies for cardiovascular and other diseases: restrictive, liberal, or neither? [^9fb0c6a1]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A "restrictive" red blood cell transfusion threshold, a hemoglobin concentration < 7 to 8 g/dL, has long been recommended for most hospitalized patients including anemic patients with stable cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although no threshold recommendation is given for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), recent evidence suggests that "liberal" rather than "restrictive" transfusion strategies are associated with significantly improved safety for hospitalized patients with stable CVD and/or ACS. This finding suggests that previously available data were misinterpreted. Conclusions drawn from earlier transfusion trigger trials have been confounded by unintentional trial design and analysis flaws that have contributed to erroneous recommendations regarding the safety of a restrictive threshold. Subsequently, these conclusions have been incorporated into widely accepted guidelines and clinical practice. Management with a restrictive vs liberal transfusion strategy (< 10 g/dL) increases the risk of new-onset ACS in patients with CVD by ∼2%. We estimate that since 2019, using hospital databases and a recent meta-analysis, this practice may have resulted in ∼700 excess ACS events per year in orthopedic surgical patients. Given these findings, transfusion practices in other clinical conditions, particularly those derived from similar transfusion trigger trials, should be questioned. Restrictive and liberal transfusion policies merit a general reconsideration. Rather than a single numerical transfusion trigger, transfusion therapy should be personalized. Consideration of an individual patient's age, clinical status, and comorbidities is integral to transfusing. To avoid making similar errors, future trials of transfusion therapy should determine common practices before study inception and incorporate them as a usual-care "control" comparator arm into the trial design. Such studies should more reliably improve current transfusion practice.

AABB guideline panel statements on thresholds note that the panel chose not to recommend for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for patients with acute myocardial infarction; the panel noted that the MINT trial (including 3500 participants with acute myocardial infarction) compares a liberal transfusion at 10 g/dL with a restrictive transfusion strategy of 7 to 8 g/dL; in hematology and oncology inpatients, the panel suggests transfusion at 7 g/dL (conditional, low certainty evidence).

### Anemia acuity effect on transfusion strategies in acute myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the MINT trial [^f0c154f3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Physiologic adaptative mechanisms to anemia, such as increases in cardiac output, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels (decreasing Hb oxygen–binding affinity), tissue oxygen extraction, and redistribution of regional blood flow in favor of coronary and cerebral circulation, may not have sufficient time to occur and sustain tissue oxygen delivery in acute anemia. In the context of acute MI, the additional myocardial oxygen consumption caused by the required acute increase in cardiac output may further worsen clinical outcomes. We thus hypothesized that a more liberal RBC transfusion strategy after acute MI might improve tissue oxygen delivery (including myocardial oxygen delivery), reduce tissue hypoxia, and improve outcomes, especially in patients with acute anemia. However, our findings did not support this hypothesis. Acute anemia was not associated with an increased risk of recurrent MI, and the transfusion strategy did not have a larger effect on the outcomes in patients with MI and acute anemia.

Our findings suggest that acute anemia was a marker of a more complex and morbid clinical course. Patients with acute anemia had evidence of increased acute blood loss, hemodynamic instability, and requirement for critical care, including mechanical ventilation, prior to randomization. The associations we observed between anemia acuity and mortality could be the effect of acutely occurring anemia itself, with its limited time for physiologic adaptation and worse tissue hypoxia, but was likely more the effect of the more severe underlying disease. In this context, a liberal RBC transfusion strategy did not have a larger effect in these patients. This strategy either did not provide any additional oxygen delivery benefit because of unimportant or ineffective differences in the adaptative mechanisms between acute and chronic anemia or provided oxygen delivery benefits that were countered by harm from transfusions administered to acutely ill patients. In prior studies involving critically ill patients with acute multisystemic diseases or acute bleeding, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy resulted in either similar or lower hospital mortality while requiring fewer RBC transfusions. Shared characteristics of multisystem organ dysfunction between patients with acute anemia in our study and other critically ill populations may explain our observations. Whether there is a larger benefit of a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with acute anemia, acute MI, and less severe illness will require further study.

Table 1
Hemoglobin levels to diagnose anemia at sea level (g/l)

Anemia in the perioperative period and in critically ill patients is a particular problem. The rate of preoperative anemia depends on age, sex, comorbidity and surgical pathology and can reach up to 75%. Despite such a high prevalence in clinical practice, preoperative anemia has long been perceived as a relatively minor problem that can be easily eliminated by blood transfusion. Meanwhile, numerous clinical trials suggest that preoperative anemia is associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality in both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery patients. Transfusion of RBCs remains the most common approach for perioperative anemia treatment. Thus, the American Red Cross reports that nearly 16 million blood components units are transfused annually in the USA, with approximately 29,000 units of RBCs needed daily.

Table 2
Clinical trials demonstrating the impact of blood transfusion on clinical outcomes

As shown in Table 2, blood transfusion has varying effects on clinical outcomes — both improvement outcomes and an increase in the risks of adverse outcomes. A similar situation arises in studies comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies. For example, in the randomized 'Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC)'trial, a restrictive strategy showed a similar 30-day mortality compared to a liberal strategy in critically ill patients. However, mortality in the restrictive group was significantly lower among the subgroups- patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of ≤ 20 and younger patients (less than 55 years) and was also lower during hospitalization. Nevertheless, there was no difference in mortality among patients with cardiac pathology. In accordance, another multicenter randomized trial demonstrated an identical mortality rate in septic shock patients between a liberal and restrictive transfusion strategy. The number of patients experiencing ischemic events (including cerebral ischemia and acute myocardial ischemia), adverse transfusion reactions and requiring life support were comparable in both groups. Additionally, more recently, a systematic Cochrane database review analysed 48 trials and showed that a restrictive blood transfusion strategy led to a 41% reduction in the proportion of individuals subjected to red blood cell transfusions. Authors suggested that there is no evidence of influence of the restrictive strategy on mortality and morbidity (such as stroke and myocardial infarction). Nevertheless, the authors emphasized that in some patient groups, higher hemoglobin levels may be preferable, but there was insufficient evidence to recommend applying a specific strategy to certain patient subgroups (traumatic brain injury, myocardial infarction, etc). Importantly, the authors were of the conviction that hemoglobin levels do not always reliably reflect the need for transfusion in some patients. A further large meta-analysis also demonstrated a reduction in in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients treated with a restrictive transfusion strategy. On the other hand, a liberal blood transfusion strategy improved survival and decreased complications specifically in elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular diseases. This issue is well described by Patel and co-authors, who, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, compared both cardiac and non-cardiac randomized clinical trials, as well as observational studies, investigating restrictive and liberal strategies. The authors demonstrated that the results of randomized studies in cardiac surgery were not in accordance with the a general assumption that a liberal strategy significantly increases mortality and morbidity. Thus available evidence supports the inconsistency of the hemoglobin level as a transfusion trigger, especially in specific cohorts of patients. However, several modern guidelines suggest using the hemoglobin level as the only blood transfusion trigger and in most cases recommend a restrictive strategy.

Research Priorities

Studying the feasibility, implementation, and adherence to a restrictive transfusion strategy in acute GIB is a priority. Additionally, examining interprofessional knowledge transmission through a systems-based approach that adheres to the principles of quality improvement is essential.

Question 3: Should critically ill patients with acute coronary syndrome be treated with a restrictive or permissive RBC transfusion strategy?

3. In critically ill patients with acute coronary syndrome, we suggest against a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence).

Justification

The optimal transfusion strategy for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been controversial, balancing improved oxygen delivery to the myocardium against the potential expansion of vascular volume and increase in blood viscosity from overtransfusion. This recommendation is supported by four RCTs involving a total of 4,324 patients (evidence profile 3, supplementary material).,

The pooled analysis showed a trend toward higher mortality with the restrictive approach (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.67–1.91), but this difference was not statistically significant. The MINT trial substantially influenced this analysis because of its large sample size because it recruited three times more patients than the other studies combined. The 30-day mortality in the restrictive group was 9.9%, compared with 8.3% in the permissive group, a difference not reaching statistical significance (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.96–1.47). However, cardiac death rates were 5.5% in the restrictive group and 3.2% in the permissive group (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.40). Moreover, the point estimates for myocardial infarction (MI) or death and for recurrent MI consistently favored the permissive strategy. Although a statistically significant increase in adverse outcomes such as death and recurrent MI might not have been found, concern exists that a restrictive approach allowing hemoglobin levels of 7 or 8 g/dL might increase the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute MI. From these data, it was unclear whether a gradient effect was present in which risk progressively increased to < 10 g/dL or a threshold effect at 10 g/dL. That is, these data do not indicate whether 9 g/dL is as safe as 10 g/dL. Patient symptoms and physiologic variables should be considered when choosing a transfusion threshold for patients with ACS.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review [^3586df8e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia is a fairly common clinical and hematological syndrome with a decrease in hemoglobin level as the main diagnostic criterion. Existing conservative drug treatments cannot always be used in patients in the perioperative period. The main treatment for anemia is blood transfusion, and the main trigger is the hemoglobin level. Sometimes additional triggers are used such as clinical signs of anemic syndrome. However, the clinical signs of anemia are not specific and cannot always be used in the clinical practice. Numerous studies have shown that both anemia and blood transfusion are independent factors that worsen outcomes.

The generally accepted consensus between these two problems is currently being solved by a restrictive transfusion strategy with reference points to a lower threshold hemoglobin level. However this strategy does not take into account some features of patients with comorbidities. As a result, studies on the threshold level of hemoglobin in patients with various acute diseases remain controversial. This fact has recently been emphasized by the results from the Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion (MINT) trial, which evaluated whether a restrictive transfusion strategy (hemoglobin trigger, 7–8 g/dL) differed from a liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin trigger, < 10 g/dL) among patiens with acute myocardial infarction. Although the groups did not differ significantly regarding the primary composite outcome recurrent myocardial infarction or death at 30 days, the liberal treatment showed advantages in specific subgruoups. This underlines again the importance of a multifactorial approach which addresses multiple patient specific risk factors and confirms the need for alternative blood transfusion triggers.

Despite the availability and interest in physiologic blood transfusion triggers, the level of evidence for their use is extremely low, which is primarily due to the lack of large randomized trials. At the same time, the need for personification of blood transfusion therapy is necessary. Vincent J.L. in one of his recent articles, gives a simple example: a hemoglobin level of 80 g/l is safe in a young healthy patient with an injury and the same hemoglobin level in an elderly patient with severe tachycardia and a history of myocardial infarction can play a critical role. Current recommendations do not provide a clear solution to resolve this dilemma.

The application and study of alternative triggers for blood transfusion are crucial for several reasons. First, traditional triggers for transfusion, such as hemoglobin levels, may not fully capture an individual patient's oxygen-carrying capacity and overall physiological status. By exploring alternative triggers, we can potentially identify more accurate and tailored indicators of when a patient truly requires a blood transfusion.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^cae673e6]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-term follow-up of patients described a 1-year mortality of 23.1% in the restrictive and 20.4% in the permissive group (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.74–4.69). Moreover, no significant differences were identified in hospital LOS, ICU LOS, or the risk of adverse events (Table 4). Overall, the increased point estimates in the risk of 30-day mortality, need for revascularization, and cardiac and renal adverse effects associated with a restrictive transfusion strategy outweighed the potential benefits on lower rates of infection and thromboembolism.

Table 4
Pooled Analysis Comparing Restrictive vs Permissive Strategies in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome

What Others Are Saying

The ESICM guidelines, released before the publication of the MINT trial, suggested an RBC transfusion threshold of 9 to 10 g/dL in patients with ACS. However, given that it is unclear if a difference in outcomes occurs at higher hemoglobin levels, even in the range of a permissive approach, the panel opted to suggest against a restrictive approach.

Research Priorities

Studies exploring the impact on patient outcomes of a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of 8 g/dL or 9 g/dL are necessary. Further exploration of effect modifiers within the MINT trial may help to guide clinicians. Subgroup analysis, especially focused on type 1 MI vs 2 MI, as well as patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, are welcomed.

### Transfusion strategy effect on quality of life in patients with myocardial infarction and anemia… [^a871c735]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does a liberal vs restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy affect health-related quality of life in patients with myocardial infarction and anemia. Findings. In this prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial including 2844 patients, no differences were observed for any QOL outcome between a liberal vs restrictive transfusion strategy at 30 days postrandomization. Meaning Higher hemoglobin levels maintained with RBC transfusion may not offer significant benefits to QOL overall in patients with MI and anemia. Importance Both myocardial infarction and anemia have deleterious effects on health-related quality of life. Red blood cell transfusion may improve QOL after MI by relieving symptoms and/or increasing functional capacity.

Objective To evaluate whether a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a more restrictive transfusion strategy affects QOL in patients with MI and anemia. The MINT trial randomized patients to a restrictive or a liberal RBC transfusion strategy. Main Outcomes and Measures QOL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L 30 days after randomization. Results Of 2844 included patients, 1551 were male, and the mean age was 71. 9 years. A total of 2525 had QOL data, and 319 died before 30-day follow-up. Overall, there were no differences in mean or median scores for any EQ-5D-5L QOL outcome between assigned transfusion strategies at 30 days postrandomization.

Conclusions and Relevance This secondary analysis of the MINT trial found that in patients with MI and anemia, a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy did not affect QOL outcomes 30 days after randomization. This suggests that higher Hb levels maintained with RBC transfusion may not offer significant benefits to QOL overall in patients with MI and anemia. Additional studies may be useful for further examining and validating transfusion's effect on QOL in patients with MI and heart failure.

### Clinical trials evaluating red blood cell transfusion thresholds: an updated systematic review and with additional focus on patients with cardiovascular disease [^0e5e6050]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several new trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with cardiovascular disease have recently been published, increasing the number of enrolled patients by over 30%. The objective was to evaluate transfusion thresholds in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We conducted an updated systematic review of randomized trials that compared patients assigned to maintain a lower (restrictive transfusion strategy) or higher (liberal transfusion strategy) hemoglobin concentration. We focused on new trial data in patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Specific subgroups were patients undergoing cardiac surgery and with acute myocardial infarction.

Results

A total of 37 trials that enrolled 19,049 patients were appraised. In cardiac surgery, mortality at 30days was comparable between groups (risk ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.74–1.33). In 2 small trials (n = 154) in patients with myocardial infarction, the point estimate for the mortality risk ratio was 3.88 (95% CI, 0.83–18.13) favoring the liberal strategy. Overall, from 26 trials enrolling 15,681 patients, 30-day mortality was not different between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies (risk ratio 1.0, 95% CI, 0.86–1.16). Overall and in the cardiovascular disease subgroup, there were no significant differences observed across a range of secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

New trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery establish that a restrictive transfusion strategy of 7 to 8g/dL is safe and decreased red cell use by 24%. Further research is needed to define the optimal transfusion threshold in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

### Relationship of blood transfusion and clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^70002d24]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

It is unclear if blood transfusion in anemic patients with acute coronary syndromes is associated with improved survival.

Objective

To determine the association between blood transfusion and mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes who develop bleeding, anemia, or both during their hospital course.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed 24,112 enrollees in 3 large international trials of patients with acute coronary syndromes (the GUSTO IIb, PURSUIT, and PARAGON B trials). Patients were grouped according to whether they received a blood transfusion during the hospitalization. The association between transfusion and outcome was assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling that incorporated transfusion as a time-dependent covariate and the propensity to receive blood, and a landmark analysis.

Main Outcome Measure

Thirty-day mortality.

Results

Of the patients included, 2401 (10.0%) underwent at least 1 blood transfusion during their hospitalization. Patients who underwent transfusion were older and had more comorbid illness at presentation and also had a significantly higher unadjusted rate of 30-day death (8.00% vs 3.08%; P < .001), myocardial infarction (MI) (25.16% vs 8.16%; P < .001), and death/MI (29.24% vs 10.02%; P < .001) compared with patients who did not undergo transfusion. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling that incorporated transfusion as a time-dependent covariate, transfusion was associated with an increased hazard for 30-day death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.26–4.75) and 30-day death/MI (HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.55–3.35). In the landmark analysis that included procedures and bleeding events, transfusion was associated with a trend toward increased mortality. The predicted probability of 30-day death was higher with transfusion at nadir hematocrit values above 25%.

Conclusions

Blood transfusion in the setting of acute coronary syndromes is associated with higher mortality, and this relationship persists after adjustment for other predictive factors and timing of events. Given the limitations of post hoc analysis of clinical trials data, a randomized trial of transfusion strategies is warranted to resolve the disparity in results between our study and other observational studies. We suggest caution regarding the routine use of blood transfusion to maintain arbitrary hematocrit levels in stable patients with ischemic heart disease.

### How low is too low? Cardiac risks with anemia [^2fcf8063]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Despite the increasing availability of data supporting more restrictive transfusion practices, the risks and benefits of transfusing critically ill patients continue to evoke controversy. Past retrospective and observational studies suggested that liberal transfusion strategies were more beneficial in patients whose hematocrit levels fell below 30%. An expanding body of literature suggests that an arbitrary trigger for transfusion (the '10/30 rule') is ill advised. A recent randomized controlled trial provided compelling evidence that similar, and in some cases better, outcomes result if a restrictive transfusion strategy is maintained. The impact of this accumulating evidence on clinical practice is evident in large reports, which show that the average transfusion trigger in critically ill patients was a hemoglobin level in the range 8–8.5 g/dl. Based on the available evidence, transfusion in the critically ill patient without active ischemic heart disease should generally be withheld until the hemoglobin level falls to 7 g/dl. Transfusions should be administered as clinically indicated for patients with acute, ongoing blood loss and those who have objective signs and symptoms of anemia despite maintenance of euvolemia. The hemoglobin level at which serious morbidity or mortality occurs in critically ill patients with active ischemic heart disease is a subject of continued debate but it is likely that a set transfusion trigger will not provide an optimal risk-benefit profile in this population.

### Relationship between anemia and mortality outcomes in a national acute coronary syndrome cohort: insights from the UK myocardial ischemia national audit project registry [^9f272bf5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our analysis suggests that anemia is independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients presenting with ACS. There is a lack of clarity in contemporary guideline recommendations as to whether such patients with anemia should be transfused and the optimal transfusion strategy. 33 The American Association of Blood Banks recommendation for patients presenting with ACS is "No recommendation for or against a liberal or restrictive transfusion threshold for hospitalized, hemodynamically stable patients with acute coronary syndrome." 33 Furthermore, the CRIT (conservative vs liberal red cell transfusion in acute myocardial infarction) randomized pilot trial 34 demonstrated that patients with ACS and a hematocrit level < 30% who were randomized to a liberal transfusion arm had a significantly higher composite endpoint of in‐hospital death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure than those who underwent more restrictive transfusion practice (38% vs 13%; P = 0.046). In contrast, in the MINT (A Multicenter, Randomized Study of Argatroban Versus Heparin as Adjunct to Tissue Plasminogen Activator [TPA] in Acute Myocardial Infarction: Myocardial Infarction With Novastan and TPA) pilot study undertaken in 110 patients presenting with an ACS or stable angina with anemia undergoing cardiac catheterization, patients randomized to a liberal blood transfusion strategy had 50% lower primary outcome rates of death, myocardial infarction, and unscheduled revascularization compared to those patients randomized to a restrictive transfusion strategy, with lower 30‐day mortality too. A recent meta‐analysis of 10 studies consisting mainly of registry studies including 203 665 patients has shown a close to 3‐fold independent increase in the risk of mortality associated with a liberal blood transfusion strategy in the AMI setting with meta‐regression adjusting for a history of bleeding or baseline hemoglobin level revealing a similar increased risk, indicating a significant risk for blood transfusion over and above that associated with bleeding or anemia, 35 with similar findings reported in the PCI setting. 36

### Risks of restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients with cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis [^27bbd783]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). Medium credibility.

In individuals with preexisting CVD who are hospitalized for ACS, orthopedic surgery, or other noncardiac surgery indications, the restrictive transfusion triggers (as shown in the Figure; range, 7–9.7; median, 8 g/dL) were associated with a significant increase in the outcomes of ACS and mortality rates. The most recent and largest RTTT studying subjects with acute myocardial infarctions used a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL and achieved on average a hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL in the restrictive arm. The restrictive trigger threshold was associated with an increased combined risk of myocardial infarction and death as compared with hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL in the liberal threshold arm (P = 0.07; Figure). This is consistent with the findings of our meta-analysis, which has many more subjects enrolled, giving our study the added statistical power needed to show significance. We conclude that the summary data support the use of a liberal transfusion threshold as opposed to a restrictive approach for patients with CVD. Physicians must consider pertinent cardiac comorbidities and other clinical variables when making decisions about appropriate liberal transfusion thresholds. Whereas such a statement is usually appended to transfusion guidelines, too often the hemoglobin value alone remains the trigger for transfusion. Transfusion practice guidelines should update recommendations to incorporate the mounting evidence for harm when restrictive thresholds are used for patients with CVD with ACS or hospitalized for noncardiac reasons.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^48a1b221]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

While the RBC transfusion recommendations are fundamentally well founded, there remain limitations in our understanding of the indications, risks, and benefits of such transfusion. These knowledge gaps are particularly prevalent in the gray zones of RBC transfusion practice, such as in the setting of active bleeding, the potential for end-organ ischemia (for example, myocardial ischemia, septic shock), and neurologic illness and injury. Such gaps raise serious concern when adherence to the restrictive transfusion guidelines is broadly promulgated in the current clinical literature, emphasizing a broad endorsement of the guideline. To suggest that such a view is unfounded, it may be noted that broad-based measures have been recently applied in assessing compliance with the aforementioned restrictive guidelines. While the decision to transfuse RBC should be based upon a comprehensive, patient-specific clinical assessment, deviation from the target of such published compliance measures has been specifically criticized as failure of their adherence.

To provide the physician with a RBC transfusion compass, we reviewed the clinical research data in support of a restrictive or a more liberal RBC transfusion practice, and examined the quality and content of the datasets. Reviewed studies included PubMed-cited (1974 to 2013) prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective subset analyses of randomized studies, nonrandomized controlled trials, observational case series, consecutive and nonconsecutive case series, and review articles. Prospective RCTs were acknowledged and emphasized as the best-quality evidence. We have organized the review to provide a synopsis of RBC transfusion trial data, risks of anemia and transfusion, concerns in the bleeding versus nonbleeding patient, and specific issues regarding RBC transfusion that arise in one common clinical scenario – interventional cardiology.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^dfa56f4a]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Red blood cells

In patients who are haemodynamically stable and not bleeding, haemoglobin concentration is the most common clinical measurement used to guide RBC transfusion. There is now good evidence, based on an analysis of 48 randomised trials recruiting over 20,000 patients across a range of clinical settings, that a restrictive transfusion strategy (maintaining Hb between 70 and 80 g.l ‐1) is safe and may lead to a 41% reduction in the number of patients who receive at least one RBC unit. Much of this applies in clinical contexts such as orthopaedic surgery, critical care, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, acute gastrointestinal bleeding and paediatric surgery.

Uncertainties exist in certain clinical subgroups such as those with acute coronary syndromes, acute brain injury, active cancer and older patients, and higher haemoglobin thresholds (80–100 g.l ‐1) may be more appropriate until the results of ongoing trials are available. The recent Haemoglobin transfusion threshold in traumatic brain injury optimisation (HEMOTION) trial found no evidence of a difference in unfavourable neurological outcome at 6 months in patients randomly allocated to a liberal strategy (transfusion initiated at Hb ≤ 100 g.l ‐1) compared with a restrictive strategy (transfusion initiated at Hb ≤ 70 g.l ‐1). However, a liberal strategy was associated with better scores on measures of motor function and quality of life. Similarly, the Transfusion Strategies in Acute Brain Injured Patients (TRAIN) found that a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusion triggered by Hb < 90 g.l ‐1) was associated with a more favourable neurological outcome at 6 months when compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion triggered by Hb < 70 g.l ‐1). Two large RCTs have been published reporting on the impact of different haemoglobin thresholds on clinically relevant outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (The Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion trial (MINT), Restrictive and Liberal Transfusion Strategies in Patients with AMI trial, REALITY (REALITY)). Although the designs of both trials were broadly similar, the two studies reported differing directions of effect for key outcomes. MINT, the largest trial, favoured a liberal transfusion strategy with a Hb threshold of 100 g.l ‐1. Specific guidance on these patient groups is awaited.

### Oxygen supplementation and hyperoxia in critically ill cardiac patients: from pathophysiology to clinical practice [^90cc2754]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular pathophysiology of hypoxia and hyperoxia

The fundamental function of the cardiovascular system is to provide oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and organs. Oxygen is carried predominantly in red blood cells bound to hemoglobin, with a small amount of oxygen dissolved in plasma. Once hemoglobin is completely saturated with oxygen, further oxygen supplementation will only serve to increase the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood (Figure 2). Importantly, excess oxygen dissolved in blood contributes little to the overall oxygen content but potentially enhances its toxic effects through the production of reactive oxygen species. In addition, other methods of increasing oxygen delivery, such as blood transfusions, have largely found benefit or noninferiority from a restrictive strategy (hemoglobin levels 7–8 g/dL) compared with liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin level 10 g/dL) in numerous patient populations, including patients with AMI. In the REALITY randomized trial of patients presenting with AMI, a transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL was found to be noninferior to a transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL for major cardiovascular outcomes at 30 days. Nevertheless, anemia is associated with higher mortality, including in patients with AMI. Management of anemia in the patient with cardiovascular disease should be individualized (eg, evaluation for acuity of the drop, symptoms, or evidence of ongoing refractory ischemia) and prompt investigation for the etiology. The ongoing MINT trial, which aims to enroll 3,500 patients with AMI and a hemoglobin < 10 g/dL to a restrictive or liberal transfusion goal, may clarify future practice. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest benefit in increasing cardiac output with inotropes and/or mechanical support above a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg improves outcomes.

### Transfusion thresholds for acute coronary syndromes-insights from the TRICS-III randomized controlled trial, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^3d460ab7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Both anemia and red blood cell transfusion are associated with morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs); these exposures are tightly linked, and their attributable risks are difficult to isolate. To reduce unnecessary blood exposure, transfusion should only be administered if/when its net benefits outweigh the risks associated with anemia. Hemoglobin thresholds are currently used for evaluating the severity of anemia and for guiding transfusion therapy; however, there is controversy surrounding the optimal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in this patient population. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing hemoglobin‐guided restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies are difficult to interpret, and there is a paucity of available data on long‐term outcomes. We therefore performed a subset analysis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the TRICS‐III (Transfusion Thresholds in Cardiac Surgery) RCT to add evidence addressing this important clinical question and further interpret the results using a systematic‐review, meta‐analysis, and trial‐sequential analysis.

The previously describedmultinational TRICS‐III trial (NCT02042898) randomly assigned patients with a moderate‐to‐high risk of death undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dL) or liberal strategy (operating room and intensive care unit: transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 9.5 g/dL; ward: < 8.5 g/dL). Appropriate ethical board review and approval were obtained from each participating site, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients with AMI were those with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) (< 90 days of surgery) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and ≥ 1 of the following enrichment criteria: unstable angina, critical preoperative state, use of preoperative intra‐aortic balloon pump, and/or undergoing emergency surgery. The primary outcome was a per‐protocol analysis of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all‐cause death, MI, and revascularization at 6 months.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy in the perioperative and acute care settings: a context-specific systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^12390c5b]. Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blood transfusions are associated with morbidity and mortality. However, restrictive thresholds could harm patients less able to tolerate anemia. Using a context-specific approach (according to patient characteristics and clinical settings), the authors conducted a systematic review to quantify the effects of transfusion strategies.

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources to November 2015 for randomized controlled trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies applied more than 24h in adult surgical or critically ill patients. Data were independently extracted. Risk ratios were calculated for 30-day complications, defined as inadequate oxygen supply (myocardial, cerebral, renal, mesenteric, and peripheral ischemic injury; arrhythmia; and unstable angina), mortality, composite of both, and infections. Statistical combination followed a context-specific approach. Additional analyses explored transfusion protocol heterogeneity and cointerventions effects.

Results

Thirty-one trials were regrouped into five context-specific risk strata. In patients undergoing cardiac/vascular procedures, restrictive strategies seemed to increase the risk of events reflecting inadequate oxygen supply (risk ratio [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.22), mortality (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.04), and composite events (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.24–3322, 3245, and 3322 patients, respectively). Similar results were found in elderly orthopedic patients (inadequate oxygen supply: RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.92; mortality: RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.49; composite outcome: RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.54–3465, 3546, and 3749 patients, respectively), but not in critically ill patients. No difference was found for infections, although a protective effect may exist. Risk estimates varied with successful/unsuccessful transfusion protocol implementation.

Conclusions

Restrictive transfusion strategies should be applied with caution in high-risk patients undergoing major surgery.

### Is a low transfusion threshold safe in critically ill patients with cardiovascular diseases? [^1dbbb426]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy with a more liberal strategy in volume-resuscitated critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease.

Setting

Twenty-two academic and three community critical care units across Canada.

Study Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial.

Study Population

Three hundred fifty-seven critically ill patients with cardiovascular diseases from the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care trial who had a hemoglobin concentration of < 90 g/L within 72 hrs of admission to the intensive care unit.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to a restrictive strategy to receive allogeneic red blood cell transfusions at a hemoglobin concentration of 70 g/L (and maintained between 70 and 90 g/L) or a liberal strategy to receive red blood cells at 100 g/L (and maintained between 100 and 120 g/L).

Results

Baseline characteristics in the restrictive (n = 160) and the liberal group (n = 197) were comparable, except for the use of cardiac and anesthetic drugs (p < .02). Average hemoglobin concentrations (85 ± 6.2 vs. 103 ± 6.7 g/L; p < .01) and red blood cell units transfused (2.4 ± 4.1 vs. 5.2 ± 5.0 red blood cell units; p < .01) were significantly lower in the restrictive compared with the liberal group. Overall, all mortality rates were similar in both study groups, including 30-day (23% vs. 23%; p = 1.00), 60-day, hospital, and intensive care unit rates. Changes in multiple organ dysfunction from baseline scores were significantly less in the restrictive transfusion group overall (0.2 ± 4.2 vs. 1.3 ± 4.4; p = .02). In the 257 patients with severe ischemic heart disease, there were no statistically significant differences in all survival measures, but this is the only subgroup where the restrictive group had lower but nonsignificant absolute survival rates compared with the patients in the liberal group.

Conclusion

A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy generally appears to be safe in most critically ill patients with cardiovascular disease, with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial infarcts and unstable angina.

### Transfusion thresholds for acute coronary syndromes-insights from the TRICS-III randomized controlled trial, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^2cf98c32]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We next performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to April 18, 2022, to identify RCTs evaluating restrictive versus liberal transfusion in patients hospitalized for ACSs. The primary outcome was MACE, defined as all‐cause death, MI, and revascularization (when available), at the longest available timepoint. Citation screening, data abstraction, and assessment of quality and risk of bias were performed in duplicate and as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Interventions and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Inverse variance‐weighted random‐effects models were used to estimate risk differences (RD) and 95% CIs. We then conducted a trial‐sequential analysis to evaluate the conclusiveness of our meta‐analysis of MACE.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request and in accordance with a data‐sharing agreement.

Of the 4860 patients included in the primary TRICS‐III trial, prerandomization AMI status could be ascertained in 4765 patients (98% of cohort), of which 194 had AMI. A total of 89 patients were allocated to restrictive transfusion and 105 to the liberal strategy. Baseline and procedural characteristics were well balanced between groups (Figure). In the TRICS‐AMI population, a restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy resulted in a numerically higher incidence of MACE at 6 months (14% versus 11%); however, this association was not statistically significant (RD, 3% [95% CI, −6% to 13%]).

### Anemia and acute coronary syndrome: time for intervention studies [^d49ef0a0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

How then should a clinician approach an ACS patient with concomitant anemia? As recommended by current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, measures should be taken to minimize risks for bleeding. This may be accomplished by integrating formal bleeding risk algorithms within usual care pathways to identify patients who will derive the greatest benefit from bleeding avoidance strategies, such as transradial access and use of vascular closure devices. Dosing of antithrombotic therapy by weight and renal function should be emphasized to further minimize bleeding risks. With respect to treatment, a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL appears reasonable given the potential for harm with administration of blood products coupled with the lack of any clear benefit in randomized studies using a more liberal threshold.

Our understanding of red blood cells, both in normal human physiology and in disease states, has advanced substantially since the seminal observations of van Leeuwenhoek. While we currently appreciate the prognostic importance of anemia on both short‐ and long‐term outcomes following ACS, clear mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions to guide and mitigate such risk remain lacking. The need for studies to inform clinical decisions within this space is highlighted by studies such as the one by Mamas et al, reinforcing the high prevalence of and substantial risk associated with anemia in the setting of ACS.

### Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion: systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^89e714d2]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the benefit and harm of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies to guide red blood cell transfusions.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials.

Data Sources

Cochrane central register of controlled trials, SilverPlatter Medline (1950 to date), SilverPlatter Embase (1980 to date), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to present). Reference lists of identified trials and other systematic reviews were assessed, and authors and experts in transfusion were contacted to identify additional trials.

Trial Selection

Published and unpublished randomised clinical trials that evaluated a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy in adults or children, irrespective of language, blinding procedure, publication status, or sample size.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts of trials identified, and relevant trials were evaluated in full text for eligibility. Two reviewers then independently extracted data on methods, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias from included trials. random effects models were used to estimate risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

31 trials totalling 9813 randomised patients were included. The proportion of patients receiving red blood cells (relative risk 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.63, 8923 patients, 24 trials) and the number of red blood cell units transfused (mean difference -1.43, 95% confidence interval -2.01 to -0.86) were lower with the restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies. Restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies were not associated with risk of death (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01, 5707 patients, nine lower risk of bias trials), overall morbidity (0.98, 0.85 to 1.12, 4517 patients, six lower risk of bias trials), or fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1.28, 0.66 to 2.49, 4730 patients, seven lower risk of bias trials). Results were not affected by the inclusion of trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Using trial sequential analyses on mortality and myocardial infarction, the required information size was not reached, but a 15% relative risk reduction or increase in overall morbidity with restrictive transfusion strategies could be excluded.

Conclusions

Compared with liberal strategies, restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a reduction in the number of red blood cell units transfused and number of patients being transfused, but mortality, overall morbidity, and myocardial infarction seemed to be unaltered. Restrictive transfusion strategies are safe in most clinical settings. Liberal transfusion strategies have not been shown to convey any benefit to patients.

### Transfusion in older anemic patients: should the troponin value Be taken into account? [^9aae8fc0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is common in older individuals, but it is not known whether the prognostic impact of transfusion differs according to cardiac troponin concentration.

Methods

During this 2-year retrospective study in an acute geriatric unit, 514 patients with hemoglobin < 10 g/dL and troponin sampling were included. Thirty-day and 1-year mortality were compared according to transfusion status and troponin and hemoglobin levels.

Results

Of the 514 anemic patients included (median age 88 years), 157 (31%) had elevated troponin concentrations. These patients were more likely to die at 30 days (49% vs 27%, P < .001) and 1 year (65% vs 51%, P = 0.004) than patients with normal values. Among patients with elevated troponin concentrations, 30-day mortality tended to be lower in transfused than in not-transfused patients (hazard ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.21–1.08; P = 0.07). This association was not found in patients without troponin elevation (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% CI, 0.61–1.93; P = 0.8). Transfusion was associated with 30-day survival in patients with hemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL. It was also associated with excess 1-year mortality in patients with hemoglobin > 8 g/dL.

Conclusions

This pilot study suggests that transfusion could be associated with better 30-day outcomes in older anemic patients with anemia-related myocardial injury. Thus, troponin levels could be involved in decision-making relative to transfusion in anemic older patients. Clinical trials are needed to establish the benefit of transfusion in patients with elevated troponins.

### Should we restrict erythrocyte transfusion in early goal directed protocols? [^293c9a5a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

In high-risk cardiac surgical patients, Murphy et al. recently randomly assigned 2,007 patients post cardiac surgery (they were either revasculerized or replaced defective valves) to a restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dl) or a liberal transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 9 g/dl) group. The primary outcome was a serious infection (sepsis or wound infection) or an ischemic event (permanent stroke, myocardial infarction, infarction of the gut, or acute kidney injury) within 3 months after surgery. Transfusion rates were 53.4% (higher than many liberal transfusion hospitals) and 92.2% in the two groups, respectively. The restrictive transfusion threshold was not inferior to the liberal threshold with respect to morbidity or 30 day mortality. Mortality at 90 days was statistically higher in the restrictive group with 16 more deaths than in the liberal-threshold group. These finding are perplexing since the causes of death were not related to anemia and no plausible mechanism was offered by the authors. In this respect, this study provides non-inferiority data on restrictive transfusion and should not result in change of practice until these findings are either corroborated or refuted. It is also unclear whether the liberal transfused group were benefiting from the 'volume therapy' which the restrictive group has not received.

In-line with this discussion, two US health care organizations (American Medical Association Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement® and The Joint Commission) have previously recommended strategies to minimize overuse in healthcare, naming blood products as one of the top five targets. In addition, the Choosing Wisely® campaign launched by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation both in US and now Canada, repeat the same message. The World Health Organization has adopted resolution 63.12, also adopted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, recommending all member states to implement a patient blood management (PBM) program employing multiple strategies to minimize unnecessary exposure to blood products as a new standard of care. In detail, PBM is a proactive evidence based approach to identify, diagnose and treat anemia before a transfusion threshold is met. Optimization of hemostasis and minimization of blood loss are additional core principles of PBM to reduce costs and to improve patient outcome.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^a4837b8a]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Anemia and red blood cell efficacy

Anemia has long been associated with adverse patient outcomes. With respect to correlative data, anemia in older people has been well documented as being an independent risk factor for increased mortality, functional dependence, impaired cognition, re-admission to hospital, and falls. The challenge remains to elucidate at what risk–benefit point the treatment of anemia with transfusion will be associated with net improvement in functional capacity and outcome. The large prospective restrictive versus liberal transfusion studies evaluated select populations over a short period of time, typically ICU or hospital lengths of stay, with no assessment of ultimate functional outcome or rate of recovery.

In one well-conducted prospective study with 1,156 patients > 65 years old who were evaluated in six basic and eight instrumental activities of daily living, anemia as defined by Hb < 12.0 g/dl incurred poorer performance and strength. Similarly, Foss and colleagues prospectively demonstrated in a population of 487 hip fracture patients that a more severe degree of anemia (< 10 g/dl) was associated with a linear Hb concentration dependency with respect to independent ambulation on each of the 3 days postoperatively (16% first day, 25% second day, 40% third day with no anemia versus 5% first day, 18% second day, 26% third day with anemia, P < 0.001), with a significantly increased 30-day mortality of 12.6% versus 6.3% (P < 0.05), and with an increased length of hospital stay (13 days (9–23) versus 8 days (6–18) (P < 0.001)). In opposition to these data, the more recent, prospective randomized Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergoing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) trial demonstrated that a liberal transfusion strategy offered no overall benefit in terms of reducing mortality or the ability to ambulate without assistance 60 days following surgery. However, strength, endurance, and other metrics of robust, independent function were not measured. Additionally, the primary functional outcome of ambulation was defined as the ability to walk a distance of 10 feet, which is not a robust measure of either stability or endurance. For such assessment, either the 10-meter walk or the 6-minute walk test is incorporated for such purpose as standard evaluation metrics in the practice of rehabilitative medicine.

Table 1
Large prospective randomized clinical trials on transfusion triggers

ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; Hb, hemoglobin; NS, nonsignificant; RBC, red blood cell.

Having the hypothesis that a restrictive transfusion regimen would offer medical benefit, especially to that population of sicker, older patients, Hébert and co-investigators of the landmark 1999 Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial acknowledged at the trial's end that there was no difference between liberal and restrictive cohorts in the only primary outcome measure of all-cause 30-day mortality. A secondary outcome measure, in-hospital mortality, was lower in the restrictive group (P = 0.05) but in the context of no mortality benefit during the ICU stay or at 60 days. Three of four mortality risk assessments were thus negative between cohorts, including the shortest and longest time spans evaluating patient survival. Interestingly, and counter to their original hypothesis, subgroup analysis revealed that restrictive RBC transfusion was associated with reduced mortality in younger not older study participants (age < 55) and in those with less severe acute illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores < 20). If this observation was true, then the opposite comparison must also be valid; namely that liberal transfusion strategy reduced mortality in the older and very ill patient (data were not specifically reported in the study), because the overall mortality rates between transfusion strategies were not different. The finding was probably a statistical quirk, and subsequent trials evaluating leukocyte-reduced RBCs have generally not confirmed a mortality benefit with restrictive RBC transfusion strategies (Table 1).

When taken in aggregate, however, the available large clinical trial data clearly support non-inferiority of restrictive RBC transfusion practices in the acute setting in stable hospitalized patients. Together with additional observational and correlative studies that link potential harm and worse clinical outcome to RBC transfusion, many published reviews and international medical societies have therefore endorsed a Hb transfusion trigger of approximately 7 g/dl as a practice guideline for most hospitalized and stable critically ill patients. Such recommendations no doubt reflect the desire for patient wellbeing together with optimal stewardship of a valuable resource. There is little debate regarding the important economic and societal considerations of minimizing unwarranted transfusions; regional or national blood shortages in the USA are reported with regularity, and the $200 to 250 per RBC unit hospital acquisition fee is but a fraction of the activity-based cost of transferring a blood unit from the donor to the recipient, estimated to be $500 to 1,200 per RBC unit.

### The impacts of anemia burden on clinical outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^d8ef3020]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is possible that anemia merely indicates more severe illness or less favorable cardiac arrest etiology. In a large study of over 17 000 elders with normal renal function, anemia was associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization, even after adjusting for age, sex, and chronic disease. Furthermore, patients with lower hemoglobin levels may experience worse outcomes in chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure, COPD, and chronic kidney disease. Pre‐existing anemia is also a predictor of worse outcomes in patients undergoing elective surgery, acute MI, and patients in the critical care unit, including failure of liberation from mechanical ventilation and increased risk of death. Therefore, monitoring and managing hemoglobin levels in OHCA patients is important for prognostic purposes and identifying potential underlying conditions that may impact patient outcomes.

Although blood transfusion may be a potential treatment option to improve outcomes in postcardiac arrest patients with low hemoglobin levels, there is a lack of data supporting its use. Clinical trials that support the conservative approach of maintaining lower hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion have typically excluded patients with severe ischemic events such as MI., The decision of whether to transfuse patients with cardiovascular disease has yielded conflicting results. The recent REALITY trial showed that a restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin of ≤ 8 g/dL) in individuals with acute MI may be acceptable. Despite this, some studies have included hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 mg/dL as part of postarrest care bundles. However, the optimal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in this population remains unclear, and further studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy and safety.

Further research is needed to explore this relationship in greater detail and to develop effective interventions to optimize hemoglobin levels in these patients. Specifically, future studies should focus on investigating the association between hemoglobin levels and both neurological outcomes and mortality in OHCA patients and exploring the potential impact of interventions to improve hemoglobin levels on patient outcomes. Ultimately, a better understanding of the relationship between hemoglobin levels and outcomes in OHCA patients could guide the development of more effective treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes in this population.

### Outcomes of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in older adults from nine randomised controlled trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^44fdea67]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for patient blood management recommend restrictive transfusion practice for most adult patients. These guidelines are supported by evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, one of the patient groups not explicitly examined in these studies is the geriatric population. We examined RCTs relevant to transfusion outcomes in older patients. Our aim was to determine whether special guidelines are warranted for geriatric patients, recognising the different pathophysiological characteristics of this group.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases from their inception to May 5, 2017, for evidence relating to transfusion outcomes in adults aged 65 years and older. This criterion was widened to include RCTs where a substantial proportion of the study population was older than 65 years. We also included study populations of all clinical settings, and did not limit the search by date, language, or study type. For articles not in English, only available translations of the abstracts were reviewed. Studies were excluded if they did not specify age. Observational studies and duplicate patient and outcome data from studies that generated multiple publications were also excluded. We screened bibliographies of retrieved articles for additional publications. We analysed data extracted from published RCTs comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies in older adults. We generated fixed effects risk ratios (RR) for pooled study data using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Primary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day mortality events for patients enrolled in restrictive and liberal transfusion study groups. We included intention-to-treat outcome data in the meta-analysis when available, otherwise we used per-protocol outcome data.

Findings

686 articles were identified by the search, and a further 37 by the snowball approach. Of these articles, 13 eligible papers described findings from nine RCTs (five trials investigating orthopaedic surgery, three cardiac surgery, and one oncology surgery; including 5780 patients). The risk of 30-day mortality was higher in older patients who followed a restrictive transfusion strategy than in those who followed a liberal transfusion strategy (risk ratio [RR] 1·36, 95% CI 1·05–1·74; p = 0·017). The risk of 90-day mortality was also higher in those who followed a restrictive transfusion strategy than in those who followed a liberal transfusion strategy (RR 1·45, 95% CI 1·05–1·98; p = 0·022).

Interpretation

Liberal transfusion strategies might produce better outcomes in geriatric patients than restrictive transfusion strategies. This outcome contradicts current restrictive transfusion approaches. Population ageing will challenge resources globally, and this finding has implications for blood supply and demand, and optimal care of older adults. Further research is needed to formulate evidence-based transfusion practice across clinical specialties specific to the geriatric population, and to examine resource effects.

### Targeting investigation and treatment in Type 2 myocardial infarction: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^2a575c29]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Variability in the trial intervention was raised by both patients and clinicians as a potential barrier to recruitment, and we agreed with our PPIE group that a future trial should mandate cardiac imaging. Potential participants in whom the attending cardiologist feels invasive or CT coronary angiography is essential for diagnostic purposes would not be eligible for recruitment. This approach will maximize differences between trial populations and allow us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of systematic cardiac imaging in patients with type 2 MI where there is clinical equipoise.

Further feedback suggested that participants found the diagnostic terminology around type 2 MI confusing and they received inconsistent information from clinicians. At present, there are no dedicated patient-facing resources available which can contribute to fear and uncertainty around future prognosis when patients seek information from the internet. Therefore, one focus for optimizing patient care in type 2 MI must be improved access to patient-facing resources.

While TARGET-Type 2 incorporated the targeting of secondary prevention, an alternative strategy for clinical trials in type 2 MI is to target the etiology of specific disease phenotypes. The MINT (Myocardial Ischaemia and Transfusion) trial evaluated a restrictive vs liberal transfusion strategy in patients with MI. Most of the participants recruited (55.8%) had type 2 MI, but in this subgroup, no differences in MI or death were observed at 30 days. While this analysis was prespecified, these diagnoses were not adjudicated and the trial was not powered for this comparison. Prospective trials evaluating specific therapeutic strategies with the aim of reducing ischemic burden in the acute phase of type 2 MI should be designed to address specific phenotypes such as tachyarrhythmia, anemia, hypoxemia, or hypotension.

### Impact of blood transfusions in patients presenting with anemia and suspected acute coronary syndrome [^6039d0cf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Anemia has been shown to predict adverse events in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (MIs). Less is known about the value of blood transfusions in this setting. We sought to evaluate the impact of red blood cell transfusions on outcomes. Transfusion in anemic patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome/non-ST-elevation MIs led to a significant increase in 30-day recurrent MI or death (odds ratio 3.05, 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 5.17, p < 0.001). This relation persisted after adjusting for significant univariate predictors: hypotension on presentation, pulmonary edema, and increased troponin-I levels (odds ratio 2.57, 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 4.69, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the risk versus benefit of transfusion in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome needs careful assessment.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^c2d027ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.
