## Question

shingles bloodwork

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to order laboratory tests for suspected shingles (herpes zoster), which tests are optimal, and how to interpret them alongside clinical findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primacy of clinical diagnosis and when labs are unnecessary. Then, I should define clear indications for testing. Next, I will select the right test and specimen by scenario. After that, I will interpret positive and negative results in context. Finally, I will consider special populations and conclude with a practical take-home, ensuring I verify each step against guideline-grade references as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: herpes zoster is usually a clinical diagnosis characterized by unilateral, dermatomal vesicles with neuritic pain and a typical evolution of lesions; in classic thoracic or lumbar presentations, laboratory confirmation is generally not required, and the positive predictive value of experienced primary care diagnosis is high, around 90% in older adults, so I should not over-test when the presentation is textbook [^117SffUB] [^112q7vZD] [^116GzE41].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are scenarios where labs do matter, and I need to check those carefully: testing is indicated for atypical rashes or locations (face or genital) where HSV can mimic VZV, disseminated disease, immunocompromised hosts where management hinges on confirmation, suspected vaccine-modified disease with minimal or maculopapular lesions, neurological or visceral complications where site-directed PCR is needed, and in younger patients with multidermatomal or recurrent HZ where concomitant HIV testing should be considered [^117VGxqh] [^113c874T] [^112q7vZD] [^115mghUn].

> Next, I should review the optimal test and specimen type; I need to ensure I prioritize high-yield sampling: PCR is the first-line diagnostic in suspected zoster when confirmation is needed, with vesicle fluid or lesion swabs providing the best sensitivity, and if PCR is unavailable a direct fluorescent antibody test is acceptable but less sensitive; when the differential includes HSV, dual PCR testing for HSV and VZV on the lesion is prudent, and for CNS disease, CSF PCR is the appropriate modality, with modern assays such as Simplexa demonstrating excellent agreement with composite standards [^113c874T] [^112q7vZD] [^117VGxqh] [^113m5VrU].

> Wait, let me verify the role and timing of "bloodwork" specifically; this is where confusion often arises: VZV DNAemia in blood can be detected during herpes zoster and is particularly useful to support disseminated infection or severe disease in immunocompromised hosts; initially, I thought the window "about 5 days before to 4 days after rash onset" applied to zoster, but I should correct that — this timing is better established for varicella, whereas in zoster, DNAemia is typically present at onset and can persist for weeks, so peripheral blood PCR is adjunctive, not first-line, except when dissemination or zoster sine herpete is suspected or when no lesion is available [^1148Zabi] [^115fjkK2] [^114pdYpb].

> I need to check the role of serology because "shingles bloodwork" often gets conflated with antibody testing; IgM is generally not recommended for diagnosing acute zoster due to poor specificity and performance in vaccinated individuals, while IgG is useful for assessing immunity, not acute disease; an exception is suspected zoster sine herpete where paired serology demonstrating a rise can support the diagnosis, but even there PCR is preferred; population data show IgG testing is overused relative to PCR, reinforcing that serology should be reserved for immunity assessment or very select diagnostic circumstances and not for routine acute zoster diagnosis [^1121dVW7] [^111c6g8R] [^114Su4Vr] [^1121dVW7].

> Let me now interpret results in context so I don't mislead management: if lesion PCR is positive for VZV, that confirms the diagnosis and supports timely antivirals; if blood PCR is positive, I should consider the patient at higher risk for dissemination and escalate to intravenous therapy in severe or immunocompromised cases; FDA-labeled data support acyclovir efficacy in reducing cutaneous and visceral spread in immunocompromised hosts, which aligns with practice to use IV therapy for complicated disease and oral valacyclovir or famciclovir for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated dermatomal zoster [^113XHMJX] [^114nqXJm] [^113c874T] [^115iUfkY].

> But wait, what if PCR is negative despite high clinical suspicion; I should double-check sampling and timing before excluding zoster: false negatives occur with suboptimal sampling, late crusted lesions, or inhibitors; repeating lesion sampling early in the course, sampling a fresh vesicle, or testing an alternate site is reasonable, and if the presentation is classic, it remains appropriate to treat clinically while reconsidering the differential for atypical cases; modern lesion PCR assays are highly sensitive when collected correctly, so preanalytic factors are often the culprit when results do not align with the bedside picture [^113m5VrU] [^115AiXXR] [^112q7vZD].

> I will now examine special populations where I need to be stricter: in solid organ transplant recipients or other immunocompromised patients, rapid molecular confirmation from lesion and often blood is recommended to guide therapy and infection control; for neurological complications, CSF PCR is essential; in patients ≤ 50 years with multidermatomal or recurrent disease, I should add HIV testing; in vaccinated patients with suspected breakthrough zoster, genotyping can distinguish wild-type from vaccine strain when available, although access is variable [^113c874T] [^113m5VrU] [^115mghUn] [^111hnqoR].

> Hold on, I should verify one more potential pitfall: vaccine-modified disease and maculopapular rashes can reduce the yield if I sample poorly; choosing an intact vesicle or vigorously swabbing the lesion base improves sensitivity, and when vesicles are absent, oropharyngeal or blood PCR can be considered as supportive tests, keeping in mind that lesion-based PCR remains the diagnostic workhorse when available [^115AiXXR] [^1148Zabi] [^113c874T].

> Let me summarize the practical takeaway so I don't leave ambiguity: "shingles bloodwork" is often a misnomer — most classic cases need no labs; when confirmation matters, lesion PCR is the test of choice, blood PCR is reserved for dissemination risk, severe disease, or no-lesion scenarios, and routine serology has limited diagnostic value in acute zoster; always integrate results with the clinical picture and the patient's immune status, and do not delay indicated antiviral therapy while awaiting tests if the presentation is compelling [^113c874T] [^112q7vZD] [^113c874T] [^1121dVW7].

Shingles is primarily a clinical diagnosis [^112q7vZD] [^117SffUB], but **PCR is the preferred test** [^115GGmXR] for confirming VZV in atypical or severe cases, especially in immunocompromised patients [^113c874T]. Serology is **not reliable for acute diagnosis** [^1121dVW7] because most adults are VZV IgG positive and IgM is often absent or delayed [^111c6g8R] [^113c874T]. Routine blood tests (CBC, CRP, ESR) are nonspecific and not diagnostic; use PCR on blood [^115fjkK2] or CSF [^113m5VrU] when disseminated or neurologic disease is suspected [^1148Zabi]. Order HIV testing in younger patients with multidermatomal or recurrent zoster [^115mghUn], and consider PCR or antigen detection when the diagnosis is uncertain or to distinguish from HSV [^117VGxqh] [^113WiocE].

## Blood tests for shingles diagnosis

### Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

PCR is the **most sensitive and specific method** for detecting VZV DNA in blood, saliva, or CSF [^113m5VrU] and is especially useful in immunocompromised patients [^113c874T] or atypical presentations [^114pdYpb]. It can **detect VZV DNA in blood** during acute infection [^1148Zabi] and for weeks thereafter, correlating with disease severity and immune status. PCR assays show high diagnostic accuracy [^113m5VrU] for confirming shingles in these settings [^114pdYpb]. Early detection is critical in immunocompromised patients [^115fjkK2], where viral dissemination is more common [^113c874T].

---

### Serological testing (IgG and IgM antibodies)

Serological testing for VZV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies is generally **not recommended for acute shingles diagnosis** due to several limitations:

- **IgG antibodies**: Most adults have detectable VZV-specific IgG antibodies from prior varicella infection or vaccination [^116ebQeH], making IgG testing unreliable for acute shingles diagnosis [^113c874T].

- **IgM antibodies**: IgM antibodies may be absent or delayed [^111c6g8R], limiting their diagnostic utility [^113c874T] [^1121dVW7].

- **Clinical utility**: Serological testing may be considered in atypical cases, such as herpes zoster sine herpete (shingles without rash) [^1148Zabi], but results must be interpreted cautiously due to variability in antibody responses [^114Su4Vr].

---

## Routine blood tests and their clinical significance

Routine blood tests, such as complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are **not specific for shingles diagnosis** but may provide general information about inflammatory status [^112q7vZD]. A **CBC** may show mild lymphopenia or leukocytosis; these findings are nonspecific and not diagnostic for shingles. CRP and ESR may be mildly elevated, indicating inflammation, but are **not specific for shingles**.

---

## Blood tests for complications and severity assessment

Blood tests may be useful in **assessing complications or severity** of shingles, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated disease [^115fjkK2]. Detection of VZV DNA in blood by PCR indicates **active viral replication** [^1148Zabi] and may correlate with disease severity and risk of complications [^113c874T]. In cases of disseminated shingles or suspected visceral involvement, **liver function tests** may be indicated. In younger patients (≤ 50 years) with multidermatomal or recurrent shingles, **HIV testing is recommended**, particularly if lesions are in different stages or other risk factors for HIV are present [^115mghUn] [^117VGxqh].

---

## Limitations and challenges of blood tests for shingles

Blood tests for shingles diagnosis have **several limitations and challenges**:

- **PCR limitations**: PCR may detect low levels of VZV DNA in asymptomatic individuals, leading to potential false positives [^1148Zabi]. Additionally, PCR may not detect VZV DNA in all cases, particularly if viral load is low or sampling is delayed [^115AiXXR] [^113c874T].

- **Serological limitations**: Serological testing is limited by variability in antibody responses, particularly in vaccinated individuals or those with atypical presentations [^111c6g8R] [^116ebQeH].

- **Clinical judgment**: Clinical diagnosis remains the primary method for shingles diagnosis, and laboratory tests should be used to confirm atypical cases or assess complications [^112q7vZD] [^117SffUB].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following **recommendations** regarding blood tests for shingles:

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Shingles is primarily diagnosed clinically based on the characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash and pain [^112q7vZD] [^117SffUB].

- **PCR testing**: PCR is recommended for confirming atypical cases, immunocompromised patients, or suspected complications [^115GGmXR] [^113c874T] [^115fjkK2].

- **Serological testing**: Serological testing is generally not recommended for acute shingles diagnosis but may be considered in atypical cases [^114Su4Vr] [^116ebQeH].

- **HIV testing**: Recommended in younger patients with multidermatomal or recurrent shingles [^115mghUn].

---

Blood tests are **not routinely required** for shingles diagnosis [^112q7vZD], but **PCR is the preferred method** for confirming atypical cases or assessing complications [^113m5VrU], especially in immunocompromised patients [^113c874T]. Serological testing is generally **not recommended** due to variability in antibody responses [^114Su4Vr] [^116ebQeH].

Varicella vaccination of children has decreased the incidence of varicella disease but introduced the occurrence of herpes zoster (HZ) from the vaccine-type virus. We identified 14 vaccinated children with suspected HZ and confirmed the presence of the varicella virus by polymerase chain reaction in 6 cases. Two of these cases were due to the vaccine-type virus. Serum varicella IgM and IgG were not useful for the diagnosis of HZ among vaccinated children.

### Varicella-zoster virus and virus DNA in the blood and oropharynx of people with latent or active varicella-zoster virus infections [^1148Zabi]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can be detected in the blood from approximately 5 days before to 4 days after varicella. VZV DNA, primarily in T-lymphocytes, is detected as early as 8–10 days prior to the rash and can persist for a week. The duration and magnitude of VZV DNAemia correlate with immune status and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. VZV DNA is also readily detected in the oropharynx just prior to rash and for 1–2 weeks thereafter.

Detection of VZV DNA in blood and saliva has been useful for diagnosis and prognosis in atypical cases of varicella. Herpes zoster (HZ) is also characterized by VZV DNAemia at onset and for many weeks thereafter, and VZV DNA is present in the oropharynx shortly after HZ onset. Detection of VZV DNA in blood and saliva facilitates the diagnosis of zoster sine herpete and other atypical manifestations of VZV reactivation, such as neurologic syndromes when cerebrospinal fluid is not available, Bell's palsy, and atypical pain syndromes. VZV DNA is sometimes present in the blood and saliva of asymptomatic individuals.

In total, these observations extend the understanding of the pathophysiology and epidemiology of VZV and increasingly contribute to the clinical management of VZV infections.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the corresponding table illustrates antibody cut-off values and specificity/sensitivity if the test was required to have 80% sensitivity/specificity at each visit. If the VZV IgG antibody titer value is greater than or equal to the cut-off, the individual is declared positive (affected) by this cut-off approach; otherwise, they are considered negative (healthy). These results are then compared to actual status to determine sensitivity and specificity.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^115qamtk]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Monthly clinical case reports for chickenpox and shingles were obtained from the Thailand Ministry of Health. Population-level data were acquired from the Thailand National Statistical Office. Population and birth rate projection data were downloaded from the United Nations.

- **Model and simulations**: Chickenpox and shingles data from Thailand were previously fit using a mechanistic model. The model implemented here was similar, with two vaccinated classes added, one each for chickenpox and shingles. Full model equations are available in the supplemental information. In addition to a vaccine-free simulation, vaccination scenarios were examined. These scenarios considered different combinations of chickenpox vaccine roll-out, uptake of the chickenpox vaccine, shingles vaccine coverage, and the length of immunity from the shingles vaccine. The only other change to the model involved increasing the average lifespan to 76.6 years to account for improved healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions over the next hundred years.

	- **Figure 5a**: Model schematic includes susceptible (S), exposed (E), vaccinated against chickenpox, infected with chickenpox, vaccinated against shingles, recovered from chickenpox, infected with shingles, and recovered from shingles classes. Births entered the model through either the S class or the vaccinated against chickenpox class, depending on chickenpox vaccination. Natural death occurred in all classes and is indicated by an arrow leaving each class at the bottom.

	- **Figure 5b and Table S2**: Vaccination simulations varied by chickenpox vaccine roll-out, uptake of the chickenpox vaccine, shingles vaccine coverage, and the length of immunity from the shingles vaccine.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^113Ln9L1]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the eight known human herpesviruses. Initial VZV infection results in chickenpox, while viral reactivation following a period of latency manifests as shingles. Separate vaccines exist to protect against both the initial infection and subsequent reactivation. Controversy regarding chickenpox vaccination is contentious, with most countries not including the vaccine in their childhood immunization schedule due to the hypothesized negative impact on immune boosting, where VZV reactivation is suppressed through exogenous boosting of VZV antibodies from exposure to natural chickenpox infections.

- **Methods**: Population-level chickenpox and shingles notifications from Thailand, a country that does not vaccinate against either disease, were previously fitted with mathematical models to estimate rates of VZV transmission and reactivation. Here, multiple chickenpox and shingles vaccination scenarios were simulated and compared to a model lacking any vaccination to analyze the long-term impacts of VZV vaccination.

- **Results**: As expected, simulations suggested that an introduction of the chickenpox vaccine, at any coverage level, would reduce chickenpox incidence. However, chickenpox vaccine coverage levels above 35% would increase shingles incidence under realistic estimates of shingles coverage with the length of protective immunity from the vaccine. A trade-off between chickenpox and shingles vaccination coverage was discovered, where mid-level chickenpox coverage levels were identified as the optimal target to minimize total zoster.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^111gVXDQ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend administering the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine 2–6 months after the first dose. Do not restart the vaccine series if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose. Repeat the second dose if the recombinant zoster vaccine is given less than 4 weeks after the first dose. Administer 2 doses of the vaccine regardless of prior history of herpes zoster or prior receipt of the live zoster vaccine.

Herpes zoster can present many uncertainties for consulting dermatologists. We review the guidelines and recent literature on important issues that arise in the care of hospitalized patients with herpes zoster, including infection control isolation practices, treatment courses for zoster and acute zoster-associated pain, and indications for long-term prophylaxis. We present the findings of an inpatient zoster management practices survey of the membership of the Society of Dermatology Hospitalists, an expert resource group of the American Academy of Dermatology, and discuss directions for future investigation and potential opportunities for management improvements in light of these collective data.

### Varicella-zoster virus testing in clinical practice in the US, 2016–2023 [^1121dVW7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus testing is increasingly needed for assessing immunity and diagnosis in the varicella vaccination era. Varicella-zoster virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) is recommended when assessing immunity; real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended for varicella or herpes zoster diagnosis. The study objective was to describe varicella-zoster virus serologic and virologic testing in U.S. clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Patients with serologic (IgG, immunoglobulin M [IgM]) or virologic (PCR, culture) varicella-zoster virus testing were identified in five administrative data sources (approximately 11–100 million enrollees; 2016–2023). Descriptive analyses were used to examine varicella-zoster virus testing frequency, patient characteristics, and rates by test type. The top 20 diagnostic codes associated with varicella-zoster test type were used as a proxy for the reason for testing.

- **Results**: Across data sources, the highest proportion of varicella-zoster virus testing was for IgG (43%-92%); most were in females (79%-82%) and those aged 20–39 years (62%-70%). Rates of serologic testing were 50–60/10,000 persons. The frequency of varicella-zoster virologic testing was considerably lower; PCR testing rates were approximately 1/10,000 persons. Diagnostic codes associated with IgG or virologic testing were primarily categorized as routine care or acute illness, respectively. IgM testing was up to 11% of tests, despite not being recommended for screening or diagnostic purposes.

- **Conclusions**: Varicella-zoster virus serologic testing rates were 50–60 times higher than PCR.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: Prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, with increasing age being the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, such as opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia.

Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol. Moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Evaluation of laboratory methods for diagnosis of varicella [^115AiXXR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence of varicella disease is declining as a result of vaccination, making clinical diagnosis more challenging, particularly for vaccine-modified cases. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of laboratory tests and specimen types to assess diagnostic performance and determine what role testing can play after skin lesions have resolved.

- **Methods**: We enrolled patients with suspected varicella disease in two communities. Enrollees were visited at the time of rash onset and two weeks later. Multiple skin lesion, oral, urine, and blood or serum specimens were requested at each visit and tested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA antibody by enzyme-linked immunoassay; for VZV antigen by direct fluorescent antibody; and/or for VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical certainty of the diagnosis of varicella disease was scored. PCR results from first-visit vesicles or scab specimens served as the gold standard in assessing test performance.

- **Results**: Of 93 enrollees, 53 were confirmed to have varicella disease. Among 20 unmodified cases, PCR testing was 95%-100% sensitive for macular and/or papular lesions and for oral specimens collected at the first visit; most specimens from the second visit yielded negative results. Among 27 vaccine-modified cases, macular and/or papular lesions collected at the first visit were also 100% sensitive; yields from other specimens were poorer, and few specimens from the second visit tested positive. Clinical diagnosis was 100% and 85% sensitive for diagnosing unmodified and vaccine-modified cases.

### Multicenter evaluation of the Simplexa VZV direct assay for detection of varicella-zoster virus in cerebrospinal fluid and lesion-swab specimens [^113m5VrU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiologic agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) infections, commonly involving the skin, mucous membranes, and less frequently, the central nervous system. Traditional methods for the laboratory diagnosis of these infections are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often insensitive. As such, these tests are being replaced by more sensitive and rapid molecular methods. This study evaluated the performance of two different molecular assays, the Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct, to detect VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lesion-swab specimens, respectively.

The Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct assays were compared against individual composite reference methods that varied depending on the sample cohort examined. A total of 883 CSF and 452 cutaneous and mucocutaneous prospective, retrospective, and contrived specimens were evaluated in this multicenter study. The results showed that the Simplexa assays demonstrated near perfect agreement (k = 0.98) compared to the composite reference methods for the detection of VZV in CSF and lesion swab specimens. A further comparison between the standard of care molecular assays employed at the site of specimen collection and the Simplexa assays demonstrated excellent agreement (k = 1.0).

The Simplexa assays offer rapid and reliable alternatives for the detection of VZV in certain clinical specimens without the need for nucleic acid extraction.

### Notes from the field: Expanded laboratory testing for varicella - Minnesota, 2016–2023 [^113FJBU3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Low credibility.

These findings suggest that the clinical diagnosis of varicella can be unreliable, especially in vaccinated patients, and underscore the importance of laboratory confirmation of varicella. PCR testing of appropriately collected skin lesion specimens has demonstrated high reliability in the detection of VZV in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Because recommended clinical and public health management of varicella differs from that of other rash illnesses, not performing testing can result in nonrecommended clinical management of suspected varicella cases and exposed contacts, as well as incorrect recommendations regarding the need for exclusion from school or work.

Education and engagement with health care providers, partnership development and maintenance with schools and child care facilities, and opportunities for free testing and at-home specimen collection might have contributed to an increase in varicella testing and confirmation rates in Minnesota. This increase in varicella testing likely also contributed to an increase in appropriate clinical management and school exclusion recommendations for suspect varicella cases.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^115yz4d2]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization in immunocompetent adults, CDC 2018 guidelines recommend not to screen for a history of varicella (either verbally or via laboratory serology) before vaccination for HZ.

### Acyclovir [^113XHMJX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A multicenter trial investigated the use of acyclovir at a dose of 500 mg/m² every 8 hours for 7 days in immunocompromised patients with varicella-zoster infections (shingles). Ninety-four patients participated, with 52 receiving acyclovir and 42 receiving a placebo. Acyclovir demonstrated superiority over placebo, resulting in significant reductions in both cutaneous and visceral dissemination of the infection.

### Vaccines for preventing herpes zoster in older adults [^115bk6o9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is a neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of the virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). After the resolution of the varicella episode, the virus can remain latent in the sensitive dorsal ganglia of the spine. Years later, with declining immunity, the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can reactivate and cause herpes zoster, an extremely painful condition that can last many weeks or months and significantly compromise the quality of life of the affected person. The natural process of aging is associated with a reduction in cellular immunity, and this predisposes older adults to herpes zoster.

Vaccination with an attenuated form of the VZV activates specific T-cell production, avoiding viral reactivation. Two types of herpes zoster vaccines are currently available:

- **Live attenuated zoster vaccine (LZV)**: This single-dose vaccine contains the same live attenuated virus used in the chickenpox vaccine, but it has over 14-fold more plaque-forming units of the attenuated virus per dose.
- **Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV)**: This vaccine does not contain the live attenuated virus, but rather a small fraction of the virus that cannot replicate but can boost immunogenicity. The recommended schedule for the RZV is two doses, two months apart.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010, and updated in 2012, 2016, and 2019.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^1129LaiG]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster, commonly referred to as chickenpox, is a respiratory infectious disease that causes a characteristic red rash and pox on the skin surface. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which also causes shingles, often referred to as herpes zoster. Chickenpox symptoms typically arise 1–3 weeks after exposure to an infected individual, and a newly infected individual is infectious for around a week, starting 1–2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptoms last approximately 2 weeks, when the virus then retreats to the nerve ganglia in the spine. By the age of 15, nearly all children have antibodies to VZV, whether from a natural infection or vaccine. In 10–30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles, typically in adults aged over 60. The VZV vaccine prevents infection with VZV in children, while a booster dose, referred to as a shingles vaccine, later in life suppresses VZV reactivation in adults.

### Herpes zoster and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease [^117VFsYx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In three large cohorts of women and men with up to 16 years of follow-up, herpes zoster (HZ) was associated with a higher long-term risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event. This heightened risk persisted for 12 years and possibly longer. There was an indication that the magnitude of the increased risk might be greater among individuals with potentially immunocompromising conditions.

Several mechanisms could underlie the observed association between HZ and the long-term risk of a major cardiovascular disease (CVD) event. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the only human virus demonstrated to replicate in arteries and lead to vasculopathy, and a growing body of evidence links VZV to vascular disease. VZV has been detected in large and small blood vessels and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several VZV-related cardiovascular disorders. VZV vasculopathy develops from viral spread along nerve fibers, directly involving both intracranial and extracranial vasculature, and has been confirmed by the presence of multinucleated giant cells, herpesvirus particles, VZV DNA, and VZV antigen in arteries.

Vascular changes associated with VZV vasculopathy, including disruption of the internal elastic lamina, intimal thickening, and reduced medial smooth muscle cells, can lead to alterations in arterial caliber and contractility, and vessel wall damage. Arterial dissection or aneurysm could trigger an ischemic or hemorrhagic CVD event. Notably, VZV vasculopathy may be chronic and protracted, and thus, vascular changes could elevate the risk of a CVD event years after an episode of HZ. Furthermore, systemic inflammation, autoimmune reactions, or hemodynamic perturbations may also contribute to this long-term risk.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^111w9tUR]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Shingles coverage was modeled as either non-existent (no shingles vaccination) or similar to the estimated coverage values from the United States or the UK. Initial conditions for the vaccinated with shingles class were considered to be either 0% or a portion of the recovered from chickenpox class, depending on shingles coverage. The model simulated shingles coverage by moving individuals from the existing vaccinated with chickenpox and infected with chickenpox classes to the shingles class. Shingles immunity duration was considered to be either 5 years or lifelong. Lifelong immunity could be interpreted as every individual who received the shingles vaccine would continue receiving their booster doses, removing the possibility of them moving into the latent and susceptible to shingles class, or it could represent a new vaccine brought to market. All scenarios that included shingles vaccination also included one form of chickenpox vaccination, though sensitivity analyses were performed where no chickenpox vaccination occurred. All models were run for 100 years and implemented with the R package "pomp".

Though most of the results and discussion focus on the vaccination scenarios listed in Fig. 5b, overall, these simulations varied chickenpox vaccine coverage (0–100%), chickenpox vaccine effectiveness (79.5% or 100%), chickenpox vaccination duration of immunity (20 or 40 years), shingles vaccine coverage (0–100%), and shingles vaccination duration of immunity (5 years or lifetime).

### An inverse correlation of VZV skin-test reaction, but not antibody, with severity of herpes zoster skin symptoms and zoster-associated pain [^115TdquH]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2013). Low credibility.

Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) has been considered to be related to the development of herpes zoster (HZ). However, there have been no large-scale prospective studies on the relationship between VZV-specific CMI and severity of HZ.

- **Objective**: We carried out a large-scale prospective cohort study to clarify the relationship between immunological factors for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and the clinical severity of HZ.

- **Methods**: We carried out a cohort study on VZV immunity in a population living on an island cluster, Shozu County in Japan, and examined the people who developed HZ during a median follow-up period of 2 years, with a focus on the relationship between cell-mediated and humoral immunity and the severity of skin lesions and zoster-associated pain. A total of 12,522 people over the age of 50 were enrolled in this study, and 258 registrants were diagnosed as HZ. CMI was measured by VZV skin test, and humoral immunity was assessed with serological tests (neutralization test, immunoadherence hemagglutination test, and gpELISA test) for VZV-specific antibodies.

- **Results**: CMI to VZV assessed by VZV skin test showed a significant inverse relationship to the severity of HZ skin lesions, and also to the severity of acute and subacute pain. Furthermore, weak response to the VZV skin test was associated with a high risk of post-herpetic neuralgia. In contrast, VZV-specific antibody titer was not associated with the severity of skin lesions and zoster-associated pain.

- **Conclusion**: VZV-specific CMI, but not humoral immunity, may play a key role in controlling the severity of HZ and associated pain.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^113gnMXu]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

The study design involved the recruitment of patients with shingles who presented to general practitioners in London between 2001 and 2003 for a prospective cohort study assessing disease burden and clinical and laboratory indices of zoster. The diagnosis was confirmed through the detection of VZV DNA from vesicle fluid by PCR in patients with clinically suspected zoster. Patients completed a baseline survey that collected demographic information, history of chickenpox and previous shingles episodes, immune status (including underlying illnesses and treatments), and detailed information about the shingles episode (timing, symptoms, and medications). Blood samples were taken at baseline, one, three, and six months to measure IgG antibody titre and viral load, with additional samples collected from healthy blood donors at a single time point.

- **Viral load and antibody measurements**: Viral load was assessed by detecting and quantifying VZV DNA from whole blood. This involved DNA extraction using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd, United Kingdom), with the eluted DNA stored at −20°C. VZV DNA was quantified using a real-time PCR assay, which had a sensitivity threshold of < 10 VZV copies/μl. VZV IgG antibody titres were measured using a validated in-house time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Serum dilutions were tested in duplicate, and the Europium counts obtained were interpolated against a standard curve of British Standard VZV antibody (NIBSC 90/690) covering the VZV IgG range 0.39–50 mIU/ml. Sera producing Europium counts outside the curve were noted.

### Herpes zoster in the era of COVID-19: A prospective observational study to probe the association of herpes zoster with COVID-19 infection and vaccination [^114rRVXF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by the reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) following a decline in cell-mediated immunity. In recent years, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged globally as a viral cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Based on limited evidence, co-infection of COVID-19 with VZV or reactivation of VZV after COVID-19 vaccination has been sporadically reported.

All patients diagnosed with HZ at Farwaniya Hospital in Kuwait from March 2020 to July 2021, who either (A) had a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or (B) were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, were enrolled in the study. All patients' demographic information, medical history, laboratory findings, and vaccination status were documented. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 21.0 software.

Twelve cases were infected with COVID-19 with a positive PCR (group 1), and five cases were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (group 2). Out of the 12 COVID-19 infected patients (group 1), only two patients (16.67%) required hospitalization, while the remaining 10 patients had mild/moderate lymphopenia. Furthermore, among the 12 positive COVID-19 cases, four patients with HZ were diagnosed within the first week of COVID-19, while the remaining eight cases were diagnosed within eight weeks of COVID-19. Thoracic segments were affected in five cases (41.67%), cervical in one case (8.33%), cranial in two cases (16.67%), lumbar in three cases (25%), and sacral in one case (8.33%).

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^111XHBQ6]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Statistical methods**: We recoded implausible IgG values above the 95th blood donor percentile as missing (n = 23) and log-transformed viral load and antibody titre to provide a normal distribution. We summarized the median, IQR, and mean of the log-transformed viral load and antibody titre at each time point. As there was no evidence of a non-linear association between logged mean viral DNA load and logged mean antibody titre, we used Pearson's correlation coefficients to investigate associations between these variables at the same and subsequent time points for shingles patients. These relationships were further explored using multivariable linear regression models.

	- Potential confounding effects of age, sex, ethnicity, immunosuppression, days since rash onset, prodromal symptoms, disseminated rash, and antiviral treatment were investigated using causal diagrams. Variables were retained if they were theoretically relevant confounders and/or associated with both outcome and exposure at the 10% significance level using a forward selection approach.

	- To determine whether recent zoster could be identified from antibody levels, we undertook ROC analysis, comparing antibody levels in healthy controls with zoster patients. Antibody cut-off values (not on the log scale) to achieve 80% and 90% sensitivity or specificity were calculated for each visit separately (along with the corresponding sensitivity or specificity), after adjusting for age and sex.

### Calibration and evaluation of quantitative antibody titers for varicella-zoster virus by use of the BioPlex 2200 [^114wYjdP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Most commercially available enzyme immunoassay-based methods have limited sensitivity to detect antibody responses to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in vaccinated individuals, who produce lower antibody levels than those with natural infection. However, more sensitive methods are either not commercially available or less amenable to high-throughput testing. The BioPlex 2200 measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) IgG assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) is an automated high-throughput platform based on the microsphere Luminex technology that measures antibodies against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses simultaneously. Although it has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval as a qualitative diagnostic test for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus immunity, in this study, we have validated the assay to produce quantitative titers (off label) against the VaccZyme VZV glycoprotein (VZVgp) low-level IgG kit (The Binding Site Ltd, Birmingham, UK) using the World Health Organization international standard.

Here, we show that the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assay has sensitivity superior to that of the Zeus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) VZV IgG assay (Zeus Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and adjusting the cutoff levels, we improved the sensitivity of the quantitative BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG assay to 97.4%, while maintaining 100% specificity.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^1129wV6F]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

We showed that baseline viral load, rather than subsequent viral load, was the strongest predictor of antibody titre at one, three, and six months after an acute shingles episode. Antibody titres remained persistently elevated in shingles patients compared to healthy blood donors for at least six months, with the greatest discrimination between groups occurring at one month post-shingles. Antibody titres could discriminate patients with recent shingles from healthy controls; however, there was a significant trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

Reactivation of latent VZV is largely kept in check through cell-mediated immunity, with antibodies playing very little role in VZV control. Individuals with severe clinical VZV reactivation, including those who develop post-herpetic neuralgia, often have high antibody titres, which are believed to correlate with more widespread VZV replication. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis. The lack of association found between viral loads at one, three, and six months and antibody titres at the same and subsequent time points suggests that persistence of serum VZV DNA after shingles may be a function of decay rather than ongoing replication, although this finding needs to be tested in other larger populations.

Antibody titre cut-off values could be used to identify patients with shingles 1–6 months previously, but with a large trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Whether researchers choose to set cut-off values to achieve a high sensitivity, for example, when using antibody titre as an initial screening test for recent…

### Rapid detection of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections by real-time PCR [^113WiocE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

The herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause life-threatening infections of the central nervous system and lead to severe infections in immunocompromised subjects and newborns. In these cases, rapid diagnosis is crucial. We developed three different real-time PCR assays based on TaqMan chemistry for the LightCycler instrument to detect HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV.

When the TaqMan assays were compared to our in-house nested PCR assays, the test systems had equal sensitivities of ≤ 10 plasmid copies per assay. When clinical samples were investigated by TaqMan PCR to detect HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV DNA, 95%, 100%, and 96% of the samples determined to be positive by nested PCR, respectively, were positive by the real-time PCR assays. The specificities of all PCR assays were almost 100%. Furthermore, the TaqMan PCR assays could be performed within 2.5 hours, whereas nested PCR results were available after 9 hours. In addition to offering more rapid results, the TaqMan PCR assays appear to be less expensive than nested PCR assays due to less hands-on time.

In summary, TaqMan PCR is an excellent alternative to conventional nested PCR assays for the rapid detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV in clinical samples.

### Notes from the field: Expanded laboratory testing for varicella - Minnesota, 2016–2023 [^112qu4BY]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Low credibility.

In December 2016, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) established expanded laboratory testing for confirmation of varicella in Minnesota. A multipronged approach was used to promote testing. MDH implemented outreach to health care providers via newsletters, health advisories, webinars, and conferences, describing the importance of laboratory testing for rash illnesses suspected to be varicella, the preferred testing method, and availability of free testing at MDH Public Health Laboratory (MDH-PHL). In addition, MDH implemented direct follow-up when needed with individual providers related to testing practices and provided specimen collection kits — containing a swab for collection of vesicular fluid and slides for collection of scabs or scraping of maculopapular lesions — to clinics interested in partnering with MDH-PHL. Through funding from CDC's Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Cooperative Agreement, MDH-PHL provided free testing for persons with suspected varicella, including clinically diagnosed, school- or child care–reported, and self-diagnosed cases. MDH-PHL performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and enterovirus on all specimens received by MDH-PHL.

MDH also offered specimen collection kits directly to persons with suspected varicella identified through Minnesota's varicella case-based surveillance, allowing free access to testing across the state. Kits were also available to families through partnerships with schools and child care centers.

### Herpes zoster and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease [^115dSEVG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Ascertainment of HZ ("Shingles"): Information on the history of "shingles" (HZ) and the date it occurred was collected in the 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012 NHS questionnaires; the 2001, 2005, 2013, and 2017 NHS II questionnaires; and the 2004, 2006, and 2008 HPFS questionnaires. Participants were asked about clinician‐diagnosed "shingles" and the year of diagnosis. To confirm the validity of self‐report in our participants, we mailed a supplemental questionnaire to 99 NHS women asking for permission to obtain medical records related to the diagnosis of shingles, which were reviewed by a physician investigator (G.C.C.). The diagnosis of HZ was confirmed in 97%, demonstrating that the self‐reported diagnosis of shingles (HZ) in this cohort of nurses is highly reliable. Notably, the participants in all three of our cohorts are healthcare professionals, and the reliability of health‐related information collected from our participants has been demonstrated for a large number of health outcomes. The primary exposure for this study was categorized according to time (in years) since the participant's HZ event. Those with no history of HZ were the referent group.

Ascertainment of stroke: Stroke was classified as total stroke, encompassing ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, confirmed by physician review of medical records according to criteria specified in the National Survey of Stroke, requiring evidence of a sudden or rapid onset of neurologic deficit that persisted for more than 24 hours or until death. Participants who reported a nonfatal stroke on a biennial questionnaire were asked for permission to verify the event through medical records.

### Fold rise in antibody titers as measured by glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an excellent correlate of protection for a herpes zoster vaccine, demonstrated via the vaccine efficacy curve [^112HMB6H]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The phase III Zostavax Efficacy and Safety Trial, evaluating the efficacy of one dose of the licensed zoster vaccine (ZV; Zostavax; Merck) in individuals aged 50–59, showed approximately 70% vaccine efficacy (VE) in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ). An objective of the trial was to assess immune response biomarkers measuring antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) via glycoprotein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as correlates of protection (CoPs) against HZ.

- **Methods**: The principal stratification vaccine efficacy curve framework for statistically evaluating immune response biomarkers as CoPs was applied. The VE curve illustrates how VE against the clinical endpoint (HZ) varies across participant subgroups defined by biomarker readout measuring vaccine-induced immune response. The VE curve was estimated using several subgroup definitions.

- **Results**: The fold rise in VZV antibody titers from the time before immunization to six weeks after immunization proved to be an excellent CoP, with VE increasing sharply with the fold rise. VE was estimated at 0% for the subgroup with no rise and at 90% for the subgroup with a 5.26-fold rise. In contrast, VZV antibody titers measured six weeks after immunization did not predict VE, with similar estimated VEs across titer subgroups.

- **Conclusions**: The analysis illustrates the value of the VE curve framework for assessing immune response biomarkers as CoPs in vaccine efficacy trials.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^116JFaU1]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the eight known human herpesviruses. Initial VZV infection results in chickenpox, while viral reactivation following a period of latency manifests as shingles. Separate vaccines exist to protect against both initial infection and subsequent reactivation. Controversy regarding chickenpox vaccination is contentious, with most countries not including the vaccine in their childhood immunization schedule due to the hypothesized negative impact on immune-boosting, where VZV reactivation is suppressed through exogenous boosting of VZV antibodies from exposure to natural chickenpox infections.

- **Methods**: Population-level chickenpox and shingles notifications from Thailand, a country that does not vaccinate against either disease, were previously fitted with mathematical models to estimate rates of VZV transmission and reactivation. Here, multiple chickenpox and shingles vaccination scenarios were simulated and compared to a model lacking any vaccination to analyze the long-term impacts of VZV vaccination.

- **Results**: As expected, simulations suggested that the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine, at any coverage level, would reduce chickenpox incidence. However, chickenpox vaccine coverage levels above 35% would increase shingles incidence under realistic estimates of shingles coverage with the length of protective immunity from the vaccine. A trade-off between chickenpox and shingles vaccination coverage was discovered, where mid-level chickenpox coverage levels were identified as the optimal target to minimize total zoster.

### Immune system dysregulation preceding a case of laboratory-confirmed zoster/dermatitis on board the International Space Station [^116yso5y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Following resolution of the zoster symptoms, a final ambient blood sampling was performed before landing. These samples demonstrated that the reductions in T-cell function had essentially resolved to baseline values; however, both detectable inflammation (plasma cytokines) and increased monocyte function (according to intracellular cytokine assay) persisted, as did the shedding of EBV. All monitored parameters had mostly returned to baseline 30 days after return.

Noteworthy is a parallel symptomatic event. By flight day 30, this crew member also developed clinically concerning spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Although its etiology remains unclear, SANS is characterized by a constellation of ocular anatomic changes during spaceflight that can be asymptomatic or can induce vision alterations. Multiple Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography images (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) were collected during the mission and processed terrestrially to monitor ocular integrity. This crew member developed bilateral optic nerve head edema that peaked mid-mission, followed by limited recovery during flight. Bilateral chorioretinal fold formation and choroidal engorgement peaked mid-to-late mission, followed by partial recovery during flight. These parameters recovered after flight. In addition, postflight magnetic resonance imaging (Siemens) and eye examinations detected globe flattening and refractive error shifts (greater than +0.75 D) in both eyes.

### Use and limitations of varicella-zoster virus-specific serological testing to evaluate breakthrough disease in vaccinees and to screen for susceptibility to varicella [^116ebQeH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A plethora of tests for determining the presence of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been developed over the years, with a wide range of performance standards. There is general agreement that the presence of VZV antibodies in serum indicates immunity to varicella and protection from chickenpox, although the role of specific antibodies in mediating protection remains unclear. Both antibodies and cellular immunity probably interact to mediate immunity to the virus. Nevertheless, VZV-specific serum antibody is a useful indicator of protection against chickenpox in patients and persons at high risk of exposure, whether they have been immunized or naturally infected. Serological tests are also a useful tool for evaluating the length of time that immunity to varicella persists after vaccination and for assessing whether waning of vaccine-induced immunity occurs.

The purpose of this review is to contrast the strengths and weaknesses of currently available VZV antibody assays. Although several of these methods are useful for various specific applications, simpler and more accurate tests to measure antibodies to VZV are a high priority for future research and development.

### Quantification of risk factors for herpes zoster: Population based case-control study [^113qqYHP]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

This large study included all incident cases of zoster in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink over an 11-year period, providing high power to detect small effects, except for rare potential risk factors. We assessed a wide range of factors, allowing adjustment for many of the known as well as potential confounders, in addition to exploring interactions with age, which is of key public health relevance in terms of vaccination policy.

The study may be subject to ascertainment bias; regular general practice visits for a chronic condition such as diabetes may increase the likelihood of receiving a zoster diagnosis. However, we believe that most zoster cases would present to their general practice, owing to the extensive rash and considerable pain associated with zoster and free general practice attendance in the UK. A survey about immunization practices in the United States among people aged 60 and over found that 95% of those who knew they had zoster sought care. Furthermore, we found little evidence to suggest that patients with epilepsy (who were visiting their general practice as frequently as patients with our risk factors of interest) were at increased risk of zoster.

As with any observational study, residual confounding may be present. For example, exposure to varicella contacts, hypothesized to naturally boost varicella zoster virus-specific immunity in people with latent varicella zoster virus infection and thus protect against zoster, was not available.

Some misclassification of zoster is possible. In UK primary care, diagnosis.

### Herpes zoster meningitis in a young, immunocompetent adult [^114aEM7h]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus is typically encountered in the emergency department (ED) in two forms: varicella (chickenpox) in children and zoster (shingles) in older adults. Zoster is infrequently encountered in young, healthy adults, and neurological complications are extremely rare.

- **Case report**: We describe a case of a previously healthy 36-year-old woman who presented to the ED with fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache four days after being diagnosed with herpes zoster and started on oral valacyclovir. Lumbar puncture confirmed herpes zoster meningitis. Despite the initiation of antivirals within 48 hours of symptom onset, progression to zoster meningitis occurred.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Emergency physicians must be aware that neurological complications of varicella-zoster can develop despite the initiation of oral antivirals. These patients must be identified in the ED, as admission for intravenous antivirals is indicated.

### Transient increased risk of shingles post Shingrix vaccination: Self-controlled case series analysis [^116hm8zk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Following the introduction of a funded recombinant shingles (RZV, Shingrix®) vaccination program for individuals aged ≥ 65 in Australia, clinician reports of shingles presentations shortly after vaccination emerged. We investigated whether there was an increase in shingles risk immediately post-RZV vaccination in South-eastern Australia.

- **Methods**: Two independent datasets — a general practice dataset and a statewide linked dataset — were analyzed separately using self-controlled case series analyses (SCCS) with 21 days post-vaccination as the risk window. The observation period was from 1 January 2023 to 30 April 2025. Adults ≥ 18 years old were included, with analyses stratified by age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) and sex. We calculated the rate of incident shingles in time periods relative to vaccination, along with attributable risk and the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

- **Results**: The primary care SCCS analysis found an 11-fold increase (risk incidence [RI] 10.96, 95% CI 10.34, 11.62, p < 0.0001) in shingles presentations within 21 days post-dose 1 of RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 in the general practice dataset only. No increase was detected in younger adults. Following dose two, the risk of shingles presentations was reduced in all age groups. Vaccine recipients had a 73% reduction in shingles following 2 doses. PHN risk was not increased.

- **Conclusions**: There is a transient increase in shingles presentations shortly after dose one of the RZV vaccination in adults ≥ 65 years of age; however, these cases are likely to be mild, and there is clear evidence of vaccine effectiveness after the full vaccination series.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^114uPE9q]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Under realistic vaccination scenarios observed in countries that currently vaccinate against both chickenpox and shingles, where the shingles vaccine provides 5 years of immunity and high chickenpox coverage (50%) exists, anything less than 80% shingles coverage led to an increase in shingles incidence compared to the null model at some point in the simulation. This high level of shingles coverage would be nearly impossible to achieve at the population level, as routine adult immunizations are uncommon and the highest cited level of national shingles coverage is 50%.

Under both the 5-year and lifetime immunity from shingles vaccination simulations, mid-level chickenpox coverage resulted in a greater reduction in shingles incidence than low or high chickenpox coverage. This 'C' shape can be seen in Figures 2 and 3 (seen as a "U").

If chickenpox vaccine immunity was extended to 40 years, this pattern remained, though the increase in shingles cases at higher chickenpox vaccination levels was reduced (Figure S3). These counter-intuitive results reveal that to achieve the greatest reduction in both chickenpox and shingles, policymakers should strive for mid-level chickenpox coverage and focus their efforts on maximizing shingles coverage.

### Notes from the field: Expanded laboratory testing for varicella - Minnesota, 2016–2023 [^116KTdWy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

The U.S. varicella vaccination program, implemented in 1995, led to a greater than 97% decline in varicella incidence. Clinical diagnosis continues to be the primary means for diagnosing varicella, although the modified signs and symptoms of the disease (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) occurring in persons who have received the varicella vaccine pose diagnostic challenges. Laboratory confirmation of varicella is increasingly necessary to guide clinical and public health management, understand varicella epidemiology, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness.

In June 2023, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists updated its varicella position statement to increase the specificity of confirmed varicella cases by including only cases with positive laboratory results or cases that have an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed varicella case or to a person with herpes zoster.

### Relationship between serum anti-varicella zoster virus antibody titer and time from onset of herpes zoster [^116VfLiT]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is an internal reactivation of varicella zoster virus, and its onset depends on immunity against this virus. We have previously reported that antiviral antibody titers are inversely correlated with patient numbers. In this study, we hypothesized that patients with higher titers may be late visitors to the clinic, whose antibodies were already boosted at presentation because of the time lapse between onset of zoster and measurement of antibodies.

We analyzed antibody titers of patients with acute herpes zoster who visited Fukuoka University Hospital from January 2009 to May 2016 (n = 141, 62 males and 79 females). Varicella zoster virus-specific immunoglobulin G, M, and complement fixation tests were positive in 93.9%, 12.0%, and 64.2% of the patients, respectively. Immunoglobulin G and complement fixation titers were strongly correlated (Spearman's r = 0.8634, P < 0.0001). Patients with high immunoglobulin G and complement fixation titers were immunoglobulin M-negative.

Unexpectedly, immunoglobulin G and complement fixation titers showed large inter-subject variation and were only weakly correlated with onset-measurement time lapse. Patients with consecutive tests tended to show increasing immunoglobulin G and complement fixation titers. Our data suggest that herpes zoster preferentially occurs in patients with low immunoglobulin G and complement fixation titers and subsequently causes antibody elevation. However, the timing of elevation varies and can be as late as 10 days after zoster.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^116xkf6j]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Primary infection with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox, following which the virus establishes latency. It reactivates in up to 25% of individuals to cause the painful dermatomal rash known as shingles (herpes zoster). During chickenpox or shingles, viral DNA is detectable in skin lesions, blood, and saliva. Viral replication is accompanied by the boosting of VZV antibodies, consistent with antigenic or endogenous boosting. Few data exist, however, confirming the relationship between viral load and antibody titres during and following acute clinical VZV disease.

The extent to which the presence of persisting viral DNA in blood or saliva indicates active viral replication likely to induce an immune response is unclear. Immunocompetent children with chickenpox clear viral DNA rapidly so that it is no longer detectable two weeks after the rash has healed. In contrast, VZV DNA has been detected in blood for up to six months following shingles, albeit with falling loads. Asymptomatic shedding of VZV in saliva occurs more frequently in individuals who are immune disadvantaged. A better understanding of the spectrum of VZV reactivation is needed to inform the use of biological markers of VZV reactivation in research.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^115sBpsS]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

The study comprised 63 patients with shingles, with a median age of 56 years (IQR 37–71 years), of whom 34 (54.0%) were male, and 441 blood donor controls.

- **Viral load among shingles patients**:
	- Viral load was highest at baseline and lowest at six months. Antibody titres rose from baseline to be maximal at one month, then gradually declined, although titres remained elevated above baseline levels at six months.

- **Association between viral load and antibody titres**:
	- Viral load at baseline was positively associated with antibody titres at one, three, and six months, although the strength of the associations was small to moderate. There was some evidence (P = 0.033) of a small negative correlation (r = −0.285) between viral load at one month and antibody titre at six months. However, there were otherwise no significant associations between viral load measurements taken after baseline and later antibody titres. In multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and immune status, higher baseline viral load was associated with a higher antibody titre at one, three, and six months.

Note: Adjusted coefficients represent the effect of a one-unit change in the variable value on the log mean antibody titre, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and immune status.

### Serological detection of varicella-zoster virus-specific immunoglobulin G by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using glycoprotein antigen [^11231GUC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of varicella vaccination in several countries, there has been an urgent need for commercially available test procedures that allow highly sensitive and specific quantitative determination of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune status, including immunity postimmunization. This study compared the performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the sensitive and specific determination of VZV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in seronegative and latently infected persons, as well as in vaccinees.

One ELISA is based on the detection of antibody to VZV-specific envelope glycoproteins (gp), and the other comprises the whole antigen extract prepared from VZV-infected cells. A modified standard fluorescent-antibody-to-membrane-antigen (FAMA) assay was used as a reference. An excellent sensitivity (100%) in relation to FAMA was demonstrated for the gpELISA (Virion\Serion), while the non-gpELISA (Dade Behring) had a lower sensitivity (83%) when sera from latently infected persons were tested. After postvaccinal immunity was measured, a sensitivity of 87% was achieved with gpELISA, whereas the ELISA incorporating antigen extract of VZV-infected cells had a sensitivity of 78%. Excellent specificity (100%) was calculated for both the gpELISA and the non-gpELISA.

In conclusion, SERION ELISA classic VZV IgG is useful for the sensitive and specific quantitative determination of VZV immune status after natural infection. The test can also be recommended for measuring antibody response after varicella vaccination, particularly after the cut.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^115Epe59]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Under realistic scenarios of shingles vaccination, with up to 50% coverage and 5 years of protective immunity, simulations that included slow, moderate, or aggressive chickenpox vaccine roll-outs increased the incidence of shingles. However, some scenarios of lower chickenpox coverage resulted in slight reductions in shingles cases. This outcome was because immunity from the chickenpox vaccination provided only 20 years of protection, thereby increasing the number of individuals susceptible to shingles reactivation.

Simulations showed that a noticeable long-term impact on shingles reduction occurred only when immunity from shingles vaccination was lifelong, or when immunity lasted for 5 years and shingles coverage was extremely high. Even with lifetime immunity from shingles vaccination, there were no scenarios where realistic shingles coverage equated to an equal rate of case reduction when chickenpox vaccination was also included. Only when chickenpox vaccination was omitted and shingles immunity was lifelong did vaccinating half (UK estimate) or a third (US estimate) of the population reduce the total shingles cases by 50% or 33%.

While scenarios with lower chickenpox coverage and high shingles coverage with lifetime immunity performed best, an interesting trade-off was observed between chickenpox uptake and shingles coverage. This trade-off was evident in both the 5-year and lifetime shingles immunity simulations.

### Prior herpes simplex virus infection and the risk of herpes zoster [^115Gpkoq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) has increased in the United States concomitant with a decrease in herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevalence. We hypothesized that the lack of HSV-elicited cross-reactive immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in an increased risk of HZ. Using specimens from the placebo arm of the Shingles Prevention Study, we investigated whether persons who develop HZ are less likely to have prior HSV infection than persons who do not develop HZ, and whether HZ is less severe in persons with HSV than in HSV seronegative persons.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nested case-control (1:2) study comparing the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cases (persons with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HZ) to age-, sex-, and health-matched controls (persons without HZ).

- **Results**: Sera from 639 study participants (213 cases and 426 controls) yielded definitive HSV antibody results and were analyzed. The overall HSV seropositivity rate was 75%. HSV seronegativity was significantly higher in HZ cases than in controls (30.5% vs. 22.3%; p = 0.024), with a 55% higher risk of HZ in HSV seronegative than HSV seropositive participants. HSV seropositivity was associated with more severe HZ (P = 0.021).

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrated that prior infection with HSV partly protects against HZ.

### Clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster in family practice [^116GzE41]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Family physicians usually diagnose herpes zoster on clinical grounds only, which can result in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment. This study aimed to determine the positive predictive value of physicians' judgment in diagnosing herpes zoster and to assess the applicability of dried blood spot analysis for diagnosis in family practice.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of 272 patients over 50 years old with herpes zoster (rash for less than 7 days). Dried blood spot samples were collected from all patients and sent by mail to the laboratory. Baseline measurements included clinical signs (localization, severity, and duration of rash) and symptoms (duration and severity of pain). Varicella-zoster virus antibodies were determined at baseline and 5 to 10 days later. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between clinical variables and serological confirmation of herpes zoster.

- **Results**: Dried blood spot analysis was possible in 260 patients (96%). In 236 patients, the diagnosis of herpes zoster was confirmed serologically, with a positive predictive value of clinical judgment at 90.8% (95% confidence interval, 87.3%-94.3%). Independent clinical variables for serologically confirmed herpes zoster included the severity and duration of rash at first examination.

- **Conclusion**: Family physicians demonstrate good clinical judgment when diagnosing herpes zoster in older patients. Although dried blood spot analysis is a logistically convenient method for serological investigation in family practice, it is rarely necessary for diagnosis.

### Does apolipoprotein E determine outcome of infection by varicella zoster virus and by Epstein Barr virus [^117VmmHs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

Over 90% of the population is infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV), but only some develop shingles when the virus reactivates from latency. Among those with shingles, only a subset develops post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), characterized by pain persisting for more than about four months. Similarly, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infects over 90% of the population, yet some individuals infected during their teenage or young adult years develop infectious mononucleosis (IM). The reason for these disparities between infection rates and illness rates is not well understood but likely reflects host factors.

Our previous results indicated that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype influences susceptibility to or outcomes of infections in several diseases with known infectious causes. Therefore, we investigated the APOE genotypes of patients with shingles, PHN, and IM. Our rationale for studying VZV stems from the fact that these microorganisms use the same cell surface sites for binding and entry as the protein apoE. Consequently, competition with apoE could influence the pathogen's entry and, hence, the extent of damage caused.

We determined the APOE genotypes of individuals suffering from shingles, PHN, and IM using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In females, epsilon4 homozygosity was found to confer a risk for shingles and IM, while the APOE-epsilon4 allele appeared to be protective against PHN, with the APOE-epsilon3 allele posing a risk. Our findings, indicating that a host genetic factor influences the development of shingles and PHN in females, have clinical significance.

### Rapid quantitative PCR assays for the simultaneous detection of herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA in blood and other clinical specimens [^114pdYpb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnosis of human herpesvirus primary infections or reactivations is facilitated by quantitative PCRs. Quantitative PCR assays with a standard thermal cycling profile permitting simultaneous detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) DNA were developed and validated for diagnostic use. High specificity and sensitivity were achieved, and the new PCR assays correlated well with commercial PCR assays.

Twenty-two thousand eight hundred sixty-eight PCR tests were undertaken on specimens obtained from immunosuppressed patients. DNAemia was frequent with EBV (43.5%), HHV6 (32.4%), CMV (12.8%), and VZV (12.9%). As already described for EBV and CMV, high virus loads of HHV6 and VZV were associated with clinical symptoms and poor clinical outcomes; for example, three of four patients with VZV virus loads > 10⁵ copies/ml died. A high proportion of lower respiratory specimens was positive for EBV- (38.8%), HHV6- (29.4%), and CMV-DNA (18.2%). For CMV, infection was confirmed in 66.7% of patients by virus isolation or positive pp65 antigenaemia. Differentiation of HHV6A, -B and HSV-1, -2 by melting curve analysis revealed that HHV6A and HSV-2 represented only 1.8% and 3.3% of all positive specimens, respectively.

In conclusion, these results indicate significant improvements for the early diagnosis of primary infections or reactivations of five human herpesviruses, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Detection of coinfections with multiple herpesviruses is facilitated.

### Unraveling the immune signature of herpes zoster: Insights into the pathophysiology and human leukocyte antigen risk profile [^112Zujkx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infects over 95% of the population. VZV reactivation causes herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, primarily affecting the elderly and individuals who are immunocompromised. However, HZ can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. We analyzed the immune signature and risk profile in patients with HZ using a genome-wide association study across different UK Biobank HZ cohorts. Additionally, we conducted one of the largest HZ human leukocyte antigen association studies at the time of writing, coupled with transcriptomic analysis of pathways underlying HZ susceptibility. Our findings highlight the significance of the major histocompatibility complex locus for HZ development, identifying five protective and four risk human leukocyte antigen alleles. This demonstrates that HZ susceptibility is largely governed by variations in the major histocompatibility complex. Furthermore, functional analyses revealed the upregulation of type I interferon and adaptive immune responses. These findings provide fresh molecular insights into the pathophysiology and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses triggered by symptomatic VZV reactivation.
