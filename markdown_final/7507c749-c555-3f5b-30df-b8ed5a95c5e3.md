## Question

D-dimer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about D-dimer testing, specifically its role, performance, thresholds, special populations, and how to manage elevated results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that D-dimer is a rule-out test with high sensitivity and low specificity. Then, I should verify how pretest probability and clinical decision rules govern when to order and how to interpret results. Next, I will examine assay types and why only highly sensitive assays are appropriate for exclusion strategies. After that, I need to check age-adjusted thresholds and their evidence base. I will then review special populations such as pregnancy, inpatients, and COVID-19. Finally, I should consider how to manage an incidentally elevated D-dimer and synthesize a practical algorithm with safety caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle: D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that reflects ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis; it is highly sensitive but nonspecific for venous thromboembolism, so a negative result in the right context effectively rules out VTE, whereas a positive result is not diagnostic and requires imaging or clinical correlation [^113CguKd] [^114NcPTj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure we anchor testing to pretest probability. Validated clinical decision rules such as Wells or Geneva should be applied first because D-dimer's negative predictive value depends on prevalence, and guidelines recommend D-dimer only for low or intermediate probability patients, not for high probability where imaging is indicated regardless of D-dimer result [^notfound] [^117Kqscd] [^112UjLr8].

> Wait, let me verify assay selection before discussing thresholds. Only highly sensitive quantitative assays (ELISA, quantitative rapid ELISA, immunoturbidimetric) with sensitivity around 95% or higher and established cutoffs are appropriate for exclusion strategies; qualitative or whole-blood assays have lower sensitivity and should not be used to rule out VTE in intermediate-risk patients, though some point-of-care tests may be acceptable in low-risk settings with caution [^114NcPTj] [^115P1Co8] [^115W3Wv6].

> I should confirm the conventional cutoff and its limitations. The standard threshold is 500 μg/L FEU, but specificity falls with age, dropping to roughly 15% in patients over 80, which drives many false positives; this is why age-adjusted thresholds were developed to preserve sensitivity while improving specificity in older adults [^112jpuht] [^114iWSdG].

> Let me think about age-adjusted D-dimer. For patients older than 50 years, multiplying age by 10 μg/L FEU (e.g., 78 years → 780 μg/L) maintains sensitivity above 97% and meaningfully increases specificity across age strata, reducing unnecessary imaging; this is supported by multiple meta-analyses and is endorsed by major guidelines, though clinicians should remember the calculation applies to FEU-based assays and may differ for DDU-based assays where age × 5 μg/L is sometimes used [^112jpuht] [^114iWSdG] [^11693TVn] [^112Q1i2b].

> But wait, what if we consider pretest-probability–adjusted thresholds instead of age-adjusted? Individual patient data meta-analyses suggest that CPTP-adjusted strategies can achieve similar high negative predictive values with modest gains in utility compared with age-adjusted approaches; however, age-adjusted cutoffs are simpler to implement and more widely validated, so I should be cautious about substituting CPTP-adjusted thresholds outside of research or carefully selected contexts [^117YBSbL] [^115zBrs6].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pregnancy. Initially, I thought D-dimer is uniformly unreliable in pregnancy, but wait, let me verify; more recent prospective studies and a meta-analysis suggest that with pregnancy-adapted algorithms and appropriate thresholds, D-dimer can safely exclude VTE in pregnant patients with low or intermediate probability, though levels rise with gestation and test performance varies by trimester, so clinical judgment and ultrasound-first strategies remain important [^111mRXm3] [^114ndJXp].

> I will now examine inpatients and postoperative patients. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients due to frequent elevations from inflammation, infection, malignancy, and surgery; specificity is poor, and even a negative result may be less reliable, so imaging is often pursued directly when suspicion is moderate to high and D-dimer is best reserved for low-probability inpatients or used as part of a broader algorithm rather than as a standalone rule-out test [^1119QXSn] [^111XAuCs] [^116737R7].

> Hold on, I should verify COVID-19 data. In hospitalized COVID-19, D-dimer is frequently elevated and specificity is very low, so using standard thresholds to exclude PE is unsafe; higher thresholds have been explored, but they trade sensitivity for specificity and can miss clinically significant thrombosis, so D-dimer should not be used to rule out PE in this population and imaging decisions should be driven by clinical probability and risk assessment rather than D-dimer alone [^113SBb8a] [^111KxaN8].

> Let me consider cancer patients. Elevated D-dimer is common in malignancy, so specificity is reduced; nonetheless, in patients with low or intermediate probability, a negative D-dimer still has a high negative predictive value and can exclude DVT, though the proportion who can be spared imaging is smaller due to the high baseline prevalence and frequent positives [^114x5PDL].

> I should double-check the approach to suspected recurrence. After a first unprovoked VTE, D-dimer measured after stopping anticoagulation helps stratify recurrence risk; a positive D-dimer is associated with a roughly 2.5-fold higher recurrence risk, and randomized data show that prolonging anticoagulation in those with positive D-dimer reduces recurrence, supporting its use in decision-making about treatment duration [^116SsMwk] [^116Mqtnj].

> Now, how do we manage an incidentally elevated D-dimer in an asymptomatic ambulatory patient? I need to ensure we do not medicalize a nonspecific marker; the first step is to reassure and contextualize, then screen thoughtfully for plausible causes such as infection, inflammation, malignancy, liver disease, or recent trauma, reserving imaging for those with risk factors or concerning features; indiscriminate workups can cause harm and should be avoided [^116FAgqE] [^1144PcsQ] [^113VjdMm].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-conscious algorithm. First, apply a validated clinical decision rule to assign low, intermediate, or high pretest probability. If high probability, proceed directly to imaging and do not order D-dimer. If low or intermediate probability, obtain a highly sensitive D-dimer and interpret using age-adjusted thresholds in patients older than 50; a negative result safely excludes VTE and obviates imaging, whereas a positive result should prompt appropriate imaging such as proximal ultrasound for DVT or CTPA for PE, with V/Q reserved when contrast is contraindicated or CTPA is unavailable [^11693TVn] [^117Kqscd] [^112UjLr8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a negative D-dimer alone is sufficient in all settings; I should correct that. Safety depends on using highly sensitive assays, applying decision rules rigorously, and ensuring reliable follow-up or alternative pathways when results are discordant or preanalytical conditions are suboptimal; in older adults, age-adjusted cutoffs improve efficiency without compromising safety, but they do not convert D-dimer into a diagnostic test, and clinical vigilance remains essential [^112jpuht] [^114iWSdG] [^11693TVn].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit: record the pretest probability, the assay used, the cutoff applied, and the rationale for imaging or discharge. This aligns with best-practice advice and reduces misuse, repeat testing, and patient anxiety while preserving diagnostic safety [^11693TVn].

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that rises with thrombosis and fibrinolysis; it is **most useful to rule out VTE** [^114NcPTj] in outpatients with low or intermediate pretest probability [^11693TVn], using highly sensitive assays and clinical decision rules [^113YSXtA]. It has **poor specificity** [^113CguKd], so positive results are common in cancer, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, and recent surgery, and it should not be used to rule in VTE or in high pretest probability patients [^117Kqscd]. Age-adjusted thresholds (age × 10 μg/L) [^112jpuht] improve specificity in patients > 50 years without compromising sensitivity [^114iWSdG]. In COVID-19 inpatients, D-dimer has limited utility for excluding PE due to frequent elevations [^113SBb8a] [^111KxaN8]. After unprovoked VTE, a positive D-dimer off anticoagulation predicts higher recurrence risk and can inform duration decisions [^116SsMwk] [^116Mqtnj].

---

## Physiological basis and clinical significance

D-dimer is generated during plasmin degradation of cross-linked fibrin, reflecting **coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis** [^113CguKd]. Elevated levels indicate ongoing thrombus formation and breakdown but are not specific to VTE [^113CguKd].

---

## Clinical indications and diagnostic utility

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE)

- **Primary role**: Rule out VTE (DVT/PE) in outpatients with low or intermediate pretest probability [^11693TVn] [^112UjLr8].
- **Assay requirement**: Highly sensitive assays (≥ 97% sensitivity) are required for safe exclusion [^112rULpX] [^114NcPTj].
- **Clinical decision rules**: Wells or Geneva scores should guide test ordering and interpretation [^11693TVn] [^112UjLr8].
- **High pretest probability**: Do not use D-dimer; proceed directly to imaging [^117Kqscd] [^11693TVn].

---

### Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds

Conventional cutoff (500 μg/L) reduces specificity with age [^112jpuht]; the **age-adjusted threshold (age × 10 μg/L)** [^114iWSdG] increases specificity in patients > 50 years without sacrificing sensitivity [^112jpuht].

| **Age group** | **Conventional specificity** | **Age-adjusted specificity** |
|-|-|-|
| 51–60 years | 57.6% | 62.3% |
| 61–70 years | 39.4% | 49.5% |
| 71–80 years | 24.5% | 44.2% |
| > 80 years | 14.7% | 35.2% |

---

### Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: D-dimer rises with gestation; pregnancy-adapted algorithms (e.g. YEARS) can safely reduce imaging [^111mRXm3] [^114ndJXp].
- **COVID-19 inpatients**: Frequent elevations limit utility for excluding PE; use clinical judgment and imaging [^113SBb8a] [^111KxaN8].
- **Cancer**: Common elevations limit specificity; still useful in low/intermediate probability with careful interpretation [^114x5PDL].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Poor specificity**: Elevated in cancer, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, recent surgery, liver disease, and trauma [^113CguKd] [^115KTUBp].
- **False negatives**: Can occur with small clots, early presentation, or anticoagulation [^116ntJwo].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays have varying sensitivity/specificity; results are not interchangeable [^115P1Co8] [^112rULpX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and best practices

- **ASH 2018**: Use highly sensitive D-dimer in low/intermediate probability; avoid in high probability or hospitalized patients [^113YSXtA] [^116737R7].
- **ACP 2015**: Use age-adjusted thresholds in patients > 50 years; do not image if below cutoff [^11693TVn] [^114ZGKy6].
- **ESC 2019**: Use D-dimer in low/intermediate probability; do not use in high probability [^112UjLr8] [^117Kqscd].

---

## Role in predicting recurrence risk

After a first unprovoked VTE, a positive D-dimer off anticoagulation predicts higher recurrence risk and can guide **duration of anticoagulation** [^116SsMwk] [^116Mqtnj].

---

## Summary of clinical utility

| **Clinical scenario** | **Utility of d-dimer** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected VTE (low/intermediate probability) | High | Rule-out test; use highly sensitive assay |
| Suspected VTE (high probability) | Not recommended | Proceed to imaging |
| Pregnancy | Moderate | Use pregnancy-adapted algorithms |
| COVID-19 inpatients | Limited | Frequent false positives |
| Unprovoked VTE (recurrence risk) | Moderate | Guides anticoagulation duration |

---

D-dimer is a **high-sensitivity, low-specificity** test that, when combined with clinical probability and appropriate thresholds, safely excludes VTE in selected outpatients [^114NcPTj]. It is not diagnostic for VTE and must be interpreted in clinical context, with age-adjusted thresholds improving specificity in older adults [^112jpuht].

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: making sense of international guideline recommendations [^112rULpX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

For these reasons, we suggest that instead of recommending an evaluation algorithm for elevated D-dimer tests in asymptomatic ambulatory individuals, the focus should shift back towards avoiding unnecessary medical tests. Such efforts could lead to the better education of healthcare professionals on the rational prescription of these tests, ensuring effective and appropriate use based on solid clinical reasoning and a specific patient context.

### Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: constructive perspectives and comments on' how we manage a high D-dimer' [^111rctNM]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the narrative review, "How we manage a high D-dimer", authored by Massimo Franchini and colleagues and published in a recent issue of Haematologica. This review offers didactic and informative content, and although we generally agree with the perspectives and recommendations presented, we would like to address two specific issues that are vital to good clinical practice: the correct understanding of the properties of diagnostic tests; and the need for reduction of unnecessary test prescription.

Regarding the first issue, the review mentions the intrinsically low positive predictive value (PPV) of D-dimer testing. It is essential to clarify that PPV is not an intrinsic characteristic of the test. Rather, PPV is determined by the interaction between the pre-test probability and the test's positive likelihood ratio. Therefore, even a test like D-dimer, which has a low positive likelihood ratio, can exhibit a high PPV if applied in a setting with a very high pre-test probability.

Regarding the second issue, the review highlights that ubiquitous physiological conditions such as aging, pregnancy, and physical activity are among the main causes of elevated D-dimer levels. It also states that D-dimer testing has limited clinical utility in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient and appropriately suggests that it should only be prescribed in specific clinical situations. Yet, it also asserts that an elevated D-Dimer ordered in the random asymptomatic ambulatory patient cannot be ignored and warrants further consideration and proposes an algorithm for the management of these patients. In our opinion, this approach legitimizes inappropriate ordering of the test and shifts the focus away from what truly should be good clinical practice: the use of a diagnostic test as a complement to sound clinical reasoning. This applies not only to D-dimer, but also to other tests inappropriately routinely ordered in asymptomatic individuals, such as high-sensitivity troponinand the ANA test. These tests should be reserved for cases of clinical suspicion due to extremely high false-positive rates in the context of low pre-test probability, which can lead to further unnecessary tests, invasive procedures with iatrogenic risk, increased costs to the healthcare system, and anxiety for the patient. We reinforce the need for rational patient selection prior to prescribing the diagnostic test, rather than seeking an unlikely diagnosis afterwards motivated by inappropriate test ordering.

Conclusions

D-dimer testing is unequivocally a useful tool for the diagnosis of VTE. However, owing to its intrinsic poor positive predictive value, D-dimer is not specific for thromboembolic disease because increased levels are also observed in many other conditions, ranging from DIC to infections and malignant neoplasms. In other words, increased D-dimer levels may be encountered as part of an inflammatory state or cancer without being the sign of intravascular thrombus formation. Thus, while D-dimer measurement must be incorporated in multi-test algorithms for the evaluation of patients with suspected VTE, this measurement has limited clinical utility in unselected ambulatory cases and should, therefore, only be performed in specified clinical situations. However, the detection of increased D-dimer cannot be ignored and warrants a series of diagnostic procedures aimed at the proper management of these cases. This means, on the one hand, the exclusion of any associated thromboembolic complication and, on the other hand, the identification or exclusion of conditions associated with increased D-dimer. When the latter remains the only abnormality, individuals should be reassured about their health status and encouraged to avoid the repeated, obsessive measurement of D-dimer.

### Widely used types and clinical applications of D-dimer assay [^111CUH5f]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

D-dimers are formed by the breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin during fibrinolysis. D-dimer analysis is critical for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Modern assays for D-dimer are monoclonal antibody based. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the reference method for D-dimer analysis in the central clinical laboratory, but is time consuming to perform. Recently, a number of rapid, point-of-care D-dimer assays have been developed for acute care settings that utilize a variety of methodologies. In view of the diversity of D-dimer assays used in central laboratory and point-of-care settings, several caveats must be taken to assure the proper interpretation and clinical application of the results. These include consideration of preanalytical variables and interfering substances, as well as patient drug therapy and underlying disease. D-dimer assays should also be validated in clinical studies, have established cut-off values, and reported according to the reagent manufacturers recommendations.

### D-dimer testing: the role of the clinical laboratory in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115n9rxw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common, yet often unsuspected and unrecognised disease associated with a high mortality. New, objective, "user friendly" and cost effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful of the procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis markers. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the setting of normal values, a low clinical suspicion, and non-diagnostic lung scans. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

### Emergency department D-dimer testing [^117FvG6L]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Since the early 1980s, much attention has been paid to the development of a biochemical marker for venous thromboembolism. D-dimers are derivatives of fibrinolysis and recently have been touted as a means of screening for thromboemoblism. We review the physiologic, pathologic, and chemical bases for this new test, and outline the specific D-dimer assays currently available. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical utility of D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with venous thromboembolism.

### Clinical pre-test probability adjusted versus age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation strategy for DVT diagnosis: a diagnostic individual patient data meta-analysis [^117YBSbL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To increase the clinical usefulness of the D-dimer test in diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), two strategies have been proposed: the age-adjusted, and the clinical pre-test probability (CPTP) adjusted interpretation. However, it is not known which of these strategies is superior.

Objective

To conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis that compares the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and utility (the proportion of all patients who have a negative D-dimer test) when the two strategies are used to interpret D-dimer results.

Methods

Using an established IPD database, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the two strategies. A bivariate random effects regression model was used to estimate and compare the pooled sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. The pooled NPV and utility of the two strategies was compared using a univariate random effects model.

Results

Four studies were eligible for this analysis, with a total of 2554 patients. Overall prevalence of DVT was 12% with substantial heterogeneity between studies (P value < .001). Both strategies have high pooled NPVs (99.8%) with a difference of 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1, 0.1). The difference between the pooled specificity of the CPTP-adjusted strategy (57.3%) and the age-adjusted strategy (54.7%) was 2.6% (95% CI: -7.7, 12.8). The CPTP-adjusted strategy (49.4%) has a marginally greater pooled utility compared with the age-adjusted approach (47.4%), with a pooled difference of 1.9% (95% CI: -0.1, 3.9).

Conclusions

Both D-dimer interpretation strategies were associated with a high and similar NPV, and similar utility.

### Patient-level meta-analysis: effect of measurement timing, threshold, and patient age on ability of D-dimer testing to assess recurrence risk after unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^116SsMwk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), an elevated d-dimer level after anticoagulation is stopped is a risk factor for recurrent VTE. However, questions remain about the utility of measuring d-dimer in clinical practice.

Purpose

To determine whether the timing of testing, patient age, and the cut point used to define a positive or negative result affect the ability of d-dimer testing to distinguish risk for recurrent disease.

Data Sources

Comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) until July 2010, supplemented by reviewing conference abstracts and contacting content experts.

Study Selection

7 prospective studies that investigated an association between d-dimer, measured after stopping anticoagulation, and disease recurrence in patients with a first unprovoked VTE (proximal deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both).

Data Extraction

Patient-level databases were obtained, transferred to a central database, checked, completed with further information provided by study investigators, and pooled into a single database.

Data Synthesis

1818 patients with a first unprovoked VTE were followed for a mean of 26.9 months (SD, 19.1). A study-stratified multivariate Cox regression model, which included patient age, sex, hormone therapy use at the time of the index event, body mass index, timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing, and inherited thrombophilia as possible confounders, indicated that the hazard ratio for d-dimer status (positive vs. negative) was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.90 to 3.52). Only male sex had a significant effect on risk for recurrent VTE independent of d-dimer status. The Cox regression model and the log-rank test confirmed that the risk for recurrent VTE was higher in patients with a positive d-dimer result than in those with a negative result, regardless of the timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing or patient age. No study- or assay-specific d-dimer effect was found, and reassessing the analysis after recoding data according to specific quantitative d-dimer cut points (500 µg/L and 250 µg/L) did not change the results.

Limitations

Unmeasured variables could have affected the risk for recurrent VTE. The study population was predominantly white.

Conclusion

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have their d-dimer level measured after stopping anticoagulation, the timing of d-dimer testing, patient age, and the assay cut point used do not affect the ability of d-dimer to distinguish patients with a higher or lower risk for recurrent VTE.

### D-dimer for venous thromboembolism diagnosis: 20 years later [^1134mb7u]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

### Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism: 20 years of progress [^112Toi1z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Many guidelines suggest incorporating clinical assessment, imaging, and D-dimer testing into diagnostic algorithms in patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This special article reviews the evidence supporting the use of algorithms and their individual components for diagnosis of upper- and lower-extremity DVT and PE in adults, including pregnant women. The authors identified evidence through several electronic database searches to April 2017, evaluated the robustness of selected evidence, assessed whether diagnostic approaches that do not use algorithms are acceptable, and identified knowledge gaps that require further research.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^113kRJDw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy. This review: 1) describes how D-dimer is generated; 2) reviews the assays used for its detection; and 3) discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### The D-dimer assay [^113CguKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

D-dimer is an indirect marker of fibrinolysis and fibrin turnover; this molecule exhibits unique properties as a biological marker of hemostatic abnormalities as well as an indicator of intravascular thrombosis. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the systematic degradation of vascular thrombi through the fibrinolytic mechanism. Because of this, the D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in a number of clinical scenarios. Most commonly, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for excluding the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and for monitoring other conditions in which the patient is at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Limitations of the assay include D-dimer elevation in a constellation of clinical scenarios (age, pregnancy, and cancer) and lack of clinical standardization.

### Decision-making with D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115qeJk9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^113UHRKg]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Several scores have been developed in order to assess the clinical probability of VTE. The most used are the Wells and Geneva scores. In addition, a simplified and validated version of the Geneva score has been developed to widen its adoption in clinical practice. The combination of negative D-dimer ELISA and low-intermediate pre-test clinical probability excludes DVT or pulmonary embolism in approximately 30% of the cases with suspected VTE with no need for imaging (i.e. venous ultrasonography for a suspected DVT and computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiogram for a suspected pulmonary embolism). Conversely, D-dimer is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability, because a normal result does not exclude VTE, even when a highly sensitive assay is used; these cases should directly undergo imaging without D-dimer testing (Figure 2). Notably, as D-dimer levels increase with age, an age-adjusted (age × 10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) rather than a fixed cutoff (< 500 µg/L) is warranted to exclude VTE in patients with low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability. Although impaired renal function has been suggested to affect D-dimer levels in individuals suspected of having VTE, its influence seems to be less important than that of age.

D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical pre-test probability assessment (YEARS criteria or revised GENEVA score) has also been used for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women with the aim of avoiding unnecessary imaging. In addition, D-dimer testing provides important information not only for the diagnosis of VTE, but also for the anticoagulant management of VTE. Current evidence indicates that a positive D-dimer after completion of three months of anticoagulant therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of VTE recurrence than a negative test. Thus, following the demonstration of the strong association between D-dimer and VTE recurrence, D-dimer testing is often included in the prediction models designed to guide decisions for stopping anticoagulant therapy. On the other hand, persistently high D-dimer after stopping a 3-month anticoagulant treatment argues in favor of therapy prolongation in cases with unprovoked VTE.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113C8JE9]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and implications for further research

D-dimer testing has limited utility in older patients when the conventional cut-off value is applied. The application of the age adjusted cut-off value combined with a non-high clinical probability greatly increases the utility of a D-dimer test for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism in older patients, while hardly affecting the sensitivity. D-dimer levels below the age adjusted cut-off value correctly avoided imaging examinations in 30% to 54% of older patients with a non-high probability. This meta-analysis shows the robustness of our findings for patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, as well as for different age groups, D-dimer assays, and prevalence of venous thromboembolism.

Given that the age adjusted cut-off level could be easily implemented in routine laboratory practice it may have an immediate impact in clinical practice and serve the needs of older patients with a non-high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism by sparing a substantial proportion the burden of imaging investigations. Our results are not, however, applicable to patients with a high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism as additional imaging examination is warranted in these patients, irrespective of the D-dimer test results. Furthermore, since this strategy has only been confirmed in retrospective analyses, it could be argued that a formal cost effectiveness modeling studyor even a prospective impact studyis needed to further confirm the cost effectiveness and ease of use and acceptability of this diagnostic strategy in daily patient care before its implementation in clinical practice.

### Is stand-alone D-dimer testing safe to rule out acute pulmonary embolism? [^114UCWnd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials A stand-alone D-dimer below 750 μg/L has been proposed to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This was a post-hoc analysis on data from 6 studies comprising 7268 patients with suspected PE. The negative predictive value of a D-dimer < 750 μg/L ranged from 79% to 96% in various subgroups. Stand-alone D-dimer testing seems to be unsafe to rule out PE in all patients.

Summary

Background Recently, stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L⁻¹ has been proposed as a safe and efficient approach to rule out acute pulmonary embolism (PE), without additional imaging, but this approach needs validation. Objectives To evaluate stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L⁻¹ to rule out PE. Methods Individual data from 7268 patients with suspected PE previously enrolled in six prospective management studies were used. Patients were assessed by the Wells rule followed by quantitative D-dimer testing in those with a 'PE unlikely' score. Patients were classified post hoc as having a negative (< 750 μg L⁻¹) or positive (≥ 750 μg L⁻¹) D-dimer. Using a one-stage meta-analytic approach, the negative predictive value (NPV) of stand-alone D-dimer testing was evaluated overall and in different risk subgroups. Results The pooled incidence of PE was 23% (range, 13–42%). Overall, 44% of patients had a D-dimer < 750 μg L⁻¹, of whom 2.8% were diagnosed with PE at baseline or during 3-month follow-up (NPV, 97.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 94.9–98.5). The NPV was highest in patients with a low probability of PE according to the Wells rule (99.2%; 95% CI, 98.6–99.5%) and lowest in those with a high probability of PE (79.3%; 95% CI, 53.0–92.8%). The NPVs in patients with active cancer, patients with previous venous thromboembolism and inpatients were 96.2% (95% CI, 85.6–99.1%), 94.7% (95% CI, 88.6–97.6%) and 92.7% (95% CI, 79.3–97.7%), respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that stand-alone D-dimer testing at a positivity threshold of 750 μg L⁻¹ is not safe to rule out acute PE.

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be used in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer also is used as a part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, there are no robust data available at present on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in a hospital inpatient. Considerable confusion also exists among physicians about its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

### D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113SBb8a]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

For more than 2 decades, the plasma D-dimer assay has been used in conjunction with clinical prediction scores to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a low pretest probability of having this condition without the need for more costly and invasive methods. The increased thrombotic risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ie, those with high pretest probability of PE) and increased D-dimer levels in the absence of thrombosis diverge considerably from the study population used to originally validate this assay. However, the availability of D-dimer samples routinely collected from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the heterogeneity of early, smaller studies generated uncertainty regarding the clinical utility of the assay in this setting. Therefore, we conducted a diagnostic accuracy study to characterize the performance of D-dimer using various threshold values to exclude PE among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^11452w79]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Measurement of D-dimer concentration in the blood is a valuable tool in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer concentration below the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l combined with a "low/intermediate" or "unlikely" clinical probability can safely rule out the diagnosis in about 30% of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. However, the D-dimer concentration increases with age and its specificity for embolism decreases, which makes the test less useful to exclude pulmonary embolism in older patients. Indeed, the test is able to rule out pulmonary embolism in 60% of patients aged < 40 years, but in only 5% of patients aged > 80.

If the D-dimer test is combined with an "unlikely" clinical probabilityto rule out pulmonary embolism, 10% of patients > 75 years old versus 32% of patients of all ages do not need further diagnostic testing; the number needed to test for one negative test result is 10.6 and 3.1, respectively. Raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 μg/l and 1000 μg/l increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety, with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability.

By constructing receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, we derived a new, age dependent D-dimer cut-off value and analysed its safety and clinical utility, in combination with clinical probability assessment, for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in two large prospective cohort studies of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We then validated the outcome in two other large management studies.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^112DozZL]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening, syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation, and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (i.e. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases).D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value, but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution, and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

Cancer, inflammation, and infection

The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death.D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer even in the absence of thrombosis limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement in appropriate scoring systems including other biomarkers may help to identify cancer patients at increased risk of developing VTE who are thus candidates for primary thromboprophylaxis. In addition, although the value of screening patients with increased D-dimer for occult cancer is still a subject of debate, an occult cancer may be considered as the potential source of a substantial rise in D-dimer levels when other physiological or pathological causes have been ruled out. The usefulness of this approach has been highlighted in a clinical study in patients with unprovoked VTE, demonstrating that extremely high D-dimer (> 4,000 µg/L) is independently associated with the likelihood of an occult cancer.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^117UGcLx]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

The calculation of the age adjusted cut-off value was facilitated by the large size of the study population, which is a major strength of this analysis. However, some aspects of our study warrant comment. Firstly, two different D-dimer assays were used in the validation cohorts. Although there was no significant difference between the two tests, and the new cut-off value performed equally well with both assays, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect a difference between the two. It is unknown how the new cut-off value will perform in other D-dimer assays. Secondly, although D-dimer tests and the (variables for the) clinical decision rule were collected prospectively, this study was a retrospective analysis. After derivation and independent validation in a completely distinct cohort of patients, the next step would be to validate this cut-off value prospectively in a formal outcome study with patient follow-up.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a cut-off value adjusted to age combined with clinical probability greatly increased the utility of the D-dimer test for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among older patients without reducing safety. This new cut-off is therefore clinically relevant and has sustained external validation. The next step would be to validate this new D-dimer cut-off value prospectively before implementation in daily practice.

### Role of fibrin D-dimer testing in emergency medicine [^114Q7wUS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Systemic values of the fibrinolytic plasma marker fibrin D-dimer are raised in a variety of acute clinical conditions. D-dimer values can now be rapidly determined and used to aid diagnosis in emergency medicine. However, despite clinical guidelines, inappropriate and unnecessary measurement of D-dimer values is a significant clinical problem. An understanding of the pathophysiological basis and limitations of the value of D-dimer values may help reduce this problem. This review discusses the pathophysiology of the fibrinolytic system. The currently used assays, clinical indications, and limitations of D-dimer measurement are reviewed. Finally, the potential future clinical indications for measurement of D-dimer values in emergency medicine are discussed.

Methods

Literature on D-dimer was identified from Medline, along with cross referencing from the reference lists of major articles on the subject

Results

and conclusions: Systemic D-dimer values aids diagnosis, and is potentially a prognostic indicator, in a variety of clinical conditions in emergency medicine. However, it has limited specificity in patients with comorbid conditions. Although, currently, there is no standard D-dimer assay, immunoturbidimetric assays are the most suitable for use in emergency medicine

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

### Clinical utility of D-dimer in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and nondiagnostic lung scans or negative CT findings [^115ugejo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is difficult because the clinical diagnosis is nonspecific and all of the objective tests have limitations. The assay for plasma d-dimer may be useful as an exclusion test if results are negative. We conducted a prospective cohort study that evaluated the clinical utility (usefulness) of an automated quantitative d-dimer test in the diagnosis of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

Methods

Consecutive eligible patients who had clinically suspected PE with nondiagnostic lung scans or negative helical CT scan of the chest results underwent d-dimer testing.

Results

The d-dimer results were negative in 11 of 103 inpatients (10.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.5 to 18.3%) and 7 of 22 outpatients (31.8%, 95% CI, 13.9 to 54.9%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Measurement of plasma d-dimer is of limited clinical utility for inpatients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism and nondiagnostic lung scans or negative helical CT results at a US academic health center.

### The sensitivity and specificity of a red blood cell agglutination D-dimer assay for venous thromboembolism when performed on venous blood… [^112ajV9i]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

D DIMER is a fibrin degradation product formed by the enzymatic activity of plasmin on cross-linked fibrin polymers. Plasma levels can be measured and are useful in patients who present with symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, 1, 2 because negative test results rule out the likelihood of these diseases. The SimpliRED D-dimer assay is a unique whole-blood assay that uses a bispecific antibody to human red blood cells and D dimer. In a whole-blood sample, in the presence of elevated levels of D dimer, this antibody will cause visible agglutination of red blood cells. When performed by experienced personnel, this assay has a high sensitivity, moderate specificity, and a high negative predictive value for DVT and PE.

1–5 A high sensitivity of a D dimer for DVT and PE is critical, because the consequences of missing the diagnosis can be fatal or nonfatal recurrence. Table 1 summarizes the sensitivities, specificities, and negative predictive values and the corresponding 95% CI for all test formats. The median time for testing of the 24-hour EDTA tube after initial bedside testing was 22. 6 hours. The sensitivity of the capillary fingerstick D-dimer assay was 88%; specificity, 71%. The results of this study confirm that the SimpliRED D-dimer assay performed in the laboratory on venous blood samples collected in laboratory tubes containing one of the 3 anticoagulants has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value for VTE. These results have 2 important practical implications. First, samples can be tested in the laboratory by experienced technologists under optimal conditions without compromising sensitivity.

Second, if the assay is not available in one institution, samples can be transported within 24 hours to another site that has the test, if an EDTA-containing tube is used. The observed sensitivity for the laboratory tubes of 97% is consistent with the 94% sensitivity seen in the initial studies2, 3 with D-dimer testing performed at the bedside by selected, trained personnel.

### Plasma D-dimers in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism… [^11656ebv]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

More recently, the combination of a negative SimpliRED D-d result and low clinical suspicion derived using a formal scoring system has been shown to exclude deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to obviate the need for imaging. Several different D-d assays are now available, and clinicians should be aware of the performance characteristics of the test used before incorporation into diagnostic algorithms as these will differ between assays, and the results of clinical management studies cannot necessarily be safely extrapolated to assays other than those specifically evaluated. between weeks 1 and 221; they are significantly higher in patients with extensive proximal DVT than in those with below-the-knee DVT, 22 with peak levels corresponding to the extent of thrombosis. 23 D-dimer levels may be particularly useful in the diagnosis of recurrent DVT, a subgroup in which conventional imaging has important shortfalls.

18 Using direct thrombus magnetic resonance imaging, Fraser et al24 recently showed that D-d levels correlate with clot volume and surface area. The results of these 2 studies show that serial testing is obviated in the presence of normal D-d levels, and a recent decision analysis model has shown that this strategy is likely to be cost-effective.
88. Fourteen DVTs were identified, and a D-d threshold of 1092 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 66%. Positive and negative predictive values were 31% and 100%, respectively. At this threshold, therefore, the D-d test excluded DVT with the same confidence as a negative ultrasound finding. Bounameaux et al102 performed D-d measurements and bilateral CV on postoperative day 8 in 185 patients who had undergone gastrointestinal tract surgery.

Although D-d levels were increased substantially by surgery, a threshold of 3000 ng/mL had an 89% sensitivity and a 48% specificity for the diagnosis of DVT. At a cutoff value of 3500 ng/mL, the assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 32% for DVT. Bongard et al105 evaluated 173 patients undergoing hip surgery using a D-d assay and ultrasonography on postoperative day 12.

### Use of different D-dimer levels to exclude venous thromboembolism depending on clinical pretest probability [^115zBrs6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, the same D-dimer cut-off point is used to define a positive result for all patients with suspected venous thromboembolism, regardless of their pretest probability. However, use of a relatively high D-dimer cut-off point (lower sensitivity) for those with a low clinical pretest probability, and a low D-dimer cut-off point (higher sensitivity) for those with a high clinical pretest probability, may be preferable. To determine if using three different D-dimer cut-off points according to low, moderate or high clinical pretest probability has greater utility for exclusion of venous thromboembolism than using the same single D-dimer cut-off point in all patients. Data from a previously published study of 571 patients was used to identify the highest D-dimer cut-off point with a negative predictive value of at least 98% for the subgroup of patients with low and high pretest probability. The D-dimer cut-off point for those with moderate clinical pretest probability remained unchanged [0.5 fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) microgram mL⁻¹]. Accuracy of D-dimer testing for venous thromboembolism using three cut-off points vs. one cut-off point was than determined. D-dimer cut-off points of 0.2 and 2.1 FEU microgram mL⁻¹ were selected for the high and low pretest probability groups, respectively. When three pretest probability-specific cut-off points were used instead of the previously determined single D-dimer cut-off point (0.5 FEU microgram mL⁻¹), sensitivity and negative predictive value were unchanged (95 and 98%, respectively), but specificity increased from 44.7 to 60.4% (P < 0.001). This resulted in exclusion of venous thromboembolism in 80 additional patients. Use of three pretest probability-specific D-dimer cut-off points rather than a single D-dimer cut-off point for all patients, has the potential to increase the utility of D-dimer testing for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.

### Can causes of false-normal D-dimer test [simpliRED] results be identified? [^116ntJwo]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To simplify the diagnostic strategy of patients suspected for venous thromboembolism, the use of D-dimer tests has been advocated. Very important for the safety of such diagnostic strategies would be the capacity to recognise false-normal D-dimer results, in order to prevent inadequately withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients who actually have the disease. Insight in the causes of false-normal D-dimer results would therefore be necessary. We hypothesised that certain patient characteristics are associated with relatively low plasma D-dimer levels and, therefore, could increase the risk of false-normal results.

Methods

Consecutive patients with an objectively confirmed venous thromboembolic event and an independently obtained false-normal SimpliRED D-dimer test result were included in the study. For each patient, two controls with objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism and an adequate abnormal D-dimer result were selected. Baseline patient characteristics, obtained by standardised questionnaires, were compared between the two groups of patients.

Results

In total, 686 patients had a venous thromboembolic event and 47 of these patients had a false-normal SimpliRED result. Therefore, the overall sensitivity of the SimpliRED test for venous thromboembolism was 94% (95% CI: 92–95%). Although the prevalence of certain clinical characteristics was significantly higher in patients with a false-normal D-dimer result than in the controls [odds ratios for (LMW)heparin treatment and symptoms lasting more than 10 days: 5.1 (95% CI: 1.5–18.7) and 3.2 (95% CI:1.4–7.4), respectively], the prevalence of these characteristics was also high in the control group with an adequate abnormal D-dimer. Combining two or more of these characteristics had a low prevalence and did not further improve the ability to identify those patients with a false-normal D-dimer test at presentation.

Conclusions

Although these findings clearly indicate an association between certain baseline clinical characteristics and the occurrence of a false-normal SimpliRED test, the clinical utility for these characteristics is limited.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jpuht]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (> 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

Design

Systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

Data Sources

We searched Medline and Embase for studies published before 21 June 2012 and we contacted the authors of primary studies.

Study Selection

Primary studies that enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing, using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age adjusted (age × 10 µg/L) cut-off values, and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2 × 2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

Results

13 cohorts including 12,497 patients with a non-high clinical probability were included in the meta-analysis. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7% in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

Conclusions

The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity without modifying sensitivity, thereby improving the clinical utility of D-dimer testing in patients aged 50 or more with a non-high clinical probability.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) best practice advice 3 — Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^113YSXtA]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Remarks — Clinical decision rules and test selection in low PTP note that for patients presenting to an emergency department with a low probability of PE, PERC may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is warranted, and that if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used, this recommendation corresponds to the "unlikely PE" category. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results with standard thresholds. Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in outpatients older than 50 years is as safe as the standard cutoff and increases diagnostic utility; the age-adjusted cutoff = age (years) × 10 μg/L (using D-dimer assays with a cutoff of 500 μg/L). VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure for patients likely to have a diagnostic scan.

Age-adjusted D-dimer — clinical usefulness for increasing negative results and specificity shows consistent gains versus conventional cutoffs: the 3 Class II studies found a modest increase (ranging from 5% to 12%) in the proportion of non–high-risk patients with a negative D-dimer using age-adjusted versus conventional cutoffs, including a 12% increase from 28% to 40%, an increase from 28% to 33%, and from 28% to 37% with specificity improving from 36% to 47%. Class III studies also showed increases: from 46% to 51% and 34% to 40% in two validation sets; a 4% to 7% increase across clinical decision rules; from 54% to 63% with a yearly age-adjusted cutoff; specificity increases from 7% to 14% with a decadal formula and to 17% with yearly; and small increases from 2% to 6% (yearly) and from 2% to 13% using a 1,000 µg/L cutoff.

### Is D-dimer used according to clinical algorithms in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspicion of venous thromboembolism? A study in six European countries [^111mh2wu]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical algorithms consisting of pre-test probability estimation and D-dimer testing are recommended in diagnostic work-up for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to explore how physicians working in emergency departments investigated patients suspected to have VTE.

Materials and Methods

A questionnaire with two case histories related to the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) (Case A) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (Case B) were sent to physicians in six European countries. The physicians were asked to estimate pre-test probability of VTE, and indicate their clinical actions.

Results

In total, 487 physicians were included. Sixty percent assessed pre-test probability of PE to be high in Case A, but 7% would still request only D-dimer and 11% would exclude PE if D-dimer was negative, which could be hazardous. Besides imaging, a D-dimer test was requested by 41%, which is a "waste of resources" (extra costs and efforts, no clinical benefit). For Case B, 92% assessed pre-test probability of DVT to be low. Correctly, only D-dimer was requested by 66% of the physicians, while 26% requested imaging, alone or in addition to D-dimer, which is a "waste of resources".

Conclusions

These results should encourage scientific societies to improve the dissemination and knowledge of the current recommendations for the diagnosis of VTE.

### Clinical decision rules and D-dimer in venous thromboembolism: current controversies and future research priorities [^117FxJSs]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially lethal clinical condition that is suspected in patients with common clinical complaints, in many and varied, clinical care settings. Once VTE is diagnosed, optimal therapeutic management (thrombolysis, IVC filters, type and duration of anticoagulants) and ideal therapeutic management settings (outpatient, critical care) are also controversial. Clinical prediction tools, including clinical decision rules and D-Dimer, have been developed, and some validated, to assist clinical decision making along the diagnostic and therapeutic management paths for VTE. Despite these developments, practice variation is high and there remain many controversies in the use of the clinical prediction tools. In this narrative review, we highlight challenges and controversies in VTE diagnostic and therapeutic management with a focus on clinical decision rules and D-Dimer.

The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7% in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

Conclusions The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity without modifying sensitivity, thereby improving the clinical utility of D-dimer testing in patients aged 50 or more with a non-high clinical probability.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) evaluation — Best Practice Advice 3 states that clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria, and clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

### The use of a fixed high sensitivity to evaluate five D-dimer assays' ability to rule out deep venous thrombosis: a novel approach [^111DkdZZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is difficult to refute without complex diagnostic algorithms and expensive testing. We analysed five D-dimer assays' utility for exclusion of suspected DVT during a prospective clinical cohort trial, choosing a highly sensitive cut-off value at which to compare the assays. Assays were performed on 436 consecutive patients who were referred with symptoms that suggested a first episode of DVT. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) was defined as positive findings on comprehensive duplex ultrasonography or any episode, or complication of VTE detected during 3 months of clinical follow-up. All five assays were performed in 377 patients. At a highly sensitive cut-off value, all five assays reliably excluded DVT in the study population. While the choice of a highly sensitive cut-off value reduced the specificity of all the assays, the change in specificity differed between tests. Our findings suggest that a second-generation D-dimer assay could be used as a stand-alone test to rule out suspected DVT when a highly sensitive cut-off value is chosen. These findings should be subjected to a prospective management study, as a small reduction in sensitivity from our findings could result in a clinically relevant decrease in negative predictive value.

### D-dimer testing is useful to exclude deep vein thrombosis in elderly outpatients [^117WpU2m]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can be safely and reliably excluded in patients with a low clinical probability and a negative D-dimer result but the accuracy and utility of such a strategy is unclear in elderly patients.

Objectives

We sought to compare the performance of the Wells pretest probability (PTP) model and D-dimer testing between patients of different age groups and to examine the utility of the two PTP model classification schemes (low/moderate/high vs. unlikely/likely) in excluding DVT in elderly outpatients.

Patients/Methods

Pooled analysis of databases from three prospective diagnostic studies evaluating consecutive outpatients with suspected DVT.

Results

A total of 2696 patients were evaluated. DVT was diagnosed in 400 (15%) patients overall and in 50 out of 325 (15.5%) patients ≥ 60 years old. The PTP distribution and the prevalence of DVT in each PTP category were similar among the different age groups. The negative predictive values of a low or unlikely PTP score in combination with a negative D-dimer result were 99% for all groups. A negative D-dimer in combination with a low or unlikely PTP excluded 21.7% and 31% of patients ≥ 80 years old, respectively.

Conclusions

The combination of a low or unlikely PTP with a negative D-dimer result can effectively and safely exclude DVT in a significant proportion of elderly outpatients. However, this clinical prediction rule needs to be prospectively validated with different D-dimer assays in this specific population.

### D-dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^117TJSyF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur when a thrombus (blood clot) travels through the veins and lodges in the arteries of the lungs, producing an obstruction. People who are thought to be at risk include those with cancer, people who have had a recent surgical procedure or have experienced long periods of immobilisation and women who are pregnant. The clinical presentation can vary, but unexplained respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain and an increased respiratory rate are common.D-dimers are fragments of protein released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down as a result of normal body processes or with use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication. The D-dimer test is a laboratory assay currently used to rule out the presence of high D-dimer plasma levels and, by association, venous thromboembolism (VTE). D-dimer tests are rapid, simple and inexpensive and can prevent the high costs associated with expensive diagnostic tests.

Objectives

To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.

Search Methods

We searched 13 databases from conception until December 2013. We cross-checked the reference lists of relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently applied exclusion criteria to full papers and resolved disagreements by discussion. We included cross-sectional studies of D-dimer in which ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy, computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), selective pulmonary angiography and magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA) were used as the reference standard.•

Participants

Adults who were managed in hospital outpatient and A&E settings and were suspected of acute PE were eligible for inclusion in the review if they had received a pre-test probability score based on a CPR.•

Index Tests

quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative D-dimer tests.• Target condition: acute symptomatic PE.• Reference standards: We included studies that used pulmonary angiography, V/Q scintigraphy, CTPA and MRPA as reference standard tests.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). We resolved disagreements by discussion. Review authors extracted patient-level data when available to populate 2 × 2 contingency tables (true-positives (TPs), true-negatives (TNs), false-positives (FPs) and false-negatives (FNs)).

Main Results

We included four studies in the review (n = 1585 patients). None of the studies were at high risk of bias in any of the QUADAS-2 domains, but some uncertainty surrounded the validity of studies in some domains for which the risk of bias was uncertain. D-dimer assays demonstrated high sensitivity in all four studies, but with high levels of false-positive results, especially among those over the age of 65 years. Estimates of sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100%, and estimates of specificity from 23% to 63%.

Authors' Conclusions

A negative D-dimer test is valuable in ruling out PE in patients who present to the A&E setting with a low PTP. Evidence from one study suggests that this test may have less utility in older populations, but no empirical evidence was available to support an increase in the diagnostic threshold of interpretation of D-dimer results for those over the age of 65 years.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115KTUBp]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product that originates from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis that is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, as well as the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Besides VTE, D-dimer may be high due to physiologic conditions, including aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. In addition, several disorders have been associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Thus, it is far from unusual for hematologists to have to deal with ambulatory individuals with increased D-dimer without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review is dedicated to the management of these cases by the hematologist.

Others have argued for increasing the D-dimer cut-off value in older patients to improve the specificity and thereby increase the number of patients in whom — based on a D-dimer level below the cut-off value — imaging could be avoided. An age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value that increases gradually with age especially showed a promising increase in specificity without substantial loss of safety. This age adjusted cut-off value was defined as age (years)×10 μg/L for patients aged over 50 years (for example, for a patient aged 78 years, the D-dimer concentration would be considered normal below 780 μg/L). The age adjusted cut-off value was derived from a cohort of secondary care patients with a non-high probability of pulmonary embolism. This cohort was subdivided into 10 year age groups and the optimal cut-off value was selected for each age group — that is, the cut-off value with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest accompanying specificity. This revealed an increase of the optimal cut-off value of approximately 100 μg/L per decade (10 μg/L per year). This age adjusted cut-off value was subsequently validated in secondary care patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and in both primary and secondary care cohorts of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, higher cut-off values may also lead to an increased percentage of false negative cases (that is, missed cases of venous thromboembolism), which might make this strategy less safe. Since venous thromboembolism has a high short term mortality rate in older patients, doctors do not always get the chance to reconsider a missed diagnosis.

Controversy therefore remains on the utility of D-dimer testing (either using the conventional or higher cut-off values) to safely exclude venous thromboembolism in a substantial proportion of older patients. A formal systematic review increases the evidence base on this topic; a meta-analysis can provide more precise estimates of the accuracy of D-dimer testing among clinically relevant subgroups, whereby sources for interstudy heterogeneity can be considered. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing for excluding suspected venous thromboembolism in older patients, with a particular interest in whether increasing the threshold for test positivity using the proposed age adjusted manner is a safe and more efficient strategy than using the conventional cut-off value.

Suspected recurrent DVT — D-dimer testing strategies and outcomes: D-Dimer assays "have been less extensively evaluated in patients with suspected recurrent DVT than in those with a suspected first event", and levels "appear to return to normal values within 3 months of starting treatment of acute DVT", supporting that "D-dimer testing should be useful in patients with suspected recurrence". In two cohort strategies, a negative sensitive D-dimer combined with an unlikely Wells pretest probability (n = 16) or with a CUS that was normal or had an increase in residual diameter of < 4 mm (n = 75) led to "no patients experienced VTE during 3 months of follow-up", although this excluded recurrence in "only 15% of patients". Two larger cohorts reported "false-negative frequencies of 2% and 5%", and in a randomized trial of "1,096 outpatients" with "102 had prior VTE", the combined unlikely Wells plus negative D-dimer strategy yielded VTE at 3 months of "0.9% (95% CI, 0.3%-3.3%)".

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^117NFvQE]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Two systematic reviews concluded that a low clinical probability (as assessed by the clinical decision rule developed by Wells et al) and a negative result on SimpliRED D-dimer (a point of care assay; Agen Biomedical, Brisbane, Australia) could safely exclude venous thromboembolism. There has nevertheless been much discussion about the diagnostic accuracy and applicability of this semiqualitative point of care D-dimer test, mainly because of the low interobserver agreement associated with this assay. Perhaps as a consequence, several new point of care D-dimer tests have been introduced in recent years. Such tests have never been subject to a formal (diagnostic) meta-analysis because studies on their diagnostic performance were not available at the time of the two latest systematic reviews. Before these new point of care tests are widely implemented in daily practice, however, their diagnostic performance has to be thoroughly evaluated. We conducted a diagnostic meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of all currently available point of care D-dimer tests, with particular focus on their ability to exclude either DVT or PE in suspected outpatients.

Pulmonary embolism workup — D-dimer is used in suspected pulmonary embolism; its sensitivity is much greater than specificity and positive predictive value is poor, so its primary value is rapid identification of patients with low probability of pulmonary embolism in outpatient settings, while its negative predictive value is poor in hospitalized patients, especially after several days or in patients older than 60 years of age.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — low pretest probability (≤ 10%) diagnostic strategy: The ASH guideline panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT, and against additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 10%); if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT with no additional testing or anticoagulation required. If D-dimer is not readily available, alternate acceptable strategies include performing proximal lower extremity or whole-leg ultrasound alone, with a strong recommendation for D-dimer and a conditional recommendation for proximal or whole-leg ultrasound. The strategy assumes test results are obtained under optimal conditions, and suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized, postsurgical, or pregnant patients due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^112RQMMh]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Impact in the clinical setting

A recent cost effectiveness analysis showed that D-dimer measurement as part of the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism was cost saving until the age of 79 years. After 80 years, the test's clinical utility was too low to be cost effective, and the costs of strategies with or without D-dimer testing were similar. This analysis was based on the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l for ELISA based assays. It can be expected, however, that the test's cost effectiveness in older patients would increase with the new cut-off value, as the number needed to test was lower with the age adjusted cut-off value compared with the conventional cut-off value in patients > 80 years old (3.5 versus 6.6). For a given clinical setting, this means that for every 35 patients aged > 80 with a low/intermediate or "unlikely" clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, imaging tests can be avoided in five patients when the conventional cut-off is used compared with 10 patients when the age adjusted cut-off value is used. Avoiding imaging tests (that is, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy or computed tomography) would be of particular benefit for older patients because of the high frequency of non-conclusive scintigraphy results, the risk from injection with iodine contrast agent for computed tomography scanning, and the length of hospital stay when ordering imaging tests in this patient population.

Some may argue that having to calculate a D-dimer cut-off value is impractical in a clinical setting, and that the new value is really a series of multiple cut-off points. However, the treating physician needs to remember only the coefficient of 10 in order to calculate the new cut-off value, which is an easy multiplication.

### Selective D-dimer testing for diagnosis of a first suspected episode of deep venous thrombosis: a randomized trial [^116NJWJD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

D-Dimer testing is sensitive but not specific for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Changing the use of testing and the threshold level for a positive test result on the basis of risk for DVT might improve the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity and reduce the need for testing.

Objective

To determine whether using a selective D-dimer testing strategy based on clinical pretest probability (C-PTP) for DVT is safe and reduces diagnostic testing compared with using a single D-dimer threshold for all patients.

Design

Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial. Patients were allocated using a central automated system. Ultrasonographers and study adjudicators but not other study personnel were blinded to trial allocation. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00157677)

Setting

5 Canadian hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive symptomatic patients with a first episode of suspected DVT.

Intervention

Selective testing (n = 860), defined as D-dimer testing for outpatients with low or moderate C-PTP (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 1.0 µg/mL [low C-PTP] or < 0.5 µg/mL [moderate C-PTP]) and venous ultrasonography without D-dimer testing for outpatients with high C-PTP and inpatients, or uniform testing (n = 863), defined as D-dimer testing for all participants (DVT excluded at D-dimer levels < 0.5 µg/mL).

Measurements

The proportion of patients not diagnosed with DVT during initial testing who had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up and the proportion of patients undergoing D-dimer testing and ultrasonography.

Results

The incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism at 3 months was 0.5% in both study groups (difference, 0.0 percentage point [95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8 percentage points]). Selective testing reduced the proportion of patients who required D-dimer testing by 21.8 percentage points (CI, 19.1 to 24.8 percentage points). It reduced the proportion who required ultrasonography by 7.6 percentage points (CI, 2.9 to 12.2 percentage points) overall and by 21.0 percentage points (CI, 14.2 to 27.6 percentage points) in outpatients with low C-PTP.

Limitation

Results may not be generalizable to all D-dimer assays or patients with previous DVT, study personnel were not blinded, and the trial was stopped prematurely.

Conclusion

A selective D-dimer testing strategy seems as safe as and more efficient than having everyone undergo D-dimer testing when diagnosing a first episode of suspected DVT.

### Potential impact of adjusting the threshold of the quantitative D-dimer based on pretest probability of acute pulmonary embolism [^114vVTJk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The utility of D-dimer testing for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) can be limited by test specificity. The authors tested if the threshold of the quantitative D-dimer can be varied according to pretest probability (PTP) of PE to increase specificity while maintaining a negative predictive value (NPV) of > 99%.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational multicenter study of emergency department (ED) patients in the United States. Eligible patients had a diagnostic study ordered to evaluate possible PE. PTP was determined by the clinician's unstructured estimate and the Wells score. Five different D-dimer assays were used. D-dimer test performance was measured using 1) standard thresholds and 2) variable threshold values: twice (for low PTP patients), equal (intermediate PTP patients), or half (high PTP patients) of standard threshold. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 45 days required positive imaging plus decision to treat.

Results

The authors enrolled 7,940 patients tested for PE, and clinicians ordered a quantitative D-dimer for 4,357 (55%) patients who had PTPs distributed as follows: low (74%), moderate (21%), or high (4%). At standard cutoffs, across all PTP strata, quantitative D-dimer testing had a test sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91% to 97%), specificity of 58% (95% CI = 56% to 60%), and NPV of 99.5% (95% CI = 99.1% to 99.7%). If variable cutoffs had been used the overall sensitivity would have been 88% (95% CI = 83% to 92%), specificity 75% (95% CI = 74% to 76%), and NPV 99.1% (95% CI = 98.7% to 99.4%).

Conclusions

This large multicenter observational sample demonstrates that emergency medicine clinicians currently order a D-dimer in the majority of patients tested for PE, including a large proportion with intermediate PTP and high PTP. Varying the D-dimer's cutoff according to PTP can increase specificity with no measurable decrease in NPV.

### Limitations of D-dimer testing in unselected inpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism [^1119QXSn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the utility and limitations of D-dimer testing for the evaluation of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients.

Methods

We performed D-dimer testing by four different methods in unselected inpatients undergoing radiologic evaluation for possible venous thromboembolism. We included patients with a history of malignancy, recent surgery, thrombosis, and anticoagulation treatment. C-reactive protein levels were assayed as a measure of inflammation.

Results

Of 45 patients with radiographically proven proximal deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, 43 had elevated D-dimer levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (sensitivity, 96%); the specificity of the test was 23% (36/157). The qualitative non-ELISA tests had higher specificities, but their sensitivities were < 70%. Nineteen patients (42%) with thrombosis had false-negative D-dimer tests by at least one assay. The specificity of the tests decreased with increasing duration of hospitalization, increasing age, and increasing C-reactive protein levels. D-dimer testing had little or no utility in distinguishing patients with thrombosis from those without in patients who had been hospitalized for more than 3 days, were older than 60 years, or had C-reactive protein levels in the highest quartile.

Conclusion

In unselected inpatients, D-dimer testing has limited clinical utility because of its poor specificity. This is particularly true for older patients, those who have undergone prolonged hospitalization, and those with markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels. In some patient subsets, a negative non-ELISA D-dimer test cannot discriminate between inpatients with and without thrombosis.

### D-dimer specificity and clinical context: an old unlearned story [^115pUABF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the D-dimer dose adjustment of anticoagulant prophylaxis has not been proven effective even in COVID-19 patients, although some scientific societies suggest the possibility of stratifying patients based on serum D-dimer levels. This strategy's rationale is at least controversial: even in overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the D-dimer is unreliable since its specificity varies considerably with the cut-off value. Approximately 20% of patients with a D-dimer value greater than 2.2 μg/mL do not have DIC.

Finally, it should be considered that the ISTH SSC on Fibrinolysis group has identified several technical pitfalls detected in current studies on D-dimer in COVID-19 cases.

In conclusion, D-Dimer guided-anticoagulation management does not seem supported enough by evidence-based recommendations. Studies that specifically address this issue are needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cYYWv]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

D-dimer concentrations are highly sensitive for thrombus formation. Hence D-dimer tests are often used to rule-out venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in suspected patients with a non-high clinical probability. Patients with a high clinical probability do not require a D-dimer test. In these patients imaging examination is warranted to confirm or refute the diagnosis, irrespective of the D-dimer results (fig 1). However, D-dimer concentrations increase with age, which leads to a high proportion of older patients with D-dimer concentrations higher than conventional cut-off values (500 µg/L). This in turn leads to a low specificity (that is, more false positive results) of D-dimer testing in older patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism; the specificity is 49% to 67% for patients aged less than 50 years but in older old patients (≥ 80 years) between 0% and 18%. As imaging is indicated in patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism with a D-dimer concentration above the cut-off value, a high proportion of older patients with a non-high clinical probability undergo unnecessary diagnostic investigations. This can be burdensome, especially in older patients, and the yield of this imaging is relatively low (typically 20% or less of patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism are actually affected). As a result of a low specificity of D-dimer testing in older patients, some authors dissuade doctors from D-dimer testing in very old patients. Yet this would actually imply referring all suspected older patients for imaging, which is even less desirable.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^115W3Wv6]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

We defined a priori the following clinical and design characteristics of a study as potential relevant covariates: type of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE); proportion of patients with a proximal DVT (for DVT studies only); proportion of patients with a recurrent DVT (for DVT studies only); proportion of patients with an active malignancy; and proportion of patients with recent surgery (< 4 weeks). The QUADAS tool criteria, in particular differential verification and incorporation bias, were also examined as potential sources of bias.

To graphically present the results, we plotted the individual and summary points of sensitivity and specificity in a receiver operating characteristic graph, plotting the index test's sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y axis against 1 − specificity (false negative rate) on the x axis. In addition, we plotted the 95% confidence region and a 95% prediction region around the pooled estimates to illustrate the precision with which the pooled values were estimated (confidence ellipse of a mean) and to show the amount of between study variation (prediction ellipse; the likely range of values for a new study).

Finally, we estimated the predictive value of the point of care D-dimer tests. Given that D-dimer testing is predominately used to exclude venous thromboembolism, the post-test probability of a negative D-dimer test — that is, the negative predictive value — is of highest importance. As the incidence of venous thromboembolism following normal results from imaging tests is around 2% for patients suspected of DVT, a post-test probability of 2% or less would be accepted as safe. According to Bayes' theorem, the post-test probability of a negative test can be calculated using the negative likelihood ratio; that is, the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio of a negative test result (LR-), where pre-test odds is calculated by dividing pre-test probability by (1 − pre-test probability) and the post-test probability comprises post-test odds divided by (1 + post-test odds). The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were used to calculate the average LR- by dividing (1-sensitivity) over specificity. Subsequently, we estimated the negative predictive value of the different point of care D-dimer tests for three different clinically relevant prevalences of venous thromboembolism:5% prevalence (low risk patients); 20% prevalence (moderate risk patients); and 50% prevalence (high risk patients). Where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

### Serum D-dimer levels at admission for prediction of outcomes in acute pancreatitis [^1135AAZ3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study has several potential limitations. First, D-dimer could not be detected in some of the samples obtained upon admission; therefore, the measurement of D-dimer levels may be subject to selection bias. To counter this potential limitation, a head-to-head comparison of patients having available D-dimer values with those not having available D-dimer values was performed. No difference in clinical outcomes, including persistent organ failure, was found between the two groups. Second,

the D-dimer level is affected by many factors; any process (including pregnancy, inflammation, cancer, and surgery) that increases fibrin production or breakdown also increases D-dimer levels. In addition, D-dimer levels and age are closely related. Furthermore, the magnitude of the unit of measure for the D-dimer level varies widely across laboratories using the same assays, and an accepted standardization for D-dimer concentration across assay types is lacking. The optimal D-dimer test methodology and associated threshold value for detecting AP remain uncertain. Consequently, the results available for one assay cannot simply be extrapolated to other assays, even those using similar formats.

### D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111KxaN8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This diagnostic study found that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of PE had plasma D-dimer levels of 0.05 μg/mL or greater. If using D-dimer to exclude patients with PE, the increased values we found among 92.3% of patients suggest that this assay would be less useful than in the populations in which it was originally validated, among which a minority of patients had increased D-dimer values. Setting higher D-dimer thresholds was associated with improved specificity at the cost of an increased false-negative rate that could be associated with an unacceptable patient safety risk. The inclusion of patients with D-dimer and CTPA results was necessary to estimate diagnostic performance; however, this may have introduced selection bias by excluding patients unable to undergo CTPA. Nonetheless, given the high pretest probability of PE and low specificity observed in this and other studies, these results suggest that the use of D-dimer levels to exclude PE among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may be inappropriate and have limited clinical utility.

### Does this patient have deep vein thrombosis? [^112khAkj]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have nonspecific signs and symptoms. Missed DVT diagnosis may result in fatal pulmonary embolism. Since many patients may have DVT, a selective and efficient diagnostic process is needed.

Objective

To systematically review trials that determined the prevalence of DVT using clinical prediction rules either with or without D-dimer, for the diagnosis of DVT.

Data Sources

English- and French-language studies were identified from MEDLINE from 1990 to July 2004 and supplemented by a review of all relevant bibliographies.

Study Selection

We included studies that prospectively enrolled consecutive, unselected outpatients with suspected DVT and applied clinical prediction rules before D-dimer testing or diagnostic imaging. All studies included sufficient information to allow the calculation of the prevalence of DVT for at least 1 of the 3 clinical probability estimates (low, moderate, or high). We required that patients be followed up for a minimum 3-month period. Unless the clinical model incorporated prior DVT, studies were excluded if patients with a history of prior DVT were enrolled.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the prevalence of DVT, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of D-dimer in each of the 3 clinical probability estimates. Data for the D-dimer in all studies were pooled and analyzed as high-sensitivity/low-specificity test or a moderate-sensitivity/moderate-specificity test.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies involving more than 8000 patients used 1 clinical prediction rule for diagnosing DVT, of which 11 incorporated D-dimer testing in the diagnostic algorithm. The prevalence of DVT in the low, moderate, and high clinical probability groups was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.0%-8.0%), 17% (95% CI, 13%-23%), and 53% (95% CI, 44%-61%), respectively. The overall prevalence of DVT was 19% (95% CI, 16%-23%). Pooling all studies, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative LRs of D-dimer testing in the low probability group were 88% (95% CI, 81%-92%), 72% (95% CI, 65%-78%), and 0.18% (95% CI, 0.12–0.18); in the moderate probability group: 90% (95% CI, 80%-95%), 58% (95% CI, 49%-67%), and 0.19% (95% CI, 0.11–0.32); and in the high probability group: 92% (95% CI, 85%-96%), 45% (95% CI, 37%-52%), and 0.16% (95% CI, 0.09–0.30). The LRs for a normal result on a high or moderately sensitive D-dimer assay among patients with: (1) low clinical suspicion were 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03–0.37) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.12–0.31); (2) moderate clinical suspicion were 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01–0.21) and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13–0.39); and (3) high clinical suspicion were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03–0.18) and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.10–0.38).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy for DVT improves when clinical probability is estimated before diagnostic tests. Patients with low clinical probability on the predictive rule have prevalence of DVT of less than 5%. In low-probability patients with negative D-dimer results, diagnosis of DVT can be excluded without ultrasound; in patients with high clinical suspicion for DVT, results should not affect clinical decisions.

The D-dimer antigen is a degradation byproduct of the fibrinolytic process and is commonly used as a biomarker in various clinical settings such as the evaluation of venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Much more literature on and collective experience with use of the D-dimer assay exists for adult than pediatric patients. However, thrombotic complications are becoming increasingly recognized in infants and children, and reports on this assay's utility in a variety of other pediatric applications are increasing. This review examines the biochemical basis of D-dimer formation, issues raised by the varied testing methods used to measure D-dimer, and the scenarios in which this assay may provide information useful for medical management. D-dimer formation begins with cleavage of fibrinogen molecules by activated thrombin into fibrin monomers, which then polymerize.

Thrombin activates fibrin-bound factor XIII to form factor XIIIa that, in turn, catalyzes formation of covalent.

Intermediate pretest probability lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — The ASH guideline panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (∼25%). For an intermediate clinical probability population where prevalence was modeled at 25%, whole-leg ultrasound as the sole diagnostic tool met the threshold criteria, or proximal lower extremity ultrasound as long as negative results were followed by serial proximal ultrasound; at lower intermediate prevalence of 15%, proximal ultrasound alone was acceptable, as was use of D-dimer followed by proximal or whole-leg ultrasound. Any pathways with no follow-up testing for positive D-dimer results yielded a large number of FP results, and pathways starting with D-dimer resulted in a large number of FP results despite follow-up testing for positive D-dimer results. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions, suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing, serial ultrasound is defined as 1 additional ultrasound in 1 week following the initial ultrasound, and D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized, postsurgical, or pregnant patients due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis — hemodynamically stable, nonpregnant patients: If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnancy) due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds, and there are limited data on the utility of D-dimer for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who present with suspected recurrent PE. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions and suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing, and if prior imaging is available, comparison of the previous and current imaging is warranted to determine whether the findings are new and represent recurrent PE. Scores were used to assess clinical probability of recurrent PE, but the Wells and Geneva scores have not been specifically validated for patients with suspected recurrent PE.

Evidence Review

Establishing Pretest Probability

D-dimers, used alongside other clinical factors, are well-established biomarkers for guiding further diagnostic imaging to rule out PE in the nonpregnant population.D-dimer testing incorporated in risk assessment algorithms in pregnancy was evaluated in 2 prospective studies in 2018 and 2019: the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism During Pregnancy (CT-PE) study and the Pregnancy-Adapted YEARS Algorithm for the Diagnosis of Suspected Pulmonary Embolism (ARTEMIS) study (Table 1).

Table 1
Establishing the Pretest Probability of PE

The CT-PE study involved 395 participants with suspected PE.PE was ruled out in patients at low or intermediate pretest probability using the revised Geneva score with a D-dimer level < 500 μg/L. When the pretest clinical probability was high or when the D-dimer level was ≥ 500 μg/L, a bilateral compression ultrasonography (CUS) of the lower extremities was performed; if no DVT was identified, a CTPA was performed. No VTE or deaths occurred during the 3-month follow-up (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-1.1%). Chest imaging was avoided in 11.6% of participants. However, the single D-dimer cutoff level limits the utility of the revised Geneva score following the first trimester of pregnancy as D-dimer levels tend to increase from 1 trimester to another and peak around delivery. In addition, the revised Geneva score comprises predictors that are generally not applicable to pregnant patients. The Pregnancy-Adapted Geneva score, developed from the CT-PE study, excludes criteria that are less or unlikely to be relevant in pregnancy (eg, age > 65 years and malignancy). Although the Pregnancy-Adapted Geneva score outperformed the Geneva score (area under the curve, 0.795 vs 0.684), it requires prospective validation.

### The accuracy of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis [^111YD3Bi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D -dimer test in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the adult emergency department population.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographies of previous systematic reviews was conducted, with no language restriction. Experts in the field of PE research were contacted to identify unpublished studies. Prospective investigations involving a predominately outpatient population suspected of PE that used ELISA D -dimer tests were included. Two authors extracted data independently and assessed study quality on the basis of the patient spectrum and reference standard. Consensus was reached by means of conference. The analysis was based on a summary receiver operating characteristic curve and pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity by using a random-effects model.

Results

The search yielded 52 publications. No unpublished studies were found. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and provided a sample of 2,126 patients. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found significant heterogeneity among the 11 studies. Subgroup analysis of the 9 studies that used traditional ELISA D -dimer methods yielded the most valid pooled estimates, with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and a specificity of 0.45 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.55). Advanced age resulted in a lower specificity. A prolonged duration of symptoms decreased the sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusion

The ELISA D -dimer test is highly sensitive but nonspecific for the detection of PE in the clinical setting. This test might help clinicians safely rule out PE, especially in the face of low and low-to-moderate pretest probabilities.

### The unlikely presence of deep vein thrombosis in a patient with low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer: a case report [^113grqex]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is commonly encountered in the emergency department. Clinical models, such as the Wells criteria, allow physicians to estimate the probability of DVT in a patient. Current literature suggests a low pretest probability combined with a negative D-dimer laboratory study rules out DVT approximately 99% of the time.

Case Report

This case discusses a 37-year-old male patient who had a low pretest probability and a negative D-dimer, but was found to have a DVT on Doppler ultrasound. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The astute emergency physician must not discount clinical suspicion in order to decide when radiographic imaging is warranted for a possible venous thromboembolism. New adjuncts, such as bedside ultrasonography, can also be implemented to further risk stratify patients, potentially decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with DVT.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^1119hm4S]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosing patients suspected of venous thromboembolism — that is, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — is a major challenge because the signs and symptoms are often mild and non-specific. Primary care physicians in particular, who in many countries are faced with the initial presentation of venous thromboembolism and have to decide whether to refer patients for subsequent testing or not, can have difficulty diagnosing venous thromboembolism.

D-dimer testing can be used to improve the cost effectiveness of the diagnostic process. D-dimers are degradation products of cross linked fibrin that are generated during fibrinolysis, and circulating levels are typically elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism. A negative result in a D-dimer test in combination with a low pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism (as assessed by a validated clinical decision rule) can safely rule out DVT as well as PE. A large variety of laboratory D-dimer tests are currently available and their accuracy has been described extensively.

Recently, various point of care or "near patient" D-dimer tests have been introduced. These D-dimer tests can be performed during the consultation of a patient and results are already available within 10–15 minutes. Using these tests could avoid the need for more labour intensive and time consuming laboratory D-dimer testing. This advantage is especially useful for primary care physicians, as they often have to decide on further patient management during the consultation of a patient with suspected venous thromboembolism. In this setting, referral for conventional laboratory D-dimer testing could be either impractical owing to limited access to central laboratories or time consuming for both patient and doctor. Furthermore, venous thromboembolism is confirmed by subsequent imaging tests in only 10–20% of all referred patients. Application of point of care D-dimer tests could, therefore, be cost effective not only in primary care patients suspected of venous thromboembolism but also in secondary care outpatients, notably those presenting at emergency departments. Another advantage in this setting is that a test result can be obtained more rapidly than when using conventional laboratory testing.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^111kCibX]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — intermediate pretest probability (~20%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%), followed by VQ scan or CTPA for patients requiring additional testing; if D-dimer or VQ scan are not available or testing would delay treatment in high suspicion, proceeding directly to VQ scan or CTPA alone is acceptable, and patients likely to have a nondiagnostic VQ scan should undergo CTPA. The panel also recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against additional testing following negative CTPA or normal VQ scan in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%). Remarks note that a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized and certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results; in outpatients older than 50 years an age-adjusted D-dimer can be used (age [years] × 10 μg/L with assays having a cutoff of 500 μg/L); VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure when expertise and timely interpretation are available, with CTPA preferred when VQ is not feasible; results should be obtained under optimal conditions, with suboptimal D-dimer or CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing, and nondiagnostic VQ scans followed by CTPA.

### Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside with low pre-test probability and D-dimer: safety and clinical utility of 4 methods to assign pre-test probability [^115gdtqy]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Less than 35% of patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) actually have PE. Safe bedside methods to exclude PE could save scarce health care resources if they exclude large proportions of patients with suspected PE and are widely applicable. Non-Elisa D-dimer in combination with pre-test probability of suspected PE can safely exclude PE at the bedside. Pre-test probability can be assigned by gestalt or by using clinical models (Wells, Wicki, Rodger).

Materials and Methods

We combined two databases from studies of patients with suspected PE and retrospectively compared the diagnostic test characteristics of the different methods of assigning pre-test probability.

Results

535 patients were studied. PE was confirmed in 20.8% of study patients. Two clinical predictive models (Rodger and Wells) and overall diagnostic impression have similar sensitivities ranging from 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89–99%) to 99% (93–100%). Wicki's model has a sensitivity of 89% (77–96%). The Wells' model with a cutoff of less than 2 points in association with semi-quantitative D-dimer has a specificity of 11% (CI 7–15%). The specificities for the other clinical predictive model are ranging from 21% (17–25%) to 49% (CI 42–55%).

Conclusion

Semi-quantitative D-dimer must be combined with safe clinical probability assessment to safely exclude PE in a significant proportion of patients. Wicki's model in association with semi-quantitative D-dimer has the lowest sensitivity and should be used carefully to exclude PE at the bedside. The Wells' model with a cutoff of less than 2 points when combined with semi-quantitative D-dimer excluded very few patients and therefore limits its clinical utility.

### D-dimer for the exclusion of acute venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^114NcPTj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Despite extensive literature, the diagnostic role of d-dimer for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unclear, reflecting multiple d-dimer assays and concerns about differing sensitivities and variability.

Purpose

To systematically review trials that assessed sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and variability among d-dimer assays.

Data Sources

Studies in all languages were identified by searching PubMed from 1983 to January 2003 and EMBASE from 1988 to January 2003.

Study Selection

The researchers selected prospective studies that compared d-dimer with a reference standard. Studies of high methodologic quality were included in the primary analyses; sensitivity analysis included additional weaker studies.

Data Extraction

Two authors collected data on study-level factors: d-dimer assay used, cutoff value, and whether patients had suspected DVT or PE.

Data Synthesis

For DVT, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative rapid ELISA dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.96 (95% confidence limit [CL], 0.91 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.12 (CL, 0.04 to 0.33); and sensitivity, 0.96 (CL, 0.90 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.09 (CL, 0.02 to 0.41), respectively. For PE, the ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA also dominate the rank order for these values: sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.85 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.03 to 0.58); and sensitivity, 0.95 (CL, 0.83 to 1.00), and negative likelihood ratio, 0.13 (CL, 0.02 to 0.84), respectively. The ELISA and quantitative rapid ELISA have negative likelihood ratios that yield a high certainty for excluding DVT or PE. The positive likelihood values, which are in the general range of 1.5 to 2.5, do not greatly increase the certainty of diagnosis. Sensitivity analyses do not affect these findings.

Limitations

Although many studies evaluated multiple d-dimer assays, findings are based largely on indirect comparisons of test performance characteristics across studies.

Conclusion

The ELISAs in general dominate the comparative ranking among the d-dimer assays for sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio. For excluding PE or DVT, a negative result on quantitative rapid ELISA is as diagnostically useful as a normal lung scan or negative duplex ultrasonography finding.

### An evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a randomized trial [^115J9k13]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer test, but this approach has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

Objective

To determine if additional diagnostic testing can be safely withheld in patients with suspected PE who have negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results.

Design

Randomized comparisons in 2 subgroups of a prospective multicenter study.

Setting

7 university hospitals.

Patients

1126 outpatients or inpatients with suspected PE; of these, 456 patients with negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results were randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Patients were classified into 2 clinical probability groups: those with a low clinical probability of PE (low-probability group) and those with a moderate or high clinical probability of PE, a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and no evidence of proximal deep venous thrombosis on bilateral ultrasonography (moderate- or high-probability group).

Interventions

The experimental intervention for both probability groups was no further diagnostic testing for PE. The control intervention for the low-probability group was a ventilation-perfusion lung scan followed by ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs on the same day. If the lung scan was nondiagnostic, ultrasonography of the legs was repeated 7 and 14 days later. The control intervention for the moderate- or high-probability group was ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs after 7 and 14 days. In the control and experimental groups, anticoagulation was withheld or withdrawn if PE was not diagnosed.

Measurements

Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 6 months of follow-up.

Results

Prevalence of VTE was 15.2% in the 1126 enrolled patients. In the low-probability group, VTE occurred during follow-up in 0 of 182 patients who had no additional diagnostic testing and in 1 of 185 patients who had additional testing (difference, -0.5 percentage point [95% CI, -3.0 to 1.6 percentage points]). In the moderate- or high-probability group, VTE occurred during follow-up in 1 of 41 patients who had no additional diagnostic testing and in 0 of 41 patients who had additional testing (difference, 2.4 percentage points [CI, -6.4 to 12.6 percentage points]).

Limitations

The authors could not enroll 2000 patients as originally planned; 3 randomly assigned patients did not receive the allocated intervention, and 7 received inadequate follow-up. Personnel who performed follow-up evaluations were not blinded to the results of diagnostic testing at enrollment or to allocation group assignments.

Conclusion

In patients with a low probability of PE who have negative D-dimer results, additional diagnostic testing can be withheld without increasing the frequency of VTE during follow-up. Low clinical probability and negative D-dimer results occur in 50% of outpatients and in 20% of inpatients with suspected PE.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115771Z4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

Moderate pretest probability of first lower extremity DVT — initial testing: We recommend one of the following initial tests — a highly sensitive D-dimer, proximal CUS, or whole-leg US — rather than no testing (Grade 1B for all comparisons) or venography (Grade 1B for all comparisons), and we suggest initial use of a highly sensitive D-dimer rather than US (Grade 2C). Choice between a highly sensitive D-dimer test or US as the initial test will depend on local availability, access to testing, and costs of testing.

### Effectiveness of managing suspected pulmonary embolism using an algorithm combining clinical probability, D-dimer testing, and computed tomography… [^111cqhdr]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measure Symptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism during 3-month follow-up. Pulmonary embolism was considered a possible cause of death in 7 patients after a negative CT scan. The algorithm was completed and allowed a management decision in 97. 9% of patients. Conclusions A diagnostic management strategy using a simple clinical decision rule, D-dimer testing, and CT is effective in the evaluation and management of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Its use is associated with low risk for subsequent fatal and nonfatal VTE. In patients with a clinical decision rule indicating pulmonary embolism unlikely, a D-dimer concentration was measured, using either the VIDAS D-dimer assay or the Tinaquant assay. A D-dimer concentration of 500 ng/mL or less was defined as normal.

The decision of the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism was made by trained attending radiologists who were blinded to any specific patient clinical information. By protocol design they knew that a patient referred for CT either had a D-dimer level that was above 500 ng/mL or a clinical decision rule score that was higher than 4 points, but did not know which of these items was the reason for performing a CT scan. This large cohort study of 3306 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism demonstrates that the use of a diagnostic algorithm consisting of a dichotomous decision rule, D-dimer testing, and CT scan can guide treatment decisions with a low risk for subsequent pulmonary embolism. No further diagnostic testing was necessary in the third of our patients who had an unlikely clinical probability score in combination with a normal D-dimer test result, with a 3-month incidence of VTE of 0. 5%.

To improve the simplicity and utility of their decision rule, Wells et al proposed changing their model from the original 3 categories to 2 categories. 3 Our study is the first to prospectively validate the safety of the dichotomized score in combination with the D-dimer assay. Compared with a combination using the 3-category classification, this approach has the potential to increase the number of patients in whom pulmonary embolism can be excluded by approximately 50%. 3, 17.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^112Q1i2b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — nonhigh-risk adult patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) — are commonly based on the patient's age in years (age×10 μg/L) for patients older than 50 years, with most studies using high-sensitivity assays that generally use a conventional cutoff of FEU at 500 μg/L; one study using the HemosIL assay reported results in DDU and used age×5 μg/L. Nonhigh risk refers to a low or intermediate pretest probability or "PE unlikely" using a validated clinical prediction rule, and age-dependent increases in D-dimer reduce specificity with a fixed cutoff in the elderly, leading to unnecessary imaging.

Acute pulmonary embolism — D-dimer–first strategy when PERC not met: The diagnostic testing strategy for patients with low pretest probability who do not meet all of the PERC (as well as patients with intermediate pretest probability) should begin with D-dimer testing, and studies have shown that approximately one third of emergency department (ED) patients who receive CT for PE either did not have a D-dimer test performed or had a negative D-dimer result; implementation of pathways to standardize the appropriate use of D-dimer in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE decreased use of CT in one Australian tertiary care hospital by 27%.

### Diagnostic value of D-dimer in patients with a moderate pretest probability of deep venous thrombosis [^115aZSdj]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

The negative predictive value (NPV) of d-dimer (DD) for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism is, overall, high and tends to increase as clinical pretest probability decreases. We have assessed the accuracy of a diagnostic protocol including clinical evaluation and DD in 134 outpatients presenting with a moderate pretest probability of proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT). In these patients, a negative DD value safely excluded DVT (NPV 100%, 95% CI 85–100) In our experience, these results are equivalent to those found for low-pretest probability patients and therefore the same diagnostic strategy can be used for both risk groups.

### Diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer test for exclusion of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review [^115P1Co8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The reported diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) varies. It is unknown to what extent this is due to differences in study design or patient groups, or to genuine differences between D-dimer assays.

Methods

Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test in the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism were systematically searched for in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to March 2005. Reference lists of all included studies and of reviews related to the topic of the present meta-analysis were manually searched for other additional potentially eligible studies. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics using standardized forms.

Results

In total, 217 D-dimer test evaluations for DVT and 111 for PE were analyzed. Several study design characteristics were associated with systematic differences in diagnostic accuracy. After adjustment for these features, the sensitivities of the D-dimer enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assay (ELFA) (DVT 96%; PE 97%), microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (DVT 94%; PE 95%), and latex quantitative assay (DVT 93%; PE 95%) were superior to those of the whole-blood D-dimer assay (DVT 83%; PE 87%), latex semiquantitative assay (DVT 85%; PE 88%) and latex qualitative assay (DVT 69%; PE 75%). The latex qualitative and whole-blood D-dimer assays had the highest specificities (DVT 99%, 71%; PE 99%, 69%).

Conclusions

Compared to other D-dimer assays, the ELFA, microplate ELISA and latex quantitative assays have higher sensitivity but lower specificity, resulting in a more confident exclusion of the disease at the expense of more additional imaging testing. These conclusions are based on the most up-to-date and extensive systematic review of the topic area, including 184 articles, with 328 D-dimer test evaluations.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mRXm3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Essentials

The usefulness of D‐dimer measurement to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy is debated.
A systematic meta‐analysis to investigate the safety of D‐dimer to rule out acute VTE in pregnant women was performed
The pooled estimate values were 99.5% for sensitivity (95% CI, 95.0–100.0; I ², 0%) and 100% for negative predictive value (95% CI, 99.19–100.0; I ², 0%).
Our results suggest that D‐dimer allows to safely rule out VTE in pregnant women with suspected VTE and a disease prevalence consistent with a low/intermediate or unlikely pre‐test probability.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111svvuX]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

From the 2×2 tables we calculated the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and the D-dimer test sensitivity (the number of patients with venous thromboembolism and a D-dimer level above the tested cut-off value — that is, patients with true positive test results — divided by the total number of patients with venous thromboembolism) and specificity (the number of patients without venous thromboembolism and a D-dimer level below the tested cut-off level — that is, patients with true negative test results — divided by the total number of patients without venous thromboembolism).

To graphically display the sensitivity and specificity measurements at study level we used Review Manager 5 software from the Cochrane collaboration. For the main analyses we stratified the data by age category and D-dimer cut-off value. We used random effects bivariate regression models to meta-analyse the logit transformed sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer to obtain pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals of these variables. The bivariate approach simultaneously models pairs of (logit transformed) sensitivity and specificity from studies, thereby incorporating any correlation that might exist between these measures. The model uses a random effects approach for both sensitivity and specificity to incorporate heterogeneity beyond chance as a result of remaining clinical and methodological differences between studies. We added covariates to the bivariate model to examine whether sensitivity and specificity were different for the following study characteristics: prevalence of venous thromboembolism within each study, the type of applied D-dimer assay, and whether the initial suspicion was deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the included studies. We fitted the bivariate random effects models using the NLMIXED (non-linear mixed effect) procedure of SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the wells rule in clinically important subgroups: individual patient data meta-analysis [^112Esmpn]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Fourthly, the American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommends D-dimer testing to rule out deep vein thrombosis in those with a low score on the Wells rule; a negative D-dimer test result precludes the need for imaging. Our individual patient data meta-analysis confirmed that recommendation, and as such that finding of our analyses is not novel. Yet, different thresholds on the Wells rule have been defined to categorise patients as low risk. The Wells rule can be either trichotomised (three level Wells rule; low score ≤ 0, moderate score 1 or 2, and high score > 2) or dichotomised (two level Wells rule; unlikely score ≤ 1 and likely score ≥ 2). The evidence summarised in the American College of Chest Physicians guideline suggested that moderately sensitive D-dimer tests (such as qualitative point of care D-dimer tests) are only safe in patients defined as low risk by the three level Wells rule (score ≤ 0), whereas highly sensitive laboratory based D-dimer testing (using assay specific cut-offs, usually < 500 µg/L) can still safely exclude deep vein thrombosis in patients with a moderate pretest probability using the three level Wells rule (score 1 or 2). Yet, evidence on the pooled estimates for the safety of excluding deep vein thrombosis using the two level Wells rule combined with either point of care or laboratory based D-dimer testing was unfortunately lacking. A novel finding of our individual patient data meta-analysis is that we can now provide such pooled estimates on the probability of deep vein thrombosis in patients with an unlikely score on the Wells rule (≤ 1) combined with either a point of care (qualitative) or a laboratory (quantitative) based negative D-dimer test result. Overall, the probability of deep vein thrombosis in this group of patients is low: 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.7% to 1.8%). In addition, we found no clinically relevant differences for this probability using either a quantitative or a qualitative D-dimer test (see table 6). Qualitative assays do seem to be more efficient (notably in low prevalence populations, see table 6), which is not surprising given their higher specificity (fewer false positives). To increase the efficiency of quantitative D-dimer testing, notably in older people, an age adjusted cut-off was recently proposed: age×10 in patients aged more than 50 years. In our dataset, information on quantitative D-dimer testing was available in 1930 patients. An additional analysis on the safety and efficiency of using this age adjusted cut-off indeed showed that (combined with the Wells rule) this still is a safe approach (failure rate 0.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.2% to 2.3%) with an, albeit small, higher efficiency (21%, 95% confidence interval 13% to 33%), compared with 18% (14% to 23%). Further prospective validation studies are needed on the actual clinical value of using this age adjusted cut-off in daily practice.

Guideline context — age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — notes that several other societies have reviewed this issue; the American College of Physicians recommends using age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds in patients older than 50 years and not ordering imaging if the D-dimer is below the cutoff, whereas the 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines discussed but did not formally endorse their use; applicability to U.S. ED populations may be limited because many included studies were European with higher PE prevalence than most U.S. study populations.

### Accuracy and usefulness of a clinical prediction rule and D-dimer testing in excluding deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients [^114x5PDL]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can be safely and reliably excluded in patients with a low clinical probability and a negative D-dimer result but the accuracy and utility of such a strategy is less certain in cancer patients. We sought to compare the performance of the Wells pretest probability (PTP) model and D-dimer testing between patients with and without cancer and to examine the utility of the two PTP model classification schemes (low/moderate/high versus unlikely/likely) in excluding DVT in patients with cancer.

Materials and Methods

Pooled analysis of databases from three prospective diagnostic studies evaluating consecutive outpatients with suspected DVT.

Results

A total of 2696 patients were evaluated. DVT was diagnosed in 403 (15%) patients overall and in 83 of 200 (41.5%) cancer patients. The PTP distribution and the prevalence of DVT in each PTP category were significantly different between patients with and without cancer, regardless of the classification used (p < 0.01). In patients with cancer, the negative predictive values of a low or unlikely PTP score in combination with a negative D-dimer result were 100% (95% CI 69.8%-100%) and 100% (95% CI 82.8%-96.6%), respectively. However, the specificities ranged from 46.2% (95%CI 27.1%-66.3%) to 57.1% (95%CI 41.1%-71.9%). Further testing was required in 94% of cancer patients using the low/moderate/high PTP classification and in 88% using the unlikely/likely stratification.

Conclusions

As in patients without cancer, the combination of a low or unlikely PTP with a negative D-dimer result can exclude DVT in patients with cancer. However, this strategy has limited utility because very few cancer patients present with this combination.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^116Mqtnj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study PROLONG was published by Palareti G and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the PROLONG study, the trial question was: what is the role of D-dimer testing in determining the duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients who had a first idiopathic episode of VTE? In the PROLONG study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PROLONG study, the population was: 223 patients (118 female, 105 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received a VKA for at least 3 months and underwent D-dimer testing. The key exclusion criteria were serious liver disease, renal insufficiency, other indications or contraindications for anticoagulation, or a limited life expectancy. In the PROLONG study, the interventions were: n = 120 abnormal D-dimer level with discontinuation of anticoagulation (discontinuation of VKA therapy) n = 103 abnormal D-dimer level with resumption of anticoagulation (resumption of VKA therapy). In the PROLONG study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in recurrence of thromboembolism (15% vs. 2.9%; aHR 4.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 14.6). In the PROLONG study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in deaths. In the PROLONG study, the conclusion was: in patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received a VKA for at least 3 months and underwent D-dimer testing, abnormal D-dimer level with discontinuation of anticoagulation was inferior to abnormal D-dimer level with resumption of anticoagulation with respect to recurrence of thromboembolism.
