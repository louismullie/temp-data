## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for a choledochal cyst?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10 code for a choledochal cyst is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether choledochal cysts are classified as congenital malformations in ICD-10-CM. Then, I should verify the exact alphanumeric code and its placement within the Q44 subcategory. Next, I will check for any synonyms or inclusions that confirm the code's applicability. Finally, I will cross-check with authoritative sources and note any exceptions or related codes that might be confused with this diagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the classification. Choledochal cysts are congenital malformations of the biliary tract, so they belong in the Q44 subcategory of ICD-10-CM, which covers congenital malformations of the gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver. This aligns with standard coding logic and is supported by coding references that list Q44.4 specifically for choledochal cyst [^deaa6bfe].

> Wait, let me verify the exact code. The ICD-10-CM code for choledochal cyst is Q44.4. I should double-check that this is the current, valid code and not a legacy or deprecated entry, and yes, contemporary coding resources consistently show Q44.4 as the active diagnosis code for choledochal cyst [^deaa6bfe].

> I need to ensure the code description matches the clinical entity. The ICD-10-CM entry for Q44.4 is "Choledochal cyst", and it is included under congenital malformations of the gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver, which correctly reflects that choledochal cysts are congenital dilations of the bile ducts rather than acquired obstructive lesions [^deaa6bfe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about related biliary codes. I initially wondered if K83.9 ("other diseases of biliary tract") might apply, but that would be incorrect because K83.9 pertains to non-congenital biliary diseases, whereas choledochal cyst is explicitly congenital and therefore coded under Q44.4, not K83.9 [^deaa6bfe].

> Next, I should review whether any synonyms or inclusions are captured by Q44.4. Some coding references and ICD-11 materials describe choledochal cysts as congenital bile duct dilatation or use Todani-type nomenclature, but in ICD-10-CM the umbrella term remains Q44.4, with the clinical detail documented in the medical record rather than encoded in subtypes, so Q44.4 suffices for all Todani types unless a more specific congenital anomaly code exists, which it does not in ICD-10-CM [^deaa6bfe] [^9dabbec0].

> I will now examine real-world usage to confirm consistency. Large pediatric surgical cohorts and national database studies that identify choledochal cysts consistently rely on ICD-10-CM Q44.4 for case ascertainment, reinforcing that Q44.4 is the standard, accepted code in practice for this diagnosis [^04add619].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for choledochal cyst is Q44.4 [^deaa6bfe].

---

The ICD-10 code for choledochal cyst is **Q44.4**. This code is used for congenital cystic dilatation of the bile ducts, including Todani types I–V, and should be documented with the specific type when known to support accurate coding and clinical communication [^deaa6bfe] [^c7246558].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for choledochal cyst

The ICD-10-CM code for choledochal cyst is **Q44.4**, defined as a congenital malformation of the gallbladder, bile ducts, or liver — specifically, a choledochal cyst [^deaa6bfe].

---

## Clinical significance and classification

Choledochal cysts are rare congenital anomalies characterized by cystic dilatation of the bile ducts, with a female predominance and higher prevalence in Asian populations [^f818d9db]. They are classified by the Todani system into five types based on anatomy and extent of biliary involvement:

| **Type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Type I | Cystic or fusiform dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct (most common) |
| Type II | Extrahepatic supraduodenal diverticulum |
| Type III | Intraduodenal diverticulum (choledochocele) |
| Type IV | Multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic dilatations (IVA) or multiple extrahepatic dilatations (IVB) |
| Type V | Caroli disease (intrahepatic ductal dilatations) |

---

## Clinical presentation and complications

Choledochal cysts present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and a palpable mass — the classic triad — though this is more common in children than adults [^b025e035]. Complications include cholangitis, pancreatitis, biliary stones, and an increased risk of malignancy, particularly cholangiocarcinoma [^8e3c9aea].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** modality for initial evaluation, while MRI with MRCP is the gold standard for detailed delineation of cyst anatomy and detection of anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction [^c7246558]. ERCP or EUS may be used when MRCP is inconclusive or when therapeutic intervention is planned [^c7246558].

---

## Management and surgical considerations

Complete cyst excision with biliary reconstruction (hepaticojejunostomy) is the **definitive treatment** to prevent complications and malignancy [^8b798408]. Laparoscopic approaches are increasingly used and associated with shorter length of stay and fewer complications compared to open surgery in pediatric patients [^04add619].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

When coding choledochal cysts, use **Q44.4** for the congenital anomaly. If additional detail is available, document the specific Todani type to support accurate coding and clinical communication. For complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis, include the appropriate additional ICD-10-CM codes.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for choledochal cyst is **Q44.4**, representing a congenital malformation of the bile ducts. Accurate coding and documentation of the specific cyst type and any complications are essential for optimal patient care, billing, and epidemiological tracking.

### Outcomes of laparoscopic versus open resection of pediatric choledochal cyst [^04add619]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Untreated pediatric choledochal cyst (CC) is associated with complications including cholangitis, pancreatitis, and risk of malignancy. Therefore, CC is typically treated by surgical excision with biliary reconstruction. Both open and laparoscopic (lap) surgical approaches are regularly used, but outcomes have not been compared on a national level.

Methods

The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify pediatric patients (age 0–21 years, excluding newborns) with choledochal cyst from 2016 to 2018 based on ICD-10 codes. Patients were stratified by operative approach (open vs. lap). Demographics, operative management, and complications were compared using standard statistical tests. Results were weighted for national estimates.

Results

Choledochal cyst excision was performed in 577 children (75% female) via lap (28%) and open (72%) surgical approaches. Patients undergoing an open resection experienced longer index hospital length of stay (LOS), higher total cost, and more complications. Anastomotic technique differed by approach, with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (RYHJ) more often utilized with open cases (86% vs. 29%) and hepaticoduodenostomy (HD) more common with laparoscopic procedures (71% vs. 15%), both p < 0.001. There was no significant difference in post-operative cholangitis or mortality.

Conclusions

Although utilized less frequently than an open approach, laparoscopic choledochal cyst resection is safe in pediatric patients and is associated with shorter LOS, lower costs, and fewer complications. HD anastomosis is more commonly performed during laparoscopic procedures, whereas RYHJ more commonly used with the open approach. While HD is associated with more short-term gastrointestinal dysfunction than RYHJ, the latter is more commonly associated with sepsis, wound infection, and respiratory dysfunction.

### Clinical characteristics, predictors, and rates of hospitalized acute cholangitis patients in the United States [^005cf71d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 0.8% increase in the number of patients who underwent ERCP, according to our research. ERCP was shown to be more common in patients over 60 than in other age groups. These findings could be attributed to older patients being more likely to be sicker at presentation with other comorbidities and to require immediate drainage. In contrast, younger patients are more likely to be healthier, have a less acute presentation, and safely get elective ERCP or none. According to our study, the patients who had to undergo an ERCP had a higher risk of death, probably because these patients were more critical than those who did not require an ERCP. In terms of race Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely to undergo ERCP than Whites. The increasing use of ERCP in Hispanics has already been observed and may be related to the higher occurrence of biliary stones in that community. In a previous study, Asian and Pacific Islander patients were more likely to require surgical drainage than White patients. This could be related to an increase in the prevalence of biliary tract diseases amongst Asia and pacific islanders such as hepatolithiasis and choledochal cysts, which frequently necessitate surgical intervention.

This study is the second to evaluate nationwide hospitalization and factors associated with inpatient outcomes in the United States. The large sample size employed for analysis is the investigation's main strength. The NIS database is one of the country's most extensive all-payer inpatient and health information databases. Furthermore, it is designed to approximate an immense sample of patients from an extensive range of hospital settings, including academic medical centers, public hospitals, and specialty hospitals in urban and rural areas. As a result, the trends observed from this database are not limited to specific subpopulations of patients and are therefore likely to reflect actual trends occurring across the nation.

A limitation of the study is that accurate diagnosis of AC is dependent on proper ICD-10-CM coding, susceptible to error if coding is not accurately completed. However, this error level was unlikely to have changed across the study period and should not have affected the overall trends. The ICD-10 codes related to cholangitis did not change over the study period.

### Associations between pediatric choledochal cysts, biliary atresia, and congenital cardiac anomalies [^b6f7e4b4]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In our institutional experience treating pediatric choledochal cysts over the past 12 y, we noted that seven of 32 patients (21.9%) had comorbid congenital cardiac anomalies. This association has not been previously described other than in isolated case reports. We aimed to quantify this association on a national level.

Materials and Methods

We queried the 2009 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. We identified patients with a diagnosis of choledochal cyst (ICD-9-CM 75169, 75162, and 75160) or biliary atresia (75161). We defined cardiac anomalies using the Clinical Classification Software code (CCS 213). Comorbid choledochal cysts or biliary atresia and congenital cardiac anomalies were quantified in both infant (< 12 mo) and child (1–18 y) subpopulations.

Results

Of 1646 estimated discharges for patients with choledochal cysts, 506 (30.7%) were for patients who also had congenital cardiac anomalies, compared with 2.6% in the general hospitalized population (χ²; P < 0.001). The frequency of congenital cardiac anomalies was lower in 1973 hospitalizations for biliary atresia (13.8%) than in those for patients with choledochal cysts (χ²; P < 0.001). We detected cardiac anomalies in 44.9% of choledochal cyst hospitalizations for infants < 12 mo (versus 3.44% general hospitalized population; χ²; P < 0.001), but in 6.9% of children ages 1–18 y (versus 1.3% general hospitalized population; χ²; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We observed a strong association between pediatric choledochal cysts and congenital cardiac anomalies that commonly manifests in infancy. When choledochal cysts are diagnosed either prenatally or in infancy, we suggest echocardiographic screening for cardiac anomalies, which may affect the timing of surgery and anesthetic planning.

### Choledocholithiasis as a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^a3f48e05]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study had several limitations. First, the differentiation of perihilar CCA subtypes was challenging because KCD codes (version 6) lacked specific subcodes for perihilar CCA when the HIRA database was in operation. Consequently, it could have been incorrectly recorded as either ECA or ICA. This limitation was recently addressed in the new version of the KCD codes implemented on January 1, 2021. Second, the special code (V193) for the national aid program for critical and rare diseases was not considered. Additionally, the code for ECA in KCD also included ampulla of Vater cancer, cystic duct cancer, and neuroendocrine carcinoma, even though these diseases exhibited much lower occurrences than those of CCA. Thus, the actual magnitude may be slightly lower than that observed in this study. Third, the coding system did not differentiate bile duct stones into intrahepatic and extrahepatic ones. Therefore, we could not investigate the specific association between hepatolithiasis and ICA, even though the diagnostic codes used in this study covered patients with hepatolithiasis. Fourth, while our findings highlight a significant association between choledocholithiasis and cholangiocarcinoma, the retrospective design and short delays in capturing the diagnosis time for each patient using administrative databases precludes an inference of causation. Future studies, including mechanistic investigations or prospective cohort studies, are necessary to validate and understand this link. Fifth, there remains the possibility that some cases included in the study were secondary to tumor-induced cholestasis, despite implementing a two-year washout period following the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis to mitigate this risk because the initial imaging could not be systematically reviewed in this population-based study utilizing claims data. Finally, other potential risk factors for CCA (smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, primary sclerosing cholangitis, choledochal cysts, or hepatitis B or C infection), socioeconomic status (sex, income, or education status), and alternative treatment options for choledocholithiasis (surgical or radiological intervention), could not be explored. However, the strengths of our study lie in its population-based cohort design, encompassing nearly all patients diagnosed with choledocholithiasis from 2008 to 2009 in South Korea. The SIR was estimated by comparing them with the Korean standard population. Therefore, this population-based study, utilizing the HIRA database of South Korea, holds the potential to evaluate the association between choledocholithiasis and CCA.

### Global burden of gallbladder and biliary diseases (1990–2021) with healthcare workforce analysis and projections to 2035 [^873f5e61]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and study design

This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) database, which provides comprehensive estimates for 204 countries and territories, 371 diseases and injuries, and 88 risk factors. We extracted data on incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality for gallbladder and biliary diseases from 1990 to 2021. DALYs measure the total burden of disease, combining years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs), with one DALY representing one lost year of healthy life. Both absolute numbers and rates per 100,000 population were collected for all age groups and both sexes.

Disease definition and classification

Gallbladder and biliary diseases are a group of conditions that include gallstones, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and other non-cancerous diseases of the gallbladder and biliary tract, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. In accordance with ICD- 10, gallbladder and biliary diseases under the GBD framework encompass codes K80-K80.81 (cholelithiasis/gallstones), K81-K81.9 (cholecystitis), K82-K82.9 (other diseases of gallbladder), K83-K83.9 (other diseases of biliary tract), and K87-K87.1 (disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas in diseases classified elsewhere). Gallstones are crystalline formations that develop abnormally in the gallbladder or bile ducts due to bile pigments, cholesterol, or calcium salts, potentially causing abdominal pain. Cholecystitis refers to inflammation of the gallbladder, while cholangitis is inflammation of the bile duct, often caused by obstruction due to gallstones, presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The GBD methodology does not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in prevalence estimates; however, DALYs calculations account for symptomatic disease burden through disability weights assigned to symptomatic states. The study excluded gallbladder and biliary tract cancers (C23-C24), congenital malformations of the gallbladder and bile ducts (Q44), and traumatic injuries to these organs, as these are classified under separate disease categories in the GBD framework.

Case inclusion criteria from MIMIC database

Patients who met the both diagnosis of 'cholangitis' and 'calculus of gallbladder or bile duct', the diagnostic code of which are '5761' and '574∗∗' (∗ can represent any number between 0 and 9) according to the International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD-9), or met the diagnosis of 'calculus of bile duct with acute cholangitis with or without obstruction', the diagnostic code of which are 'K8032, K8033, K8036, K8037' according to the International Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD-10) during a single hospitalization were considered for inclusion. The excluded criteria were: (1) patients neither admitted in an emergency department nor underwent biliary drainage within 24 h after admission; (2) patients under the age of 18 years; (3) patients with essential information missed or over 20% of the information lost.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^8e3c9aea]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cysts — symptoms and malignancy risk are characterized by abdominal pain (60%) as the most common symptom in both children and adults, and the estimated risk of malignancy ranges from 7.5% to 30% with low rates in young children (< 1%) and 30%–40% risk in those older than 50 years. The most common malignancy is CCA (~70%), followed by gallbladder cancer (23.5%), with Type I or IV choledochal cysts most commonly associated with malignancy, malignant transformation extremely rare in type II or III cysts, and the presence of APBJ seeming to increase the risk of malignancy.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^8b798408]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cysts — management and surveillance are type-specific: Patients with type I cysts should undergo complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; type II cysts can undergo simple cyst excision; type III cysts can be managed endoscopically (via sphincterotomy) or by transduodenal excision for larger cysts. Type V cysts are managed based on the extent of intrahepatic disease with options including extrahepatic cyst excision with or without partial hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy, and liver transplantation may be required when resection is not feasible. We suggest that patients with type I and IV cysts should continue to undergo surveillance even after cyst resection because of the ongoing risk of malignancy. Key concepts emphasize that management is based on cyst type and malignancy risk; type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended; and in both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^f818d9db]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Intrahepatic and extrahepatic choledochal cysts — epidemiology and classification — Choledochal cysts are rare cystic dilatations of the bile ducts, more frequently seen in women (1:4 male-to-female ratio) and more common in Asian populations; they present predominantly in the first decade of life (80%), although incidence seems to be rising in adults. They are classified by the Todani system based on anatomic findings and extent of biliary involvement: Type I cysts are cystic or fusiform dilatations of the extrahepatic bile duct and are the most commonly seen; Type II are extrahepatic (supraduodenal) diverticula; and Type III are intraduodenal diverticula (choledochocele) which, unlike others, lack female predominance and rarely have risk of malignant transformation. Type IV cysts have both extrahepatic and intrahepatic cystic dilations (type IVA) or multiple extrahepatic dilations (IVB).

### Choledochoceles: are they choledochal cysts? [^e8ad4fe5]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this analysis was to report a multidisciplinary series comparing choledochoceles to Todani Types I, II, IV, and V choledochal cysts.

Summary Background Data

Choledochoceles have been classified as Todani Type III choledochal cysts. However, most surgical series of choledochal cysts have reported few choledochoceles because they are managed primarily by endoscopists.

Methods

Surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic records were reviewed at the Riley Children's Hospital and the Indiana University Hospitals to identify patients with choledochal cysts. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, radiologic studies, associated abnormalities, surgical and endoscopic procedures as well as outcomes were reviewed.

Results

A total of 146 patients with "choledochal cysts" including 45 children (31%) and 28 with choledochoceles (18%) were identified, which represents the largest Western series. Patients with choledochoceles were older (50.7 vs. 29.0 years, P < 0.05) and more likely to be male (43% vs. 19%, P < 0.05), to present with pancreatitis (48% vs. 24%, P < 0.05) rather than jaundice (11% vs. 30%, P < 0.05) or cholangitis (0% vs. 21%, P < 0.05), to have pancreas divisum (38% vs. 10%, P < 0.01), and to be managed with endoscopic therapy (79% vs. 17%, P < 0.01). Two patients with choledochoceles (7%) had pancreatic neoplasms.

Conclusions

Patients with choledochoceles differ from patients with choledochal cysts with respect to age, gender, presentation, pancreatic ductal anatomy, and their management. The association between choledochoceles and pancreas divisum is a new observation. Therefore, we conclude that classifications of choledochal cysts should not include choledochoceles.

### Safe cholecystectomy multi-society practice guideline and state of the art consensus conference on prevention of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^dc6b55e3]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations for future studies in acute cholecystitis (AC) — Studies that examine the relationship between BDI and AC should match patients at baseline both for severity grade of AC and history of prior attacks of AC. The diagnosis of AC should be documented in future studies following well accepted clinical criteria such as TG18 diagnostic criteria, histologic findings of acute inflammation, or both, and if documentation of AC is based on diagnostic codes such as ICD codes, investigators should ensure that the diagnostic codes conform with the preceding criteria. For timing classification, we suggest that the interval between onset of symptoms and time of operation should be defined in 4 phases, with Phase 1 defined as onset of symptoms to 72 hours with inflammation expected to be favorable for cholecystectomy and tissue swelling due to edema.

### Presentation and clinical outcomes of choledochal cysts in children and adults: a multi-institutional analysis [^b025e035]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Choledochal cysts (CCs) are rare, with risk of infection and cancer.

Objective

To characterize the natural history, management, and long-term implications of CC disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A total of 394 patients who underwent resection of a CC between January 1, 1972, and April 11, 2014, were identified from an international multi-institutional database. Patients were followed up through September 27, 2014. Clinicopathologic characteristics, operative details, and outcome data were analyzed from May 1, 2014, to October 14, 2014.

Intervention

Resection of CC.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Management, morbidity, and overall survival.

Results

Among 394 patients, there were 135 children (34.3%) and 318 women (80.7%). Adults were more likely to present with abdominal pain (71.8% vs 40.7%; P < .001) and children were more likely to have jaundice (31.9% vs 11.6%; P < .001). Preoperative interventions were more commonly performed in adults (64.5% vs 31.1%; P < .001), including endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (55.6% vs 27.4%; P < .001), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (17.4% vs 5.9%; P < .001), and endobiliary stenting (18.1% vs 4.4%; P < .001)). Type I CCs were more often seen in children vs adults (79.7% vs 64.9%; P = 0.003); type IV CCs predominated in the adult population (23.9% vs 12.0%; P = 0.006). Extrahepatic bile duct resection with hepaticoenterostomy was the most frequently performed procedure in both age groups (80.3%). Perioperative morbidity was higher in adults (35.1% vs 16.3%; P < .001). On pathologic examination, 10 patients (2.5%) had cholangiocarcinoma. After a median follow-up of 28 months, 5-year overall survival was 95.5%. On follow-up, 13 patients (3.3%), presented with biliary cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

Presentation of CC varied between children and adults, and resection was associated with a degree of morbidity. Although concomitant cancer was uncommon, it occurred in 3.0% of the patients. Long-term surveillance is indicated given the possibility of future development of biliary cancer after CC resection.

### Understanding choledochal malformation [^64892ae3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Choledochal malformations (also known as choledochal cysts) may be characterised as an abnormal dilatation of the biliary tract, in the absence of any acute obstruction. Most appear to be of congenital origin probably related to distal bile duct stenosis, and almost 15% can now be detected antenatally. Excision and biliary reconstruction using a Roux loop as an open operation is still the standard to compare to. This article discusses recent advances in the understanding of their aetiology and classification together with the place of newer modalites of surgical treatment such as laparoscopic excision and biliary reconstruction. Although these are definitely feasible and safe, care should be taken before dispensing with standard open techniques which have minimal complications and proven long-term benefit.

Choledochal cyst in cholestatic infants — imaging clues and BA overlap: Ultrasonography can often differentiate between choledochal cyst and BA as the bile ducts are typically dilated or cystic and the gallbladder is not atretic, yet a diagnosis of choledochal cyst in a cholestatic neonate should always prompt careful evaluation for BA; in a few studies, cyst size appeared to decrease between prenatal diagnosis and birth in patients with BA but did not change in those with choledochal cyst, and choledochal cysts can coincide with BA.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for biliary acute pancreatitis or choledocholithiasis reduces 30-day readmission rates in children [^3ac5b64c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data source and study design

This is a retrospective cohort study of admissions to US acute-care hospitals for biliary acute pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis among children and young adults. Data on hospital admissions of all pediatric patients (age < 18 years) in 2018 was extracted from the National Readmissions Database (NRD). NRD is an inpatient database with several key features: it provides sufficient data for analysis across hospital types and the study of readmissions for relatively uncommon disorders and procedures, contains discharge data from 27 geographically dispersed states, accounting for 57.8% of the total US resident population and 56.6% of all US hospitalizations, is designed to support national readmission analyses. Of note, this database links patient readmission to the same or any other hospital in the USA for each calendar year (1 January through 31 December) but does not link patient data across preceding or subsequent years. Therefore, we excluded index admissions occurring in December from our analysis since readmissions for those encounters could not be tracked. The database excludes observation admissions, rehabilitation hospitals, and chemical-dependency units. This study was exempted from IRB review, as no identifiable patient data were included in the database.

We used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to identify all hospitalized pediatric patients (age < 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of mild biliary acute pancreatitis (ICD-10 K85.10) or choledocholithiasis (K80.3x–K80.7x) who survived to hospital discharge. Both cholecystectomy and ERCP procedures performed were identified using ICD procedure codes. All diagnostic and procedural codes used for classifications are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Admissions were identified by querying for all diagnostic ICD-10-CM codes corresponding to biliary acute pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis. We excluded patients with biliary acute pancreatitis with features of necrosis or infection to characterize those with mild pancreatitis and to address bias introduced by those with severe disease. We also excluded patients who were coded as having elective readmission.

Definitions of variables

The NRD collects demographic information, including age, sex, income, and primary and secondary insurance as well as hospital information (e.g. bed size, location, and teaching status). The All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) severity score is was used to assess symptom severity, which has bene shown to be accurate in the pediatric population. The NRD definition of hospital size is available in Supplementary Table 2.

### Choledochal malformations: surgical implications of radiologic findings [^d759c911]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the relevant pathophysiologic features, appearances, and surgical implications of choledochal malformations.

Conclusion

Choledochal malformations, colloquially called choledochal cysts, initially described in 1723, have been recategorized multiple times, the most widely accepted being the Todani classification based on morphologic features and location. Although readily applied to imaging findings, this classification system does not correlate well with clinical and surgical management. In 2004, Visser and colleagues proposed an alternative that emphasized the etiologic factors, imaging appearance, and treatment approach.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^e09b5910]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bile duct cysts are rare anomalies that to this day are poorly understood. They are more common in the Asian population, and often found and treated in childhood. In Western countries, bile duct cysts are more commonly discovered incidentally in adults or as part of work-up for jaundice or non-specific upper abdominal symptoms. Often referred to as 'choledochal cysts', even in contemporary literature, the biliary dilatation can occur throughout the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Thus, the term 'bile duct cyst' or 'biliary tract cyst' is preferred.

### Meta-analysis of risk of developing malignancy in congenital choledochal malformation [^7509f57a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement 15. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised the studies critically. Any differences of opinion between reviewers were resolved by discussion. If they failed to reach agreement, a third reviewer was consulted to achieve consensus. This review was registered in PROSPERO, the international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews (CRD42016048392) 16.

Literature search strategy

A systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed for articles relevant to the prevalence of malignancies and/or malignant transformations in patients with choledochal malformation, published between 1 January 1995 and 1 June 2016. The electronic searches were supplemented by manual reference checks of papers in recent reviews. The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms 'choledochal malformation', 'bile duct cyst', 'malignant' and 'carcinoma' were used for both databases. For searching in Embase, the keyword 'common bile duct cyst' was added.

Definitions

Prevalence of malignancy was defined as the presence of a gallbladder carcinoma and/or cholangiocarcinoma at the time of diagnosis or an incidental finding during surgery without previous intervention. Prevalence of malignancy is the primary risk of malignancy in choledochal malformation and can be considered as risk of malignancy according to the natural history of disease. Malignant transformation was defined as the development of a cholangiocarcinoma following a surgical drainage procedure or formal excision of the choledochal malformation.

Literature screening

According to the PRISMA guidelines, the studies were selected in three phases (Fig. 2). During the identification phase, duplicates from different databases were removed. During the screening phase, abstracts of all studies accepted during the identification phase were reviewed. Reasons for exclusion were language other than English, reviews, case reports, studies with fewer than ten patients, and studies with a subject that was not relevant. During the eligibility phase, the methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies 17.

Characteristics of the included studies

Ethnicity, sex and type of choledochal malformation

Characteristics of the 18 studies are summarized in 1. Six 23, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37 studies described Asian populations, one 7 described a European population, one 25 a Middle Eastern population, one 22 a population with Caucasian patients, and four studies 24, 27, 28, 36 described populations with both Asian and Caucasian patients. The remaining five studies 26, 33, 34, 35, 38 did not specifically describe the study population, but were authored by Asian institutions. The 18 studies reported on a total of 2904 patients, 1655 (57.0 per cent) of whom were of Asian descent and 669 (23.0 per cent) of non‐Asian descent; descent was unknown for 580 patients (20.0 per cent). The sex of 2636 patients was known; of these, 1925 (73.0 per cent) were women.

The type of choledochal malformation was available for 2304 patients. The majority of patients (2049, 88.9 per cent) had types I or IV malformations, 59 (2.6 per cent) had types II or III and 196 (8.5 per cent) had Type V. Two studies did not provide follow‐up data 27, 38. The median age at time of diagnosis was 36 (range 0.1–82) years.

### Risk factors associated with symptomatic cholelithiasis in Taiwan: a population-based study [^6656bdc8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We identified total of 14900 patients from a random sample of the 2005 Registry for Beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Research Database. This database contains longitudinal insurance records of reimbursement claims for the years 2003 to 2007, which includes the original claim data of 1000000 beneficiaries. This insurance program has covered more than 96% of Taiwan's population and has contracted with 97% of hospitals and clinics in Taiwan, since March 1995. The database included information regarding date of birth, gender, medical diagnosis, and medical procedures. These data were released for public access and patient identities were not revealed. Information was obtained with the authorization of Bureau of National Health Insurance, Department of Health in Taiwan. This study was exempt from full review by the institution review board.

Criteria and Definition

We used diagnostic guidelines from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 th Revision to identify individuals newly diagnosed with cholelithiasis (ICD-9-CM 574) who were 20 years of age and above in 2006–2007. Individuals meeting these criteria were selected randomly, without regard to age or gender, for inclusion in the case group. Because the database did not provide the diagnostic criteria for cholelithiasis, these patients are more appropriately designated as having symptomatic cholelithiasis, i.e. calculus of the gallbladder without mention of cholecystitis. Each individual in the case group was matched to three individuals of the same age and sex in the control group. It should be noted that because the control group was constructed in this manner — i.e. by matching exactly the age and sex of controls to individuals in the case group — the mean ages for the two groups are identical, as are the percentages of males and females in the two groups. Furthermore, because of the large n values, the standard deviations for the case and control groups are identical to within three significant figures (see Table 1). Controls were defined as individuals who had neither been diagnosed with cholelithiasis nor undergone a related medical procedure, such as cholecystectomy (ICD-9-CM 51.22 and 51.23) or common duct exploration for removal of calculus (ICD-9-CM 51.41) between the years 2003 to 2007. The age for individuals in the case group was defined as the age of onset of cholelithiasis as determined at the time of diagnosis. Age for individuals in the control group was defined as their age 2007.

### The presentation and management of choledochocele (type III choledochal cyst): a 40-year systematic review of the literature [^c84b6a8d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Choledochoceles may cause biliary obstruction and harbor malignancy. We conducted a 40-year systematic review of the literature for this rare anomaly.

Methods

PubMed and Cochrane databases were accessed 1975–2015 using terms "choledochocele" or "choledochal cyst". Studies reviewed that met the following criteria: English language, published 1975–2015 with human subjects.

Results

325 patients with a choledochocele were identified, including 71 case reports and 254 cases within institutional reviews. 13 pediatric case reports of choledochocele exist, with abdominal pain being the most common symptom (n = 11). The most frequent diagnostic and treatment modalities were ultrasound (n = 10), and endoscopic sphincterotomy (n = 5). No malignancies were reported. 58 adult case reports exist, with the most common presenting symptom being abdominal pain (n = 54). Ultrasound was the frequently employed diagnostic modality (n = 32). Open procedures were performed more often (n = 30). Malignant lesions were identified in 5. In 42 institutional reviews, the frequency of choledochocele was 0.7%. Of those for whom treatment was reported, 69% underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy.

Conclusion

Choledochocele is a rare malformation. Similarities exist between pediatric and adult patients, but malignancy has only been reported in adults. An algorithm based on patient age, cyst size, lining and amenability to endoscopic resection may be considered as a treatment strategy for this uncommon condition.

### Choledochal cysts: age of presentation, symptoms, and late complications related to todani's classification [^a414ecf5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to compare presentation, complications, diagnosis, and treatment of choledochal cysts in pediatric and adult patients.

Methods

Forty-two patients were analyzed after subdivision into 3 groups: group A, less than 2 years (n = 10); group B, 2 to 16 years (n = 11); group C, greater than 16 years (n = 21).

Results

The cysts were classified as extrahepatic (n = 33), intrahepatic (n = 5), and combined (n = 4). Seventy-six percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, (20 of 21 group C), and 57% with jaundice, (10 of 10 group A). Cholangiocarcinoma occurred in 6 patients, 4 of whom had previously undergone internal drainage procedures. Excision of the extrahepatic cyst was performed in 27 of 37 patients. Five patients, of whom, 4 had cholangiocarcinoma, were beyond curative treatment at the time of diagnosis. Six patients had died at the closure of this study, 5 of them had carcinoma.

Conclusions

Presenting symptoms are age dependent with jaundice prevailing in children and abdominal pain in adults. In view of the high risk of cholangiocarcinoma, early resection and not internal drainage is the appropriate treatment of extrahepatic cysts. Patients who had undergone internal drainage in the past still should undergo resection of the cyst.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^c7246558]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cysts — imaging evaluation is best performed with MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography; MRCP may offer the advantage of detecting an APBJ and does not contaminate the biliary tree with instrumentation, and Type V cysts (Caroli disease) involve only the intrahepatic bile ducts and are the least common type. One key feature distinguishing biliary ductal dilatation as a choledochal cyst from malignancy causing obstruction is that malignancy usually results in diffuse intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation as opposed to more focal areas of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^94dd30a6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

What are the risks of having bile duct cysts and when should they be resected?

Bile duct cysts are associated with an increased risk of developing biliary tract cancers, reported in about 10 per cent. The risk increases with age, and such cancers often present a decade earlier than spontaneous cholangiocarcinoma. The highest risk of malignancy is in the most prevalent types I and IV. Of note, type II and type III cysts (less than 1–2 per cent of all cysts) may not be associated with reflux of pancreatic secretions into the bile duct, and as such have a much lower or even non-existent carcinogenic risk. The risk of cholangiocarcinoma in Caroli's disease was 6–7 per cent in a German multicentre study.

### Prenatal diagnosis of familial type I choledochal cyst [^204174ad]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Familial choledochal cysts are extremely rare. High-resolution ultrasound now allows for the antenatal diagnosis of these anomalies. After delivery, elective surgical resection should be planned; however, increases in size, deterioration of liver function, and ascending cholangitis frequently force early intervention. We report an unusual occurrence of siblings with type I choledochal cysts and review the existing literature on cause, genetics, classification, diagnosis, and management of this disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^e3200bcc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Table 3 (continued) — management of biliary hamartomas, peribiliary cysts, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts: Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts are premalignant biliary lesions with a high risk of malignant transformation, and thus, continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection. Management and treatment of choledochal cysts is based on type of cyst and risk of malignant transformation; Type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended. In both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered. For hydatid cysts, medical therapy with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in symptomatic or active cysts to prevent recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and medical therapy alone is not recommended unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated.

### Biliary atresia with choledochal cyst: implications for classification [^43ea013a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

To illustrate the limitations of the embryonic and perinatal classification system of biliary atresia (BA), we present a child with an antenatal diagnosis of choledochal cyst (CC) associated with BA and review the published literature.

Methods

Medline and Pubmed were searched for "BA and CC", "cystic biliary atresia", "BA and cysts", and "biliary cystic malformations".

Results

A 7-week-old with an antenatal diagnosis of CC was found to have BA associated with CC. The literature search identified 88 cases of BA with CC. Sixty-seven cases had type 1 BA (atresia of the common bile duct), 2 had type 2 BA (atresia of the common hepatic duct), and 19 had type 3 BA (atresia of the porta hepatis). Of the 27 cases of antenatal diagnosis of BA with CC only 1 had associated congenital anomalies. Outcome analysis showed poor outcomes were significantly more common (P = 0.009) and occurred earlier (P = 0.0249) in patients with type 3 BA. Children with type 3 BA were 5.4 times more likely to develop poor outcomes compared with type 1 (hazard ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–27.8).

Conclusions

BA associated with CC forms a distinct subtype of BA, characterized by a preponderance of type 1 BA, a relatively good clinical outcome after surgery, and an absence of associated congenital anomalies. Antenatal diagnosis of many affected infants supports their inclusion within the embryonic BA group and suggests that a broader interpretation of the embryonic phenotype and further classification of BA based on genetic susceptibility may be required.

### Peribiliary cysts: a systematic review and proposal of a classification framework [^a4c7ac7e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Peribiliary cysts are one of the most recent discoveries in the domain of liver cystic abnormalities. These lesions are usually found up the liver hilum, tracking the fourth-order biliary duct branches. Although they are usually diminutive, measuring < 20 mm in diameter and lacking communication with the adjoining large bile ducts, they can at times cluster together resembling a multilocular malignancy, mimic biliary dilation (taking the appearance of periportal fluid-filled cylinders), or grow to compress the neighbouring structures, resulting in obstruction and cholestasis. These structures do not communicate with the biliary lumen, and are external to the duct walls. Although these cysts are usually benign, and typically found in patients with liver cirrhosis, they can occasionally cause biliary obstruction or cholangitis. The clinical importance of these structures arises from the fact that they may mimic other diseases (eg, cholangiocarcinoma, choledochal cyst), or may represent a harbinger of an important underlying illness (eg, portal hypertension), which may lead the clinician to unneeded investigations. Our aim was to systematically review the characteristics of these anatomical variants, and propose a clinical classification based on their location.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis reduces 30-day readmission rates in pediatric patients [^57901a2e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

In our analysis, we did not identify insurance status, age, or length of hospital stay as independent predictors of 30-day admission rate. In lieu of analyzing associated comorbidities, which in addition to being uncommon in pediatrics, would also not provide a definitive contraindication to surgery, we chose to include the APR-DRG score to serve as a proxy of disease severity to ensure no confounding by severity. Interestingly, although the "severe" disease category was associated with higher odds of readmission on univariate analysis, no level of disease severity was associated with higher rate of readmission in multivariate analysis. To provide a more granular understanding of the data, of the patients with "severe" disease, no patient who underwent index cholecystectomy was readmitted, while 50% of those who did not undergo index cholecystectomy were readmitted. Prior studies have shown that socioeconomic status in the pediatric population may not be associated with morbidity and mortality as much as racial disparities, which was not evaluated in our study. Determinants of length of hospital stay in pediatric patients with gallbladder disease have been studied previously; several factors have been associated with increased length of stay including admission to children's hospitals, elective admissions, and patients having sickle cell anemia, choledocholithiasis, or pancreatitis. Our study did not further stratify patients within these groups, though we did include APR-DRG severity score in the analysis.

This is one of the largest pediatric cohorts evaluating outcomes of index cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis. While there have been several studies evaluating gallbladder disease and gallstone pancreatitis in this population, this is one of the first studies looking specifically at outcomes in acute cholecystitis. There are several limitations to this study. First, this is a retrospective study, which can demonstrate association but not causality. Due to the limitation of the database used to identify a cohort, we were unable to ensure baseline homogeneity in the population. Additionally, we did not have access to surgical techniques, outcomes, and adverse events to examine safety of index cholecystectomy. Given the nature of the study, we were unable to identify the medical decisions behind why cholecystectomy was not performed on index admission or length of stay was prolonged. We also could not evaluate social risk factors for readmission. Finally, the use of a national database that is reliant on ICD-10 coding can include coding errors or omissions in the database.

### Comparative safety of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^968c7707]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome was bile duct injury requiring surgical repair with hepaticojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy (surgical repairs in which the biliary system of the liver is connected to the small intestine to restore physiologic drainage) within 1 year following cholecystectomy. These 2 surgical procedures are performed as definitive treatments for severe bile duct injury, which was defined using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for a bile duct injury combined with codes for either operative repair procedure (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

Our secondary outcomes were postoperative biliary interventions and the overall incidence of postoperative complications. Biliary interventions reflected a composite outcome of an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code for bile duct injury and ICD-9 or ICD-10 and Current Procedural Technology codes for surgical or endoscopic biliary interventions, which included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and common bile duct exploration (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We chose this composite measure as it may capture more minor bile duct injuries that can be managed without a separate invasive surgery. We also calculated incidence of 30-day overall complications and serious complications (incidence of complications with a hospital length of stay > 75th percentile).

Statistical Analysis

We used univariable statistical tests to compare baseline differences among patients who underwent each operation. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between robotic surgery and postoperative complications. All models included the following covariates: age, race and ethnicity, sex, 29 Elixhausercomorbidities, primary diagnosis, and year. Race and ethnicity (African American or Black, Asian, Hispanic, or White) were abstracted from Medicare's enrollment database, which is derived from patient self-report and submitted to the Social Security Administration. Race and ethnicity were assessed here to provide additional clarity of the demographics of this patient population. All models accounted for clustering of outcomes within hospital referral regions with robust standard errors.

### Antenatally detected choledochal malformation: what are we waiting for? [^19977f8b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An increasing proportion of congenital choledochal malformation (CCM) are being detected on antenatal ultrasound. However, the actual timing of its surgical correction remains controversial with some series showing an excess of complications the earlier the operation. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathophysiological aspects of this cohort from the perspective of age at surgery in order to inform a more rational basis for clinical decision-making.

Methods

We analysed a prospective database of CCM acquired over a 26-year period (Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2022) for patient demography; details of pre- and post-natal imaging; age at surgical intervention; operative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and outcome. Data are quoted as median (IQR). All comparisons are non-parametric. A P value of 0.05 was accepted as significant.

Results

There were 58 (72% female) children with an antenatally-detected CCM from a total of 265 (21.8%) in the series. These were classified as Type 1C (n = 47; 81%), type 4C (n = 3; 5%) and Type 5 (n = 8; 14%). There were no Type 1F lesions in this cohort. Median age at surgery was 113 (IQR 57–198) days. Postnatal cyst (US) size varied from 12 to 130 mm but there was little evidence of a relationship between this and post-natal liver biochemistry (e.g. bilirubin rₛ = 0.01, P = 0.44; AST rₛ = 0.14, P = 0.19). Choledochal pressure measurements (n = 46) showed resting pressures of 12 (9–21) mmHg with no significant correlation with age (P = 0.4) or aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.2) or γ-glutamyl transferase (P = 0.06). The cohort was divided into 2 groups (Early and Late) based on the median age at surgery (all open) (113 days). Biliary obstruction was more common in the Early group (10 vs. 2; P = 0.01). Two perforations occurred, both in the Early group. With a deliberate policy of regular ultrasound-based follow-up we have seen no anastomotic complications (leak, stenosis, persistent intrahepatic biliary dilatation or stones) or post-operative cholangitis in any child [median follow-up 3.42 (1.30–8.05) years].

Conclusions

This is one of the largest series documenting the outcomes of antenatally-detected CCMs, certainly in Europe and North America. Such lesions are invariably cystic in nature, and either Types 1C, 4C or 5. The absence of complications using a policy of early intervention (where possible) in experienced hepatobiliary units was shown.

### Biliary duct dilatation: expert panel narrative review [^04203758]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biliary duct dilatation is a common incidental finding in practice, but it is unlikely to indicate biliary obstruction in the absence of clinical symptoms or elevated levels on liver function tests (LFTs). However, the clinical presentation may be nonspecific, and LFTs may either be unavailable or difficult to interpret. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to highlight a series of topics fundamental to the management of biliary duct dilatation, providing consensus recommendations in a question-and-answer format. We start by covering a basic approach to interpreting LFT results, the strengths and weaknesses of the biliary imaging modalities, and how and where to measure the extrahepatic bile duct. Next, we define the criteria for biliary duct dilatation, including patients with prior cholecystectomy and advanced age, and discuss when and whether biliary duct dilatation can be attributed to papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Subsequently, we discuss two conditions in which the duct is pathologically dilated but not obstructed: congenital cystic dilatation (i.e., choledochal cyst) and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct. Finally, we provide guidance regarding when to recommend obtaining additional imaging or testing, such as endoscopic ultrasound or ERCP, and include a discussion of future directions in biliary imaging.

### Trends of cholecystectomies for presumed biliary dyskinesia in children in the United States [^62234a84]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Biliary dyskinesia (BD) is a controversial clinical entity. Standardized diagnostic test and management guidelines are lacking in children. Published data suggest that long-term outcomes of surgical and medical management are similar. We sought to determine national population-based trends of cholecystectomies performed in children for BD and associated healthcare expenditure in the United States during a 10-year period.

Methods

Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample and the International Classification of Diseases, the 9th revision clinical modification codes, we identified children who had a cholecystectomy for BD from 2002 to 2011 in the United States.

Results

A total of 66,380 cholecystectomies were identified as primary procedural diagnosis using weighted analysis from 2002 to 2011 in children. BD was the primary indication for cholecystectomy in 6674 (10.8%) of the patients. During the study period, the number of cholecystectomies performed for BD in children increased from 6.6% in 2002 to 10.6% in 2011, and a majority were adolescent white females. The annual health care expenditure for surgical management of BD for children in the US was estimated to almost $16 million/year.

Conclusions

Despite lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and variable outcomes of surgical intervention reported in pediatric literature, cholecystectomies are commonly performed for children with BD in the United States. Consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of this controversial disorder in children are needed.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^5cca99f0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Uncommon and congenital liver cysts

Ductal plate malformations, also known as fibropolycystic liver diseases, represent a unique spectrum of pathological abnormalities that are caused by an insult to the embryonic ductal plate development. As a result, congenital cystic lesions tend to develop in intra- or extra-hepatic bile ducts, predisposing for pancreatitis, cholangitis, lithiasis and malignancy. Depending on the timing of ductal plate insult, different congenital cystic lesions develop, including biliary hamartomas; autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (in the presence of > 20 hepatic cysts), Caroli disease (type V lesions based on Todani classification), and choledochal cysts. These lesions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex cystic liver lesions when they are complicated with hemorrhage, bacterial superinfection, or intracystic development of neoplastic lesions, and should be treated as previously discussed. Polycystic liver disease with compression on the bile ducts, the hepatic veins, the inferior vena cava, the portal vein (causing portal hypertension) or adjacent viscera may dictate the need for open or laparoscopic fenestration of multiple liver cysts, or hepatectomy in appropriate surgical candidates. Orthotopic liver transplantation should be reserved for severe hepatic decompensation, ascites, malnutrition, vascular occlusion, or when resection fails or is deemed inappropriate.

Concluding remarks

Complex cystic liver lesions are increasingly being recognized in asymptomatic individuals or during workup for non-specific abdominal symptoms, leading patients to seek surgical attention. They encompass a spectrum of disorders ranging from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. These complex cystic liver lesions pose multiple diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas to hepatobiliary specialists (radiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, hepatologists and surgeons). Liver cyst characteristics that can assist with their classification, include presence of septa, enhancing thickened wall, mural consistency/nodularity, calcifications, and quality of cystic fluid with or without debris. When a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy is present, cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. If malignancy or high-grade dysplasia is anticipated, surgical options include radical resection and enucleation, according to cyst location and the patient's performance status. When imaging characteristics are atypical or inconclusive, regular short-interval monitoring with high resolution imaging should be entertained (Fig. 5). Extensive research into the pathogenesis and progression of complex cystic liver lesions is currently underway. Ongoing studies will hopefully bring forward a set of clinically relevant molecular markers to help improve the diagnosis and classification of these lesions.

### Choledochal cysts in children and adults with contrasting profiles: 11-year experience at a tertiary care center in kashmir [^84a95381]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Choledochal cyst is a surgical problem usually related to infancy and childhood. Despite advancements in management, a large number of cases still present during adulthood. The clinical course and outcome in children varies from that in adults. This study focuses on these variations in terms of presentation, management, histopathology, and outcome.

Methods

An in-depth retrospective analysis was carried out on 79 patients presenting with choledochal cysts between December 2007 and January 1997. The patients were segregated into two groups: group A comprising 32 children and group B with 47 adults. The presentation, clinical evaluation, radiologic, and biochemical findings; operative details; pathologic findings; and early and long-term complications in the two groups were studied on a comparative basis.

Results

The male/female ratios were 1:3 and 1.0:2.3 in groups A and B, respectively. A history of previous biliary surgery, pancreatitis, cholangitis, peroperative difficulties, and early and late postoperative complications were 5.1, 5.4, 6.4, 5.4, 2.0, and 3.3 times more common in group B than in group A. However, the classic triad of jaundice, abdominal pain, and a mass was 6.7 times more common in group A than in group B. The classic triad and cholangitis were the only parameters that were statistically significant. Rare presentations of spontaneous perforation of the cyst or cachexia manifested only in group A patients. The methods of detection and operative treatment were identical for both groups. Histologically, fibrosis of the cyst wall was a feature peculiar to group A, whereas signs of inflammation and hyperplasia were predominantly seen in group B. In the group B series, one patient had cholangiocarcinoma and another gallbladder carcinoma; one more patient developed malignancy during follow-up. Long-term complications were seen in 29.7% of patients in group B versus 9.3% in group A; the most rampant complication was a type IVa cyst, seen in 68.7% of patients.

Conclusions

Choledochal cysts present differently in adults and children; whereas children present with the classic triad, adults present with common biliary or infective complications. Although the methods of detection and surgical treatment are similar for the two groups, the type IVa cyst typically seen in the adult group creates a marked deviation with respect to long-term complications such as ascending cholangitis, anastomotic strictures, stone formation, and development of cholangiocarcinoma. These are areas of grave concern that can be addressed to a large extent by providing an access loop during the initial surgery especially for type IVa cysts. The glaring differences in terms of presentation, histologic picture, and outcome urges us to consider choledochal cysts in children as a separate entity.

### Peribiliary cysts: a systematic review and proposal of a classification framework [^e48fb092]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although rarely studied in the literature, pribiliary cysts were frequent in studies designed to evaluate their prevalence, and were mostly asymptomatic. Inaccurate diagnosis, therapeutic misadventures, cysts progression and cysts-related complications are frequent. In a novel classification framework based on location, extrahepatic peribiliary cysts appear to have distinct characteristics and require a special approach for diagnosis and management.

### Open versus minimally invasive surgery for pediatric choledochal cyst in a propensity score matched cohort [^5b92bb13]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aims to evaluate 30-day outcomes for children undergoing open versus minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for choledochal cysts using a propensity score matched cohort created from a national database.

Methods

Children undergoing surgery for choledochal cyst from 2013–2023 were identified using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database. A propensity score match was performed. Outcomes were compared between operative approaches using an intention-to-treat analysis. Pearson's chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney's U tests were used as appropriate. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess operative trends.

Results

A total of 773 children who underwent surgery for choledochal cyst were identified. Pre-match, children undergoing open surgery were more likely to be younger, smaller in weight, have Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy performed, have a history of gastrointestinal disease, and have higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class. Post-match, the groups were similar and included 247 cases per group. The MIS approach was associated with a longer median operative time (311 mins vs. 261 mins, p < 0.001) and more surgical site infections (SSI) (6.5% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.006). There were no differences in composite morbidity, postoperative length of stay, and readmission or reoperation at 30 days. MIS utilization increased over the study period (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

MIS utilization has steadily increased within the NSQIP-P cohort. The MIS approach takes longer to perform and may be associated with a higher rate of SSIs. We observed no significant differences in overall morbidity, postoperative length of stay, readmission, or reoperation. Multicenter prospective trials would be useful to further compare these two approaches. Type of StudyRetrospective comparative study Level of EvidenceLevel III.

### Meta-analysis of risk of developing malignancy in congenital choledochal malformation [^b2bddf24]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and critical appraisal

Predesigned forms were used in triplicate to record the data. Data included: study design, patient population, choledochal malformation type, follow‐up time, type of surgery, and prevalence of malignancy and/or transformation. Multiple publications describing the same or overlapping series of patients were identified, and the data included only once to avoid double counting. The level of evidence for each article was assessed using the Levels of Evidence scale developed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐based Medicine 18. Quality of the articles was assessed according to the NOS for cohort studies. This scale scores selection, comparability and outcome, with a maximum score of 9 points. Only studies that scored at least 5 points were included in the review. Overall quality of the evidence was judged by means of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach 19.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables, reported as numbers with percentages, were analysed using the χ² test. Overall effects were determined using thescore. Statistical significance was defined as < 0.050 (2‐sided). The χ² statistic and the inconsistency quantity 2 were used to determine heterogeneity. An 2 value of 50 per cent or more represented substantial heterogeneity 20. A meta‐analysis, with development of malignancy as outcome measure, was performed using RevMan software (Review Manager version 5.0.21; Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) and the results were displayed in a forest plot. The meta‐analysis was carried out in accordance with MOOSE guidelines 21. Only studies that provided information on the parameters analysed were included. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).

### Index admission cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis reduces 30-day readmission rates in pediatric patients [^862a76ab]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data source and study design

This is a retrospective cohort study of admissions to US acute-care hospitals acute cholecystitis among children and young adults. Data on hospital admissions of all pediatric patients (age < 18 years) in 2018 was extracted from the National Readmissions Database (NRD). NRD is an inpatient database with several key features: it 'provides sufficient data for analysis across hospital types and the study of readmissions for relatively uncommon disorders and procedures, [contains] discharge data from 27 geographically dispersed states, accounting for 57.8% of the total US resident population and 56.6% of all US hospitalizations, is designed to support national readmission analyses, and cannot be used for regional, state-, or hospital-specific analyses'. Of note, this database links patient readmission to same or any other hospital in the USA for each calendar year (1 January through 31 December) but does not link patient data across preceding or subsequent years. Therefore, we excluded index admissions occurring in December from our analysis since readmissions for those encounters could not be tracked. This study was exempted from IRB review, as no identifiable patient data were included in the database.

Study population

We used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to identify all hospitalized pediatric patients (age < 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (K80.00, K80.01, K80.12, K80.13, K81.0) and who survived to hospital discharge. All diagnostic and procedural codes used for classifications are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Admissions were identified by querying for all diagnostic ICD-10-CM codes corresponding to acute cholecystitis.

Definitions of variables

The NRD collects demographic information, including age, sex, income, and primary and secondary insurance for all admitted patients. It also contains hospital information (e.g. bed size, location, and teaching status). The All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) severity score is also recorded in the NRD and was used to assess symptom severity. The APR-DRG scores are calculated from discharge billing codes and are based on primary and secondary discharge diagnosis, age, and preexisting medical conditions. Use of these scores have been been shown to be an accurate assessment of symptom severity in the pediatric population. The NRD definition of hospital size is available in Supplementary Table 2.

### Management of choledochal cyst: 30 years of experience and results in a single center [^ef84321e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Choledochal cyst is usually diagnosed in childhood. Early treatment can prevent further complication. We report on our series of patients over the past 30 years.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed on all pediatric patients who presented with choledochal cyst from January 1978 to December 2008. The main outcome measures recorded were the clinical presentation, management, and long-term outcome of the patients.

Results

Eighty-three patients presented to us during the caption period with a mean age at diagnosis of 45 months (0 month to 16 years). Diagnoses were made antenatally in 15 patients. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 39) and jaundice (n = 35). Seventy-five patients had surgery, in which 72 patients had resection of the cyst and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Ten were performed by laparoscopic means. We categorized the cysts based on the Todani classification. There was no mortality. No malignant change was documented. For those 4 who had Caroli disease, 2 underwent liver transplantation and 2 had hepatectomy. Overall early complication rate was 5.3% (4/75).

Conclusions

Complete excision of cyst with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of choice, and the late result is good. Laparoscopic surgery is feasible. Long-term follow-up is necessary. There is no evidence to suggest that some type IV cysts are the result of disease progression from type I cysts.

### Evolution in the management of acute cholecystitis in the elderly: population-based cohort study [^adfb7933]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Data were derived from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. This is an administrative dataset that collects patient-level data from all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. It captures all patients treated in public sector hospitals and a minority of patients treated in privately funded institutions. Patients are linked to a unique HES identifier, which allows all of their hospital admissions to be tracked throughout the dataset. Permissions for the comparison of anonymized administrative data were obtained from the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care in England.

Coding of data

Relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes were used to identify all patients over the age of 80 years who were admitted as an emergency for the treatment of acute cholecystitis (Supplementary Material), between 1st January 1997 and 31st December 2012. Patients primarily admitted with other gallstone-related disorders, including biliary colic, acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis were excluded from this study. Only patients identified as emergency admissions were included in this analysis using the admission codes (method of admission 21–28). Readmissions following index emergency admission with further gallstone-related disease were identified using relevant ICD-10 codes (Supplementary Material). Local verification of ICD-10 codes used for diagnosis and patient allocation was performed as part of the quality assurance for the data included.

Allocation to treatment groups

Treatments were identified using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures 4th revision (OPCS-4) codes (Supplementary Material). Treatment groups included the following:

Conservative management (defined as best supportive medical treatment alone in the absence of any formal surgical, endoscopic, or radiological intervention).
Cholecystectomy on index admission.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy placement on index admission.

All patients requiring initial intervention with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram (ERCP) were excluded from analysis due to the potential influence of common bile duct stones or the presence of ascending cholangitis upon outcomes.

Within the cholecystectomy group, patients were subdivided into those receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy and those undergoing open surgery. Patients who had initial attempt at a laparoscopic approach followed by conversion to open were included in the laparoscopic surgery group (based on an intention to treat analysis). Post-operative complications were defined as bile duct injury (defined by need for biliary reconstruction) or need for post-operative ERCP (as treatment of post-operative bile leak or retained stones). These interventions were identified through the relevant OPCS-4 codes (Supplementary Material).

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis? [^e4debf0a]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In previous studies, medications were the cause of 10% to 30% of acute pancreatitis cases. The most common medications reported in previous studies were valproic acid, L-asparagine, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, steroids, mesalamine, and metronidazole. Additionally, the most common biliary cause of acute pancreatitis in the present study was choledochal cyst, while in other studies, pancreas divisum, biliary stones, and biliary stenosis were the most common anatomical causes; the delayed diagnosis of choledochal cysts in Iran may be the cause of this difference. Corticosteroid, valproic acid, and carbamazepine were the most common causes of drug-induced pancreatitis in this study.

In the present study, no specific cause was found for acute pancreatitis in 28% of cases. The corresponding rate was estimated at 20–24% in similar studies; this slight difference might be due to limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of modalities. Ultrasonography was performed in 88% of patients in our study; in half of the cases, the findings were consistent with acute pancreatitis. Although ultrasound is recommended as the first diagnostic method for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, it is operator-dependent. An abdominal CT scan was performed for more than one-third of cases in this study. According to guidelines the most important indications for CT scan were necrosis, abscess, and other complications. Performing CT scan is not indicated nor obligatory for diagnosis or management of acute pancreatitis in children. In cases that are vague for a diagnosis, a CT scan may be needed to confirm acute pancreatitis. Given the risk of radiation exposure, the need to perform a CT scan must be carefully considered. Also, in one-third of CT scans performed in this study, no specific reason was found for the CT scans, based on the hospital records.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^a082eeac]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital biliary dilatation (CBD) was formerly known as congenital choledochal cyst. This rare congenital biliary lesion manifests as one or more dilatations of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, but does not include secondary BD related to biliary obstruction caused by bile duct stones, strictures, or tumors. In Western countries, the prevalence of BD is approximately 1/13,500–1/200,000 population, although the prevalence in Asia reaches 1/1,000 population and BD is approximately 3–4 times more common among females than males. The incidence has increased slightly during recent years, which may be related to the development of prenatal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and other examination modalities. Most cases are detected prior to puberty, and only a few cases are diagnosed in adulthood.

There are multiple classifications of CBD, including intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and mixed types based on the anatomical involvement; single and multiple types or limited and diffuse types based on the number of dilated bile ducts; and infantile and adult types based on the age of the patient. The most commonly used classification was proposed by Alonso-Lej et al. in 1959 and was supplemented and refined by Todani et al. in 1977. Many researchers have proposed improvements or new classifications, but these revised classifications are still vague, complicated, and difficult to remember and apply. Moreover, these classifications are generally based on adults, and a large proportion of adult patients have secondary BD, while almost all underage patients have CBD. There are significant differences in the etiology, symptoms, and prognosis between congenital and secondary. Therefore, we aimed to propose a new classification system, CBD HUAXI classification, which is simple, easy to apply, and consistent with the principles of diagnosing and treating CBD patients.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation for choledocholithiasis, WSES 2020 guidelines recommend to do not rely solely on elevated LFTs or bilirubin for identifying common bile duct stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, rather obtain further diagnostic tests.

### A new clinical classification of congenital biliary dilatation-HUAXI CBD classification [^51ee4424]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lenriot et al. argued that the Todani classification emphasizes the association of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile duct dilatation without considering their distinct nature, especially regarding the treatment and long-term prognosis of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Therefore, in 1998, they suggested combining Todani type IVb with multiple extrahepatic dilatations into type Id, and regrouping Todani type IVa with multiple extrahepatic and intrahepatic dilatations into a type IV based on the morphology of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (cystic, segmental, or fusiform dilatations). This modification differentiates extrahepatic bile duct dilatation in cases associated with intrahepatic duct dilatation and improves their classification.

Visser et al. have suggested that the Todani classification system actually encompasses four different diseases in terms of their pathogenesis, risk of malignancy, natural history, and treatment, and thus proposed describing these entities as congenital choledochal cyst, choledochocele, choledochal diverticulum, and Caroli's disease. Many researchers have subsequently supported this approach. However, these four diseases have similar clinical features and generally similar treatments (with the exception of Caroli's disease), so they can be differentiated but not necessarily be completely independent, which seems to over-exaggerate the differences of each type.

Dong et al. also concluded that the Todani classification was cumbersome, did not consider pathological results, and was confusing regarding the classification of extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, which led them to propose a new system based on anatomical and clinicopathological features from analysis of plenty of data and clinical practices. Their system combines cases that only involve the extrahepatic bile ducts, subdivides Todani type IVa, and classifies intrahepatic dilatation as involving the peripheral or central hepatic ducts, with further classification according to the extent of liver involvement. Thus, the Biliary Surgery Group of the Chinese Society of Medical Surgery acknowledged in 2017 that this classification system was useful for guiding the surgical strategy. However, Dong's exhaustive classification system is complicated to remember and apply, which is a challenge in primary hospitals, and this system includes some overlap in terms of treatment strategy, with unclear boundaries. Moreover, Dong's classification system does not cover cases with extrahepatic dilatation plus intrahepatic distal dilatation.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^7cb0ab4c]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### Comparative safety of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^0b11e292]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Instrumental Variable and Sensitivity Analyses

The instrumental variable balanced measured patient characteristics stratified about the median of the instrumental variable (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In our instrumental variable analysis, robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was still associated with higher risk of bile duct injury compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (0.4% vs 0.2%; RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.14–2.63]) (Table 3). We observed consistent findings suggesting that robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was associated with higher risk of bile duct injury across multiple sensitivity analyses. For example, robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was associated with higher rates of bile duct injury for elective surgical procedures (1.3% vs 0.5%; RR, 2.64 [95% CI, 2.04–3.25]), urgent or emergent surgical procedures (0.3% vs 0.2%; RR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.36–2.38]), and for patients who underwent a cholecystectomy for acute or chronic cholecystitis (0.5% vs 0.2%; RR 2.29 [95% CI, 1.79–2.79]) (Table 3). Our instrumental variable analysis of secondary outcomes did not find any statistically significant associations for biliary interventions or complications between robotic-assisted cholecystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

### The clinical characters of congenital choledochal cysts in perinatal patients: a retrospective analysis in a single institution [^53c641ab]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Object

We aimed to investigate the clinical characters of congenital choledochal cysts (CC) in perinatal patients and to determine the most suitable time for their management.

Study Design

We retrospectively analyzed all the data of patients with CC in our hospital between 2003 and 2013. Clinical characteristics during the perinatal, infancy, and childhood periods were examined.

Results

A total of 216 cases were analyzed, including 12, 39, and 165 patients in their perinatal, infancy, and childhood periods, respectively. The incidence of abdominal pain and jaundice in the perinatal group was lower than that in other groups (p < 0.0001; p = 0.001). The incidence of abnormal inflammatory markers and liver function in perinatal cases was lower than in the other cases (p = 0.012; p = 0.002). The receiver-operating characteristic curves for liver function indicated that the cut-off point for age at which liver damage was found was 120 days. Of the 12 perinatal cases, there were no significant differences, with regards to operative time and hospital stay, between open and laparoscopic surgical approaches (p = 0.164; p = 0.722).

Conclusion

Abdominal pain, jaundice, inflammatory markers, and liver function in perinatal patients with CC are better than in the infancy and childhood groups. We recommend surgical treatment before 120 days of age.

### Choledochal malformation in children: lessons learned from a Dutch national study [^84fe65d9]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

We included all Dutch pediatric patients who were operated for CM < 18 years of age in the Netherlands between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 2014. Patients who were diagnosed with a type V CM were excluded. Data were collected from all academic pediatric surgical centers performing surgery for CM, resulting in a national registry: "Nederlandse Studiegroep voor CHoledochus Cysten/malformaties (NeSCHoC)".

Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. The primary investigator (ME) collected data concerning patient demographics, age at diagnosis, type of CM according to Todani, age at surgical intervention, type of surgical intervention, surgical data and postoperative complications. Postoperative complications were defined as short-term (< 30 days) and long-term (> 30 days) complications following the Clavien–Dindo classification. Postoperative complications were defined as follows: cholangitis as fever (> 38.5) with abdominal pain and jaundice, pancreatitis as abdominal pain with elevated serum amylase, wound infection as red discoloration of the surgical and/or drain wound, bile leakage as abdominal complaints and proven bilirubin in the abdominal fluid, intra-abdominal infections as fever and a proven bacterial infection confirmed via culture, ileus as > 1 day of abdominal distension, vomiting and the absence of defecation and gas, liver(bile)stones as intrahepatic bile stones confirmed by ultrasonography, liver abscesses as circumscribed infection in the liver confirmed by ultrasonography and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis as confirmed histologically via liver biopsy.

We also collected the occurrence of biliary malignancies and survival data. We compared the outcomes after laparoscopic resection with the outcomes after resection via laparotomy, and the outcomes after surgery before 1 year of age with outcomes after surgery after 1 year of age. Follow-up was performed using the hospital databases. As surgical treatment of CM is only performed in a pediatric surgical center, all postoperative complications were collected from the patients' electronic or paper files in the pediatric surgical center where the resection was performed. Follow-up analysis was conducted from January 1, 1989 until of October 1, 2015. The study protocol was approved by the University Medical Center Groningen Ethics Committee (METC2015/115).

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4d6a22ee]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Search Strategy

We have established our inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 checklist, with the review protocol registered at PROSPERO (CRD42024581409). On 22 August 2024, HK searched three healthcare‐related databases, the names, date coverages, and search strategies, which are as presented in Table 1. We imported and organized the search results in Rayyan, with which duplicated results were automatically removed. Two reviewers (HK and FF) independently screened titles and abstracts of all the studies retrieved to identify those which evaluated the guidelines in terms of diagnostic performance for a full text review. Discordances between HK and SF were resolved by consensus, or with adjudication by AM if a consensus could not be reached.

TABLE 1
Summary of literature search.

Next, HK performed a full text review of each screened study to (i) determine if the study was to be included or excluded and to (ii) extract data using a proforma if the study was included (see below). Decisions for inclusion or exclusion were independently verified by AM with disagreement resolved by consensus. HK also carried out a "snowball" search of the reference lists of the included studies to identify additional relevant studies; these additional studies were subjected to the same verification process by AM before the final inclusion.

2.2 Study Selection Criteria

In this review, we considered diagnostic guidelines identified by the search if they were developed or adopted by regional, national, or international (defined as at least state, provincial, or equivalent level) professional bodies or expert panels; specifically, we excluded diagnostic tools, algorithms, or scoring systems which were based on limited populations such as those devised and used locally by single institutions, due to uncertainties about their generalizability. Studies that used the diagnostic guidelines for patient selection but focused on outcomes other than performance of the guidelines were excluded. For example, we excluded studies primarily comparing the performance of MRCP or EUS on patients stratified as intermediate risk of CBDS using the guidelines.

For inclusion, the studies were required to report the diagnostic performance in terms of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) to allow the construction of the 2 × 2 error matrix, or provide sufficient data for their derivation if these measures were not directly reported. Studies published as abstracts only were excluded. Non‐English language studies were excluded, unless official English versions were available.

### Gallstones and cholecystectomy in relation to risk of intra-and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [^88445576]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study design

A detailed description of the study design was published elsewhere (in a study of the risk of oesophageal cancer), but in the current study the cohorts were substantially extended. Two cohorts of patients with gallstone disease were identified in the nationwide Swedish Patient Registry during the period 1965–2008. The gallstone cohort included patients who had not undergone cholecystectomy, while the second cohort included patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. The study participants were identified in the patient registry through unique personal identity numbers, that are assigned to all Swedish residents, containing information on date of birth and sex. With almost complete coverage, the patient registry contains information on the majority of discharges from inpatient care between 1965 and 1986 and information on every discharge since 1987 and on. For each hospitalisation, up to eight discharge diagnoses coded were registered, according to the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases (the 7th version for 1964–1968, the 8th version for 1969–1986, the 9th version until 1996 and the 10th version thereafter). Up to six surgical codes were also assigned, according to the Swedish Classification of Operations and Major Procedures. Validation surveys suggest that almost 90% of registered diagnoses are correct when compared with the medical files. As private inpatient care in Sweden was negligible during the relevant time for this study, hospital-provided medical services were, in effect, population-based. For the cholecystectomy cohort, we identified all records between 1965 and 2008 that contained a cholecystectomy code ('Swedish Classification of Surgical Procedures' edition 6: 5350, 5351, 5352, 5356, 5357, or 5359; and edition 7: JKA20 or JKA21) and a diagnosis of gallstones, and for the gallstone cohort we identified all records with a diagnosis of gallstones, but no code for cholecystectomy during the study period. Entry into either cohort was recorded as the date of discharge following the first recorded hospitalisation with a cholecystectomy code or a gallstone code in the patient registry. The regional ethical committee in Stockholm approved the study.

### Surgical experience of 204 cases of adult choledochal cyst disease over 14 years [^19d3748b]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This study presents our 14-year surgical experience with adult choledochal cyst disease (CCD), focusing on the clinical outcomes after surgical treatment.

Methods

Medical records of 204 adult patients who had undergone surgery for CCD were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

Median patient age was 40.2 years, and 157 (77%) of the patients were female. Todani classification was type I in 116 patients (56.9%), type II in 1 patient (0.5%), type IVa in 86 patients (42.2%), and type V in 1 patient (0.5%). Extrahepatic cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy were performed in 185 patients (90.7%). Major perioperative complications occurred in 5 patients (2.5%), resulting in no mortality. Late complications occurred in 48 patients (23.6%). Concurrent cancer was diagnosed in 20 patients (9.8%). Mean age of patients with or without biliary cancer was 48.1 ± 13.2 years and 39.1 ± 11.8 years, respectively (P = 0.001). Anomalous union of the pancreaticobiliary duct was more frequently associated with gallbladder cancer than with bile duct cancer. De novo malignancy at the cyst remnant occurred in 2 patients (1%). The survival outcomes in CCD patients with concurrent biliary cancer were comparable to those in cancer patients without CCD.

Conclusions

As a result of diverse features of adult CCD, various clinical problems occurred after surgical excision. Surgical treatment for adult patients with CCDs having complex features should be individualized to maintain a balance between risk of surgery and potential risk of late complications.

### The increasing prevalence and adverse impact of morbid obesity in paediatric acute pancreatitis [^a94bff18]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Morbid obesity is proinflammatory has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes in acute pancreatitis (AP) among adults. Obesity is increasingly prevalent in children and hence, we sought to evaluate the impact of morbid obesity on the clinical outcomes of AP using a large paediatric population-based cohort.

Methods

We analysed the US Kids' Inpatient Database between years 2003 and 2016 to include all patients (age ≤ 21years) with a primary diagnosis of AP using specific ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes. We compared clinical outcomes between children without obesity (controls) and those with morbid obesity (cases). The primary outcome was severe AP (2012 revised Atlanta classification) and secondary outcomes included healthcare resource utilization (length of stay and hospital costs).

Results

Among 36698 paediatric AP hospitalizations, 1275 (3.5%) were found to have morbid obesity. From 2003 to 2016, the proportion of children with morbid obesity among AP patients increased from 1.3% to 5.5% (P < .001). More than half (54%) of the children with morbid obesity were presented with cholelithiasis as contributive aetiology. The prevalence of severe AP was significantly higher in morbid obesity (7.3% vs 3.8%, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that morbid obesity was increasingly associated with severe AP (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.4, 2.26), prolonged hospitalization (by 0.41days, P = 0.03), and higher hospital costs (by $1596, P < .001).

Conclusion

Unlike adult population, there is a lack of other confounding comorbidities in children and this national-level analysis shows that morbid obesity independently prognosticates adverse clinical outcomes in paediatric AP.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^0f1707a3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE choledocholithiasis guideline — predictive criteria and diagnostic pathway: We suggest the following high-risk criteria for choledocholithiasis, which should directly prompt ERCP: common bile duct stone on US or cross-sectional imaging; total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL and dilated common bile duct; or ascending cholangitis. We suggest that patients with other criteria such as abnormal liver tests, age > 55 years, and dilated common bile duct on US (intermediate risk for choledocholithiasis) undergo EUS, MRCP, or laparoscopic IOC or laparoscopic intraoperative US for further evaluation. The 2010 ASGE Guideline proposed risk categories as high [> 50%], intermediate [10%-50%], and low [< 10%].

### Meta-analysis of risk of developing malignancy in congenital choledochal malformation [^ec6350cf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Malignancy rate

Overall, 312 of the 2904 patients (10.7 per cent) developed a malignancy. This was subdivided into tumours present during primary surgery, which was the case in 212 patients (7.3 per cent), and tumours that developed during follow‐up, which affected 100 patients (3.4 per cent). Of these 100 patients, 42 (42.0 per cent) were treated with some kind of drainage procedure, 36 (36.0 per cent) underwent complete cyst excision followed by a Roux‐en‐Y hepaticojejunostomy, and in 22 patients (22.0 per cent) the treatment was unknown. Information about survival of patients with malignancy was provided by ten studies 7, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 38. Included studies reported mortality rates of between 45 and 100 per cent (1).

Age at development of malignancy

Six studies 7, 22, 26, 32, 34, 38 (comprising 58 patients) provided detailed information on age at which malignancies developed. Of these 58 patients, 41 were aged less than 60 years. There was one 12‐year‐old child with a malignancy. The number of patients per age decade is shown in. 3. Of the other 11 studies that reported the development of malignancies, only eight reported median age. The median age was less than 60 years in all but one of these studies 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 37. The median age of patients with choledochal malformation at presentation of malignancy for each study is illustrated in. 4. The median age at which malignancy developed was 49.5 years (14 studies); three studies 31, 35, 36 lacked this information. One study 25 reported no development of malignancy. The malignancy rates and median age at detection of malignancy are shown in 1.

### Preoperative imaging does not predict intrahepatic involvement in choledochal cysts [^14bbca09]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Choledochal cyst (CDC) is a congenital malformation of the bile ducts, which can include the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. We hypothesize that preoperative intrahepatic ductal dilation is not predictive of postoperative intrahepatic involvement.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all cases of CDC in children diagnosed at a single institution between 1991 and 2013.

Results

Sixty-two patients were diagnosed with CDC during the study period with a median follow-up time of 2.25 (range 0–19.5) years. Forty-two patients (68%) were diagnosed with type I disease preoperatively, and 15 patients (24%) were diagnosed with type IV-A disease. The most common presenting symptoms included pain (34%), jaundice (28%), and pancreatitis (25%). There were no deaths or malignancies and only one postoperative stricture. Forty-two patients (68%) had intrahepatic ductal dilation preoperatively. Only four patients (9%) had intrahepatic ductal dilation following resection (P < 0.0001). In one patient, this dilation resolved following stricture revision. Of the four patients with postoperative dilation, two were diagnosed with type I disease, and the other two were diagnosed with type IV-A disease preoperatively.

Conclusion

Preoperative intrahepatic ductal dilation is not predictive of postoperative intrahepatic ductal involvement in children with CDC. The preoperative distinction between type I and IV disease is not helpful in treating these patients.

### Impact of comorbidities on hospital mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis: a population-based study of 110, 021 patients [^2345a32f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We carried out a retrospective observational study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge (Registro de Actividad de Atención Especializada-Conjunto Mínimo Básico de Datos, "RAE-CMBD"). The RAE-CMBD collects all the administrative data from hospitals (public and private) in the country.

The information collected in this database comes from hospital discharge reports made by the physicians in charge of the patient. This information and record of coded diagnoses are automatically collected by the computer software of each center or by technical-administrative staff.

Study population

The study population includes patients diagnosed with AP and admitted to the Spanish National Health System hospitals from 2016 to 2019. Since 2016, the RAE-CMDB has collected 20 diagnoses and 20 procedures from each patient based on the International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD-10).

The inclusion criteria were: Patients with a primary or first registered secondary diagnosis of AP.

The exclusion criteria were: 1) Patients under 18 years of age, 2) Patients with a diagnosis primary or first registered secondary of pancreatic neoplasm, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cyst, pancreatic pseudocyst, extrahepatic bile duct neoplasm, and complications of the transplanted pancreas. We excluded the population under 18 years of age because the incidence of AP is lower in the pediatric population, and the etiologies distribution differs from that of adults.

Variables analyzed

The variables included are demographic variables such as age and sex, and AP etiology. We used the ICD-10 diagnostic code from each patient to identify the etiology of AP, which includes six categories: biliary, alcohol, idiopathic, drug-related, other, and unspecified. Our clinical-administrative database does not have data on diagnostic tests such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging that allow the identification of the etiology in patients with a diagnosis of "unspecified pancreatitis. In addition, we did not have data after hospital discharge that could expand the information on the etiology. Other variables assessed were clinical variables on diagnoses and procedures.

Comorbidity assessment

Comorbidities were identified from the ICD-10 diagnosis codes of each patient. We have used the POA indicator (Present on registration) to identify comorbidities and differentiate them from diagnoses produced during hospital admission that could be secondary complications of AP. The ICD-10 codes used to identify specific comorbidities are described in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).

### Type IV choledochal cyst with polycystic kidney disease: a case report [^979fc86d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Choledochal cysts are cystic dilations that may occur in any part of the bile duct between the liver and the duodenum. Alonso-lej first classified choledochal cysts in 1959, and Todani expanded the classification system in 1977 by dividing choledochal cysts into 5 types. Type I cysts are subclassified into 3 types. Type IA cysts are marked cystic dilations of the entire extrahepatic biliary tree that do not involve the intrahepatic ducts. Type IB cysts are focal, segmental dilations of the extrahepatic bile duct. Type IC cysts are smooth fusiform dilations of the entire extrahepatic bile duct. Type II cysts are discrete diverticula of the extrahepatic duct with narrow stalk connections to the common bile duct. Type III cysts are choledochoceles that are located in the duodenal wall. Type IVA cysts are multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic dilations. Intrahepatic duct dilation can be cystic, fusiform, or irregular. Type IVB cysts are multiple dilatations that are confined only to the extrahepatic bile duct. Type V cysts, which are also called Caroli disease, show single or multiple dilatations of the intrahepatic bile duct.

The aetiology of choledochal cysts is complex. At present, there are several assumed causes, including genetic factors, abnormal pancreaticobiliary confluence (pancreaticobiliary maljunction, PBM), gastrointestinal neuroendocrine factors, and abnormal proliferation of the bile duct epithelium. Caroli disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disease that is caused by a mutation in the PKHD1 gene located on chromosome 6p12; usually, it is considered to be associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The role of congenital factors in the pathogenesis of choledochal cysts aside from those associated with Caroli disease is not yet clear.

### A giant type IVA choledochal cyst [^4859c709]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Alonso-Lej et al published the first systematic description of choledochal cysts in 1959. He classified choledochal cysts into three types. This classification was further advanced by Todani et al and includes five major types and several subtypes. Type I cysts are a dilatation of the extrahepatic bile duct. These are the most common type and seen in 75% to 85% of cases. Type I cysts may be further classified as cystic (IA), focal (IB), or fusiform (IC). Type II cyst is diverticulum of the CBD. Type III is represented by a cystic dilatation of the intramural portion of the CBD known as choledochoceles. Type IVA lesions involve both the intra and extrahepatic portions of the bile ducts and type IVB are multiple cysts limited to the extrahepatic bile ducts. Type V is synonymous with Caroli disease, which involves abnormalities of the intrahepatic bile ducts resulting in multiple segmental intrahepatic cystic biliary dilatations. Although type I cysts are the most common in patients of all ages, type IVA cysts are more prevalent in adults. The size of choledochal cyst varies, and rarely exceeds 9 cm.

Although ultrasound is the best initial method for evaluating the entire intrahepatic and extrahepatic biiary system and gallbladder, it may not always be able to precisely identify that the cyst originates in the bile duct, especially larger cysts as in our case. In this case, the presence of intrahapatic biliary dilatation adds an important clue to the diagnosis of choledochal cyst. MRCP is the current "gold standard" in the imaging of choledochal cysts. The other radiological differential of a huge cyst at porta hepatis includes pseudopancreatic cyst, hepatic cyst, mesenteric and omental cyst.

The presentation in adults is often vague and nonspecific. The classic triad of intermittent jaundice, abdominal mass, and pain, rarely seen in adults, was present in our case. The choledochal cyst, particularly the large cyst, can lead to serious complications if left untreated. These include cysto-lithiasis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension, and development of cholangiocarcinoma. The incidence of malignant transformation is reported to be 2.5–26%. This risk has been reported to be greatest in patients with intrahepatic biliary involvement.

### The challenges of implementing artificial intelligence into surgical practice [^9ec61be0]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Artificial intelligence is touted as the future of medicine. Classical algorithms for the detection of common bile duct stones (CBD) have had poor clinical uptake due to low accuracy. This study explores the challenges of developing and implementing a machine-learning model for the prediction of CBD stones in patients presenting with acute biliary disease (ABD).

Methods

All patients presenting acutely to Christchurch Hospital over a two-year period with ABD were retrospectively identified. Clinical data points including lab test results, demographics and ethnicity were recorded. Several statistical techniques were utilised to develop a machine-learning model. Issues with data collection, quality, interpretation and barriers to implementation were identified and highlighted.

Results

Issues with patient identification, coding accuracy, and implementation were encountered. In total, 1315 patients met inclusion criteria. Incorrect international classification of disease 10 (ICD-10) coding was noted in 36% (137/382) of patients recorded as having CBD stones. Patients with CBD stones were significantly older and had higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (p < 0.001). The no information rate was 81% (1070/1315 patients). The optimum model developed was the gradient boosted model with a PPV of 67%, NPV of 87%, sensitivity of 37% and a specificity of 96% for common bile duct stones.

Conclusion

This paper highlights the utility of machine learning in predicting CBD stones. Accuracy is limited by current data and issues do exist around both the ethics and practicality of implementation. Regardless, machine learning represents a promising new paradigm for surgical practice.

### Comparative safety of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^682bf476]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was deemed exempt from review by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, which also waived the requirement to obtain informed consent because data were deidentified. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data Source and Study Population

We used Medicare Provider Analysis and Review claims from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, for nonfederal acute care hospitals. The current analyses were performed from August 17, 2022, to June 1, 2023. We selected patients who underwent 23-hour observation or inpatient admissions for cholecystectomy by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), and Current Procedural Technology codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). This technique using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes has been previously used to identify robotic-assisted proceduresand verified within a statewide clinical registry that manually abstracts information on operative approaches. We included beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with continuous Medicare fee-for-service coverage for 3 months before and 12 months after the surgical procedure of interest. We excluded patients in Medicare Advantage and patients with gallbladder, bile duct, and liver cancers (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We collected information on patient demographic characteristics, and comorbidities were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes and defined using the Elixhauser method. Hospitals were identified and linked to hospital referral regions. Hospital referral regions represent regional health care markets and typically include at least 1 tertiary referral hospital.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Biliary atresia (BA) evaluation — imaging and histology recommendations: Abdominal ultrasound is described as useful to exclude choledochal cyst or gallstone disease causing extrahepatic bile duct obstruction and may show an absent or abnormal gallbladder or other features suggestive, but not diagnostic, of BA (1A); limited specificity precludes the use of the hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) scan as a stand‑alone test for definitive BA diagnosis (1B), though definitively demonstrated bile flow by selective HBS may help exclude BA (1B); limited specificity of MRCP, ERCP, and PTCC provides only a limited role in guiding diagnosis of BA; and, in the hands of an experienced pediatric pathologist, characteristic histopathologic changes on an appropriately timed liver biopsy are the most supportive test for infants with protracted conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (1B), while histology can identify other cholestatic diseases.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Laparoscopic management of choledochal cyst-technical modifications and outcome analysis [^ead9e192]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Choledochal cyst (CDC) is a well described albeit rare clinical entity. Complete cyst excision with biliary-enteric reconstruction is the recommended treatment for Todani type I, II, and IVA cysts to prevent complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate outcomes of laparoscopic CDC excision from a tertiary care center.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of 110 patients who underwent laparoscopic cyst excision and biliary-enteric reconstruction for CDC type I and IVA from 1998 to 2013.

Results

Out of 110 patients, 55 were children (< 16 years) and 55 were adults (> 16 years) with mean age 21.19 ± 17.75 years and male:female ratio of 1:2.14. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (59.09%). Surprisingly, 32.73% of adults presented with incidentally detected cyst. Type I cyst was the most common (71.82%) with mean size of 4.67 ± 1.59 cm. Blood loss (56.0 ± 16.62 vs. 76.55 ± 26.61 ml) and operative time (199.8 ± 44.66 vs. 251.6 ± 54.25 min) were significantly low in pediatric group. Three adults required conversion. Overall complication rate was 10%. Re-exploration rate was 1.81% with one patient died post-operatively. Mean hospital stay was significantly low in children (5.9 ± 1.39 vs. 7.0 ± 2.66 days). Median follow-up was 60 months (8–110). Cholangitis developed in six patients with three having anastomotic stricture requiring intervention.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic excision of CDC is safe and feasible. Surgery should be performed early as outcomes are better in pediatric age as compared to adults.

### Value of ultrasound in diagnosing perforation of congenital choledochal cysts in children [^4c27064e]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of ultrasound in children with perforation of congenital choledochal cysts.

Methods

Eligible patients recruited from January 2004 to December 2018 in our hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. A total of 59 cases of congenital choledochal cysts with perforation were defined as the perforation group, and 100 cases of congenital choledochal cysts without perforation with similar symptoms were defined as the control group. Clinical features were analyzed and compared between the groups. The differential efficacy of varied diagnostic criteria was evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic analysis.

Results

Significant differences were found between the groups with respect to clinical characteristics (abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, and abdominal distention; all P < .01) and the disease onset age (P < .001), but the diagnostic efficacy of both was poor (both areas under the curve, < 0.7). The interruption of bile duct continuity only occurred in the perforation group with high specificity of 100% but poor sensitivity of 18.6%. The discrimination of combined features was significantly better (area under the curve, 0.936) than that of the disease onset age and clinical characteristics, with observed sensitivity and specificity of 93.2% and 94.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

Using specific features, ultrasound can effectively diagnose perforation of a congenital choledochal cyst in children.
