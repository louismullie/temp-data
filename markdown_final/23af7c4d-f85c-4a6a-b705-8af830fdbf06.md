## Question

is ventricular bigeminy dangerosu?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ventricular bigeminy is dangerous and how to interpret its risk and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what ventricular bigeminy is and how it is defined. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts that change risk, including structural heart disease, exercise or recovery phases, and genetic arrhythmia syndromes. Next, I will examine mechanistic hazards such as PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and torsades-promoting short–long–short sequences. After that, I should review prognostic data from large cohorts and exercise testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk stratification and outline evaluation and management steps, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline-based recommendations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: ventricular bigeminy is an alternating pattern of a normal sinus beat followed by a premature ventricular contraction, which by definition implies a very high PVC burden approaching 50% of beats when sustained, and it is considered a frequent or complex ectopic pattern in imaging appropriateness criteria, which already flags it as non-trivial even before I assess the underlying substrate [^111dNxmX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about danger without context. I need to check the substrate because risk stratification hinges on whether there is structural heart disease, reduced LV function, ischemia, or an inherited arrhythmia syndrome, and guidelines emphasize that symptoms and discovered or known heart disease should prompt focused evaluation for precipitating factors and family history, which materially shifts risk and management decisions [^112Xc1vW] [^114g3Ybt].

> I will now examine PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, since sustained bigeminy constitutes a very high PVC burden. Wait, let me verify the burden threshold and reversibility — ESC and contemporary reviews indicate that frequent PVCs, typically in the range of more than about 5–10% of beats, can cause a reversible LV dysfunction, and bigeminy at ~50% clearly exceeds that, with suppression of PVCs restoring LV function, supported by mechanistic animal models showing that bigeminal ectopy alone can induce cardiomyopathy and that dyssynchrony severity correlates with LV decline, which reinforces the causal link rather than mere association [^116mK92N] [^114HBCHD] [^114Rc9PD].

> Next, I should review acute arrhythmic hazards. Bigeminy can facilitate short–long–short sequences that are proarrhythmic for torsades de pointes, especially in patients with QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte derangements, or intrinsic repolarization disease, and hospital guidance highlights that occasional bigeminy in the setting of bradycardia and clustered risk factors warrants close ECG/QT monitoring and electrolyte optimization, so I need to ensure I screen for these modifiable triggers before labeling bigeminy as "benign" [^112HejQ2].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic with a normal heart — does bigeminy still matter? I should double-check prognostic data from exercise testing and population cohorts, which show that frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery after exercise, including bigeminy, independently predicts higher long-term cardiovascular mortality and major adverse events, and that complex PVC patterns during exercise testing carry worse prognosis than PVC count alone, indicating that bigeminy is not just a benign curiosity even when resting ventricular function is preserved [^112N9eUf] [^116ZZK6s] [^117CcctN].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy, I initially thought bigeminy itself independently predicted adverse fetal outcomes, but wait, I should verify — multivariate analyses show that the overall PVC burden, rather than the mere presence of bigeminy, was the significant predictor, so I should correct that assumption and frame bigeminy as a marker of higher burden that correlates with risk rather than a standalone predictor in that cohort [^1138taUF] [^112zUzyD].

> I need to ensure I cover inherited arrhythmia syndromes. In catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, exercise-induced bigeminy and bidirectional ectopy are classic manifestations and herald adrenergic-triggered polymorphic VT or VF, and in long QT evaluations, exercise-induced bigeminy is uncommon and, when present, more often reflects CPVT than LQTS, so discovering bigeminy during stress testing should prompt targeted genetic and phenotypic workup rather than reassurance [^1153CK6f] [^115LLQon] [^116XZvXq].

> Next, I should review toxic and metabolic precipitants. Digoxin toxicity classically produces bigeminy and can progress to VT/VF, and cholinergic or cardiotoxic poisonings can present with bigeminy as part of a toxidrome, so I need to check medications and exposures carefully because removing the toxin can be curative and life-saving in those scenarios [^116bwSqH] [^1112c4N1] [^1122USxA] [^1132BkKK].

> Let me synthesize risk: ventricular bigeminy is never entirely benign when sustained. It is dangerous in proportion to the presence of structural heart disease or LV dysfunction, the magnitude and chronicity of PVC burden, adrenergic contexts such as exercise or recovery, inherited arrhythmia substrates, and toxic-metabolic triggers, whereas isolated brief bigeminy in a truly normal heart may carry lower immediate risk yet still warrants evaluation for evolving disease or high burden that could lead to cardiomyopathy over time [^116mK92N] [^112N9eUf] [^112Xc1vW].

> I should confirm the evaluation framework. For any patient with bigeminy, I need a 12-lead ECG to characterize morphology and look for ischemia or repolarization disease, echocardiography to assess structure and LV function, ambulatory monitoring to quantify burden and patterns, and selective use of exercise testing, cardiac MRI, coronary evaluation, and genetic testing based on clinical suspicion, because guidelines and consensus documents advise structured workups to uncover reversible causes and to risk-stratify for PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy and malignant arrhythmias [^112Xc1vW] [^1126s47S] [^114g3Ybt].

> Now, management. If there is structural heart disease, reduced LVEF, or symptoms, I should treat per guideline-directed therapy and consider rhythm control strategies, and if PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected, catheter ablation is often preferred to eradicate the ectopic focus and reverse LV dysfunction, with antiarrhythmic drugs considered when ablation is not feasible or fails, and in CPVT or LQTS phenocopies, beta-blockade with strict adrenergic avoidance is critical while ICD decisions follow syndrome-specific risk stratification, so I need to tailor therapy to the underlying substrate rather than treating the ECG pattern in isolation [^1176ssdc] [^116XZvXq].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line is precise: ventricular bigeminy is a high-burden PVC pattern that is potentially dangerous because it can cause or reflect structural injury such as PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy, it can precipitate malignant arrhythmias in susceptible substrates, and it carries adverse prognostic associations in population and exercise cohorts. Therefore, it warrants systematic evaluation and risk-targeted management rather than passive reassurance, with urgency escalated when structural disease, symptoms, genetic risk, or toxic exposures are present [^116mK92N] [^112N9eUf] [^116ZZK6s] [^112Xc1vW].

Ventricular bigeminy is **not inherently dangerous** in patients with structurally normal hearts, but it can be a marker of underlying disease or trigger serious arrhythmias in those with structural heart disease or high ectopic burden [^112Xc1vW] [^116mK92N]. Risk increases with **frequent PVCs (> 10% of beats)** [^116mK92N], complex forms (couplets, nonsustained VT) [^116ZZK6s], or symptoms such as syncope or chest pain [^114nYwaD]. Evaluation should include ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring [^114ZtC8F]; treat underlying causes, consider beta-blockers or ablation for symptomatic or high-burden cases, and reserve ICDs for high-risk patients with structural heart disease and malignant ventricular arrhythmias [^114CkpNy] [^1176ssdc] [^115ktvuH].

---

## Clinical significance and risk stratification

Ventricular bigeminy is **generally benign in healthy individuals** with normal hearts, but it may indicate underlying disease or increased arrhythmic risk in patients with structural heart disease or high ectopic burden [^1111dN7N] [^116mK92N]. Risk stratification depends on the presence of structural heart disease, PVC burden, and clinical symptoms [^1126s47S].

---

### Risk factors associated with ventricular bigeminy

Several factors **increase the risk** of ventricular bigeminy:

- **Structural heart disease**: Coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and valvular heart disease significantly increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including bigeminy [^112Xc1vW].

- **High PVC burden**: Frequent PVCs (> 10% of total heartbeats) can lead to PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, a reversible form of left ventricular dysfunction [^116mK92N].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias [^112HejQ2] [^1157Pir7].

- **Medications and substances**: Digitalis toxicity [^116bwSqH], antiarrhythmic drugs, caffeine, alcohol, and illicit drugs can trigger ventricular bigeminy [^notfound].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Inherited arrhythmogenic syndromes such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias [^1153CK6f].

---

## Potential complications

While ventricular bigeminy is often benign, it can lead to **significant complications**, particularly in patients with underlying heart disease or high ectopic burden:

- **PVC-induced cardiomyopathy**: Prolonged frequent PVCs can cause reversible left ventricular dysfunction [^116mK92N].

- **Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation**: Bigeminy can degenerate into sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, especially in patients with structural heart disease [^113311M8].

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Frequent PVCs can cause symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and chest pain, impacting quality of life and daily activities [^114CkpNy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to determine the **underlying cause** and guide management:

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identifies ventricular bigeminy and assesses for underlying conduction abnormalities or structural heart disease [^112Xc1vW].

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluates cardiac structure and function, identifying structural heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction [^114ZtC8F].

- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Quantifies PVC burden and detects complex ventricular arrhythmias [^1126s47S].

- **Electrophysiological study**: Indicated in patients with high-risk features or suspected underlying arrhythmogenic substrates [^1126s47S].

---

## Management strategies

Management of ventricular bigeminy **depends on the underlying cause**, PVC burden, and symptom severity:

- **Treat underlying causes**: Address electrolyte imbalances, medication adjustments, and management of structural heart disease [^112Xc1vW].

- **Medical therapy**: Beta-blockers are first-line therapy for symptomatic patients or those with high PVC burden. Antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide or amiodarone may be considered in selected cases [^114CkpNy].

- **Catheter ablation**: Effective for patients with symptomatic or high-burden PVCs, particularly when a focal ectopic source is identified [^114CkpNy].

- **Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)**: Reserved for patients with structural heart disease, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, or high risk of sudden cardiac death [^115ktvuH].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of ventricular bigeminy **varies with the underlying cardiac condition** and PVC burden. In patients with structurally normal hearts, the prognosis is generally excellent. In contrast, patients with structural heart disease or high ectopic burden have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [^116ZZK6s] [^116mK92N].

---

Ventricular bigeminy is **not inherently dangerous** but can signal underlying disease or trigger serious arrhythmias in susceptible patients. Risk depends on heart structure, PVC burden, and symptoms; evaluation includes ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring, with treatment focused on causes, beta-blockers or ablation for symptomatic or high-burden cases, and ICDs for high-risk structural disease with malignant ventricular arrhythmias.

### A straightforward guide to the basic science behind arrhythmogenesis [^112q3gGB]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanisms behind cardiac arrhythmias are described in this manuscript. In clinical practice, significant arrhythmias are unpredictable, and under some conditions, potentially life-threatening. How can basic science help improve our understanding of molecular entities and factors behind the arrhythmia to advance, develop, adapt or deliver available medications? Structural heart disease and remodelling (eg, heart failure, cardiomyopathy), the presence of modulating factors (ie, diabetes mellitus, autonomic nervous system), genetic predispositions (ie, channelopathies) are considerable preconditions, and influence the development of an arrhythmia. Cardiac arrhythmias may indeed share common basic mechanisms, while elements and substrates perpetuating these may be different and ultimately manifest as various ECG abnormalities. This article lists cellular and subcellular iatrogenic disorders responsible for abnormal impulse generation, or conduction disturbances, including the latest development in theories and biological research, for a better understanding of cellular disorders behind arrhythmogenesis.

Family Investigation

Between 2007 and 2017, 4 cases of cardiac arrest in young individuals were identified in a large family from a village near Jerusalem, Israel (Figure 1A), out of which 3 survived the event. One out of 4 resulted in the death of a 16‐year‐old girl while she was on a giant wheel in an amusement park (Figure 1A, patient IV7). The other three were aborted cardiac arrest cases. The clinical scenarios were of an 18‐year‐old man while helping friends to push a car (patient IV11), his 13‐year‐old sister immediately upon hearing about her brother's cardiac arrest (patient IV13), and a 17‐year‐old girl who had cardiac arrest while descending from a school bus (patient IV2) and was shocked by an automatic external defibrillator, which documented ventricular fibrillation. All survivors received an implantable cardiac defibrillator, and therapy with a beta blocker, metoprolol, was initiated. Resting ECG and echocardiography were normal in all clinically affected members; however, their exertional stress test demonstrated ventricular arrhythmia in the form of ventricular bigeminy and bidirectional couplets, which appeared at a rate of ≈100 beats per minute, increasing in frequency with increasing heart rate (Figure 1B).

In a cascade family clinical investigation, we identified 2 other siblings (patients IV4 and IV15) who had multifocal premature ventricular contractions and bidirectional couplets during stress tests. The parents of the affected individuals were asymptomatic, had normal baseline ECGs, echocardiography, and 24‐hour Holters. The father of patient IV3 had ventricular bigeminy and a single bidirectional couplet during his exertional stress test. Other parents' exertional stress tests were unremarkable.

During 9 years of follow up, patient IV13 had a breakthrough episode of ventricular fibrillation that terminated with shocks from her implantable cardiac defibrillator (Figure 1C). At this point, the dose of metoprolol was increased, after which no further ventricular fibrillation episodes occurred. This patient had atrial fibrillation episodes as well.

### Severe acute poisoning with homemade aconitum napellus capsules: toxicokinetic and clinical data [^1132BkKK]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Aconitum napellus is an extremely dangerous plant that contains various toxic diterpenoid alkaloids, mainly aconitine primarily concentrated in the roots. We report a case of acute intoxication of a 21-year-old man admitted to our Emergency Department after the ingestion, in order to sleep, of three homemade Aconitum napellus capsules. Capsules were measured to contain 237 mg of root and 19 microg of aconitine. The patient experienced the first symptoms on wakening 5 hours later with generalized paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, vertigo, thoracic pain dyspnea, and dyschromatopsia. At admission, 7 hours after intake electrocardiographic analysis showed a sinusal bradycardia with polymorphic and bigeminal ventricular extrasystolia. Cardiovascular and neurological symptoms disappeared, respectively within 11 and 13 hours of ingestion. The patient was discharged from the ICU on day 2. Plasmatic concentrations at H7, H9, H14 H19, and after ingestion were, respectively, of 1.75, 0.75, 0.35, and 0.02 ng/mL. The calculated half-life of aconitine was 3 hours. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case with an aconitine toxicokinetic-effect relationship. The authors stress that clinicians must be aware of possible occurrence of acute poisoning with Aconitum napellus in European countries and in the United States as herbal medicine is becoming increasingly popular.

### Prognostic value of plasma big endothelin-1 in left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy [^112N31QQ]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study revealed that plasma big ET-1 is a valuable tool for risk stratification in patients with LVNC as well. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that big ET-1 was independently associated with the left ventricular size and function in terms of predicting adverse outcomes. Furthermore, a big ET-1 level of ≥ 0.42 pmol/L was significantly related to an increased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, suggesting that a high level of big ET-1 could be a potential indicator of a patient's prognosis.

The study showed that a high level of big ET-1 (≥ 0.42 pmol/L) contributed to an elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, especially heart-failure-related death and heart transplantation. Patients with high big ET-1 levels seemed to be a higher risk for SCD with a statistical difference, but the number of SCD cases was small. A previous study revealed that high big ET-1 levels were related to the development of a sustained VT and VF, and the recurrence of various arrhythmias. The present study, however, did not find a significant difference in the incidence of sustained VT or VF between the high-level and low-level big ET-1 groups. It is probably due to the fact that even asymptomatic patients with LVNC are at risk for life-threatening arrhythmia or SCD. Consequently, the relation between big ET-1 levels and SCD or a sustained VT or VF needs to be evaluated further in long-term follow-up studies with a large sample.

Prognostic Value of High-Grade and Complex PVC Rhythms

To compare our data with the recently published work from Refaat et al, we identified high-grade PVCs in 1560 (3.2%) and 727 (1.5%) participants, during exercise and recovery, respectively. High-grade PVCs were associated with MI/HF/LTVA independent of clinical and ECG factors (HR, 1.7 [1.4–2.0], p < 0.001; HR, 1.7 [1.3–2.1], P < 0.001, for exercise and recovery, respectively;) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1–1.5], P = 0.003; HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.0–1.7], P = 0.028). Both markers were also associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.7–3.1], P < 0.001, and HR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.3–3.2], P = 0.001;). Complex PVC rhythms (couplets, triplets, and bigeminy) were all associated with higher risk for MI/HF/LTVA compared with PVC count alone with fully adjusted HRs ranging between 2.4 (single PVC couplet) and 7.1 (≥ 1 episode with ≥ 3 consecutive PVCs;).

Sensitivity Analyses

Results obtained after adjusting for high resting PVC burden (n = 1437, 3.0%) or excluding participants with prevalent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 466; 1.0%) or CKD (n = 1374; 3.1%) were similar to the main analyses for both exercise and recovery PVCs.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes — evaluation considerations: Because some studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes, the detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and such patients are generally evaluated to ensure they do not have underlying conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) that warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### Consequences of chronic frequent premature atrial contractions: association with cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac structural changes [^115AKsbH]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause cardiomyopathy (CM). Postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and irregularity have been in implicated as triggers of PVC-CM. Because both phenomena can also be found in premature atrial contractions (PACs), it is speculated that frequent PACs have similar consequences.

Methods and Results

A single-center, retrospective study included all consecutive patients undergoing a 14-day Holter monitors (November 2014 to October 2016). Patients were divided into four groups by ectopy burden group 1 (< 1%) and remaining by tertiles (group 2–4). Echocardiographic and arrhythmic data were compared between PAC and PVC burdens. In addition, a translational PAC animal model was used to assess the chronic effects of frequent PACs. A total 846 patients were reviewed. In contrast to PVCs, we found no difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and presence of CM (LVEF < 50%) between different PAC groups. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that only PVC burden predicted low EF (odds ratio, 1.1; confidence interval, 1.03–1.13; p = 0.001). While there was a weak correlation between PAC burden and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episodes and atrial fibrillation (AF) burden (r = 0.19; P < .001), there was no correlation between PAC burden and LVEF or CM. Finally, atrial bigeminy in our animal model did not significantly decrease LVEF after 3 months.

Conclusion

PAC burden is associated with increased AF and SVT episodes. In contrast to a high PVC burden, a high PAC burden is not associated with CM. Our findings suggest that heart rate irregularity and/or PESP may play a minimal role in the pathophysiology of PVC-CM.

Myocardial dysfunction and damage. At baseline (BL) and 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), left ventricular ejection fraction (A), myocardial performance index (B) and E/A ratio (the ratio between early (diastolic, E) and late (atrial, A) ventricular filling velocity) (C) were evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography, and cardiac troponin T serum values (D) were quantified in the propofol (CONTROL) and sevoflurane (SEVO) groups. # P < 0.05 vs CONTROL.

Table 2
Hemodynamic data

Hemodynamic data were determined at baseline and 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the propofol (CONTROL) and sevoflurane (SEVO) groups. Data are means ± SD. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and cardiac index (CI) did not differ significantly between groups after we applied the Bonferroni correction for repeated time measurements using two-way analysis of variance. Cardiac index was calculated as the ratio of cardiac output to body surface area (body surface area = 0.0734 × (body weight in kilograms) 0.656).

Table 3
Ventricular arrhythmias

The total number of ventricular premature beats, bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) ratio was counted over an interval of 30 minutes immediately after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and over a 30-minute interval 24 hours later in the propofol (CONTROL) and sevoflurane (SEVO) groups. Data are medians [25th to 75th percentiles]. Neither ventricular tachycardia nor ventricular fibrillation was observed in any group.

Exercise testing in CRT recipients can be used to quantify the exercise functional capacity, and additional exercise test findings may include atrial tracking rate above upper tracking limit, rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (above lower rate or sensor rate), shortening of the intrinsic PR interval during exercise, frequent PVCs or ventricular bigeminy, and loss of tracking due to P waves in the post-ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP).

### Diagnostic and prognostic significance of exercise stress testing in desmosomal arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^116Lkigd]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is characterized by fibrofatty myocardial replacement and increased arrhythmic risk. Although exercise exacerbates desmosomal ACM, the prognostic significance of arrhythmias during exercise stress tests (ESTs) remains unclear.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to determine the impact of ventricular arrhythmia observed during peak exercise and/or recovery EST phases on the risk of major ventricular arrhythmia (MVA) events in patients with desmosomal ACM.

Methods

A retrospective review of 904 patients with ACM was used to identify those with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, and PKP2. After exclusion of patients with no EST data, demographic and electrocardiographic data were extracted from the medical record. The arrhythmic burden (premature ventricular complexes [PVCs], couplet, bigeminy, nonsustained VT, sustained VT, ventricular fibrillation, and PVCs per minute) during each EST phase (baseline, peak, and early and late recovery) were reviewed and correlated with MVA outcomes (sudden cardiac arrest, sustained VT, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies).

Results

A total of 326 ESTs from 147 patients (89 PKP2 [60%], 45 DSP [31%], 10 DSG2 [7%], and 3 DSC2 [2%]) were included. PKP2-ACM patients exhibited increased PVCs per minute (P < 0.001), bigeminy (P < 0.001), couplets (P < 0.001), and nonsustained VT (P < 0.001) during recovery. Recovery phase arrhythmias in PKP2-ACM patients were associated with a higher risk of MVA events (HR: 10.580; P = 0.003), a pattern absent in other genotypes (HR: 1.037; P = 0.973). This association remained significant in multivariable analysis (adjusted HR: 3.851; P = 0.040).

Conclusions

PKP2-ACM patients display a distinct recovery phase arrhythmic profile predictive of MVA events, emphasizing the importance of EST in risk stratification and management. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and ascertain the additive value of EST beyond established risk factors.

### Ventricular ectopy during treadmill exercise stress testing in the evaluation of long QT syndrome [^115LLQon]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) can present with sudden death during exertion.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic importance of exercise-induced ventricular ectopy in the evaluation of LQTS.

Methods

From 1998 to 2006, 381 patients with a referral diagnosis of LQTS underwent a treadmill exercise stress test. An investigator blinded to both genotype and rendered diagnosis scored the stress tests for the presence of exercise-induced ventricular ectopy.

Results

The dismissal diagnosis was LQTS in 177 (46%), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) in 16, miscellaneous cardiac disease in 17, and normal in 171. Exercise-induced ventricular ectopy was detected in 107 (28%) patients. However, only 34 patients (9% overall) had exercise-induced ventricular ectopy greater than single premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Among the 171 patients dismissed as normal, only 2% had ectopy greater than single PVCs. Among the genotype-positive LQTS patients, no significant ectopy was recorded in 80 with LQT1, compared to 5 (8%) patients with LQT2 and 3 (20%) patients with LQT3 (P < .0001). In contrast, exercise-induced ventricular ectopy beyond single PVCs was far more common among patients with CPVT (14/16 [88%]; P < .0001) and included PVCs in bigeminy in 13 (81%), couplets in 7 (47%), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 (19%). Of note, bidirectional VT was not present in any of the 16 patients diagnosed with CPVT, including the 10 with genetically proven, RYR2-mediated CPVT.

Conclusion

Exercise-induced ventricular ectopy exceeding single PVCs was observed in less than 10% of patients referred for LQTS evaluation, including 2% of patients ultimately dismissed as normal. Exercise-induced bigeminy is strongly associated with the presence of significant cardiovascular disease but is far more likely to indicate CPVT than LQTS.

### Successful use of equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATGAM) for fulminant myocarditis secondary to nivolumab therapy [^111fBBQ9]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

A clinical diagnosis of autoimmune myositis and myocarditis was made. She commenced intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days before tapering to oral prednisolone 100 mg daily. A single dose of intravenous infliximab 5 mg kg −1 was administered on Day 2 of admission given its use in previous case reports. Over the subsequent days, persistent ventricular bigeminy and episodic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias was treated with amiodarone and low-dose beta blocker therapy. Following this treatment, she remained haemodynamically stable with cardiac monitoring, confirming intermittent ventricular bigeminy with no further malignant arrhythmias.

On day 8 of admission, her clinical condition acutely deteriorated with sustained conscious ventricular tachycardia and haemodynamic compromise. She required direct current cardioversion that resulted in complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm. Subequently, an emergency cardiac biopsy, coronary angiogram and placement of a temporary pacing wire was undertaken. Cardiac biopsy (taken following administration of corticosteroids and infliximab) revealed multifocal lymphocytic (CD3+, CD8+ predominant with mixed CD3+ CD4+ subtypes) and histiocytic infiltrates associated with focal areas of myocyte necrosis (Figures 1 and 2; panel A) consistent with an immune-mediated myocarditis. All immunohistochemistry was performed using DAKO-Omnis apparatus with ready-to-use DAKO antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20 and CD68. Coronary angiogram was unremarkable.

After consultation with the heart failure/cardiac transplantation unit, the decision was made to commence equine ATGAM therapy with a view to depletion of T-lymphocytic infiltrate as used in cellular rejection of cardiac allografts.

ATGAM administration was per local protocol for acute cellular rejection consisting of ATGAM 500 mg on day 1, titrating the dose by 250 mg increments to daily CD2/3 levels (aiming for levels of 50–100/ μ l) for a total of 5 days. During this time, the patient remained in a ventricular paced rhythm. Repeat echocardiogram showed a mildly improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 43%.

Clinical and biochemical improvement occurred within three days of ATGAM therapy with resolution of ventricular arrhythmias and near normalisation of cardiac enzymes occurring by day 5 of ATGAM initiation. ECG confirmed return to sinus rhythm with an incomplete right bundle branch block and the temporary pacing wire was removed. Mycophenolate 1 gm twice daily was commenced on day 5 of ATGAM therapy. Prednisolone 100 mg daily was continued throughout ATGAM dosing.

### Anesthetic management of a patient with asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia [^114qss84]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

There are many causes of ventricular arrhythmias in pediatric patients, even those with structurally normal hearts. However, in young patients with 'normal' hearts, sustained ventricular arrhythmias are relatively rare. The primary concern of the physician is to identify which patients have benign ventricular arrhythmia patterns and which are at risk for sudden cardiac death. Even in asymptomatic patients, the choice of anesthetic agents may be important to minimize precipitation of episodes of tachyarrhythmias. This clinical report describes the anesthetic considerations for an asymptomatic child with a history of sustained premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and bigeminy. This child had chronic serous otitis media requiring repeat tympanostomy and tube replacement. This case report outlines the initial cancellation of anesthesia because of sustained arrhythmias, and subsequent conduct of the anesthesia for the case, as well as the considerations in the selection of the drugs when a child presents with significant ventricular arrhythmia.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myocarditis with or without concomitant myopathy: clinical findings and cardiovascular outcomes [^112g5Zkn]. JACC: CardioOncology (2025). Medium credibility.

ICI-induced irMyocarditis

Our definition of irMyocarditis was based on the 2022 International Cardio-Oncology Society consensus criteria. However, to minimize the possibility of false-positive myocarditis cases, we excluded all patients without imaging or histologic confirmation of myocarditis, except those with a fulminant cardiac presentation. In summary, a diagnosis of irMyocarditis was made if 1 or more of the following conditions were met:
1 An endomyocardial biopsy revealing histopathologic findings consistent with irMyocarditis.
2 Elevated troponin levels plus CMR results confirming acute myocarditis on the basis of the presence of both modified Lake Louise criteria.
3 Elevated troponin levels plus CMR results suggestive of acute myocarditis on the basis of the presence of 1 but not both modified Lake Louise criteria and at least 1 additional minor criterion. Minor criteria included clinical symptoms (such as fatigue, muscle weakness, myalgias, chest pain, diplopia, ptosis, shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness or dizziness, syncope, and/or cardiogenic shock), ventricular arrhythmias, new conduction system disease, a decline in left ventricular (LV) systolic function (defined as a reduction in LV ejection fraction [LVEF] from baseline by ≥ 10 percentage points to < 50%, or LVEF < 40% where baseline echocardiography was unavailable), and the presence of immune-related adverse events other than irMyocarditis.
4 Elevated troponin levels with at least 2 minor criteria, as detailed previously, in addition to the presence of a fulminant cardiac presentation (hemodynamic instability, heart failure [HF] requiring invasive ventilation, complete or high-grade heart block, and/or significant ventricular arrhythmias).

The severity grading of irMyocarditis was based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology classification of immune-related adverse events (Supplemental Table 1). All patients had elevated troponin levels. Grade 1 included patients who had no cardiac-related symptoms and no electrocardiographic changes. Grade 2 included patients with symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, peripheral edema, or new electrocardiographic changes (ST-segment changes, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or ventricular bigeminy). Grade 3 included patients with new bundle branch block, and grade 4 included patients with fulminant features (hemodynamic instability, HF requiring invasive ventilation, complete or high-grade heart block, and/or significant ventricular arrhythmias or cardiovascular death).

### Left ventricular systolic dysfunction induced by ventricular ectopy: a novel model for premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^114HBCHD]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) commonly coexist with cardiomyopathy. Recently, PVCs have been identified as a possible cause of cardiomyopathy. We developed a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy animal model using a novel premature pacing algorithm to assess timeframe and reversibility of this cardiomyopathy and examine the associated histopathologic abnormalities.

Methods and Results

Thirteen mongrel dogs were implanted with a specially programmed pacemaker capable of simulating ventricular extrasystoles. Animals were randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of bigeminal PVCs (n = 7) or no PVCs (control, n = 6). Continuous 24-hour Holter monitoring corroborated ventricular bigeminy in the PVC group (PVC, 49.8% versus control, < 0.01%; P < 0.0001). After 12 weeks, only the PVC group had cardiomyopathy, with a significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (PVC, 39.7 ± 5.4% versus control, 60.7 ± 3.8%; P < 0.0001) and an increase in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (PVC, 33.3 ± 3.5 mm versus control, 23.7 ± 3.6 mm; P < 0.001). Ventricular effective refractory period showed a trend to prolong in the PVC group. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy was resolved within 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of PVCs. No inflammation, fibrosis, or changes in apoptosis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were observed with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.

Conclusions

This novel PVC animal model demonstrates that frequent PVCs alone can induce a reversible form of cardiomyopathy in otherwise structurally normal hearts. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy lacks gross histopathologic and mitochondrial abnormalities seen in other canine models of cardiomyopathy.

### Paclitaxel [^116kyAow]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The minor hypersensitivity reactions consisted mostly of flushing (28%), rash (12%), hypotension (4%), dyspnea (2%), tachycardia (2%), and hypertension (1%). The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions remained relatively stable during the entire treatment period.

Chills, shock, and back pain in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.

Cardiovascular

Hypotension, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 12% of all patients and 3% of all courses administered. Bradycardia, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 3% of all patients and 1% of all courses. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, neither dose nor schedule had an effect on the frequency of hypotension and bradycardia. These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation. The frequency of hypotension and bradycardia were not influenced by prior anthracycline therapy.

Significant cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent paclitaxel occurred in approximately 1% of all patients. These events included syncope, rhythm abnormalities, hypertension, and venous thrombosis. One of the patients with syncope treated with paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2over 24 hours had progressive hypotension and died. The arrhythmias included asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, and complete AV block requiring pacemaker placement. Among patients with NSCLC treated with paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin in the Phase 3 study, significant cardiovascular events occurred in 12 to 13%. This apparent increase in cardiovascular events is possibly due to an increase in cardiovascular risk factors in patients with lung cancer.

### The burden of premature ventricular contractions predicts adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women without structural heart disease: a prospective cohort study [^112zUzyD]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3 Predictors of fetal and neonatal outcomes

The baseline characteristics of the study cohort suggested that the average burden of PVCs was related to adverse outcomes, so the burden of PVCs was further divided into low (< 33rd percentile), middle (33rd–67th percentile) and high groups (> 67th percentile) according to the percentile of the average PVC burden (Figure 3). The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the high‐burden PVC group than in the low and middle group.

FIGURE 3
Incidence of adverse fetal events in low premature ventricular contraction (PVC) burden (low), medium PVC burden (medium) and high PVC burden group (high). low PVC burden: < The 33rd percentile (< 1.69%), medium PVC burden: The 33rd percentile–the 67th percentile (1.69%–4.77%), high PVC burden: > The 67th percentile (> 4.77%), * indicates p < .05

Univariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the LVEF, heart rate, bigeminy and burden of PVCs were associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs. Variables which were statistically significant in univariate analysis were further analyzed in multivariate logistic regression analysis; however, statistical significance was only evident for PVC burden in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.11–1.61], p < .05, Table 2).

### Usefulness of the intravenous flecainide challenge test before oral flecainide treatment in a patient with Andersen-Tawil syndrome [^116T8qSU]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is an inherited disorder characterised by the triad of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), periodic paralysis and dysmorphic features. A 31-year-old woman diagnosed with ATS caused by a KCNJ2 mutation (p.R228ins) was urgently admitted to our hospital following an episode of syncope during exercise. Electrocardiography revealed frequent premature ventricular complexes and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (VTs) with pleomorphic QRS patterns. During the intravenous flecainide test (30mg), the frequent VAs were inhibited completely. After oral flecainide (100mg) was started, VAs, except for a brief bigeminy, were suppressed during the exercise test. On 24-hour Holter recordings, the VAs decreased from 50133 to 13363 beats/day (-73%). Sustained VT and syncope were not observed during a 3-year follow-up period. Intravenous flecainide challenge test may be useful in predicting the efficacy of oral flecainide treatment for patients with ATS.

ZASP/LDB3 — genetic associations, phenotypes, and mechanisms: In dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), variants in ZASP/LDB3 have been linked to arrhythmias and conduction disease, with the initial series "identifying 6 (6%) of 100 probands screened". Reported cases include "2 families and 4 sporadic cases", and "Of the 9 familial and sporadic patients affected, 3 had early-onset conduction system abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia, second-degree AV block, PVCs, VT, intraventricular conduction delay, ventricular bigeminy, and LBBB". In one family, there were "6 affected members who developed DCM between 50 and 69 years of age… 3 of whom died suddenly". Mechanistic data for ZASP-D117N show that "ZASP1-D117N can cause loss of function of Na1.5 in human cell lines, and in neonatal cardiomyocytes"; modeling indicates "the extent of functional disturbances of Na1.5 caused by ZASP-D117N is sufficient to delay cardiac conduction in human hearts"; and the Z-disc complex is required because "the interaction between ZASP and Na1.5 requires preservation of the Z-disc protein complex", while "the modification of Na1.5 by ZASP-D117N occurs without significant disruption of Z-line structures in cardiomyocytes". Clinically, "patients who carry ZASP-D117N may develop arrhythmias even before manifesting HF symptoms", and "The loss of function of Na1.5 by ZASP-D117N appeared to be largely responsible for the conduction delay". Broader phenotypes are reported, as "a pathologic variant in ZASP/LDB3 was associated with ARVC", with a proband who had "sustained VT that required electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm" and electrocardiographic "complete right bundle branch block (RBBB), with inverted and flat T waves".

### Strong modulation of ectopic focus as a mechanism of repetitive interpolated ventricular bigeminy with heart rate doubling [^1158y8FW]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Repetitive interpolated ventricular bigeminy (RIVB) can introduce a doubling of the ventricular rate.

Objective

To clarify the mechanism of RIVB, we hypothesized that it was introduced by a strong modulation of the ventricular automatic focus.

Methods

RIVB, defined as more than 7 bigeminy events, was detected by instantaneous heart rate and bigeminy interval (BI) tachograms in 1450 successive patients with frequent ventricular premature contractions (≥ 3000 per day). Postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval curves were plotted to determine the degree of modulation. Mean sinus cycle length bigeminy interval curves were plotted for selection. RIVB was simulated by using a computer-based parasystole model.

Results

RIVB was observed in 7 patients (age 60 ± 16 years; 2 men and 5 women) with a heart rate of 58.2 ± 6.5 beats/min during a rest period both during the day and at night. The tachograms disclosed the onset of the RIVB with a doubled ventricular rate to 112.3 ± 8.5 beats/min. On the postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval curves, compensatory bigeminy and interpolated bigeminy constituted overlapping regression lines with slopes close to 1.00 and RIVB was located in the lower left portion. RIVB lasting for up to 3 hours was quickly detected by mean sinus cycle length bigeminy interval curve. The PQ interval immediately after RIVB was prolonged in comparison with baseline (0.18 ± 0.02 to 0.21 ± 0.02 seconds; P < .001). The simulation was able to reproduce RIVB faithfully at a slow heart rate.

Conclusions

Our findings support the hypothesis that RIVB was introduced by strongly modulated ventricular pacemaker accelerated by an intervening normal QRS.

### Transient cardiac effects in a child with acute cholinergic syndrome due to rivastigmine poisoning [^1122USxA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We report a case of rivastigmine poisoning resulting in a full cholinergic syndrome with nicotinic, muscarinic, and central effects requiring supportive or intensive care in a pediatric patient.

Case Report

A 3-year-old girl was admitted to the Emergency Department suspected of having ingested one or two pills of rivastigmine. The child was hyporeactive, with symptoms of altered mental status, sialorrhea, sweating, and diarrhea. Subsequently, she started showing signs of respiratory failure, severe tracheobronchial involvement, and gastric and abdominal distension. An electrocardiogram recorded frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats with bigeminy and trigeminy. Long-term follow-up showed a transient dysrhythmia.

Conclusion

Poisoning with rivastigmine can be a life-threatening condition. Timely identification and appropriate management of the toxic effects of this drug are essential and often life-saving. This is particularly true in cases of cholinergic syndrome subsequent to drug poisoning. Patients with cholinergic syndrome should also be assessed for possible cardiac complications such as dysrhythmias. The main factors predisposing to the development of such complications are autonomic disorder, hypoxemia, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance.

### Electromechanical reciprocity and arrhythmogenesis in long-QT syndrome and beyond [^117Mv11E]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Electromechanical reciprocity and arrhythmogenesis

Spatiotemporal dispersion of electromechanical interactions renders the heart vulnerable to arrhythmia formation through various mechanisms (Graphical Abstract, Figure 3).

First, the presence of a negative EMW, as in severe LQTS, implies that the heart is subjected to deformation, by volume loading during the rapid filling phase, when repolarization of the ventricles is still ongoing (Figure 3C). This creates a 'sensitized' electromechanical substrate, in which inadvertent electrical or mechanical stimuli such as local afterdepolarizations, aftercontractions, or edging dyssynchrony can trigger abnormal impulses. Indeed, in an experimental setup of isolated blood-perfused canine hearts, the amplitude of stretch-induced monophasic action potential (MAP) afterdepolarizations correlated significantly, within limits, with the rise in LV volume. From that same study, transient clamping of the proximal aorta of in situ hearts led to a LV-pressure rise followed by the appearance of MAP afterdepolarizations and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), the latter often in a pattern of bigeminy. Depending on the timing and magnitude of LV volume or pressure changes, resultant mechano-electric feedback can induce afterdepolarizations, exaggerate repolarization dispersion, and generate ventricular ectopy. Differences in response may depend on variable mechanosensitivity among the myocardial regions. Also, acute changes in preload and mechanical stress by intravenous bolus applications prolonged QTc in both control- and drug-induced LQT2 rabbits, but with larger effects in the latter, implying a higher mechanosensitivity in LQTS. How global EMW negativity correlates with regional electromechanical reciprocity is currently unknown and requires further in-depth studies. In whole-heart Langendorff experiments, the extent of dispersion of APD correlated with the degree of contraction/relaxation heterogeneities, suggesting an impact of electromechanical reciprocity on the regional level. Ultrasound-based electromechanical wave imagingor patient-specific characterization of electromechanical disease substrates through combined clinical and in silico modellingmay hold promise for the identification of the individual components underlying electromechanical reciprocity. Future developments facilitating non-invasive high-resolution electromechanical mapping may provide novel mechanistic insights and improve patient-specific risk prediction. From experimental studies on drug-induced LQTS, it has become clear that local aftercontractions and mechanical dyssynchrony are strongly associated with PVCs and TdP initiation (Figure 3A). Left ventricular aftercontractions can occur in the absence of a direct electrical trigger and, in fact, precede concurrent MAP after-depolarizations by tens of milliseconds. Amplitudes with substantial impact, occasionally exceeding 25 mmHg, have been demonstrated, and these mounted in the final beats before TdP onset. Electrocardiogram changes, with T1T2 or TU waves, appeared as electrical footprints of these aftercontractions (Figure 3A and D). Whether aftercontractions are also related to arrhythmogenesis in human congenital LQTS is still unclear, but based on case studies with pressure and TDI recordings their presence prior to arrhythmia onset is suspected (Figure 3B and Table 1). Moreover, echocardiographic post-systolic shortenings, which may be related to aftercontractions, have been observed in symptomatic LQTS patients at rest (Graphical Abstract, right lower quadrant). Whether the site(s) of origin of aftercontractions co-localize with regional mechanical dyssynchrony and/or sites of afterdepolarizations/abnormal impulse formation is currently unknown. Our preliminary results on patients with gene mutations in KCNJ2, however, point in that direction. In theory, aftercontractions may impact directly on adjacent myocardium or Purkinje fibres via regional stretching, and remotely through mechanical tethering(Figure 3C). Stretch imposed on cardiac Purkinje fibres increases their conduction velocity, without affecting resting membrane potential or APD, and can also induce subthreshold after-depolarizations, PVCs, and ventricular tachycardia.

### Ventricular bigeminy following a cobra envenomation [^111ahMwM]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Envenoming by some species of cobras (Naja species) may include cardiotoxic effects including various dysrhythmias. However, dysrhythmias leading specifically to ventricular bigeminy have not been previously documented. We report a case of cardiotoxicity and the development of ventricular bigeminy following a cobra envenomation.

Case Details

The patient was a 23-year-old man who presented to an emergency department following an alleged cobra bite. There was transient episode of nausea, vomiting, hypotension and tachycardia. The ECG showed infrequent ventricular ectopics that progressed to ventricular bigeminy and persisted even after the vital signs normalized. Complete resolution and resumption of normal sinus rhythm occurred following an empirical administration of monovalent antivenom against Naja kaouthia venom. The patient was discharged after 24 hours of uneventful observation.

Discussion

The patient's concomitant local effects, episodic cardiovascular instability and evolution of ventricular bigeminy support the likelihood of a venom-induced disease. Ventricular bigeminy can develop following a cobra envenomation. Thorough clinical evaluation, close serial observation of vital signs and early continuous cardiac monitoring are important in Naja spp. bites.

Metabolic and inflammatory conditions — scope of evidence is outlined as follows: Although these disorders are important causes of life‑threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the occurrence of VT/SCD is relatively rare with few trial data to guide management; data on prevention are even more sparse, all recommendations in this section therefore have Level of Evidence B or C, and acute emergencies should be managed conventionally.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 ventricular arrhythmias — symptoms and hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia note that palpitations or a perception of cardiac rhythm irregularity may be caused by the whole spectrum of arrhythmias and can also occur without arrhythmia; patients with ventricular tachycardia may present with paroxysmal dyspnea or chest pain related to hemodynamic consequences; presyncope is a vague term, poorly defined and not specific, and ventricular tachycardia may cause undiagnosed syncope especially with structural heart disease; patients with poor ventricular function and inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation have a high incidence of subsequent appropriate therapies when implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and similar patients may be at risk of sudden cardiac death; very rapid ventricular tachycardia such as torsades de pointes with repolarization syndromes will typically present with syncope or seizure rather than palpitations; in hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, patients may be asymptomatic but more often sense rapid heart beating with dyspnea or chest discomfort, stability relates to tachycardia rate, retrograde conduction, ventricular function and peripheral compensatory mechanisms, stable presentations do not suggest absence of heart disease and can occur with very poor left ventricular function, and even patients with poor ventricular function may not notice palpitations during ventricular tachycardia.

### Arrhythmogenic manifestations of Chagas disease: perspectives from the bench to bedside [^112sdmkR]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

LINKING THE EXPERIMENTAL/CELLULAR DATA TO THE ARRHYTHMOGENIC MANIFESTATIONS OF CCM: FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE

The full understanding of disease pathogenesis ideally requires a comprehensive knowledge of the molecular changes at the cellular scale, which are responsible for the observed organ-scale remodeling and, ultimately, lead to clinical manifestations. Unfortunately, at this point, we can only propose some general cellular mechanisms potentially related to cardiac arrhythmias in humans. To date, this knowledge is mostly based on experimental models of CD or extrapolation of data from other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies.

After T. cruzi infection, CCM takes several years to develop and to express its overt clinical manifestations. The range of arrhythmogenic clinical manifestations varies widely but can be classified as conduction system abnormalities (ie, sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular conduction derangements) and ventricular arrhythmias (ie, isolated premature ventricular contractions, bigeminy, couplets, nonsustained VT, and, finally, VT and ventricular fibrillation).

Myocardial fibrosis, a most striking and peculiar hallmark of CCM, results from multiple diverse mechanisms, including inflammation directly linked to the tissue parasite persistence and to immune-mediated injury, myocytolytic necrosis induced by ischemia due to microvascular disturbances and, less importantly, apoptosis. Because it is multifactorial and diffuse, the essential triad of inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis described in experimental models of T. cruzi infection, as well as in human materials obtained from endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy studies, manifests initially as a focal microscopic process that ultimately is coalescent and assumes the form of an organ-scale macroanatomic disorder.

Among others, 2 major remodeling consequences of myocardial fibrosis in CCM result from early contractile mechanical dysfunction that affects both the diastolic and the systolic ventricular performance, and, no less conspicuously, the electrical properties of the whole heart, thereby causing various types of arrhythmia. Moreover, extensive ventricular areas exhibit myocardial fibrosis intermingled with abnormally functioning ischemic but still viable fibers. Of note, contractile disturbances have been reported using more sophisticated methods such as speckle-tracking echocardiography in humans with the indeterminate form of CD, even before a significant amount of coalescent fibrosis can be detected by the method of cardiac magnetic resonance. Such heterogeneous environments of dispersed electrical conduction properties are key phenomena, leading to focally abnormal patterns of refractoriness that cause unidirectional blocks and reentry circuits, which are the basic substrates for VT and ventricular fibrillation.

### Electrophysiologic features of fetal ventricular aneurysms and diverticula [^111PDfFn]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital ventricular wall defects are very rare and include congenital ventricular aneurysms (CVAs) and diverticula (CVDs).

Method

We report a series of five fetuses: three with CVAs and two with CVDs referred due to fetal arrhythmia. In addition to routine fetal echocardiography, fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) was used. The literature in CVA and CVD is reviewed.

Results

Incessant premature ventricular contractions (PVC), mainly bigeminy and trigeminy were found in three fetuses with CVAs and in one with CVD, who also had ventricular couplets. The other fetus with CVD, referred because of PVCs, had only sinus tachycardia. ST elevation was noted in two. Fetal movement had a variable impact on PVCs. Postnatal evaluation demonstrated two persistent left ventricular aneurysms and one persistent right CVD; one CVD resolved at 35-week gestation. Two neonates had incessant PVCs. Both arrhythmias resolved spontaneously while being treated with propranolol.

Conclusion

FMCG is complementary to echocardiographic imaging. In fetuses with left ventricular wall defects, additional electrophysiological diagnosis can be made by fMCG, including the complexity of ventricular ectopy, arrhythmic response to fetal movement, presence of ST-T wave abnormalities, and atrial amplitude increases. Prenatal risk factor assessment using fMCG can additionally support post-natal treatment and follow-up.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — exercise association and cardiomyopathy risk are described as follows: PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. Very frequent PVCs, > 1000 to 20000 a day, can be associated with depressed left ventricular (LV) function in some patients that is reversible with control of the PVCs and has been referred to as PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and very rarely idiopathic PVCs from the outflow tract may trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease.

### Implantable defibrillators in primary prevention of genetic arrhythmias. A shocking choice? [^116XbHyU]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Many previously unexplained life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young individuals are now recognized to be genetic in nature and are ascribed to a growing number of distinct inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and short QT syndrome. Because of their lower frequency compared to coronary disease, risk factors for SCD are not very precise in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. As randomized studies are generally non-feasible and may even be ethically unjustifiable, especially in the presence of effective therapies, the risk assessment of malignant arrhythmic events such as SCD, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions, or ICD therapy on fast VT/VF to guide ICD implantation is based on observational data and expert consensus. In this document, we review risk factors for SCD and indications for ICD implantation and additional therapies. What emerges is that, allowing for some important differences between cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, there is a growing and disquieting trend to create, and then use, semi-automated systems (risk scores, risk calculators, and, to some extent, even guidelines) which then dictate therapeutic choices. Their common denominator is a tendency to favour ICD implantation, sometime with reason, sometime without it. This contrasts with the time-honoured approach of selecting, among the available therapies, the best option (ICDs included) based on the clinical judgement for the specific patient and after having assessed the protection provided by optimal medical treatment.

This fetus had both LQT1 and LQT2. The fetus required β‐blocker therapy pre‐ and postnatally, and a pacemaker and left stellate ganglionectomy after delivery. VT indicates ventricular tachycardia. C, Same fetus with periods of typical polymorphic torsades morphology. Black bar = 5 s. D, Same fetus, same run, showing the monomorphic‐appearing VT. Neither form of VT was recognized before fMCG, largely because of the relatively slow rate (163 beats/min), which was thought to be sinus rhythm. Both forms of VT responded in utero to maternal high‐dose propranolol therapy at 320 mg/d. AV indicates atrioventricular; LQT ‐ Long QT; TWA, T wave alternans; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^115ktvuH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: terminology, mechanism, diagnosis, and emergency therapy [^115D6cnv]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.

### Left ventricular dyssynchrony predicts the cardiomyopathy associated with premature ventricular contractions [^114Rc9PD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy associated with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) remains unclear.

Objectives

This study prospectively explored cardiomyopathy development in a swine model of paced ectopic beats.

Methods

A total of 35 swine underwent pacemaker implantation. A group exposed to paced bigeminy from the right ventricular apex (RVA) for 14 weeks (RVA PVC) (n = 10) were compared with a group exposed to regular pacing from the RVA at 140 beats/min (RV-140) (n = 5) and a control group (n = 5). To test the role of ectopic beat dyssynchrony, further groups were exposed for 12 weeks to bigeminy from the right ventricular free wall (RVFW PVC) (n = 5), the left ventricular epicardium (LV Epi PVC) (n = 5) or the right atrium (premature atrial complex) (n = 5).

Results

After 14 weeks, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in the RVA PVC group than in the RV-140 or control groups (p < 0.05). LVEF declined significantly in the LV Epi PVC (65.2 ± 2.4% to 39.7 ± 3.0%; p < 0.01) and RVFW PVC (66.1 ± 2.6% to 48.6 ± 2.7%; p < 0.01) groups, with final LVEF significantly lower and ventricular fibrosis significantly higher in the LV Epi PVC group compared with all others (p < 0.05). Protein levels of pRyR2, NCX-1, CaMKII-α, and PLN were up-regulated and levels of SERCA2a were down-regulated in the LV Epi PVC group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Longer ectopic beat QRS duration and greater LV dyssynchrony were significantly associated with larger declines in LV systolic function.

Conclusions

In a swine model of paced ectopic beats, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is phenotypically distinct from a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy severity is strongly associated with severity of the hemodynamic derangement associated with the paced ectopic beats, particularly the extent of LV dyssynchrony.

### Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia: ping pong in the his-purkinje system [^112sZCjA]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity. Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right ventricle, respectively.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple "ping pong" model of reciprocating bigeminy to explain BVT.

Methods

We constructed a two-dimensional anatomic model of the rabbit ventricles with a simplified His-Purkinje system, in which different sites in the His-Purkinje system had different heart rate thresholds for DAD-induced bigeminy.

Results

When the heart rate exceeded the threshold for bigeminy at the first site in the His-Purkinje system, ventricular bigeminy developed, causing the heart rate to accelerate and exceed the threshold for bigeminy at the second site. Thus, the triggered beat from the first site induced a triggered beat from the second site. The triggered beat from the second site next reciprocated by inducing a triggered beat from the first site, and so forth. Bigeminy from two sites produced BVT, and that from three or more sites produced polymorphic VT.

Conclusion

This "ping pong" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^114nYwaD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 ventricular arrhythmias — clinical presentation categories and individualized approach are outlined as follows: ventricular arrhythmias can occur with or without a cardiac disorder, presentations overlap with underlying heart disease, and prognosis and management are individualized by symptom burden and disease severity; categories include asymptomatic individuals with or without electrocardiographic abnormalities, persons with symptoms potentially attributable to ventricular arrhythmias (palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, syncope and presyncope), ventricular tachycardia that is hemodynamically stable or not hemodynamically stable, and cardiac arrest (asystolic [sinus arrest, atrioventricular block], ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, pulseless electrical activity).

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^1139zC9w]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior algorithm development

The ECG interpretation algorithm is a hybrid machine learning model developed separately from and prior to the present study using a different patient cohort. It was originally trained on approximately 3 700 000 annotated single-lead ECGs of US adult patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFIB) monitored at home between 2015 and 2018 (RhythmAnalytics, Biofourmis). The data were captured via Holter monitor at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Without manual preprocessing, the model was trained to autonomously identify AFIB, pause, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, ventricular bigeminy, ventricular trigeminy and normal sinus rhythm (figure 2). The distribution of arrhythmias in the training set and the model's performance against the training data set are shown in online supplemental tables S1 and S2.

Figure 2
Example ECGs demonstrating arrhythmias. (A) Atrial fibrillation. (B) Sinus bradycardia. (C) Normal sinus rhythm. (D) Pause. (E) Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. (F) Sinus tachycardia. (G) Ventricular bigeminy. (H) Ventricular trigeminy.

The hybrid machine learning model receives input from the unfiltered signal obtained from the single-lead ECG (online supplemental figure S1 and table S3). This signal passes through a 0.5–40 Hz band pass filterand amplitude ratio thresholding to detect and remove artefacts. This is then further filteredto remove contributions from baseline wandering, power line interference, electromyographic (EMG) and motion artefact interference. This filtration is all used to reduce the noise in the ECG signal. The filtered signal is passed to modules that output the peak of the p, q, r, s and t as well as the morphological features for each beat.

### Sudden cardiac death prediction and prevention: report from a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Heart Rhythm Society workshop [^114BVrrr]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Electrocardiographic imaging and structural reconstructions for sudden cardiac death (SCD) prediction — "a new class of integrative model" is described that can be "constructed on reconstructions of cardiac structure from histology or structural imaging modalities", with "3-dimensional reconstructions of sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes" and "image-based reconstructions of the heart and mechanical association with infarction or heart failure". The "electrocardiographic imaging technique" has "made a major foray into clinical applications", having "imaged noninvasively atrial repolarization, ventricular bigeminy, and ablation of accessory pathways", and the authors suggest functional imaging could "enhance prediction of those at risk of SCD".

2.3 Definitions of arrhythmias

The ICM programming was standardized. VT detection was defined as 160 bpm during ≥ 8 intervals with high electrogram (EGM) priority, and the discriminator "sudden onset" was activated (onset delta 18%), and a bigeminy qualifier was programmed off. A potential AF episode was recorded based on ≥ 2 min duration (the shortest programmable duration). Bradycardia was recorded if the rate was ≤ 40 bpm or there was a pause ≥ 3.0 s. Patient‐activated recordings for symptoms had a high EGM priority and were set to record 6 min of pre‐trigger and 1 min of post‐trigger rhythms, with the first eight EGMs stored in memory. The maximal ventricular sensitivity was typically 0.15 mV but could be adjusted as necessary if R waves were low. The threshold start was programmed at 75%, sense refractory period 250 ms, and decay delay 60 ms.

2.4 Follow‐up

All participants completed the study with 18 months follow‐up as predefined. Technical support was sometimes requested when the patient wanted to change phones and reinstallation of the application was necessary. In a few patients, the study period had to be prolonged due to the temporary device disconnection. After the study period, all devices were explanted except in three cases, in which the clinician took over the continued monitoring.

2.5 Data analyses

All episodes were scrutinized by an expert review and categorized into atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ectopic atrial tachycardia), ventricular tachycardia (sustained VT and NSVT), sinoatrial block/arrest, and atrioventricular block (second or third degree). The differentiation between supraventricular arrhythmias and VT were based on general principles such as rate, regularity, sudden onset, and change in QRS morphology compared to a normal rhythm.

2.6 Statistical analyses

Data were described as numbers (n), percentages, ranges, percentiles, means, and standard deviations (SDs). To analyze the association between variables and outcomes, the χ 2 test and t test were employed, as appropriate. A two‐sided p ‐value < .05 was considered significant, whereas associations with p ‐values between.05 and.10 were considered a tendency. Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to describe the time from implant to the outcome, AF, and NSVT, respectively. For statistical analyses, SPSS version 25 (IBM) was used.

### Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia in a young man: a case report [^113311M8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Ventricular ectopics can potentially lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF). A case of idiopathic VF that began as ventricular bigeminy is presented. A 30-year-old man lost consciousness transiently while driving but made a complete recovery soon after. He was pale and sweaty at the onset of the event. There was neither a history of ill health nor a family history of sudden cardiac death. He was asymptomatic on arrival at the emergency department (ED) with sinus tachycardia. Two hours later ventricular bigeminy was observed. This subtle presentation did not qualify him for being high risk according to the American College of Physician's recommendations or the San Francisco syncope rule, which almost led to his discharge from the ED. Despite this, he was admitted for observation. The patient had four VF arrests overnight, which were eventually terminated by emergency radiofrequency ablation. Upon further investigation, he was found to be normal on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiogram and 24-h Holter monitoring. His serum biochemistry was normal, ruling out electrolyte disturbances. He eventually received an implantable cardioverter and remained free of recurrences in the subsequent months. This case serves as a reminder not to ignore ventricular ectopics or bigeminy.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^114vtz1N]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation of Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome is characterized by a triad of episodic flaccid muscle weakness (periodic paralysis), cardiac abnormalities (ventricular arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval, and prominent U waves), and distinctive skeletal features (low‐set ears, ocular hypertelorism, small mandible, fifth‐digit clinodactyly, syndactyly, short stature, scoliosis, and a broad forehead). 16, 24 This characteristic triad is present in 58–78% of patients with KCNJ2 mutations. 25, 26 Those affected typically present in the first or second decade with either cardiac symptoms (palpitations and/or syncope) or weakness that occurs spontaneously following prolonged rest or following rest after exertion. Permanent weakness is common. Attacks of muscle weakness can be associated with high, low or normal serum potassium levels. 16

Andersen‐Tawil syndrome is a potentially fatal condition. 27, 28, 29 In patients with the KCNJ2 gene mutation, ventricular arrhythmias are common (Table 1). 27, 28, 29 Cardiac manifestations of Andersen‐Tawil syndrome include premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), complex ventricular ectopy (bigeminy, consecutive PVCs, or multifocal PVCs), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and bidirectional VT. 29 Despite the common occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, syncope or cardiac arrest is rare. 27, 30 Early identification and diagnosis of these patients is important for treatment optimization.

### Conduction slowing contributes to spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias in intrinsically active murine RyR2-P2328S hearts [^1141hQgE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The familial condition catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is characterized by episodic bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), and ventricular fibrillation following adrenergic challenge. It is associated with mutations involving the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2).

Methods and Results

We explored for a slowing of myocardial conduction that could potentially result in a substrate for the spontaneous arrhythmogenesis that was observed following introduction of isoproterenol and caffeine in intrinsically beating murine RyR2-P2328S hearts. Such pharmacological challenge increased the number of arrhythmic episodes in electrocardiographic recordings from intact anesthetized mice, with the greatest effects in the homozygote RyR2(S/S). Arrhythmias took the form of bigeminy, BVT, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and PVT, as found in human CPVT. Ventricular epicardial conduction velocities (CVs) measured using multielectrode array recordings and maximum action potential upstroke rates, (dV/dt)(max), measured using intracellular microelectrodes were indistinguishable in untreated wild-type (WT) and RyR2(S/S). Pharmacological challenge of RyR2(S/S), but not WT hearts, then reduced CV and (dV/dt)(max) and also revealed a strongly arrhythmic phenotype. There was no evidence of gross structural or fibrotic changes in either RyR2(+/S) or RyR2(S/S) hearts on light microscopy.

Conclusions

We associate altered ventricular myocardial CV potentially resulting in arrhythmogenic substrate with arrhythmic properties associated with genetic RyR2 alterations for the first time.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^112HejQ2]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Torsade de pointes (TdP) risk factors in hospitalized patients — Risk is greater in women than men by approximately 2-fold and is more common in patients older than 65 years; predisposition has been associated with underlying heart disease of multiple origins. Hypokalemia is a well-established predisposing risk factor for TdP, as is hypomagnesemia, whereas hypocalcemia has been associated with TdP only in rare cases. The association of diuretic use with in-hospital TdP may be explained by correlations with congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, and some diuretics directly block potassium currents and may therefore reduce repolarization reserve. Intravenous potassium has been shown to reverse the QT-prolonging effects of quinidine in humans, but the value of acute potassium repletion is less well documented than that of intravenous magnesium for the acute treatment of drug-induced TdP; normal levels of both potassium and magnesium should be maintained aggressively in hospitalized patients at risk. Bradycardia is an additional important risk factor, and prolonged ventricular cycle length can present as simple sinus bradycardia or complete atrioventricular block; premature beats that lead to short-long-short cycles may foster development of TdP, whereas isoproterenol infusion or overdrive pacing can suppress TdP in these circumstances. The risk for TdP appears to be decreased when the underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation unless there is also complete heart block. No quantitative multivariate risk index exists for hospital-based prediction, and risk may be greatest when multiple recognizable factors cluster; for example, an elderly woman with diuretic-treated heart failure taking more than 1 potentially QT-prolonging drug with sinus bradycardia and occasional ventricular bigeminy would be a good candidate for ECG/QT monitoring and electrolyte repletion.

### Distinct effects of mitochondrial Na / caExchanger inhibition and caUniporter activation on caSparks and arrhythmogenesis in diabetic rats [^1155YTrH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Inhibition But NotActivation Reduces Arrhythmogenesis inRats

In concurrence with the contrasting effects of MCU activation and mitoNCX inhibition on Ca 2+ sparks, SB‐202190 resulted in higher propensity for Ca 2+ waves while CGP‐37157 had no significant effect (Figure 6A through 6C). Neither agent affected the SR Ca 2+ load (Figure S6). To assess how mitoNCX inhibition and MCU activation affect electrical activity of the heart in vivo, we assessed the effect of CGP‐37157 and SB‐202190 on arrhythmias induced by injection of caffeine and dobutamine, a challenge previously found to trigger ventricular tachycardia and bigeminy in rats. In these experiments, HIP rats received two, 1 hour apart, injections with DMSO (vehicle), followed by the caffeine/dobutamine challenge and surface ECG recording for 40 minutes. Measurements were repeated a week later in the same rats with DMSO replaced by either CGP‐37157 or SB‐202190. All DMSO‐injected HIP rats displayed multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and bigeminy (Figure 6D), each episode lasting from 1 to 2 seconds up to several minutes. CGP‐37157 prevented the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 3 out of 9 HIP rats (2 rats did not show any arrhythmic event after CGP‐37157) and significantly reduced the total duration of arrhythmic episodes (Figure 6E). In contrast, SB‐202190 had no significant effect on arrhythmogenesis (Figure 6F).

### Electrical management of heart failure: from pathophysiology to treatment [^116mK92N]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contractions are the most frequent ventricular arrhythmia and commonly associated with HF, ventricular arrhythmias, and SCD. Frequent PVCs are recognized as a reversible cause of LV systolic dysfunction referred to as 'PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy' (PVC-CM), where PVC suppression will improve and even normalize LV function. The prevalence of PVC-CM is estimated between 10 and 29% in patients with frequent PVCs (> 5–10%). While PVC burden is the most consistent predictor of PVC-M, various factors, including genetics, comorbidities, cardiac phenotype, or PVC features and length of exposure, play a role in the susceptibility or resilience to develop PVC-CM. In addition, PVCs with a longer QRS duration and epicardial location are more frequently associated with PVC-CM, supporting the role of LV dyssynchrony in PVC-CM (Table 2 and Figure 1).

Table 2
Clinical and premature ventricular contraction features to identify premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy can present with or without fatigue, HF symptoms, syncope, and SCD. Frequently, patients are referred for bradycardia due to bigeminy where heart rate is underestimated (i.e. pseudo-bradycardia) due to the lack of pulse pressure generated by PVC. The time to develop PVC-CM is unknown, but probably months or years of exposure to frequent PVCs are needed.

Premature ventricular contraction-mediated cardiomyopathy diagnosis should be suspected if PVC burden is > 5–10% and other causes of HF are excluded, and confirmed only if PVC suppression improves and even normalizes LV function. A major diagnosis challenge is when PVCs cannot be successfully eliminated. A frequent dilemma is to determine whether the PVCs are a bystander or the cause of CM. Some PVCs and clinical features (e.g. absence of scar) can assist to differentiate these two scenarios (Table 2).

### Implantable loop recorder monitoring for refining management of children with inherited arrhythmia syndromes [^1115u1Nq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 33 transmissions were labeled by patients as symptom episodes, including chest pain, syncope, dizziness, palpitations, nausea, and seizure. Of the 33 symptom events, 3 (10%) had an actionable tracing resulting in change of medication or device with the remaining 30 transmissions (90%) demonstrating sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia +/− premature ventricular contractions. Additionally, 42 automatic transmissions were received with 8 (19%) transmissions demonstrating actionable data, predominantly in the CPVT population. The remaining 34 automatic transmissions (81%) demonstrated sinus rhythm/sinus tachycardia and occasionally isolated premature ventricular contractions. Nine transmissions were identified as both symptom and automatic transmissions, with 1 of these transmissions (11%) yielding actionable data. Eighty‐eight routine transmissions were downloaded with no actionable data in those transmissions (Figure; Table S1).

The tracings shown were obtained from 4 different patients in the cohort. The tracing in (A) represents andownload from a patient with genotype‐positive catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

### Giant left ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a rare acute complication of radiofrequency catheter ablation for premature ventricular contraction [^112Pw7oL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm most often occurs after myocardial infarction and generally requires a surgical operation. It may also rarely occur in association with cardiac surgery, trauma, and endocarditis. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of radiofrequency catheter ablation, especially in the acute phase. Only two cases involving early complications have been reported. Dandamudi described a 2.4- × 2.4-cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm following premature ventricular contraction ablation of the endocardial portion of the left ventricular summit, and Gill described a small pseudoaneurysm after radiofrequency ablation of supraventricular tachycardia. Three cases involving late complications have also been reported. Mansour reported a case of a small left ventricular pseudoaneurysm near the mitral annulus as a late complication of low-energy direct current ablation. Koch also reported a late large 6.1-cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm following multiple endocardial and epicardial radiofrequency ablations for ventricular tachycardia. Auriau reported a 37- × 44-mm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm as a long-term complication of ablation of an accessory pathway. These cases reveal the rare life-threatening complications related to radiofrequency catheter ablation and the importance of prompt diagnosis for this potentially dangerous lesion.

The precise cause of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is unclear. There are reports that high temperature can lead to perforation of the myocardium. This serious complication might be prevented by decreasing the power and reducing the operative time. The thickness of the left ventricular wall is not uniform; the thinner parts of the wall (such as the left ventricular summit) are more easily penetrated. Improvements in catheter ablation techniques will also help to avoid the occurrence of this serious complication.

Clinicians should be alert to the potential risks to patients in the process of an effective treatment. Several suggestions for clinical doctors are as follows. First, as noted above, left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare potential serious complication of catheter ablation and should be given adequate attention. Second, cardiac rupture should be considered in patients with recurrent bloody pericardial effusion. Third, cardiac tamponade may also indicate the presence of a life-threatening complication. Finally, echocardiography plays an important role in the prompt diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. When symptoms are present, timely echocardiography is necessary, because this technique can promptly reveal effusion and lesions.

### Treatment of arrhythmias in… [^114CkpNy]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The term "ventricular bigeminy" refers to alternating normal sinus and premature ventricular complexes. Three or more successive premature ventricular complexes are arbitrarily defined as ventricular tachycardia. Premature ventricular complexes become more prevalent with increasing age and occur in association with a variety of stimuli. It is important to determine whether underlying structural heart disease is present and left ventricular function is impaired. Other common causes include electrolyte abnormalities, stimulants, and some medications. Attempts have been made to estimate the risk of chronic premature ventricular complexes based on their frequency and waveforms. Several studies 1, 2 have demonstrated an increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias with 10 or more ectopic impulses per hour or the presence of impulse salvos.

However, structural heart disease and poor left ventricular function are the key factors in determining whether treatment is warranted and what the prognosis may be. If patients with multiple premature ventricular complexes have severe, disabling symptoms, beta blockers are the safest initial choice. Referral to a cardiologist is indicated if beta-blocker therapy is not effective. In this situation, the next agents to be tried would be class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as flecainide and amiodarone, although radiofrequency ablation of an ectopic focus may also be an appropriate treatment. Patients with Structural Heart Disease The occurrence of premature ventricular complexes in patients with structural heart disease has been shown to significantly increase the risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality.

Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure are the major cardiac diseases associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with premature ventricular complexes. Ventricular Tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia refers to a rhythm originating from a ventricular ectopic focus at a rate greater than 100 beats per minute. The electrocardiogram shows a wide-complex tachycardia with no associated P waves. In patients with bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, or aberrant conduction, supraventricular tachycardia can resemble ventricular tachycardia. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with untreated ventricular tachycardia, any wide-complex tachycardia should be assumed to be ventricular tachycardia until proved otherwise. Physicians should keep in mind that patients with ventricular tachycardia can have minimal symptoms.

Adults: Cardiac: Therapeutic doses of digoxin may cause heart block in patients with pre-existing sinoatrial or AV conduction disorders; heart block can be avoided by adjusting the dose of digoxin. Prophylactic use of a cardiac pacemaker may be considered if the risk of heart block is considered unacceptable. High doses of digoxin may produce a variety of rhythm disturbances, such as first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation. Digoxin produces PR prolongation and ST segment depression which should not by themselves be considered digoxin toxicity. Cardiac toxicity can also occur at therapeutic doses in patients who have conditions which may alter their sensitivity to digoxin (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Gastrointestinal: Digoxin may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Rarely, the use of digoxin has been associated with abdominal pain, intestinal ischemia, and hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestines.

CNS: Digoxin can produce visual disturbances (blurred or yellow vision), headache, weakness, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and mental disturbances (such as anxiety, depression, delirium, and hallucination).

Table 2 — Definitions for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) terminology used in this consensus document state that clinical ventricular tachycardia (VT) is VT that has occurred spontaneously based on analysis of 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QRS morphology; idioventricular rhythm is three or more consecutive beats at a rate of up to 100 per minute and can be qualified as "accelerated" when the rate exceeds 40 bpm; nonsustained VT terminates spontaneously within 30 seconds, whereas sustained VT is continuous VT for 30 seconds or requires an intervention for termination; PVC burden is preferably reported as the percentage of beats of ventricular origin over a 24-hour recording; and VT storm is three or more separate episodes of sustained VT within 24 hours, each requiring termination by an intervention. VT morphology terms include monomorphic VT (a similar QRS configuration from beat to beat) and polymorphic VT (a continuously changing QRS configuration from beat to beat), while ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm on the surface ECG with undulations irregular in timing and morphology without discrete QRS complexes. Mechanistic descriptors include focal VT (a point source of earliest ventricular activation with automaticity, triggered activity, or microreentry) and scar-related reentry (arrhythmias arising after a region of myocardial scar, with large circuits commonly termed "macroreentry").

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) emphasizes that symptoms, particularly in patients with known or discovered structural or electrical heart disease, should prompt focused investigation; identifying precipitating factors and family history is important; and medication review is essential because drugs can provoke arrhythmias. The text states that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and some medications can induce a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF. Patients with bigeminy or trigeminy can present with effective bradycardia, an apical‑radial pulse deficit, and relative hypertension with a wide pulse pressure, and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to inaccurate estimation of heart rate. Physical findings that suggest structural heart disease include carotid bruits or diminished peripheral pulses (atherosclerotic disease associated with ischemic heart disease); jugular venous distention, rales, gallops, and peripheral edema (evidence of HF); cardiac murmurs such as those of aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (associated with HF and VA); and a midsystolic click indicating mitral valve prolapse that can be associated with VA. Many VA are asymptomatic and detected only on an ECG or telemetry, underscoring the need to search for evidence of underlying heart disease.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/ml although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase digoxin dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue digoxin for 1 to 2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

### Palpitations: evaluation in the primary care setting… [^115eMPB6]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

28 Isolated, monomorphic VPCs are more likely to be benign compared with frequent, consecutive, or multiform ventricular ectopy. 4 When evaluating a patient with VPCs, the first step is to determine whether there is underlying structural heart disease because mortality is increased in this group. 17 Patients in whom at least 25% of heartbeats are VPCs have an increased risk of VPC-induced cardiomyopathy. Patients with a decreased ejection fraction have VPCs more often than those with normal left ventricular function. SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA SVT may manifest as a narrow complex or wide complex tachycardia. 5, 6 It most often presents with recurrent, paroxysmal episodes that may increase in frequency and severity. 32 In the general population, the incidence of paroxysmal SVT is 35 per 100, 000 person-years.
18. Supraventricular premature complexes can be distinguished from VPCs when nonsinus atrial depolarizations are followed by narrow QRS complexes. Even when asymptomatic, they are associated with a significant increase in rates of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death. 33 Supraventricular complexes are not benign and are associated with a higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation. They are also associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and stroke, based on a 10-year prospective observational study of more than 63, 000 Japanese adults 40 to 79 years of age. 33 Beyond risk factor modification, however, no specific treatment is recommended for asymptomatic patients with atrial premature contractions who have no other apparent structural, functional, or electrical abnormality. 8 It may be life-threatening and should trigger immediate intervention and consultation with a cardiologist.

It is important to note that use of medications such as beta blockers is contraindicated in these patients because they may result in syncope and increase the risk of death. In one study of persons included in the International Long QT Syndrome Registry, those with a long QT interval who were subsequently prescribed a beta blocker had a 3. 6-fold increase in the risk of severe arrhythmic events. 19.

CM hydrocephalus — monitoring and temporizing measures: In an asymptomatic patient with CM who has radiologic evidence of hydrocephalus, medical treatment alone should be continued with serial imaging obtained every 3–6 months until stability has been determined. In the presence of typical symptoms that reflect increased intracranial pressure (ICP), placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is very likely to be necessary, and this may carry as high as a 12.5-fold increased mortality in patients with CM. Placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) should be considered as a temporizing measure to control elevated pressure; an EVD provides a means to measure ICP, obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for serial analysis, and drain CSF to decrease ICP, although it is unlikely that the typical patient with CM would achieve CSF sterility with an EVD. There are a variety of shunt systems including set pressure valves and adjustable valves, with no evidence in the literature to suggest superiority of one type of system over the other, and although some neurosurgeons are reluctant to perform shunting when the CSF is actively infected, there is no real evidence that expeditious shunting imposes undue risks and the dangerous effects of prolonged increased ICP greatly exceed the theoretical potential of an infectious nidus at the end of the catheter.

Ventricular tachycardia with normal or near-normal LVEF — device versus drug therapy: Recurrent sustained VT is usually treated by management of underlying causes and antiarrhythmic drugs, but the use of antiarrhythmic agents may predispose the patient to proarrhythmic complications that might pose significant threats to life. Increasingly, the ICD is being used effectively to avoid the relative ineffectiveness and adverse complications of pharmaceutical therapy; in monomorphic VT, antitachycardia pacing is often applied successfully without provocation of untoward symptoms, whereas polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may require shock therapy. Overall, the strategy of using devices to manage such arrhythmias appears to be clinically successful, although expensive.

Atrioventricular block classification and ECG interpretation — Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) occurs after gradual PR prolongation whereas Mobitz II does not; atrioventricular block with only 2:1 conduction cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II, making it important to elucidate the level of block. High‑grade, high‑degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted, and high‑degree atrioventricular block is generally considered intra‑ or infra‑Hisian and treated with pacing. Third‑degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no atrioventricular conduction, may be paroxysmal or persistent, and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful ECG evaluation is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm without consistent retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction, and atrial bigeminy with premature atrial contractions may mimic atrioventricular block due to normal conduction, delay, or blocked conduction.

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^1153CK6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CPVT should be considered in patients with a structurally normal heart and a normal resting ECG, presenting with dizziness, palpitations, fainting, seizure‐like episodes, or family history of juvenile sudden cardiac death during physical/emotional stress. During acute episodes, ECG presentations may exhibit 2 distinct types of polymorphic VT. The first type is the typical polymorphic VT with characteristic changing QRS morphology. The other subtype is bidirectional tachycardia characterized by 180‐degree rotation of the QRS complex between one beat and the other. It is important to distinguish normal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from those seen in patients with CPVT. The PVCs in CPVT are typically late coupled and can exhibit a right bundle branch block pattern with a superior axis or a left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. During exercise, the PVCs in patients with CPVT can be distinguished from normal heathy controls due to a variety of characteristics. These include a bigger number of PVCs that start appearing at high cardiac workload, left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis, bigeminy or trigeminy at peak stress, QRS > 120 milliseconds, coupling interval > 400 ms, or disappearance in the first minute of rest. Of those characteristics, the most sensitive and specific one is the left bundle branch block pattern with an inferior axis. This pattern suggests the presence of an RV outflow tract as an ectopic initiation site.

The primary diagnostic tool for CPVT is an exercise stress test. The test is done in a closely monitored environment and followed using a standard Bruce protocol. As the duration and intensity of the test increases, the beats can transition into a bigeminal or trigeminal pattern and may become a ventricular arrhythmia. A negative exercise stress test cannot rule out CPVT as it provokes a VT in around two thirds of patients only. In such cases, a novel "burst" exercise protocol may be used. The hypothesis is that short intense bursts of exercise cause an abrupt surge in heart rate, predisposing to higher risks of calcium dysregulation and arrhythmogenesis. In patients who cannot undergo exercise stress testing, a pharmacological stress test by epinephrine infusion is used. CPVT is diagnosed when the infusion triggers a polymorphic VT with > 10 PVCs per minute or the presence of new T‐wave alternations.

### Idiopathic malignant premature ventricular contractions [^117L638C]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in patients with structurally normal hearts was once considered a benign phenomenon. However, in susceptible patients, these "benign" or idiopathic PVCs may develop malignant potential and trigger ventricular fibrillation and result in sudden cardiac death. Alternatively, idiopathic PVCs can also induce cardiomyopathy. Clinical recognition of these entities can lead to effective targeted therapy. In the first instance, treatment consists of ablating the PVC source and implanting a defibrillator, whereas in the second scenario, ablating the PVC origin can normalize left ventricular function.

Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias

Epidemiological Features

The ventricular arrhythmias encountered in patients with CHD encompass ventricular ectopics, nonsustained, sustained monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (VT) and ventricular fibrillation. Isolated premature ventricular beats usually arise early after surgery and are well tolerated unless there is constant bigeminy. Early postoperative VT is rare and commonly arises in the setting of myocardial ischemia, which makes the arterial switch and the Ross procedure particularly risky. The incidence of late ventricular arrhythmias increases over time, reaching significant proportions in the adult population. The clinical manifestations range from palpitations to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Ventricular arrhythmias are reported to be the leading cause of SCD in patients with CHD with an estimated overall risk 25 to 100 times greater than in an age-matched control population. However, the reported incidence of sustained VT and SCD in adults with CHD remains low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2% per year.

Pathophysiological Mechanisms

The underlying mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias vary according to the CHD type as well as and the surgical procedure and therefore have an impact on their management. Monomorphic VT is most often macroreentrant and is uncommon in the absence of a ventricular scar. Indeed, the reentry circuit includes an isthmus of slow conduction bordered by unexcitable tissue like scars or patches. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common substrate for sustained monomorphic VT. As a matter of fact, four anatomic isthmuses have been identified. The first is bordered by the tricuspid annulus and a right ventricular outflow tract or free wall scar/patch; the second by the pulmonary annulus and a right ventricular outflow tract or free wall scar/patch, the third by the pulmonary annulus and the perimembranous VSD patch, and the fourth by a muscular VSD patch and the tricuspid annulus. Polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation are usually associated with more extensive myocardial injury such as hypertrophy, diffuse fibrosis, or ischemia. In CHD patients, systemic ventricular dysfunction seems to be the most important predictor of ventricular arrhythmias.

The electrocardiographic criteria of VT include a wide complex tachycardia with a different axis from that of sinus rhythm. Atrioventricular dissociation, fusion, and capture beats may help recognize ventricular arrhythmias. As patients with CHD often present ventricular conduction anomalies, it can be difficult to distinguish supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction from VT.

### Case report: hunting the hidden: surgical treatment of chronic silent thrombus in the left ventricle in a young alcoholic patient with myocardial bridging [^113hVN2X]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A silent left ventricular thrombus is dangerous. The current standard anticoagulation therapy was ineffective in our case or similar, and the outcome was poor.

Case Presentation

A 33-year-old man with a silent left ventricular thrombus was detected incidentally by transthoracic echocardiography. After admission, anti-coagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin therapy was carried out. The CAG revealed 70% systolic stenosis in the middle of the right coronary artery along with myocardial bridging. Unfortunately, an acute left temporal embolism emerged 5 days later, then the patient was transferred to the neurology department for further treatment. One month later, the patient underwent left ventricular thrombectomy, ventricular aneurysm resection, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was discharged uneventfully after surgery.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment should be a priority for patients with giant or hypermobile left ventricular thrombus or recurrent systemic emboli.

### Frequent ventricular ectopy after exercise as a predictor of death [^112N9eUf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Exercise-induced ventricular ectopy predicts an increased risk of death in population-based cohorts. We sought to examine in a clinical cohort the prognostic importance of ventricular ectopy immediately after exercise, when reactivation of parasympathetic activity occurs. We hypothesized that ventricular ectopy after exercise (i.e., during the recovery phase) would predict an increased risk of death better than ventricular ectopy during exercise.

Methods

We studied 29,244 patients (mean [± SD] age, 56 ± 11 years; 70 percent men) who had been referred for symptom-limited exercise testing without a history of heart failure, valve disease, or arrhythmia. Frequent ventricular ectopy was defined by the presence of seven or more ventricular premature beats per minute, ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy, ventricular couplets or triplets, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter, torsade de pointes, or ventricular fibrillation.

Results

Frequent ventricular ectopy occurred only during exercise in 945 patients (3 percent), only during recovery in 589 (2 percent), and during both exercise and recovery in 491 (2 percent). There were 1862 deaths during a mean of 5.3 years of follow-up. Frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise predicted an increased risk of death (five-year death rate, 9 percent, vs. 5 percent among patients without frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise; hazard ratio, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.1; P < 0.001), but frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery was a stronger predictor (11 percent vs. 5 percent; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 2.9; P < 0.001). After propensity matching for confounding variables, frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery predicted an increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9; P = 0.003), but frequent ventricular ectopy during exercise did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3; P = 0.53).

Conclusions

Frequent ventricular ectopy during recovery after exercise is a better predictor of an increased risk of death than ventricular ectopy occurring only during exercise.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG characteristics include the following: First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms and no true block, more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II; Mobitz I occurs after gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG shows group beating from "dropped" QRS complexes, while isolated 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted; high-degree block is generally intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing, and in unusual circumstances (at night with sinus slowing) a vagal etiology may be considered when the QRS is narrow. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is required, as a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may be absent with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm, and atrial bigeminy with repetitive premature atrial contractions can mimic atrioventricular block. Additionally, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, and will not respond to atropine but may improve with catecholamines.

Table 5 definitions — commonly used terms in ventricular arrhythmia care and sudden cardiac death — define ventricular tachycardia (VT) as a cardiac arrhythmia of ≥ 3 consecutive complexes originating in the ventricles at a rate > 100 bpm (cycle length: < 600 ms), with sustained VT defined as VT > 30 s or requiring termination due to hemodynamic compromise in < 30 s and nonsustained VT as ≥ 3 beats, terminating spontaneously; torsades de pointes is polymorphic VT that occurs in the setting of a long QT interval; ventricular flutter is a regular ventricular arrhythmia (VA) > 300 bpm (cycle length: 200 ms) with a sinusoidal, monomorphic appearance and no isoelectric interval between successive QRS complexes; ventricular fibrillation (VF) is rapid, grossly irregular electrical activity with marked variability in electrocardiographic waveform, with ventricular rate usually > 300 bpm (cycle length: < 200 ms); sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity such that the victim becomes unresponsive, with either persisting gasping respirations or absence of any respiratory movements, and no signs of circulation as manifest by the absence of a perceptible pulse; sudden cardiac death (SCD) is sudden and unexpected death occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms, or occurring in patients found dead within 24 h of being asymptomatic and presumably due to a cardiac arrhythmia or hemodynamic catastrophe; VT/VF storm refers to a state of cardiac electrical instability that is defined by ≥ 3 episodes of sustained VT, VF, or appropriate shocks from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) within 24 h; primary prevention ICD is ICD placement with the intention of preventing SCD in a patient who has not had sustained VT or SCA but who is at an increased risk for these events, whereas secondary prevention ICD is ICD placement in a patient with prior SCA, sustained VT, or syncope caused by VA; structural heart disease encompasses ischemic heart disease (IHD), all types of cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and adult congenital heart disease; and a cardiac channelopathy is an arrhythmogenic disease due to a genetic abnormality that results in dysfunction of a cardiac ion channel (eg, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT).

### The burden of premature ventricular contractions predicts adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women without structural heart disease: a prospective cohort study [^1138taUF]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) may increase during pregnancy, however, few studies have evaluated the relationship between PVCs and the pregnant outcomes.

Hypothesis

PVCs may increase the adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes in pregnant women.

Methods

Six thousand one hundred and forty-eight pregnant women were prospectively enrolled in our center between 2017 and 2019 in the study. The average PVC burden was determined by calculating the number of PVCs in total beats. Those who had a PVC burden > 0.5% were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of adverse fetal or neonatal events. The adverse outcomes were compared between the groups to assess the impact of PVCs on pregnancy.

Results

A total of 103 (1.68%) women with a PVC burden > 0.5% were recorded. Among them, 17 adverse events (12 cases) were documented, which was significantly higher than that among women without PVCs (11.65% vs. 2.93%, p < .01). The median PVC burden among pregnant women with PVCs was 2.84% (1.02%-6.1%). Furthermore, compared with that of the women without adverse events, the median PVC burden of women with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes was significantly higher (9.02% vs. 2.30%, p < .01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that not the LVEF, heart rate and bigeminy, but only the PVC burden was associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs (OR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.11–1.61], p < .01).

Conclusions

Frequent PVCs have adverse effects on pregnancy, and the PVC burden might be an important factor associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with PVCs.

### Adherence to thresholds: overdiagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy [^111wNevB]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Thresholds derived from quantification in imaging are increasingly used to define disease. This derivation is not an exact science. When one uses a threshold to define a disease, one does not clearly demarcate disease from normality because the threshold includes overlapping spectra of mild disease and normality. Thus, use of the threshold will mislabel normal individuals with disease. In this perspective, we will describe how the threshold has been derived for left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, the statistical biases in the design of studies used to derive the threshold, and the dangers of overdiagnosis when the threshold is used to rule out left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

### ACC / AATS / AHA / ASE / ASNC / HRS / SCAI / SCCT / SCMR / STS 2019 appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging in the assessment of cardiac structure and function in nonvalvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology appropriate use criteria task force, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, American Society of Echocardiography, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Heart Rhythm Society, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^111dNxmX]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging in nonvalvular heart disease — definitions of key clinical terms include pretest probability thresholds and arrhythmia criteria. Low pretest probability indicates < 10% probability of disease, moderate is 10% to 90%, and high is > 90% likelihood prior to testing. Ventricular premature contractions are occurring more frequently than 30 times per hour or occurring in a pattern of bigeminy, trigeminy, or runs of ventricular tachycardia, while atrial premature complexes are less than 30 times per hour or less than one per minute. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is a ventricular arrhythmia of 3 or more consecutive complexes but lasting < 30 seconds in duration at a rate > 100 bpm, and sustained ventricular tachycardia is lasting more than 30 seconds or requiring therapy because of hemodynamic compromise in < 30 seconds. Syncope is transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery (not lightheadedness or dizziness alone), presyncope is near loss of consciousness, and a patient is asymptomatic when he/she exhibits none of the typical symptoms. Heart failure is signs and symptoms explainable on the basis of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and the term clinical indication does not necessarily imply that testing is warranted; for some clinical indications, all modalities may be rated as Rarely Appropriate.

### Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: the cardiac arrest where epinephrine is contraindicated [^115tta9U]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

At 2 and 3 hours, she had further VF arrests receiving five and four DC shocks, respectively. She was given IV magnesium, amiodarone, and after her cardiac rhythm stabilized, she was started on an amiodarone infusion. She received no epinephrine during these resuscitations.

She was transferred to the PICU at a tertiary children's hospital following the third VF arrest and proceed to have three further arrests in the next 8 hours with frequent multimorphic ventricular ectopy between arrests. Another arrest occurred at 9 hours, and she received 5 DC shocks and an IV epinephrine bolus, IV magnesium, and atropine. She was started on an epinephrine infusion at 0.05 µg/kg/min, up titrated to 0.2 µg/kg/min. After the infusion was started, she received two further epinephrine boluses and four further DC shocks over 10 minutes. Specialist pediatric electrophysiology advice was sought, CPVT was suspected, and at 20 minutes into the arrest, IV fentanyl (10 µg/kg) was given, continuous IV epinephrine was stopped, and the VT/VF storm settled over 2 minutes. A final VF arrest occurred 40 minutes later, which resolved with a DC shock, IV lignocaine, magnesium, and further fentanyl (10 µg/kg).

She was started on ECMO as she had very poor ventricular function, poor cardiac output, and bradycardia. Family history was negative, the resting electrocardiogram was normal, the heart was structurally normal on echocardiography, and there was nothing to suggest myocarditis.

To confirm the suspicion of CPVT, while stable on ECMO, she received a 0.2 mg epinephrine bolus, then a 0.2 µg/kg/min infusion of epinephrine which caused a short run of ventricular bigeminy and finally a 0.5 µg/kg/min infusion that caused self-reverting VT/VF (Figs. 4 and 5).

### Correlations between cardiac troponin I and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^114wV9j2]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Different mechanisms may account for the association between elevated cTnI and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HOCM. This cardiac disorder is characterized pathologically by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis, resulting in the disorganized LV myocardial architecture in affected patients. 2 Hypertrophied myocardium usually calls for increased demand of oxygen and blood. The imbalance between inappropriate hypertrophy of the myocardium and insufficient coronary arterial supply, particularly under the condition of LVOT obstruction, will give rise to a complex interplay of elevated wall stress, prolonged ventricular relaxation, enhanced LV filling pressure and reduced myocardial perfusion reserve, lead to microvascular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and myocyte necrosis, and finally result in the release of cardiac troponins. 36, 37, 38 In addition, myocardial disarray and fibrosis, as well as myocardial replacement scarring in HOCM can serve as potentially arrhythmogenic substrates of life‐threatening electrical instability. 2 Areas of myocardial fibrosis interspersed with normal cardiomyocytes will form regions of conduction block that may promote the dispersion of electrical depolarization and repolarization, and induce re‐entry circuits leading to increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. 39 Furthermore, the frequent contractions in highly abnormal patterns of ventricular arrhythmias, in turn, can cause mechanical stress upon the myocardium and further deteriorate myocardial ischemia, which provides another important explanation for the biochemically detected myocardial injury in this setting. 40, 41 As shown in our study, patients of the NSVT group presented with more severe ventricular hypertrophy, lower LV ejection fraction, and increased myocardial fibrosis assessed by LGE in CMR. These manifestations in morphology and hemodynamics were quite consistent with the abovementioned mechanisms between elevated cTnI and ventricular arrhythmias in HOCM patients. Interestingly, besides the strong association with NSVT, we also found that the concentration of cTnI significantly correlated with increased risks for both frequent PVCs and complex ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular bigeminy, polymorphic PVCs, and paired PVCs in HOCM patients. The level of cTnI elevated progressively with the growing severity and complexity of ventricular arrhythmic events in our cohort, suggesting its potential value in assessing the detailed clinical status of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HOCM. Furthermore, analysis by CMR also roughly indicated that the more locations of LGE in the ventricular walls, the higher proportion of NSVT might be in patients with HOCM. However, more standard and accurate quantification of LGE is required in future studies.

### Premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^1111dN7N]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions are of common occurrence in routine clinical practice. Though generally perceived as of benign consequence in healthy people in the absence of heart disease, their presence can be a harbinger of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in individuals with structural heart disease. With some of the latest insights into the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially with the advent of catheter ablation, there has been renewed interest in premature ventricular contractions, not only as a predictor of arrhythmia, but also for their potential etiological association with cardiomyopathy.

### Single-lead arrhythmia detection through machine learning: cross-sectional evaluation of a novel algorithm using real-world data [^113ytjmi]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis builds on others' work. A single-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier by Hannun et al classified ECG tracings into 12 rhythmic categories — AFIB/atrial flutter, atrioventricular block, bigeminy, ectopic atrial rhythm, idioventricular rhythm, junctional rhythm, noise, normal sinus rhythm, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), tachycardia and Wenckebach block. Its average F 1 Score when tested against a 10% sample of the PhysioNet data set was 83.7%. A single-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier from Dias et al classified heartbeats as normal, supraventricular ectopic beats or ventricular ectopic beats with F 1 Scores of 52% for supraventricular ectopic beats and 91% for ventricular ectopic beats, lower than the presently considered model for PSVT (92%), ventricular bigeminy (98%) and trigeminy (96%). A 12-lead ECG arrhythmia classifier developed by Baygin et al which classifies ECG tracings into seven rhythmic categories — AFIB, atrial flutter, bradycardia, SVT, tachycardia, sinus irregularity, normal sinus rhythm — achieved a maximum single-lead F 1 Score of 84.0%. A 12-lead ECG analysis neural network from Hughes et al achieved a mean F 1 Score of 81.2% at detecting arrhythmias.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^115xJ9ng]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected ventricular arrhythmias — history and physical examination emphasize symptom characterization and specific risk clues: Palpitations, presyncope, and syncope are the 3 most important symptoms requiring further characterization, with palpitations usually of a sudden onset/offset pattern and sometimes associated with presyncope and/or syncope. Sudden episodes of collapse with loss of consciousness without premonition that usually last for a few seconds must raise suspicion of conduction defects or ventricular arrhythmias, and other symptoms of structural heart disease such as chest discomfort, dyspnea, and fatigue may be present. A thorough drug history including dosages used must be obtained, and a positive family history of sudden cardiac death is a strong independent predictor of susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Physical examination is often unrevealing unless the arrhythmia occurs during examination or other findings indicate structural heart disease.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions — evaluation for high ectopic burden begins at PVC ≥ 500/24h and instructs clinicians to exclude electrical, ischemic or structural underlying etiology through three axes: imaging work-up (Echocardiography, Cardiac MRI, Other), electrical work-up (Exercise ECG, Signal-averaged ECG, Morphological PVC assessment [unifocal/multifocal; site of origin], Invasive EP study), and genetic work-up (Consider based on familial history, imaging or electrical work-up). Decision nodes then ask Evidence for underlying etiology? with Treatment to improve prognosis if present; otherwise assess Symptomatic PVC? with Treatment to improve symptoms if present. Additional prompts include > 10% PVC burden? followed by Yearly: LV function? and Long-term: CV disease?.

### Pulse deficits resulting in apparent bradycardia in atrial bigeminy [^116cgUiZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Supraventricular premature beats are premature activations of the atria outside of the sinus node that is often benign. They typically present with irregular pulses and dynamic changes to pre-existing murmurs between sinus beats and ectopic beats, but rarely with bradycardia. We describe an elderly male with atrial bigeminy who presented for evacuation of a soft tissue collection in a regional hospital. On examination, he appeared bradycardic due to a significant pulse deficit, despite remaining haemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. This led to two emergency response teams being called and a brief admission to coronary care unit (CCU), primarily due to the ward's limited access to telemetry, before he underwent an uneventful surgery and was discharged. This case highlights the logistical challenges of monitoring such patients where telemetry is not readily available and emphasises the importance of recognising pulse deficits as a cause of peripheral bradycardia in otherwise stable patients with supraventricular ectopic beats.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^117BVCVn]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Fetal bradycardia — initial evaluation is by fetal echocardiography and rhythm analysis to classify suspected etiologies as atrial bigeminy with block, sinus or ectopic atrial rhythm, long QT syndrome (LQTS), atrioventricular (AV) block, or other conditions associated with AV block. For atrial bigeminy with block, frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) must be differentiated from second-degree heart block using Doppler velocimetry, motion-mode, or isovolumetric contraction and relaxation times, with weekly assessment of fetal status and development of fetal SVT and acknowledgement that this mechanism is generally benign. For sinus or ectopic atrial rhythm, it is characterized by 1:1 conduction with potential suppression of the sinoatrial node secondary to maternal medications or viral myocarditis, and ectopic atrial mechanisms include displaced atrial activation or absence of the sinoatrial node; management is periodic assessment of fetal status with biophysical profile and ultrasound to exclude fetal hydrops. For LQTS, diagnosis notes ion channel dysfunction and management includes observation of the fetus for ventricular arrhythmias, avoidance of maternal medications that may prolong QT interval, genetic counseling for patient and family, and postnatal evaluation with assessment of QT interval. For AV block, evaluate for isoimmune fetal heart block secondary to anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies and perform periodic assessment of degree of fetal heart block, cardiomyopathy and fetal hydrops; management uses shared decision-making for treatment with fluorinated steroids and shared decision-making for treatment with dual therapy adding intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for evolving cardiomyopathy and hydrops. For other conditions associated with AV block, etiologies include idiopathic (without structural defect), structural heart disease (SHD), and inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS) other than LQTS; management includes monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias and postnatal evaluation and genetic testing.

Other Arrhythmias

Beyond AF, OSA has been linked with a spectrum of other cardiac rhythm disturbances as well as sudden cardiac death. Simantirakis et al reported a 22% prevalence of prolonged pauses and bradycardia in patients with moderate‐to‐severe OSA who received long‐term monitoring with an implanted loop recorder. 119 Patients are considered to have the "tachy‐brady syndrome" when such bradyarrhythmias alternate with AF or other forms of supraventricular tachycardia. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias also appears to be higher among patients with OSA. Mehra et al found a significantly higher prevalence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (5.3% versus 1.2%, P = 0.004) among patients with severe OSA compared with controls. 98 Similarly, severe OSA was associated with a significantly higher overall risk of complex ventricular ectopy, defined as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy (25% versus 14.5%, P = 0.002). Importantly, an increased risk of sudden cardiac death has been reported in patients with severe OSA, particularly among those observed to have nocturnal oxygen desaturation to < 78%. 120 There are limited data suggesting a beneficial effect of CPAP therapy on reducing rhythm disturbances in patients with OSA 119, 121, 122; however, additional study is necessary given the small size and predominantly observational nature of these trials.

Coronary Artery Disease, Cerebrovascular Disease, or Patients Without Established CVD Who Are at High Risk for Future Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Associations have been identified between OSA and other forms of CVD in addition to those described above, in particular coronary artery disease (CAD) 58, 123 and cerebrovascular disease. 124 Among the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking OSA with CAD and cerebrovascular disease are some of those described above as involved in other forms of CVD, including increased sympathetic nervous system activity, oxidative stress, and predilection to poorly controlled and/or resistant hypertension. Additional mechanisms have been identified as well, including endothelial dysfunction, 125, 126 promotion of a procoagulable state, 127 and metabolic dysregulation characterized by insulin resistance. 128, 129 Treatment of OSA with CPAP has been shown to mitigate these processes, 127, 130, 131 offering a plausible mechanism by which treating OSA could influence cardiovascular outcomes.

### Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein [^112ULdMH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Ala96 HRC Mice Have an Increased Incidence of Ventricular Ectopy on Catecholamine Challenge

We previously reported that the human HRC genetic variant (Ser96Ala) was associated with fatal arrhythmias in DCM patients. Thus, we subjected the Ala96 HRC mice to catecholaminergic stress to determine whether that would induce cardiac arrhythmias in vivo. To test this, the surface ECG was monitored on intraperitoneal injection of ISO. ISO caused frequent premature ventricular complexes in the form of bigeminy and trigeminy (Figure 8 A) and episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in Ala96 mice (Figure 8 B). Arrhythmias typically began 3 to 5 minutes after catecholamine injection and lasted 20 minutes into recovery. Of 8 Ala96 mice, 4 displayed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, while none of the Ser96 HRC mice showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia events (Figure 8 C). Although all VT events were monomorphic, heart rates never exceeded 1000 bpm, and VT rhythms never deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation. The Ser96 mice showed only benign and expected arrhythmias under stress conditions, such as infrequent atrial premature contractions.

Figure 8.

### Parathyroid carcinoma presenting with ventricular bigeminy in pregnancy [^1157Pir7]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Parathyroid carcinoma is very rare in pregnancy. Clinical features are similar to primary hyperparathyroidism. A 38-year-old pregnant woman had repeated hospital admissions for palpitations, headaches, dizziness and polydipsia. Blood investigations showed severe hypercalcaemia with raised parathyroid hormone and 24-hour ECG showed ventricular bigeminy and premature ventricular contractions. Neck ultrasound showed a lesion in the right thyroid lobe. Consequently, she underwent an en bloc resection of the right parathyroid and thyroid lobe at 23 weeks gestation. Histology results confirmed parathyroid cancer. This case highlights the complexities of identifying hypercalcaemia in pregnancy due to the overlapping features with common disorders of pregnancy. Early recognition and timely surgical management can prevent maternal and fetal complications. Also, the case demonstrates the value of interprofessional collaboration between different specialities in providing quality care and improving outcomes. An abridged version of this case was presented at European Congress of Endocrinology 2021.

### Case report: hunting the hidden: surgical treatment of chronic silent thrombus in the left ventricle in a young alcoholic patient with myocardial bridging [^117Pqajm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A silent left ventricular thrombus is dangerous. The current standard anticoagulation therapy was ineffective in our case or similar, and the outcome was poor.

Case presentation

A 33-year-old man with a silent left ventricular thrombus was detected incidentally by transthoracic echocardiography. After admission, anti-coagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin therapy was carried out. The CAG revealed 70% systolic stenosis in the middle of the right coronary artery along with myocardial bridging. Unfortunately, an acute left temporal embolism emerged 5 days later, then the patient was transferred to the neurology department for further treatment. One month later, the patient underwent left ventricular thrombectomy, ventricular aneurysm resection, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was discharged uneventfully after surgery.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment should be a priority for patients with giant or hypermobile left ventricular thrombus or recurrent systemic emboli.

### Prognostic significance of different ventricular ectopic burdens during submaximal exercise in asymptomatic UK biobank subjects [^117CcctN]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Exercise testing poses a dynamic physiological stress on the heart that may unmask underlying cardiac anomalies not evident at rest and is commonly ordered to guide risk assessment in low- or intermediate-risk individuals. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are commonly observed during exercise testing (prevalence ≈7%). The prognostic implications of high PVC burden are well-recognized in patients with structural heart disease –; however, the implications for asymptomatic individuals remain incompletely understood. As highlighted recently, the increased availability of wearable ECG-monitoring devices has significantly improved the identification of asymptomatic participants with PVCs, emphasizing the need to better understand the association between PVCs and cardiovascular risk.

The prognostic implications of low and intermediate PVC counts are unknown, and little is known about the specific risks carried by different PVC rhythms (eg, couplets, triplets, and bigeminy). A very limited number of studies have investigated the prognostic implications of PVCs on exercise in asymptomatic individuals. – The latest evidence suggests that high-grade PVCs (frequent or complex PVCs) during recovery after exercise are associated with a 1.7 times higher long-term cardiovascular mortality risk, independent of established clinical risk factors, whereas no significant association was found for PVCs during exercise in 5486 individuals of which 311 died of cardiovascular disease. However, the quality of the evidence is limited because study cohorts are small, usually not population based, and, as highlighted previously, there is a lack of uniformity among the definitions used to designate frequent PVCs. In addition, little is known about the association of PVCs with other important cardiac outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (LTVA), and heart failure (HF). We hypothesized that the risk associated with PVCs increases with frequency of PVCs and their pattern.

In the present study, we investigated PVCs observed during submaximal exercise in 48 502 asymptomatic individuals without known cardiovascular disease with > 10 years follow-up from the UK Biobank study to address the following hypotheses: (1) PVC burden during submaximal exercise (n = 0, 1–5, 6–10, 11–20, > 20 beats) and recovery (n = 0, 1–5, > 5) determines the clinical adjusted risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MI/HF/LTVA) and all-cause mortality. (2) PVC burden is associated with MI, LTVA, and HF, and cardiovascular mortality. (3) Levels of risk differ according to the different PVC patterns.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^114wmuEn]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

### Amiodarone – avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^113sussL]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who had life-threatening arrhythmias, which are highly likely to be secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supra-ventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, occasionally its use can transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions and contra-indications of amiodarone as well as the need for vigilance following initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

### 'Frequent' ventricular bigeminy – a reversible cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. how frequent is' frequent'? [^115gnxWJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

An interesting development in the field of heart failure has been the link between frequent premature ventricular contractions and cardiomyopathy. We report a patient whose frequent ventricular bigeminy resulted in left ventricular impairment that resolved after the use of non-contact mapping during radiofrequency ablation. A review of the literature regarding possible mechanisms is discussed. For the practicing clinician, the question of 'frequent' should be taken in context of symptoms and LV function. A single 24-h Holter monitor may not truly reflect the ectopic load. We recommend that if there is associated LV dysfunction and a causal link to frequent PVCs then suppression with radiofrequency ablation is a safe and effective treatment strategy.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115WCBmS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) — exercise, athlete context, and high-burden effects are outlined as follows: PVCs that occur during an exercise test are associated with a higher risk of death, and in 1 study, PVCs that occur during recovery are a stronger predictor of death than PVCs occurring only during exercise. In trained athletes with palpitations, PVCs are common and there does not appear to be increased risk of death at least in those without other cardiovascular abnormalities, and an electrophysiological study may be needed to assess patients' arrhythmogenic risk. Very frequent PVCs, > 1000 to 20000 a day, can be associated with depressed LV function that is reversible with control of the PVCs (PVC-induced cardiomyopathy). Very rarely, idiopathic PVCs from the outflow tract may trigger malignant VA in patients without structural heart disease.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^111vDu5J]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Fetal echocardiography — blocked atrial bigeminy versus atrioventricular block is illustrated by heart rate alternating between frequent PACs and normal sinus rhythm, not to be mistaken for second-degree AV block; because an incomplete compensatory pause shortens the prior V–V interval, the apparent ventricular rate (86 beats/min) is more than half of the rate in the subsequent sinus rhythm (163 beats/min), distinguishing this slower rhythm from intermittent second-degree AV block and being too fast for typical third-degree block.
