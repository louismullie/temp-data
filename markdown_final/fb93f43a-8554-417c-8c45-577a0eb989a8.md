## Question

¿Qué medicamentos naturales y no naturales pueden emplearse para aliviar el dolor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which natural and conventional medications can be used to relieve pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify and scope the treatment categories. Then, I should verify high-credibility guideline support for first-line non-opioid pharmacologic therapy. Next, I need to examine when opioids are appropriate and under what restrictions. After that, I should review targeted agents for neuropathic pain. Then, I will evaluate natural products with supportive evidence and those to avoid. Finally, I will integrate safety, quality, and regulation, and synthesize a practical hierarchy by pain phenotype with ongoing monitoring recommendations, cross-checking key points against major guidelines and labels to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the classification so we don't mix incomparable interventions. I will group "non-natural" as conventional synthetics such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids, and specific neuropathic agents, and "natural" as plant-derived or nutrient supplements and topical botanicals. Hold on, I should verify that both groups have at least some guideline or regulatory support before ranking; AAFP 2021 covers acute pain pharmacology, while WHO and NASS address low back pain and certain topical botanicals, which anchors this taxonomy appropriately.

> Next, I should review first-line non-opioid analgesics. AAFP 2021 recommends NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen as initial therapy for acute pain, with choice tailored to risk profile; for localized osteoarthritis pain, topical NSAIDs are effective and often preferred, with favorable safety profiles and NICE-supported use in that context. Wait, let me verify comparative topical data; the OA network meta-analysis confirms efficacy of topical NSAIDs and documents their mechanism and safety advantages when systemic exposure is undesirable [^112vYzRo] [^115qHgAg].

> Now, I need to check the opioid role and strict limitations. FDA labeling for common opioids (e.g. Percocet, Dilaudid, Roxybond) and setting-restricted sufentanil (Dsuvia) uniformly states they are reserved for severe pain when alternatives are inadequate, emphasizing addiction, misuse, and abuse risks; buprenorphine transdermal (Butrans) shows mixed efficacy across trials and still carries the same reserve-use framing. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guidelines for chronic non-cancer pain also advise optimizing nonopioid therapies first, reinforcing opioids as last-line under careful supervision and reassessment. I should also acknowledge new approvals like JOURNAVX, which demonstrate time-to-relief parameters but do not change the "reserve" principle for opioids in chronic pain management [^116B7iwA] [^116p3h8Z] [^11559wZ6] [^1149cMYs] [^111wvDy4] [^1126Yzqj] [^112nEGY1].

> I will now examine targeted agents for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. Let me verify pregabalin's evidence: the FDA label summarizes randomized trials and a withdrawal design in fibromyalgia showing that about half of patients can titrate to an effective dose (300–600 mg/day) with sustained benefit in a subset over 26 weeks, supporting its use in neuropathic pain syndromes and fibromyalgia with individualized titration and monitoring of tolerability [^111MhzAA].

> Next, I should review topical analgesic options for neuropathic and localized pain. Lidocaine 700 mg patches are established for postherpetic neuralgia and are often used as second-line for localized neuropathic pain when oral agents are limited; high-concentration capsaicin 179 mg patches are approved in Europe and guideline-recommended as second-line for peripheral neuropathic pain. But wait, what about low back pain specifically? NASS recommends topical capsicum on a short-term basis (≤ 3 months) for LBP; FDA SPL information also recognizes capsaicin for symptomatic pain relief, which supports its topical adjunct role. I should confirm patient counseling on local reactions and application protocols [^notfound] [^115e2c9Y] [^116zRNPC].

> Let me consider "natural" products with the best supportive data. Curcuminoids show a significant pain reduction across eight RCTs with good tolerability, though the authors call for more rigorous long-term data; topical capsaicin has moderate-to-high quality evidence for short-term benefit in musculoskeletal pain and is conditionally recommended in decision aids. Hold on, I should verify external guideline alignment; WHO suggests considering topical cayenne pepper for chronic primary low back pain, which aligns with these findings, while noting that evidence strength and duration are limited [^112PQDPp] [^notfound] [^113rfGEJ] [^115j2Ep7].

> Now, I need to check herbals that warrant caution or avoidance. The WHO explicitly advises against white willow bark for chronic primary low back pain and also recommends avoiding devil's claw, despite earlier trials suggesting analgesic effects comparable to rofecoxib; this discrepancy underscores the need to privilege contemporary guideline safety assessments over older efficacy studies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should emphasize that even when older RCTs show benefit, current guideline evaluations of harms and overall certainty guide practice, hence the avoid recommendations for chronic LBP [^112DBK9u] [^111WECyu] [^113WpBDj].

> I need to ensure we discuss safety, regulation, and interactions for "natural" products. Reports document adulteration, unlabeled actives, and toxins in some "natural" products, and clinicians should proactively screen for herb–drug interactions to reduce harm; moreover, many supplements lack rigorous safety/efficacy evaluation and standardized manufacturing, so product quality and provenance must be verified before recommendation. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that this caution is explicit in evidence summaries; yes, military-focused reviews echo the uncertainty of benefit–risk across dietary supplements and emphasize the need for GMP-grade sourcing and evidence-based use [^1166VY4o] [^116L6DsY] [^117XNc49].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy. First-line for most acute and many chronic nociceptive presentations remains NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen, using topical NSAIDs when pain is localized and systemic risks are elevated; consider adding curcuminoids as a low-risk adjunct where appropriate. For focal pain, short-term topical capsaicin may be added if tolerated. For neuropathic or fibromyalgia syndromes, consider pregabalin with careful titration; for localized neuropathic pain, consider lidocaine or high-dose capsaicin patches as second-line. Reserve opioids strictly for severe pain unresponsive to optimized nonopioid therapy, with close monitoring, time-limited trials, and risk mitigation. Hold on, I should check if cannabinoids have a role; contemporary guidance suggests cannabinoid-based medicines as adjuncts in select chronic pain contexts when goals are unmet and risks are addressed, but evidence is variable across indications, so shared decision-making is key [^112vYzRo] [^115qHgAg] [^112PQDPp] [^115e2c9Y] [^111MhzAA] [^113rfGEJ] [^116zRNPC] [^116B7iwA] [^113XgE21] [^113rZnRp].

> I will now examine recommendations by pain phenotype to ensure specificity. For acute pain, start with NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen, tailoring to comorbidities; consider topical NSAIDs for localized OA flares. For chronic musculoskeletal pain, prioritize topical NSAIDs, short-term topical capsicum for LBP, and consider adjuncts such as curcuminoids where appropriate, while integrating exercise and nonpharmacologic care per WHO. For neuropathic pain, use pregabalin or topical lidocaine or high-concentration capsaicin depending on distribution and tolerability. For cancer-related pain, opioids remain necessary for severe pain while integrative nonpharmacologic adjuncts such as acupuncture or yoga may help specific syndromes, but these are not substitutes for analgesic pharmacotherapy when pain is severe. Let me verify that each element aligns with cited guidelines before finalizing these phenotype pathways [^112vYzRo] [^115qHgAg] [^115j2Ep7] [^111pxHxH] [^111MhzAA] [^113rfGEJ] [^116zRNPC] [^116B7iwA] [^111UtPYv] [^112eHnNv] [^117Uk16w].

> Hold on, I should verify and correct an earlier risk statement regarding opioids. I initially implied an addiction risk of ≥ 20% for chronic opioid therapy; that conflates different metrics. I should confirm that misuse estimates in chronic pain cohorts are roughly 21–29%, which is not synonymous with DSM-defined opioid use disorder, yet it underscores meaningful risk and the need to minimize exposure and optimize nonopioid strategies first, consistent with CMAJ guidance. Thank you for allowing the self-correction; the clinical takeaway remains to reserve opioids as last-line with vigilant monitoring and clear discontinuation thresholds [^1143QLCv] [^1126Yzqj].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the strategy is clearly prioritized and reference-aligned. Begin with low-risk, guideline-endorsed nonopioids (systemic or topical NSAIDs and acetaminophen), layer in evidence-supported adjuncts such as curcuminoids and short-term topical capsaicin when appropriate, escalate to condition-specific agents like pregabalin or topical anesthetic/neurolytic patches for neuropathic pain, and reserve opioids for severe, refractory pain with strict safeguards. Avoid or be cautious with certain herbals in chronic low back pain per WHO (e.g., willow bark, devil's claw), and proactively manage product quality and interactions for any "natural" therapy. I should emphasize periodic reassessment of pain, function, and harms to drive de-escalation whenever feasible and to maintain alignment with evolving evidence and labels [^112vYzRo] [^111pxHxH] [^112DBK9u] [^111WECyu] [^112PQDPp] [^115e2c9Y] [^116B7iwA] [^1166VY4o] [^116L6DsY].

## References

### Lyrica [^111MhzAA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 9 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figure is cumulative, where patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

- **Study F2**: This randomized withdrawal study compared Lyrica with placebo. Patients were titrated during a 6-week open-label dose optimization phase to a total daily dose of 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg. Patients were considered to be responders if they had both: 1) at least a 50% reduction in pain (VAS) and 2) rated their overall improvement on the PGIC as "much improved" or "very much improved". Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind treatment phase to either the dose achieved in the open-label phase or to placebo. Patients were treated for up to 6 months following randomization. Efficacy was assessed by time to loss of therapeutic response, defined as 1) less than 30% reduction in pain (VAS) from open-label baseline during two consecutive visits of the double-blind phase, or 2) worsening of FM symptoms necessitating an alternative treatment. Fifty-four percent of patients were able to titrate to an effective and tolerable dose of Lyrica during the 6-week open-label phase. Of the patients entering the randomized treatment phase assigned to remain on Lyrica, 38% completed 26 weeks of treatment versus 19% of placebo-treated patients.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^112vYzRo]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, the AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend offering NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination for the initial management of acute pain syndromes. The choice of medication should be decided based on minimizing risks for the specific patient.

### Clinical practice guidelines for cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines in the management of chronic pain and co-occurring conditions [^113XgE21]. Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management of cannabinoids for pain, particularly in the context of chronic pain, the CCP-CEG 2023 guidelines recommend offering cannabinoid-based medicines as an adjunct to chronic pain management. This is specifically advised for patients with arthritic conditions who are not achieving adequate response with other modalities.

---

### Guideline for opioid therapy and chronic noncancer pain [^1126Yzqj]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, specifically concerning non-opioid therapies, the CMA 2017 guidelines recommend optimizing nonpharmacological and nonopioid pharmacological therapies. These should be utilized as first-line treatment in patients with chronic non-cancer pain, rather than initiating a trial of opioids.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of curcuminoids in clinical practice: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112PQDPp]. Pain Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Curcuminoids are natural products with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. There have been a number of reports on the analgesic effects of curcuminoids in clinical trials, yet data have not been fully conclusive.

- **Objectives**: To provide the highest level of evidence on the efficacy of curcuminoids in patients with painful conditions through the meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using data reported by RCTs. The primary efficacy measure was pain intensity or algofunctional status. Treatment effect was summarized with the standardized mean difference (SMD) calculated from differences in means of pain measures between treatment and control groups using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: A total of eight RCTs met our inclusion criteria, which included 606 randomized patients. Curcuminoids were found to significantly reduce pain (SMD: -0.57, 95% CI: -1.11 to -0.03, P = 0.04). This pain-relieving effect was found to be independent of the administered dose and duration of treatment with curcuminoids and was free from publication bias. Curcuminoids were safe and well tolerated in all evaluated RCTs.

- **Conclusion**: Curcuminoid supplements may be a safe and effective strategy to improve pain severity, warranting further rigorously conducted studies to define their long-term efficacy and safety.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^113R1Djn]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Conditional recommendations were made, with 37.5% weakly in favor and 62.5% strongly in favor, for the use of capsaicin as a cream or patch for pain and related symptoms. Research shows high-quality evidence and certainty that capsaicin will produce a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD = –0.56) and the patient's global assessment of improvement (risk difference [RD] = –0.21) compared with placebo at time points closest to four weeks. These desirable anticipated effects were judged to be moderate overall, and the undesirable anticipated effects, primarily associated with burning, itching, and irritation, were judged to be small to trivial.

Most over-the-counter (OTC) creams contain 0.025–0.075% capsaicin and can be applied three to four times a day to the affected area. The application of higher OTC doses (i.e. 0.25%) is only recommended if the patient can tolerate the increased undesirable effects, as this approach can potentially provide quicker pain relief with less frequent applications. Because the cost of capsaicin is highly dependent upon its dose and delivery system, it was challenging for members to judge the required resources based on the evidence. Given the desirable versus undesirable anticipated effects, however, its use likely justifies the resource requirements and out-of-pocket expenses. Members agreed that capsaicin would likely be acceptable to stakeholders and feasible/suitable to implement for use as a cream or patch.

### Guideline summary review: An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114SM6s4]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for low back pain, specifically concerning alternative and complementary medicine and manual therapy, the NASS 2020 guidelines recommend considering offering spinal manipulative therapy to improve pain and function in patients with acute or chronic low back pain (LBP). There is insufficient evidence to recommend 12–18 visits over 6 visits of spinal manipulative therapy.

---

### Percocet [^116B7iwA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Due to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse associated with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see warnings], reserve Percocet for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, or have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Percocet should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^114HW7MT]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Two reviewers working independently of one another examined all citations from the electronic search, and full articles were obtained for those citations thought to fulfill the inclusion criteria. A third reviewer was consulted if consensus was not reached.

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and performed data extraction. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria list advised by the CBRG, which consists of 11 items evaluating internal validity. Items were scored as positive if they fulfilled the criteria, negative when bias was likely, or marked as inconclusive if there was insufficient information. Differences in scoring and data extraction were discussed during a consensus meeting. A study with a low risk of bias was defined as fulfilling six or more of the validity items.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Studies with a fatal flaw were excluded from the meta-analyses. This was pre-defined as studies with a drop-out rate higher than 50% at the first follow-up measurement or statistically significant and clinically important baseline differences for the principal outcome measures that were not accounted for in the analyses. This definition is consistent with an earlier Cochrane review.

- **Data extraction**: An a priori list of items was used for data extraction, consisting of both descriptive data (e.g. study population, type of intervention) and quantitative data regarding the primary and secondary outcome measures.

### Dilaudid [^116p3h8Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dilaudid injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, reserve Dilaudid injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products] have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, and have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

---

### Guideline summary review: An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^115e2c9Y]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for low back pain, particularly with respect to topical capsaicin, the NASS 2020 guidelines recommend offering topical capsicum on a short-term basis (≤ 3 months) to patients with low back pain.

### Herbal topical analgesic for pain management: Perspectives from cancer patients [^111gccvF]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Herbs and natural products are increasingly used by cancer patients for pain management, but few studies have examined their integration within conventional cancer care. This study describes the characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of cancer patients who were prescribed an herbal topical analgesic for pain management.

- **Design and setting**: Program evaluation of a pilot herbal dispensary at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center.

- **Subjects**: Cancer patients who were prescribed the Tibetree Pain-Relieving Plaster (PRP) by an integrative medicine physician.

- **Methods**: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients were abstracted from medical records. Semistructured phone interviews were conducted 1–2 weeks after PRP prescription to evaluate patient experiences with using PRP for pain. Interviews were analyzed through thematic content analysis.

- **Results**: From February 2019 to February 2020, 50 patients were prescribed PRP. The median age was 63 years (range 21–86). Of these patients, 37 (74%) were female, 14 (28%) were non-White, and 38 (76%) were using oral analgesics. During interviews, the majority of patients reported that the PRP improved pain and health-related outcomes, was convenient to use, and addressed pain management needs that were not fulfilled by oral analgesics. However, a few patients described adverse experiences with PRP, including skin irritation.

- **Conclusions**: Understanding patient experiences and perspectives is a critical step toward evidence-based integration of herbs and natural products into cancer pain management.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^115PuDnb]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For continuous data, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed as the difference between groups in pre–post change scores using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3.3.070 (CMA; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). When standard deviations for change scores were not reported, they were calculated from pre- and post-SDs, using r = 0.5 for the product–moment correlation. For studies with dichotomous outcomes, the risk difference (RD) between dietary ingredient and placebo groups (i.e. the percentage of responders with improvement, medication use, and adverse events) was calculated using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager (RevMan) software (version 5.2.7).

Meta-analyses of SMDs and RDs were performed with the generic inverse model of RevMan. Random-effects models were used. Statistical heterogeneity was examined by Cochrane's Q test and I², with low, moderate, and high I² values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. A P value of less than 0.05 was set as the level of significance. SMDs of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were considered small, medium, and large, respectively, according to Cohen's d.

Pooled effect sizes for the pain-related outcome of primary interest were translated into the VAS (0–100) for ease of clinical interpretation by using a standard deviation of 25 points. Note that translations should be interpreted with caution as controversy remains on what is considered clinically "relevant".

The overall quality of the body of evidence and confidence in the effect estimates for each of the outcomes, as compared with placebo, was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation.

### Dsuvia [^1149cMYs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Dsuvia is indicated for use in adults in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting, such as hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments, for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Not for home use or for use in children. Discontinue treatment with Dsuvia before patients leave the certified medically supervised healthcare setting. Dsuvia is not for use for more than 72 hours, as the use beyond 72 hours has not been studied. It is only to be administered by a healthcare provider.

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], reserve Dsuvia for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products):

- Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated
- Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia

Dsuvia contains sufentanil, an opioid agonist, and should be used in the specified healthcare settings to manage acute pain under these specific limitations.

### Dietary ingredients requiring further research before evidence-based recommendations can be made for their use as an approach to mitigating pain [^115zNe1v]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The project's full methodological approach is detailed within the first of this series of three articles and is included as Supplementary Data: Detailed Methodology. Briefly, the authors relied upon the Institute of Medicine guidelines to ensure transparent processes were followed, and conflicts of interest were managed and mitigated in the selection and recruitment of a group of key stakeholders and subject matter experts. The committee, named the Holistic Evidence Review Board (HERB), was convened to develop essential research questions and definitions and assess the factors required for decision-making. A review team, independent of HERB, then conducted a series of systematic reviews to assess the state of the evidence and to explore the safety and efficacy of various dietary ingredients for treating pain and related outcomes. The gathered evidence was integrated with the expertise of these subject matter experts. Modified Delphi methods were used to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of dietary ingredients as well as priority areas in need of future research following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence to decision framework. The systematic review evidence used to inform recommendations is reported in the Supplementary Data: Summary Report.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^111Qt12s]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations were based on conditions and factors considered specific to SOF populations. The HERB only recommended ingredients that showed a benefit and did not negatively impact other areas, such as alleviating bodily pain without increasing financial stress due to the cost of an ingredient.

The HERB grouped recommendations for practice into three tiers based on their collective judgment. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASUs), capsaicin, curcuma, glucosamine prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC), melatonin, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and vitamin D. Ginger was also conditionally recommended but only as a food source; no recommendation for use as a dietary supplement could be made at this time. No recommendations were made for boswellia, rose hip, and s-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe). Lastly, recommendations were made against the use of collagen, creatine, devil's claw, l-carnitine, methylsulfonylmethane, pycnogenol, willow bark extract, and vitamin E.

Specific details regarding the resulting evidence-based recommendations are provided in subsequent articles within this series.

### Natural products and supplements for geriatric depression and cognitive disorders: An evaluation of the research [^111WTJBv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous geriatric patients are using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for late-life mood and cognitive disorders. Natural products and supplements are a common CAM intervention, and it is essential for patients to be appropriately advised about their risks and benefits. The data for omega-3 fatty acids, ginkgo biloba, SAMe, St John's wort, B vitamins and vitamin D, huperzine, caprylidene, and coconut oil will be evaluated. Since the evidence basis for natural products and supplements is limited, especially for the geriatric population, studies involving the general adult population are included to infer effects in the aging population. Despite the data available, more rigorous studies with larger sample sizes over longer periods are still needed. Regardless of a physician's preference for recommending various natural supplements and products, a physician can protect their patients by understanding the side effects and indications of various natural products.

### Unregulated alternative medicine [^1166VY4o]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Unconventional (i.e. alternative, traditional, or complementary) treatments are used by many individuals for a variety of symptoms and disorders. Reports on fraudulent products used for unconventional treatments are not uncommon. These include herbal remedies offered as "natural" while containing non-labeled synthetic pharmacological ingredients or even toxic agents, patients not being informed of active ingredients, products containing no active substances, or unqualified individuals or "clinics" delivering dangerous advice or treatment.

Reports on tainted topical products remain rare due to the high analytical demands necessary to detect minimal traces of unknown ingredients, the fact that patients often use medications from different sources, and patient over-reliance on the effectiveness of folk remedies or advertised claims. The patients' assumption of receiving safe and effective therapy by "natural" products has shown to be unreliable. The authors urge that quality standards for "natural" and pharmaceutical products should be the same and that only qualified professionals should deliver treatment and medical advice.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115qHgAg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and disability for which two topical treatments are used: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin. Topical NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, reversibly block the production of prostanoids, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. They, alongside paracetamol, are recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as first-line pharmacological treatments. Over £32 million worth of prescriptions for topical NSAIDs were dispensed in community pharmacies in England in 2016. Topical NSAIDs are also freely available over-the-counter and are widely advertised to consumers.

Meanwhile, capsaicin, the substance responsible for the warming spiciness of chili peppers, is primarily available on prescription in the UK. Almost 200,000 tubes of 0.025% capsaicin were dispensed in 2016, amounting to over £4 million. Capsaicin is thought to cause defunctionalisation of spontaneously active peripheral nociceptors that otherwise maintain chronic pain conditions.

Topical NSAIDs and capsaicin are applied directly to the skin over the painful joint, and little to no active drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in their favorable safety profiles. Topical administration, therefore, offers a safe and effective alternative to oral analgesics for people with just one or a few painful peripheral joints, especially for individuals with comorbidities, multiple medications, or those wishing to avoid tablets. The efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA is documented.

### Management of chronic pain using complementary and integrative medicine [^112LTsFM]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) encompasses both Western-style medicine and complementary health approaches as a new combined approach to treat a variety of clinical conditions. Chronic pain is the leading indication for the use of CIM, with about 33% of adults and 12% of children in the US utilizing it in this context. Although advances have been made in treatments for chronic pain, it remains inadequately controlled for many people. Adverse effects and complications of analgesic drugs, such as addiction, kidney failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding, also limit their use. CIM offers a multimodality treatment approach that can tackle the multidimensional nature of pain with fewer or no serious adverse effects.

This review focuses on the use of CIM in three conditions with a high incidence of chronic pain: back pain, neck pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. It summarizes research on the mechanisms of action and clinical studies on the efficacy of commonly used CIM modalities such as acupuncture, mind-body system, dietary interventions and fasting, herbal medicine, and nutrients.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^117XNc49]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In fact, although approximately 70–74% of the general adult population and 55–76% of service members use dietary supplements, most individuals typically decide which supplements to use based on advice from both reliable and unreliable sources. The evidence supporting the outweighing of benefits over any potential harms across dietary supplements for pain management is unclear. Though supplements may be perceived to have fewer adverse events than conventional treatments, the safety of many products is unknown. Many have not been assessed for safety or efficacy or prepared according to good manufacturing processes. A large number of dietary and herbal supplements may even contain various toxins because they do not undergo standard regulatory and quality control.

Because dietary ingredients could potentially be a promising self-care intervention, it is important to clearly determine their safety and efficacy for pain management and how ingredients might impact not only pain but also other related outcomes, such as psychological health and quality of life. If such products are going to be used for mitigating musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, evidence-based research is required to inform appropriate and safe decisions about the available ingredients.

- **Purpose**: As part of the US Special Operations Command's Preservation of the Force and Family Behavioral Health Program, this project sought to determine whether research on dietary ingredients for chronic MSK pain provided sufficient evidence to inform decisions for both clinical practice and self-care use. To achieve this, state-of-the-science evidence is needed.

### Spiritual healing as a therapy for chronic pain: A randomized, clinical trial [^116WHdEv]. Pain (2001). Low credibility.

Spiritual healing is a popular complementary and alternative therapy; in the UK, almost 13,000 members are registered in nine separate healing organizations. This randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of healing in the treatment of chronic pain. One hundred and twenty patients suffering from chronic pain, predominantly of neuropathic and nociceptive origin resistant to conventional treatments, were recruited from a Pain Management Clinic.

The trial had two parts:

- **Face-to-face healing or simulated face-to-face healing**: Conducted for 30 minutes per week for 8 weeks.
- **Distant healing or no healing**: Conducted for 30 minutes per week for 8 weeks.

The McGill Pain Questionnaire was pre-defined as the primary outcome measure, and the sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 8 units on the total pain rating index of this instrument after 8 weeks of healing. Secondary outcome measures included VASs for pain, the SF36, HAD scale, MYMOP, and patient subjective experiences at week 8.

Data from all patients who reached the pre-defined mid-point of 4 weeks (50 subjects in part I and 55 subjects in part II) were included in the analysis. Two baseline measurements of outcome measures were made, 3 weeks apart, and no significant differences were observed between them. After eight sessions, there were significant decreases from baseline in the McGill Pain Questionnaire total pain rating index score for both groups in part I and for the control group in part II. However, there were no statistically significant differences between healing and control groups in either part.

### Herbal medicine for low back pain: a Cochrane review [^1111hitr]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was conducted to determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine compared with placebo, no intervention, or "standard/accepted/conventional treatments" for nonspecific low back pain.

Low back pain is a common condition and a substantial economic burden in industrialized societies. A large proportion of patients with chronic low back pain use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and/or visit CAM practitioners. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in low back pain.

- **Methods**: The following databases were searched: Medline (1966 to April 2003), Embase (1980 to April 2003), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2003), and Cochrane Complementary Medicine (CM) field Trials Register. Additionally, reference lists in review articles, guidelines, and in the retrieved trials were checked. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults (> 18 years of age) suffering from acute, subacute, or chronic nonspecific low back pain were included. The types of interventions included herbal medicines defined as a plant used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. Two reviewers (J.J.G. and M.W.T.) conducted electronic searches in all databases. One reviewer (J.J.G.) contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. Authors, title, subject headings, publication type, and abstract of the isolated studies were downloaded or a hard copy was retrieved. Methodological quality and clinical relevance were assessed separately by two individuals.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^1159VWXh]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

- **Versus any other intervention**: Only one study (with a low risk of bias) examined the effects of acupuncture versus another intervention, namely standard care, consisting of treatment by a physician or physiotherapist and comprised a "multimodal treatment program". Patients in the acupuncture group were allowed "rescue medication" for acute episodes consisting of a short course of NSAIDs (no more than 2 days per week). A statistically, but not clinically relevant effect was observed for pain at the short-term and intermediate follow-ups (MWD −8.50, 95% CI −11.04 to −5.96; −9.40, 95% CI −12.13 to −6.67; −12.10, 95% CI −15.25 to −8.95, respectively) (low quality evidence). In contrast, a moderate statistically significant and clinically relevant effect was observed for functional status at the short-term and intermediate follow-ups in favor of acupuncture (SMD −0.53, 95% CI −0.67 to −0.38; −0.64, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.49; −0.76, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.61, respectively) (low quality evidence). Recovery was examined but analyzed as a continuous variable.

- **Versus other types of acupuncture**: One small study (n = 35) (with a high risk of bias) examined the effect of standard acupuncture versus superficial (acupuncture sensation de qi) and deep needling at trigger points in patients 65 years of age and older (very low quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the groups at the end of either of two treatment phases. Another study (n = 61) (with a low risk of bias) examined the effect of auricular electroacupuncture to conventional manual auricular acupuncture (low quality evidence).

### Herbal medicinal products or preparations for neuropathic pain [^116zbUPb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a consequence of damage to the central nervous system (CNS), such as from a cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury, or to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), for example, painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or surgery. Evidence suggests that people suffering from neuropathic pain are likely to seek alternative modes of pain relief, such as herbal medicinal products, due to adverse events associated with pharmacological agents used to treat neuropathic pain. This review includes studies in which participants were treated with herbal medicinal products (topically or ingested) and had experienced neuropathic pain for at least three months.

- **Objectives**: To assess the analgesic efficacy and effectiveness of herbal medicinal products or preparations for neuropathic pain, and the adverse events associated with their use.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED up to March 2018. We identified additional studies from the reference lists of the retrieved papers. We also searched trial registries for ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field for relevant data on published, unpublished, or ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (including cross-over designs) of double-blind design, assessing the efficacy of herbal treatments for neuropathic pain compared to placebo, no intervention, or any other active comparator. Participants were 18 years and above and had been suffering.

**Navigating obstacles impeding novel pain therapeutics development**: From the foregoing, there are multiple obstacles impeding success in the development of novel nonopioid pain therapeutics that are efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated for relief of chronic pain in patients. The high degree of difficulty in achieving success has led several large pharmaceutical companies to exit the novel pain therapeutics field because it is "too hard". Nevertheless, others in industry and academia continue to persist despite the long (15+ years) and arduous path to success.

### Topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis [^111UuNW4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Before the invention of extraction and synthetic chemistry, musculoskeletal complaints were treated with preparations from medicinal plants. These were administered either orally or topically. Unlike oral medicinal plant products, topicals act in part as counterirritants or are toxic when given orally.

- **Objectives**: To update the previous Cochrane review of herbal therapy for osteoarthritis from 2000 by evaluating the evidence on the effectiveness of topical medicinal plant products.

- **Search methods**: Databases for mainstream and complementary medicine were searched using terms to include all forms of arthritis combined with medicinal plant products. We searched electronic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, up to February 2013, unrestricted by language. Reference lists from retrieved trials were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of herbal interventions used topically, compared with inert (placebo) or active controls, in people with osteoarthritis were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Seven studies (involving six different medicinal plant interventions and 785 participants) were included. The presence of single studies (five studies) and non-comparable studies (two studies) precluded the pooling of results. Moderate evidence from a single study of 174 people with hand osteoarthritis was noted.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^1172j7ow]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In total, four RCTs (1 with a low risk of bias) were identified, which included interventions such as exercise and treatment in a hospital outpatient pain clinic. Data could be pooled for pain at every follow-up measurement except at 6 months. A small, significant, but not clinically relevant effect was observed at 1 month from two RCTs with a high risk of bias in favor of SMT (MWD −3.28, 95% CI −5.73 to −0.82) [low quality evidence (serious limitations, indirect)]. At 3 and 12 months, no significant effect was observed [very low quality evidence (serious limitations, indirect, inconsistent)]. For functional status, there was substantial heterogeneity at the short-term and intermediate follow-up. Three RCTs reported data for the long-term follow-up, but the effect was non-significant (very low quality evidence).

In a sensitivity analysis, the effects of SMT on pain and functional status were examined in those studies which compared SMT to exercise only. A small significant, but not clinically relevant effect was seen for pain relief at 1 month in favor of SMT (1 RCT; MWD −6.00; 95% CI −11.50 to −0.50) [very low quality evidence]. No significant effect was seen for functional status at any of the follow-up measurements (very low quality evidence). The only study with a low risk of bias demonstrated no significant effect on pain relief or functional improvement at any of the intermediate or long-term follow-up measurements (data were not collected for the short-term follow-up) [low quality evidence].

### Dietary ingredients requiring further research before evidence-based recommendations can be made for their use as an approach to mitigating pain [^11752FAc]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The methodological processes and steps taken allowed for transparent and evidence-based recommendations to be made to inform policy decisions regarding the use of dietary ingredients for chronic MSK pain and other related symptoms. Whereas no recommendations were made for the use of SAMe, ginger, boswellia, or rose hips as dietary supplements, the factors required to move the evidence toward better decisions are transparently documented. Stakeholders can use this evidence gained and factors considered as a decision aid, and when determining directions for the next steps in research. As noted in the second paper within this series, dietary ingredients are not intended to treat any particular health condition. As MSK pain is a clinical condition, any ingredient or combination of ingredients would be required to go through the FDA Investigational New Drug Applications process.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): Current therapies and topical treatment option with high-concentration capsaicin [^113rfGEJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Cannabinoids

Clinical trials provide little medical evidence that cannabinoid-based medicines are effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in 16 patients could also not support a substantial benefit of cannabinoids in treating CIPN. According to the guideline of the German Society for Neurology, cannabinoids are not recommended for treatment of neuropathic pain of any origin as efficacy is low and the rate of side effects is high. In individual cases and upon failure of other therapeutic options, treatment with cannabinoids may be considered in the context of a multimodal pain therapy.

- **Pharmacological intervention — topical therapies**:

	- **Patches**:

		- **Lidocaine**: The lidocaine patch (700 mg) is approved for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia but has also been suggested by guidelines for the treatment of localized neuropathic pain of other origins, including CIPN. However, randomized clinical trials proving efficacy in CIPN are missing at the time of writing. Lidocaine patches might be used as a second-line option for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, especially in cases of intolerability of oral medications, such as in elderly patients.

		- **Capsaicin**: In Europe, the capsaicin patch (179 mg) is approved for topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain as monotherapy or in combination with other pharmaceutical products for pain treatment. The guideline of the German Society for Neurology recommends the capsaicin 179 mg patch for any kind of neuropathic pain as a second-line therapy. The effect is comparable.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^113Yyrtf]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 55–76% of service members use dietary supplements for various reasons, including pain and related outcomes. This work evaluates research on dietary ingredients for chronic musculoskeletal pain to inform decisions for practice and self-care, specifically for Special Operations Forces personnel.

A steering committee convened to develop research questions and factors required for decision-making. Key databases were searched through August 2016. Eligible systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was applied where feasible. GRADE was used to determine confidence in the effect estimates. The committee made evidence-informed judgments and recommendations for practice and self-care use.

Nineteen eligible dietary ingredients were assessed for quality, efficacy, and safety. Avocado soybean unsaponifiables, capsaicin, curcuma, ginger (as a food source), glucosamine, melatonin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamin D were conditionally recommended as their benefits outweighed risks, but there was still some uncertainty about the trade-offs. No recommendations were made for boswellia, ginger (as a dietary supplement), rose hip, or s-adenosyl-L-methionine. Recommendations were made against the use of collagen, creatine, devil's claw, l-carnitine, methylsulfonylmethane, pycnogenol, willow bark extract, and vitamin E. Research priorities were developed to address gaps precluding stronger recommendations.

### Roxybond [^11559wZ6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Indications and usage: Roxybond is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Roxybond is an opioid agonist indicated for such severe pain cases.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve Roxybond for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, and for whom such treatments have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Roxybond should not be used for an extended period unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### Herbal and dietary therapies for primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea [^113ZmvGP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhoea refers to the occurrence of painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin and is a common gynecological complaint. Common treatments for dysmenorrhoea include medical therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), both of which work by reducing myometrial activity, or contractions of the uterus. The efficacy of conventional treatments such as nonsteroidals is considerable; however, the failure rate is still often 20–25%.

Many consumers are now seeking alternatives to conventional medicine, and research into the menstrual cycle suggests that nutritional intake and metabolism may play an important role in the cause and treatment of menstrual disorders. Herbal and dietary therapies are among the more popular complementary medicines, yet there is a lack of taxonomy to assist in classifying them. In the US, herbs and other phytomedicinal products (medicine from plants) have been legally classified as dietary supplements since 1994. Included in this category are vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and other dietary substances. For the purpose of this review, we use the wider term "herbal and dietary therapies" to include the assorted herbal or dietary treatments that are classified in the US as supplements and also the phytomedicines that may be classified as drugs in the European Union.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of herbal and dietary therapies for the treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea when compared to each other, placebo, no treatment, or other conventional treatments.

### Cebranopadol, a novel first-in-class analgesic drug candidate: First experience in patients with chronic low back pain in a randomized clinical trial [^115kaNgY]. Pain (2017). High credibility.

- **Methods**: We conducted the first human phase II, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group trial with cebranopadol in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain (LBP) with and without a neuropathic pain component. Participants were recruited from 79 investigational sites in 11 European countries from November 2012 to July 2014. The clinical trial protocol, amendments, and informed consent forms were approved by the relevant regulatory authorities and ethical committees, and all patients provided written informed consent before entry into the trial. The EudraCT trial number is 2012–001920–36 and the identifier is NCT01725087.

- **Trial population**: The trial included male and female patients aged 18 to 80 years with a clinical diagnosis of chronic LBP of nonmalignant origin, with moderate-to-severe pain present for at least 3 months. Patients had to be on stable opioid or non-opioid analgesic medication with regular intake for at least 3 months and had to be dissatisfied with their analgesic treatment. An average 24-hour analgesic medication-free baseline pain score of ≥ 5 on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) was required during the 3 days preceding randomization. Patients were not eligible for the trial if they suffered from chronic LBP potentially associated with a specific spinal cause, or conditions other than LBP that could confound the self-evaluation of pain. Patients who underwent recent or more than one previous low back surgery, any invasive procedure aimed to reduce LBP, or any kind of neuromodulation were excluded.

Medicinal plant products are used orally for treating osteoarthritis. Although their mechanisms of action have not yet been elucidated in full detail, interactions with common inflammatory mediators provide a rationale for using them to treat osteoarthritic complaints.

- **Objectives**: To update a previous Cochrane review to assess the benefits and harms of oral medicinal plant products in treating osteoarthritis.

- **Search methods**: We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 29 August 2013, unrestricted by language, and the reference lists from retrieved trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of orally consumed herbal interventions compared with placebo or active controls in people with osteoarthritis were included. Herbal interventions included any plant preparation but excluded homeopathy or aromatherapy products, or any preparation of synthetic origin.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors used standard methods for trial selection and data extraction, and assessed the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach for major outcomes (pain, function, radiographic joint changes, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, total adverse events, and serious adverse events).

- **Main results**: Forty-nine randomised controlled studies (33 interventions, 5980 participants) were included. Seventeen studies of confirmatory design (sample and effect sizes pre-specified) were mostly at moderate risk of bias. The remaining 32 studies were not specified further in this excerpt.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^114ZuPe4]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Data synthesis and analysis**: The primary analysis across the included dietary ingredients, where feasible, was based on trials reporting a continuous outcome measure for pain reduction compared with placebo. Meta-analyses compared with other active therapies were not attempted due to heterogeneity among various comparators. If more than one time point was provided for a single outcome, the authors chose the time point closest to three months for the main analysis.

Secondary analyses were based on trials reporting:

1. A continuous measure for pain at any other time point (most commonly reported on the visual analog scale [VAS] or Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC] pain subscale).
2. A dichotomous outcome measure at any time point (responder data for improvement marked as "global health").
3. A continuous outcome measure for physical function or disability (commonly reported as physical function or stiffness WOMAC subscale) at any time point.
4. A continuous outcome measure for global function (often reported as a total WOMAC or total Lequesne's Functional Index).
5. A dichotomous outcome measure of medication use (reported as the event to not require the use of rescue medication) at any time point.
6. A dichotomous outcome measure of the number of participants experiencing any adverse events.

Psychological health (mood, anxiety, depression, stress), health-related quality of life (global, physical, and/or mental), sleep, and cognitive performance measures were examined at any time point.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^113CKWGf]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Findings were determined to be clinically relevant based upon the size of the effect only. A cut-off point of 25 points (0–100 scale) was considered to represent the minimally clinically important change (MCIC) for pain. An effect was considered clinically significant when the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was greater than this MCIC. For the standard mean difference (SMD), effect sizes were defined as 0.8 for large effects.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^111SXnmy]. European Spine Journal (2010). High credibility.

This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain versus sham, placebo, or passive modalities. In total, five RCTs examined this contrast, consisting of placebo tablets or plasters. The principal outcome measure was perceived recovery at 1 month. Three of the studies defined recovery as the number of patients who were pain-free and had not used Tramadol in the last week of the trial. Due to heterogeneity, data could not be pooled; therefore, in a post hoc analysis, data were examined by the specific type of herbal medicine.

- **Harpagophytum versus placebo**: Two RCTs were identified, which demonstrated a non-significant effect in favor of the herbal medicine for short-term recovery (RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.51–17.91) [moderate quality evidence (indirect; imprecise)].

- **Capsicum plaster (cayenne pepper) versus placebo**: Two RCTs were identified, which demonstrated a small, significant effect in favor of the herbal medicine for short-term recovery (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.37–1.85) [moderate quality evidence (limitations)].

- **Willow bark (Salix alba) versus placebo**: One RCT was identified, which demonstrated a strong, significant effect in favor of the herbal medicine for short-term recovery (RR 6.75, 95% CI 2.49–18.28) (low quality evidence).

- **Herbal medicine plus an intervention versus intervention alone**: No studies examined this contrast.

- **Versus any other intervention**: Two RCTs examined this contrast, comparing herbal medicine to COX-2 inhibitors (Rofecoxib). The outcomes, pain, and perceived recovery were examined at 1 month only. No data were available for the intermediate or long-term follow-up.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^1174q1Am]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Convening a steering committee**: A steering committee was selected to provide high-level oversight and guidance to define the project's scope and ensure meaningful impact for the intended audience; this group was completely independent of the research team that produced the systematic review evidence. The committee, known as the Holistic Evidence Review Board (HERB), included a diverse group of stakeholders and subject matter experts, both within and outside the military, from research, clinical (patient and practitioner perspective), and policy realms. Committee members were well-rounded with expertise in human performance, dietary supplements, and nutrition, as well as pain and pain management. Although the intent was not to develop formal clinical practice guidelines, the authors followed the Institute of Medicine's clinical practice recommendations and used transparent processes to select a well-balanced group, free of potential conflicts of interest, and to ensure transparency throughout the process.

- **Scoping review**: A scoping review was performed to understand the extent of evidence that exists for dietary ingredients in pain populations and which dietary ingredients have been researched. The HERB devised a broad research question to first identify and map the various dietary ingredients and supplements reported in the pain management literature (across the spectrum of acute to chronic conditions). The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Designs (PICOS) strategy was used to scope the literature.

### Butrans [^111wvDy4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Butrans has been evaluated in four 12-week, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. These trials involved opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis, using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain, while one study in low back pain and one study in osteoarthritis did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for either Butrans or the respective active comparators.

- **12-week study in opioid-naïve patients with chronic low back pain**: A total of 1,024 patients with chronic low back pain, who were suboptimally responsive to their non-opioid therapy, entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated therapy with three days of treatment with Butrans 5 mcg/hour. After three days, if adverse events were tolerated, the dose was increased to Butrans 10 mcg/hour. If adverse effects were tolerated but adequate analgesia was not reached, the dose was increased to Butrans 20 mcg/hour for an additional 10–12 days. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on Butrans 10 or 20 mcg/hour were then randomized to remain on their titrated dose of Butrans or a matching placebo. Fifty-three percent of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Twenty-three percent of patients discontinued due to an adverse event from the open-label titration.

### Patient experience and perspective on medical cannabis as an alternative for musculoskeletal pain management [^1143QLCv]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The increasing use of opioids for pain management has raised concerns about their potential for abuse and dangerous adverse effects. Currently, the United States accounts for 80% of the global opioid consumption, generating a narcotic crisis that costs approximately $78.5 billion annually. This situation has led to an increase in the number of deaths secondary to opioid overdose, with more than 750,000 deaths in the United States since 1999. In addition, a 1.68 million person-year life loss was reported in 2016, with the highest incidence among people aged 24 and 25 years, accounting for 20% of the deaths.

Contrarily, opioid misuse is another critical concern, with statistics ranging from 21% to 29% in patients with chronic pain and 4% to 6% in patients transitioning to heroin use. Persistent opioid use has been associated with reasons other than the intensity of the surgical pain, creating a harmful situation for patients due to the disproportionate use of these narcotics.

### Complementary and alternative medicine for postoperative pain: A systematic review [^117Sv3u5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of postoperative pain is an ongoing challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. Poorly controlled pain is associated with poorer patient outcomes, and the prescription of opioids may lead to prolonged, nonmedical use. Complementary and alternative medicine is widely adopted by the general public, and its use in chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions has been studied; however, its efficacy in a postoperative context has not yet been established.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic literature review of 10 databases to identify all relevant publications. We extracted variables related to pain measurement and postoperative opioid prescriptions.

- **Results**: We identified 8 relevant publications from an initial pool of 2,517 items. Of these, 5 were randomized studies and 3 were nonrandomized studies. All 8 studies addressed postoperative pain, with 5 showing significant decreases (p < 0.05) in postoperative pain. Also, 5 studies addressed postoperative opioid use, with 2 showing significant differences (p < 0.05) in opioid consumption. Substantial heterogeneity among the studies precluded meta-analysis. No articles were found to be free of potential bias.

- **Conclusions**: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicines for postoperative pain management or as an alternative to opioid use following orthopaedic surgery.

- **Level of evidence**: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Open-label placebo treatment in chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial [^115Ku3V5]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

During baseline interviews, we obtained data on participant demographics, including age, gender, years of education, employment status, pain medication, and complementary medicine usage. Outcomes were measured at baseline and after 11 and 21 days using paper and pencil questionnaires. Participants in the TAU arm who agreed to participate in a 3-week OLP follow-up responded again to the questionnaires 21 days later. There was no midterm visit during the 3-week open-label follow-up.

- **Validated procedures in research on cLBP**: Our a priori primary outcomes were a change from baseline at 3 weeks in lower back pain intensity during the prior week and dysfunction related to lower back pain. Pain intensity was assessed by asking participants to rate their pain using three standard numeric rating scales, ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst pain imaginable"), scoring maximum pain, minimum pain, and usual pain. The mean of the three measures was our primary pain outcome. Our other primary outcome was back-related dysfunction, which was measured using the validated Portuguese adaptation of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire includes 24 yes or no statements about difficulties in daily activities, such as difficulties in getting dressed and climbing stairs. The overall score is a sum of positive responses, ranging from 0 to 24, with a higher score signifying more disability.

### Herbal medicine for low-back pain [^113ZAPZ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Low-back pain (LBP) is a common condition that imposes a substantial economic burden on people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non-specific LBP.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal, and PubMed. We also checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines, and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub-acute, or chronic non-specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines, which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function.

- **Data collection and analysis**: A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and GRADE criteria.

### Dietary ingredients as an alternative approach for mitigating chronic musculoskeletal pain: Evidence-based recommendations for practice and research in the military [^1136SR18]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 55–76% of service members use dietary supplements for various reasons, including pain and related outcomes. This work evaluates research on dietary ingredients for chronic musculoskeletal pain to inform decisions for practice and self-care, specifically for Special Operations Forces personnel.

- **Objective**: A steering committee convened to develop research questions and factors required for decision-making. Key databases were searched through August 2016. Eligible systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was applied where feasible. GRADE was used to determine confidence in the effect estimates. The committee made evidence-informed judgments and recommendations for practice and self-care use.

- **Results**: Nineteen eligible dietary ingredients were assessed for quality, efficacy, and safety. Avocado soybean unsaponifiables, capsaicin, curcuma, ginger (as a food source), glucosamine, melatonin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamin D were conditionally recommended as their benefits outweighed risks, but there was still some uncertainty about the trade-offs. No recommendations were made for boswellia, ginger (as a dietary supplement), rose hip, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Recommendations were made against the use of collagen, creatine, devil's claw, L-carnitine, methylsulfonylmethane, pycnogenol, willow bark extract, and vitamin E. Research priorities were developed to address gaps precluding stronger recommendations.

- **Conclusions**: Currently, the scientific evidence is insufficiently detailed to support certain recommendations. Further research is required to address existing gaps.

### Herbal medicine for low back pain [^115U1Lut]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Low-back pain is a common condition and a substantial economic burden in industrialized societies. A large proportion of patients with chronic low-back pain use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in low-back pain.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non-specific low-back pain.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials Register (Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2005), and EMBASE (1980 to July 2005). We checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines, and retrieved trials, and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this very specialized area.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub-acute, or chronic non-specific low-back pain. The interventions were herbal medicines, defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors conducted the database searches. One author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. Full references and abstracts of the identified studies were downloaded. A hard copy was retrieved for final inclusion decisions. Methodological quality and clinical relevance were assessed separately by two individuals. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

- **Main results**: Ten trials were included in this review.

### A systematic review on the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine for chronic non-specific low-back pain [^112Lf37B]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

- **Acupuncture**: Studies were searched in the CBRG register from January 2003, resulting in the identification of 133 new studies potentially fulfilling the inclusion criteria. After reviewing the full text of 26 articles, seven RCTs were found to fulfill the inclusion criteria, one of which is included with another intervention (SMT) and also represents the long-term follow-up of an earlier study included in the Cochrane review. Of the 35 RCTs included in the Cochrane review, 15 publications representing 14 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Multiple publications were identified for Brinkhaus et al, Haake et al, Mendelson et al, and Muller and Giles, which represent protocols and preliminary or earlier findings. The most prominent of these publications are cited. In total, 20 RCTs were included and 5,590 patients were examined. Sample sizes ranged from 17 to 3,093 [median 56 (IQR 50–110)].

- **Herbal medicine**: Studies were searched in the CBRG register from January 2005, resulting in the identification of 31 new studies potentially fulfilling the inclusion criteria. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, no new studies were included. Of the ten RCTs included in the Cochrane Review, seven RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In total, 1,315 patients were examined. Sample sizes ranged from 88 to 320 [median 197 (IQR 118–228)]. Five RCTs compared herbal medicine, consisting of willow bark, a capsicum plaster, or Harpagophytum, to a placebo. Two RCTs compared herbal medicine, consisting of willow bark or Harpagophytum, to a COX-2 inhibitor (Rofecoxib).

### Treatment of low back pain with a herbal or synthetic anti-rheumatic: A randomized controlled study. Willow bark extract for low back pain [^113WpBDj]. Rheumatology (2001). High credibility.

To compare the effects of a proprietary extract of willow bark (Assalix) and a selective inhibitor (rofecoxib) of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), an open, randomized, post-marketing study was conducted.

The study, carried out in an outpatient clinic, involved two groups of patients aged 18 to 80 years who presented over a 6-month period with acute exacerbations of low back pain. Using a computer-generated random list, 114 patients were allocated to receive a daily dose of herbal extract containing 240 mg of salicin [PAID (phyto-anti-inflammatory drug) group], and 114 were allocated to receive 12.5 mg of the synthetic COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib [NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) group]. The doses were chosen according to existing recommendations. All patients were free to use whatever additional conventional treatments were deemed necessary. The outcome measures were a modified Arhus index, its pain component, and the Total Pain Index.

Results indicated that groups were well matched. After 4 weeks of treatment, the Arhus index had improved by about 20%, its pain component by about 30%, and the Total Pain Index by about 35%. The number of pain-free patients (visual analogue scale score ≤ 5) was about 10% in both groups, with significant improvements noted in the Total Pain Index (≥ 30% relative to its baseline). The improvement was also reflected reasonably well in the physicians' and patients' judgments of the effectiveness of treatment, which were largely concordant. Few patients from either group resorted to additional interventions.
