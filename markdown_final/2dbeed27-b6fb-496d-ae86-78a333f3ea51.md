## Question

What can a carotid duplex reveal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a carotid duplex can reveal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about its core capabilities as a first-line diagnostic test for carotid stenosis. Then, I should verify the key velocity and ratio parameters used to grade stenosis. Next, I will consider what morphological plaque features and special entities (like near-occlusion, carotid web, or FMD) the exam can suggest. After that, I need to check its role in postoperative and post-stenting surveillance. Finally, I should review limitations, pitfalls, and when confirmatory imaging is recommended, and ensure reporting aligns with standards like NASCET-based grading.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental role. Carotid duplex combines B-mode structural imaging with Doppler to evaluate both plaque and flow and is recommended as the first-line imaging technique to diagnose internal carotid artery stenosis in most settings, especially as an initial test in accredited labs, which aligns with major guidelines and systematic reviews [^112mm9q7] [^1146Vjhu].

> I need to verify the core measurable parameters used to quantify stenosis. The key metrics are internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and the ICA/CCA PSV ratio; consensus criteria commonly use PSV ≥ 230 cm/s to indicate ≥ 70% stenosis, with EDV and ICA/CCA ratio supporting classification, though PSV is typically the strongest single discriminator [^112DUEe7] [^111UW5Xw] [^113oE9K3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anatomy alone. Duplex can also characterize plaque presence and echogenicity and sometimes ulceration, but I should confirm that echolucent plaque and plaque neovascularization correlate with higher event risk while acknowledging that ultrasound features are imperfect surrogates for biological vulnerability; proteomic and histologic data suggest ultrasound cannot fully distinguish highly inflamed from stable fibroatheroma phenotypes, so clinical integration is essential [^111sLPhe] [^111WLJT5] [^1141DNs4].

> I will now examine challenging pathologies. Duplex can suggest occlusion versus near-occlusion, but wait, I should verify that near-occlusion remains difficult to diagnose with common ultrasound methods and often requires careful distal ICA assessment or confirmatory CTA; specialized sonographic techniques may reveal very low distal velocities in pseudo-occlusion, but misclassification risk persists and management differs, so caution is warranted [^116vRtzZ] [^1147RbBt] [^115iF5Fr].

> Next, I should review what else duplex can reveal beyond the ICA. It can assess the common carotid and external carotid arteries, quantify ECA stenosis using ECA PSV and ECA/CCA ratios when validated locally, and evaluate vertebral artery flow patterns, although detecting vertebral or distal ICA fibromuscular dysplasia by ultrasound can be difficult and percentage stenosis reporting is generally not recommended for FMD due to its segmental nature [^112wh5ob] [^113cXBLG].

> But wait, what if the lesion is a carotid web rather than typical plaque. Duplex may reveal a shelf-like intraluminal abnormality at the carotid bulb consistent with a web and prompt confirmatory CTA, which matters because webs are linked to recurrent embolic events even when stenosis severity appears modest [^1113sKo4].

> Let me consider surveillance and follow-up. Duplex reveals restenosis after endarterectomy or stenting, guides timing of reintervention, and is recommended early after revascularization; typical high-grade restenosis thresholds after intervention again use PSV, EDV, and ICA/CCA ratio, while in-stent restenosis often requires stent-specific velocity cutoffs validated against CTA to avoid verification bias [^1171MRos] [^111UW5Xw] [^113Hw7V8].

> I should confirm clinical indications. Duplex can reveal clinically significant stenosis in symptomatic patients and is central to expedited evaluation; in asymptomatic contexts, routine population screening is not broadly endorsed, but targeted use is considered in selected perioperative cardiac settings or when specific risk indicators are present, and carotid imaging is reasonable with bruits, prior TIA/stroke, or other vascular disease [^1146Vjhu] [^116v4ZHA] [^115wojJr].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations that can alter what duplex truly reveals. Highly calcified plaque can cause acoustic shadowing and hinder accurate velocity acquisition; inter-laboratory variability and lack of accreditation can lead to clinically significant over- or underestimation; near-occlusion may be missed; contralateral disease hemodynamics can transiently overestimate stenosis; and comparative studies show potential misclassification versus high-resolution MRI, underscoring the need for rigorous technique and correlation when findings drive intervention [^112qVhsA] [^111Lj7hQ] [^113wP8pu] [^113U2adE].

> Wait, I initially thought duplex alone was always sufficient preoperatively, but let me reconsider and double-check guideline direction. For patients considered for carotid endarterectomy, ESVS recommends corroborating duplex stenosis estimates with CTA or MRA or a second-operator duplex; for carotid stenting candidates, additional imaging of arch and intra/extracranial circulation is recommended, and reports should state the measurement method used, with grading aligned to NASCET or a validated noninvasive equivalent to ensure consistent decision-making [^114DqsR8] [^114vpRGM] [^1161SWWC] [^113YwKdK].

> In summary, a carotid duplex can reveal the presence of plaque, quantify stenosis hemodynamically via PSV/EDV and ICA/CCA ratio, suggest high-risk features and special entities, define occlusion status, and monitor restenosis after intervention; yet I need to ensure technical quality, recognize diagnostic blind spots like near-occlusion and calcified shadowing, and obtain confirmatory imaging when results will alter management, consistent with contemporary vascular guidelines [^111KuFb9] [^112DUEe7] [^114DqsR8].

Carotid duplex ultrasound is a noninvasive test that shows the **degree of carotid stenosis** by combining B-mode imaging of plaque with Doppler flow velocities [^111KuFb9], and it also detects **plaque characteristics** (echogenicity, ulceration) [^111WLJT5] [^111sLPhe] and flow abnormalities (turbulence, spectral broadening). It can identify occlusion, dissection, aneurysm, and in-stent restenosis, and is the **first-line test** for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid disease [^111KuFb9], with high sensitivity and specificity for clinically significant stenosis [^1146Vjhu]. Limitations include operator dependence [^111Lj7hQ], difficulty with heavily calcified plaques [^112qVhsA], and reduced accuracy for near-occlusion [^112MpypB], so confirmatory CTA/MRA is recommended when results are uncertain or intervention is planned [^114DqsR8] [^114vpRGM].

## Anatomical and hemodynamic information provided by carotid duplex ultrasound

Carotid duplex ultrasound provides **detailed anatomical and hemodynamic information** about the carotid arteries, including:

- **Degree of stenosis**: Quantifies narrowing using peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and ICA/CCA PSV ratio [^112DUEe7] [^113YwKdK].

- **Plaque characteristics**: Assesses echogenicity, ulceration, and surface irregularity to help stratify stroke risk [^111WLJT5] [^111sLPhe].

- **Flow abnormalities**: Detects turbulence, spectral broadening, and post-stenotic flow changes indicating hemodynamic significance [^111WLJT5].

- **Occlusion**: Identifies complete absence of flow consistent with occlusion [^1125TiGM].

- **Dissection**: Visualizes intimal flap or false lumen with abnormal flow [^1141DNs4].

- **Aneurysm**: Detects focal dilatation with altered flow [^1141DNs4].

- **In-stent restenosis**: Monitors velocity changes within stents to detect restenosis [^113Hw7V8].

---

## Clinical indications for carotid duplex ultrasound

Carotid duplex ultrasound is **indicated** in several clinical scenarios, including:

- **Symptomatic patients**: TIA, stroke, or amaurosis fugax [^111KuFb9].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Carotid bruit or multiple vascular risk factors [^112mm9q7].

- **Preoperative evaluation**: Before cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG) in patients with prior TIA/stroke or significant risk factors [^116v4ZHA] [^112YegTd].

- **Postoperative surveillance**: After **carotid endarterectomy or stenting** to detect restenosis [^111UW5Xw] [^1171MRos].

---

## Accuracy and reliability of carotid duplex ultrasound

Carotid duplex ultrasound is **highly accurate** for detecting clinically significant stenosis (≥ 50%) [^1146Vjhu], but performance is operator dependent and varies with skill and experience [^111Lj7hQ]. Calcified plaques [^112qVhsA] and near-occlusion [^112MpypB] can reduce accuracy, limiting reliability in some cases.

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its advantages, carotid duplex ultrasound has **limitations**:

- **Operator dependence**: Requires skilled operators for accurate results [^111Lj7hQ].

- **Calcified plaques**: Acoustic shadowing can obscure the lumen [^112qVhsA].

- **Near-occlusion**: Difficult to diagnose accurately [^112MpypB].

- **Patient factors**: Obesity, short neck, or limited mobility can hinder imaging.

## Clinical implications and management decisions

Findings from carotid duplex ultrasound guide clinical management by supporting **medical therapy** — antiplatelet agents, statins, and risk-factor control — for mild to moderate stenosis. Severe stenosis (≥ 70%) or symptomatic disease should prompt consideration of carotid endarterectomy or stenting [^114DqsR8]. Results also inform **surveillance**, with regular follow-up imaging to monitor progression or restenosis [^1171MRos] [^111UW5Xw].

Carotid duplex ultrasound is a noninvasive test that shows the **degree of carotid stenosis** [^111KuFb9] and plaque characteristics [^111WLJT5], guiding management decisions. It is accurate and reliable [^1146Vjhu], but operator dependence and calcified plaques can limit accuracy [^112qVhsA], so confirmatory imaging may be needed [^114DqsR8].

### Acoustic shadowing impairs accurate characterization of stenosis in carotid ultrasound examinations [^112qVhsA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) has been the mainstay for diagnosing carotid artery stenosis and is often the sole diagnostic modality used prior to intervention. Highly calcified plaque, however, results in an acoustic shadow (AcS) that obscures the vessel lumen and inhibits the sonographer's ability to obtain Doppler velocity measurements. It is unknown whether DUS can accurately determine the degree of carotid stenosis in these settings.

From July 2012 to December 2013, all patients with AcS on DUS measuring ≥ 5 mm in the longitudinal axis were cross-referenced with multidetector computed tomographic angiography (MD-CTA) images of the neck to define the study population. After standardizing the MD-CTA windows, percent stenosis was determined by cross-sectional area reduction using two separate previously described methods based on North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria. DUS waveform parameters in the internal carotid artery near the AcS were then compared with these MD-CTA measurements to determine the accuracy of DUS in characterizing the severity of carotid stenosis.

During this period, 8517 DUS studies were performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, 550 of which had AcS, for an incidence of 6.45%. There were 92 lesions with a concomitant MD-CTA; however, seven were excluded because of poor study quality, because ≥ 6 months had elapsed between DUS and MD-CTA, or because the patient had undergone carotid reconstruction between studies. Of the 85 remaining lesions…

### Imaging of high-risk carotid plaques: Ultrasound [^111WLJT5]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasonography has a well-established role in the assessment of the degree of stenosis caused by carotid atherosclerosis. This assessment is derived from Doppler velocity changes induced by the narrowing lumen of the artery. New research into the mechanisms for plaque rupture and atheroembolic stroke indicates that the degree of narrowing is an imperfect predictor of stroke risk and that other factors, such as plaque composition, remodeling, and biomechanical forces acting on the plaque, can play a role.

New advances in ultrasound imaging technology have made it possible to investigate these measures of plaque vulnerability to identify pre-embolic unstable carotid plaques. Efforts have been made to quantify the morphologic appearance of the plaque in B-mode images and to correlate them with histology. Additional research has resulted in the first generation of clinically available three-dimensional ultrasound transducers that reduce operator dependence and variability. Finally, ultrasonography provides real-time imaging and physiologic information that can be utilized to measure disruptive forces acting on carotid plaques.

We review some of these exciting developments in ultrasonography and discuss how these may impact clinical practice.

### Duplex ultrasound for diagnosing symptomatic carotid stenosis in the extracranial segments [^1146Vjhu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is an important cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated.

- **Objective**: To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

- **Search methods**: We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included less than 70% of symptomatic patients, where the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis.

### Rule-out and rule-in of carotid near-occlusion using color duplex ultrasound [^117DAAP1]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **CTA**: CTA was performed at several radiology departments at the same or referring hospitals and hence was done with various machines and clinical protocol variants. All images were assessed for study purposes by three observers, blinded to each other and color duplex ultrasound (CDU) findings. EJ, who has 10 years of experience, assessed all exams. AJF, with over 40 years of experience, assessed all cases with possible carotid near-occlusion (CNO) and some controls during the first half of the study. AH, with 5 years of experience, assessed all exams during the second half of the study.

- **CNO diagnosis**: CNO was diagnosed when there was severe stenosis associated with a reduced internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter beyond the stenosis, absent other features to suggest alternative causes such as dissection or anatomical variations. The assessment involved determining if the distal ICA was small and if the severe proximal atherosclerotic stenosis was the most plausible cause. Key considerations included stenosis severity, distal ICA diameter, ICA ratio (side-to-side), and external carotid artery (ECA) ratio (ICA-ECA). The Circle of Willis and possible distal ICA disease were also evaluated. The most common differential diagnoses for small distal ICA were dissection and anatomical variation, such as an asymmetric Circle of Willis. Anatomical variations with smaller ICA and stenosis were considered as conventional stenosis rather than CNO.

### The value and economic analysis of routine postoperative carotid duplex ultrasound surveillance after carotid endarterectomy [^116JrYN6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported on the role of postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with varying results. Most of these studies had a small sample size or did not analyze cost-effectiveness.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 489 of 501 CEA patients with patch closure. All patients had an immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound examination and were routinely followed up both clinically and with duplex ultrasound at regular intervals of 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of ≥ 50% and ≥ 80% post-CEA restenosis over time and the time frame of progression from normal to ≥ 50% or ≥ 80% restenosis. The cost of post-CEA duplex surveillance was also estimated.

- **Results**: Overall, 489 patients with a mean age of 68.5 years were analyzed. Ten of these had residual postoperative ≥ 50% stenosis, and 37 did not undergo a second duplex ultrasound examination and therefore were not included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 1–63 months), with a mean number of duplex ultrasound examinations of 3.6 (range, 1–7). Eleven of 397 patients (2.8%) with a normal finding on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound versus 4 of 45 (8.9%) with mild stenosis on immediate postoperative duplex ultrasound progressed to ≥ 50% restenosis (P = 0.055). Overall, 15 patients (3.1%) had ≥ 50% restenosis, 9 with 50% to < 80% and 4 with 80% to 99% (2 of these had carotid artery stenting reintervention), and 2 had late carotid occlusion. All of these were asymptomatic.

### Internal carotid artery web: Doppler ultrasound with CT angiography correlation [^1113sKo4]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present a case of an internal carotid web, detected on duplex ultrasound and confirmed by CT angiography. To our knowledge, this is only the third reported ultrasound case in the imaging literature. This vascular abnormality can cause a clinically significant carotid stenosis and is a risk factor for recurrent embolic cerebrovascular events. Due to their small size and poor awareness among radiologists, carotid webs are often under-diagnosed on non-invasive imaging modalities. Improved awareness, including knowledge of salient imaging features, is useful as early diagnosis leading to appropriate intervention can eliminate the risk of future cerebrovascular events.

### National variation in preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and threshold for surgery for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis [^114ZGWqd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is among the most common procedures performed in the United States. However, consensus is lacking regarding optimal preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and ultimately, the threshold for surgery. This study characterizes national variation in preoperative imaging, carotid duplex ultrasound criteria, and the threshold for surgery for asymptomatic CEA.

The Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database was used to identify all CEA procedures performed for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis between 2003 and 2014. VQI currently captures 100% of CEA procedures performed at over 300 centers by more than 2000 physicians nationwide. Three analyses were conducted to quantify the variation in the following:

- **Preoperative imaging**: The preoperative imaging modality used before CEA varied widely, with 57% of patients receiving a single preoperative imaging study (duplex ultrasound imaging, 46%; computed tomography angiography, 7.5%; magnetic resonance angiography, 2.0%; cerebral angiography, 1.3%) and 43% receiving multiple preoperative imaging studies.

- **Carotid duplex ultrasound criteria**: Of the 16,452 asymptomatic patients (89%) who underwent preoperative duplex ultrasound imaging, there was significant variability between centers in the degree of stenosis (50%-69%, 70%-79%, 80%-99%).

- **Threshold for surgery**: The criteria guiding the decision for surgical intervention vary considerably, reflecting a lack of consensus across different centers.

These variations highlight the need for consensus guidelines to optimize the use of preoperative imaging and surgical intervention criteria in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

### Development and internal validation of a risk score to detect asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^115tWGuW]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Population-level screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis with duplex ultrasound is not recommended due to the low overall prevalence. Risk prediction models can be used to select particular individuals for targeted screening to detect asymptomatic carotid stenosis, allowing improved cardiovascular risk management to prevent complications.

### Recent developments in the understanding and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^113cXBLG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Carotid artery imaging reveals that little data exist regarding the use of noninvasive imaging to confirm the diagnosis of carotid and vertebral artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). No published study has validated duplex ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in comparison with digital subtraction angiography for detecting cerebrovascular FMD. As in renal artery FMD, carotid duplex ultrasound offers a noninvasive and low-cost screening tool. Carotid FMD can be identified with velocity shifts, spectral broadening, and turbulent color Doppler flow in the mid to distal cervical internal carotid artery and vertebral arteries, although detecting vertebral FMD by ultrasound may be difficult. Recently, tortuosity and redundancy of the internal carotid artery in an "S-curve" configuration were described by Sethi and colleagues.

Ultrasound findings of carotid FMD contrast with atherosclerotic lesions, which appear as plaque with corresponding velocity shifts at the carotid bifurcation or proximal segment of the internal carotid artery. It is worth noting that carotid atherosclerosis and FMD can coexist. Therefore, to detect cervical FMD, it is necessary to investigate the entire cervical internal carotid artery, especially the most distal segments.

Unlike atherosclerotic disease, showing accurate percentage stenosis for carotid FMD on a duplex ultrasound report is not possible due to the complex nature of the tandem lesions, with areas of webbing and stenosis followed by dilatation in multifocal FMD. In general, it is recommended that ultrasound reports not attribute a specific percentage stenosis category.

### Common reasons that asymptomatic patients who are 65 years and older receive carotid imaging [^114SWsdx]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

National guidelines do not agree on the role of carotid screening in asymptomatic patients (i.e. patients who have not had a stroke or transient ischemic attack). Recently, several physician organizations participating in the Choosing Wisely campaign have identified carotid imaging in selected asymptomatic populations as being of low value. However, the majority of patients who are evaluated for carotid stenosis and subsequently revascularized are asymptomatic.

The objective was to better understand why asymptomatic patients who undergo revascularization receive initial carotid imaging. This retrospective cohort study involved 4127 Veterans Health Administration patients, 65 years and older, undergoing carotid revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis between 2005 and 2009.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Indications for carotid ultrasounds were extracted using trained abstractors. The frequency of indications and appropriateness of initial carotid ultrasound imaging for patients within each rating category after the intervention were reported.

The mean (SD) age of this cohort of 4127 patients was 73.6 (5.9) years, with 4014 (98.8%) being male. Overall, there were 5226 indications for 4063 carotid ultrasounds. The most common indications for imaging were carotid bruit (1578 instances, accounting for 30.2% of indications) and follow-up for carotid disease (stenosis/history of carotid disease) in patients with previously documented carotid stenosis (1087 instances, accounting for 20.8% of indications). Multiple vascular risk factors were the next most common indications.

### Imaging of carotid arterial diseases with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) [^1141DNs4]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Carotid duplex ultrasound is the standard of care for the initial diagnosis of carotid artery bifurcation diseases. However, in difficult examinations, carotid abnormalities are commonly encountered and may pose a diagnostic challenge in patients with clinical symptoms as well as in follow-up after carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with low mechanical index (low MI) is a promising new method for diagnosing and monitoring pathological carotid diseases. Unlike most contrast agents used for magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, the microbubbles in CEUS with SonoVue® remain within the vascular space, making it suitable for studying vascular disease. In addition to improving carotid structural scans, CEUS has the potential to enhance or provide additional information on carotid arterial diseases. This review describes the carotid duplex ultrasound examination and compares the pathological findings with CEUS.

### Long-term risk of carotid restenosis in patients randomly assigned to endovascular treatment or endarterectomy in the carotid and vertebral artery transluminal angioplasty study (CAVATAS): long-term follow-up of a randomised trial [^114S2ghk]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of this analysis (≥ 70% restenosis) was defined as any residual or severe stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery detected at any stage during follow-up after completed treatment. The secondary outcome (≥ 50% restenosis) was defined as any residual or moderate or severe carotid stenosis or occlusion after completed treatment. We compared the incidence of the primary and secondary outcomes between patients randomly assigned to endovascular treatment versus endarterectomy and between patients who were treated with balloon angioplasty alone (without use of a stent) and patients treated with a stent in those randomly assigned to endovascular treatment. Because the use of stents was not randomised in CAVATAS, the analysis of patients treated with stents and those treated with balloon angioplasty is a comparison of two subsets of patients in the endovascular treatment arm and is based on post-randomisation information (i.e. which endovascular treatment technique the patient actually received).

We investigated whether the following baseline characteristics were independently associated with restenosis of 70% or more: age at randomisation, sex, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, history of coronary heart disease, history of peripheral vascular disease, and the degree of ipsilateral carotid stenosis at randomisation according to the NASCET method.

### Optimal cut-off criteria for duplex ultrasound compared with computed tomography angiography for the diagnosis of restenosis in stented carotid arteries in the international carotid stenting study [^113Hw7V8]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Previous studies that reported duplex-ultrasound cut-off criteria, based on blood velocity parameters for the degree of stenosis in a stented carotid artery, were either retrospective or the reference test was carried out only when a patient was suspected of having restenosis at duplex ultrasound, likely resulting in verification bias. We performed a prospective study of diagnostic accuracy to find new blood velocity cut-offs in duplex ultrasound for in-stent restenosis.

- **Patients and methods**: Stented patients within the international carotid stenting study were eligible. Patients had a carotid computed tomography angiography in addition to routine duplex ultrasound performed at a yearly follow-up. Duplex-ultrasound blood flow velocity parameters were compared to the degree of stenosis on computed tomography angiography. The results were analyzed using receiver-operating-characteristic curves.

- **Results**: We included 103 patients in this study. On computed tomography angiography, 30 (29.1%) patients had 30%-49% in-stent restenosis, 21 (20.4%) patients had 50%-69% in-stent restenosis, and 5 (4.9%) patients had ≥ 70% in-stent restenosis. The cut-off value for ≥ 50% stenosis was a peak systolic velocity of 125 cm/s (sensitivity: 63% [95% CI: 41–79], specificity: 83% [95% CI: 72–90]).

- **Discussion**: This study provides a level 2b evidence for new cut-off values for in-stent restenosis. Unfortunately, we could not provide information about severe stenosis due to the low number of severe stenosis cases after one year.

The cut-off value detected from this study was a 125 cm/s peak systolic velocity on duplex ultrasound.

### Predictive multivariate regression to increase the specificity of carotid duplex ultrasound for high-grade stenosis in asymptomatic patients [^115ojSF7]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) is commonly used to screen for carotid artery stenosis. However, the specificities of CDUS criteria are lower than sensitivities, potentially resulting in false-positive examinations, which can lead to unnecessary imaging or surgery. Our objective was to establish a multivariate logistic regression to increase the specificity of CDUS for high-grade (≥ 70%) stenosis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review collected CDUS velocities and radiographic measurements from patients who underwent both CDUS and computed tomography angiography (CTA). After stratification with standard CDUS criteria, a logistic regression was created using peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and PSV ratio (PSV of internal carotid artery [ICA]/PSV of common carotid artery [CCA]) as predictor variables. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to test the model's predictive ability. A cutoff probability for unequivocal high-grade stenosis was chosen based on optimal specificity. The regression model was applied to patients with equivocal high-grade stenosis, and probabilities for the detection of high-grade stenosis were calculated. Descriptive statistics were generated to quantify the accuracy of the model.

- **Results**: A total of 244 vessels were included. Standardized velocity criteria for ≥ 70% stenosis yielded a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% confidence interval, 82.3–95.6%), specificity of 63.5% (95% CI, 55.4–70.5%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 57.0% (95% CI, 48.8–65.5%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.7% (95% CI, 85.8–96.5%).

### Duplex ultrasound verified by angiography in patients with severe primary and restenosis of internal carotid artery [^114MMaRA]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

There are very limited data in the literature about the reliability of duplex ultrasound (DU) verified by angiography in patients with restenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) after carotid surgery compared with primary carotid artery stenosis patients. Our objective was to compare the reliability of DU verified by conventional angiography in the diagnosis of severe primary stenosis versus restenosis of ICA.

One hundred thirty-four patients (238 arteries) were examined by both DU and angiography. Severe stenosis (> 70%) was found in 47 primary stenotic arteries and in 70 restenotic arteries. Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were obtained for basic DU criteria after verification of ultrasound data by angiography.

- **Detection of > 70% stenosis by end diastolic velocity**: The best accuracy for detection was found for the velocity of 70 cm/sec or more in both groups, but accuracy for the restenosis group was significantly higher (96.9% vs. 89.8%, p = 0.025). Additionally, specificity (p = 0.01) and PPV (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the restenosis group.

- **Detection of > 70% stenosis by peak systolic velocity**: The best accuracy for detection was found for the velocity of 220 cm/sec or more for restenoses and 200 cm/sec or more for primary stenoses. The accuracy of the ultrasound was significantly higher in the restenosis group (94.6% vs. 87%, p = 0.04), as were specificity (p = 0.01) and PPV (p = 0.02).

The diagnosis of severe restenosis by DU is reliable and can be used for decision-making regarding surgery or stenting.

The ESC 2024 guidelines for peripheral artery disease, particularly for patients with polyvascular disease, recommend considering carotid duplex ultrasound in stable patients who are scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and have experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the past six months, without prior carotid revascularization.

### Spontaneous resolution of carotid stenosis — a case for routine preoperative duplex ultrasound [^1156XSFf]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Spontaneous resolution of carotid stenosis has not been previously reported in the context of preoperative duplex ultrasound scanning, although it has been described as a recognizable phenomenon in the past. We report a case in which significant carotid stenosis was noted at the time of listing for surgery on both duplex ultrasound and MRA. On preoperative imaging, there was resolution of the lesion, and surgery was avoided. This case emphasizes that spontaneous resolution of carotid stenosis can occur and that preoperative duplex ultrasound is useful as a prelude to surgery, potentially preventing unwarranted intervention.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid artery imaging, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining CTA or MRA following any duplex ultrasound. This is to provide additional information on the aortic arch and the extra- and intracranial circulation in patients who are candidates for carotid artery stenting.

### Near-occlusion is difficult to diagnose with common carotid ultrasound methods [^116vRtzZ]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Ultrasound as the sole preoperative modality is accepted or recommended in guidelines, which is supported by the findings of a systematic assessment and review. However, these assessments focused on the discrimination of 50% and 70% stenosis and omitted near-occlusion, as did all their underlying ultrasound studies. Hence, when the community decided that ultrasound was reasonable as a sole preoperative modality, the low sensitivity for near-occlusion with commonly used carotid ultrasound methods was not considered. Since the difference between near-occlusion and conventional stenosis is management-altering according to guidelines, improvements in carotid ultrasound methods are needed if carotid ultrasound is to retain this prominent role. Also, the role of ultrasound might change in the future because recent studies reveal that some near-occlusions might benefit from revascularization.

Strengths of the study are relatively large size, dedicated near-occlusion data collection, and use of the same interpretation approach and image interpreter for the angiographic comparison as the pooled analysis of the NASCET and ECST trials. A limitation was that not all cases were examined with both ultrasound and CTA. Eleven cases had missing flow velocity data, mainly in the CCA, but all were in the control group of conventional stenosis. Although CTA, and not conventional digital subtraction angiography, was used as an angiographic comparison, near-occlusions are well diagnosed on CTA. Our approach to combine different parameters should be interpreted with caution as it might have caused model adjustments that require scrutiny.

### Reliability of extracranial carotid artery duplex ultrasound scanning: Value of vascular laboratory accreditation [^111Lj7hQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of carotid duplex ultrasound scanning performed by nonaccredited vascular laboratories and to assess the clinical effect on patient management.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed concordance of findings of carotid duplex ultrasound scanning between laboratories accredited by the Intersocietal Commission for Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories and nonaccredited laboratories. This review included 174 patients with asymptomatic disease referred to tertiary care community hospitals for surgical evaluation for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between January 2001 and December 2002. We also evaluated changes in clinical management based on repeat examinations.

- **Results**: Concordant findings were noted in 171 of 348 arteries (49%), predominantly those with minimal or mild disease (114 arteries; 67%). Discordant findings of no clinical significance were found in 54 arteries (16%). Clinically significant discordant findings were noted in 123 arteries (35%) in 107 patients (61%). In 104 arteries (88 patients), stenosis was overestimated by the nonaccredited laboratory due to technical error (19 arteries), use of B-mode imaging data alone (36 arteries), and use of inappropriate velocity criteria (49 arteries). None of these patients underwent CEA. Stenosis was significantly underestimated in 19 arteries (19 patients); all of these patients underwent uncomplicated CEA.

- **Conclusions**: Incorrect physician interpretation of data is the most common cause of error in carotid duplex ultrasound scanning performed in nonaccredited laboratories.

### Multidimensional characterization of carotid artery stenosis using CT imaging: a comparison with ultrasound grading and peak flow measurement [^113FWrMA]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical decision making for carotid surgery depends largely upon stenosis grade. While digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for stenosis grading, many physicians use less invasive modalities. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of multidimensional computed tomography (CTA) with ultrasound (US) grading and peak flow velocity (PSV).

Methods: Thirty-seven stenosed carotid arteries were studied retrospectively in 36 consecutive patients. US grading and PSV were compared to multidimensional CTA analysis (diameter, area, and volumetric measurements), performed by a medical software company. Calculations of stenosis percentage on CTA were made using the NASCET and ECST methodology. Diameter measurements were also performed by a neuroradiologist.

Results: All CTA diameter, area, and volume measurements had only modest correlation with PSV (r < 0.5) and ultrasound grading (p < 0.5). There was concordant classification of stenosis grades in only 40–60% of cases. CTA diameter, area, and volume measurements had good correlation (0.69 < r < 0.87) with one another using ECST methodology. Using NASCET methodology on CTA, correlation between diameter and area was insignificant (r = 0.32). CTA volumetric analysis with the NASCET method yielded 27 negative stenosis grades. Repeatability coefficient for selecting the normal distal ICA 20 mm more distally was 20% for diameter and 43% for area. CTA diameter interobserver repeatability coefficients were 22.9% (NASCET) and 17.8% (ECST), and 0.7 mm (lumen) and 1.9 mm (vessel).

Conclusions: All CTA measurements showed mod

### Diagnostic performance of duplex ultrasonography in the detection of high grade internal carotid artery stenosis [^113oE9K3]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to establish on a national basis whether the diagnostic accuracy of carotid duplex justifies carotid surgery without preoperative angiography. This was a prospective national multicentre study involving ten participating university and county hospitals.

One hundred thirty-four patients, with an average age of 69 ± 9 years, underwent routine carotid duplex ultrasonography and angiography. The relationship between ultrasonographic and angiographic variables was evaluated using multiple regression analysis. The capacity of carotid ultrasonography to detect internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis ≥ 80% was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis.

The results showed a strong correlation between peak systolic velocity in ICA (PSV(ICA)) and the angiographic degree of stenosis, significantly influenced only by the applied Doppler angle. Accordingly, the optimal PSV(ICA) cutpoint values for diagnosing ICA stenosis ≥ 80% (ECST method) varied substantially (2.1 and 3.2 m/s) between the two considered angle ranges (0–49 degrees and 50–62 degrees). The ability to identify high-grade ICA stenosis was significantly better at small Doppler angles (0–49 degrees).

In conclusion, the ultrasonographic duplex technique identifies high-grade ICA stenosis with a high degree of accuracy, which can be further improved by applying small Doppler angles and using angle-range specific PSV(ICA) cut-off points.

### Natural history of non-operative management in asymptomatic patients with 70%-80% internal carotid artery stenosis by duplex criteria [^116wpFrk]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Treatment of asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, particularly for moderate to severe (70%-80%) disease, is controversial. The goal was to assess the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis.

- **Methods**: A single institution retrospective analysis of patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis, identified on duplex ultrasound as moderate to severe (70%-80%) from 2003 to 2018, was analyzed. Duplex criteria for 70%-80% stenosis was a systolic velocity of ≥ 325 cm/s or an ICA:common carotid artery ratio of ≥ 4, and an end diastolic velocity of 80%, ipsilateral stroke/TIA without documented progression, and death.

- **Results**: In total, 206 carotid arteries were identified in 182 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 71.5 years, 57.7% were male, and 67% were white. Nineteen stenoses were removed from analysis except for survival analysis, as they initially underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stent based on surgeon/patient preference. Documented progression occurred in 24.1% of stenoses. There were 5.3% of stenoses associated with an ipsilateral stroke/TIA without documented progression, which occurred at a mean of 26.4 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a 60.3% five-year freedom from stenosis progression, a 92.5% five-year freedom from stroke/TIA without documented progression, and 83.7% five-year survival.

### Critical appraisal of the carotid duplex consensus criteria in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis [^112DUEe7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Clinicians have relied on published institutional experience for interpreting carotid duplex ultrasound studies (CDUS). This study will validate the ultrasound imaging consensus criteria published in 2003.

- **Methods**: The CDUS and angiography results of 376 carotid arteries were analyzed. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare peak systolic velocities (PSVs), end-diastolic velocities (EDVs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and ICA/common carotid (CCA) ratios in detecting < 50%, 50% to 69% (ICA PSV of 125–230 cm/s), and 70% to 99% (PSV of ≥ 230 cm/s) stenosis according to the consensus criteria.

- **Results**: The consensus criteria use a PSV of 125 to 230 cm/s for detecting angiographic stenosis of 50% to 69%, which has a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 68%, and overall accuracy of 85%. A PSV of ≥ 230 cm/s for ≥ 70% stenosis had a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, and overall accuracy of 95%. ROC curves showed that the ICA PSV was significantly better (area under the curve [AUC], 0.97) than EDV (AUC, 0.94) or ICA/CCA ratio (AUC, 0.84; p = 0.036) in detecting ≥ 70% stenosis and ≥ 50% stenosis. Pearson correlations showed a statistical difference between the correlation of PSV with angiography (0.833; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–0.86), EDV with angiography (0.755; 95% CI, 0.71–0.80), and ICA/CCA systolic ratio with angiography (0.601; 95% CI, 0.53–0.66; P < .0001) in detecting 70% to 99% stenosis. Adding the EDV values or the ratios to the PSV values did not improve accuracy.

### Optimizing duplex follow-up in patients with an asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis of less than 60% [^114qHhbz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives: The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study established the benefit of carotid endarterectomy for 60% to 99% asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Optimal follow-up intervals to detect progression from asymptomatic ICA stenosis to symptomatic are critical. Criteria for significant progression include a peak systolic velocity of ≥ 260 cm/s and end-diastolic velocity ≥ 70 cm/s.

Results: A total of 407 patients, encompassing 640 asymptomatic ICAs with < 60% stenosis, underwent serial duplex scans with a mean follow-up of 22 months. Three ICAs (0.5%) became symptomatic and progressed to 60%-99% ICA stenosis at a mean of 21 months.

### Follow-up after carotid endarterectomy and stenting: What to look for and why [^111UW5Xw]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

According to the Society for Vascular Surgery, duplex ultrasound testing after open or endovascular extracranial carotid artery interventions is a clinical practice guideline with a strong recommendation. Neurologic outcomes are improved by recognizing repair site stenosis or atherosclerotic disease progression in the unoperated carotid artery. The benefit of surveillance outweighs its risk, as duplex testing is both complication-free and accurate in detecting internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. Surveillance for greater than 70% ICA stenosis is recommended within 30 days of the procedure, followed by every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually.

- **Classification of stenosis**: Repair site and contralateral ICA stenosis should be classified using angle-corrected pulsed Doppler measurements. Key indicators include peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and the ratio of PSV at the stenosis to a proximal, nondiseased common carotid artery (CCA) segment (ICA/CCA ratio).

Interpretation criteria are as follows: PSV greater than 300 cm/s, EDV greater than 125 cm/s, and an ICA/CCA ratio greater than 4 predict more than 70% repair site stenosis. Endovascular intervention is recommended for carotid repair site stenosis based on the occurrence of an ipsilateral neurologic event and suitable anatomy for angioplasty. In cases of asymptomatic restenosis, intervention is based on the progression of stenosis to elevated PSV and EDV beyond the 70% stenosis threshold values. Additionally, the patient must be considered at high risk for stroke due to contralateral ICA occlusion or incomplete functional patency of the circle of Willis.

### Overestimation of contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis before ipsilateral surgical endarterectomy [^113wP8pu]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible overestimation of the degree of contralateral carotid artery stenosis by duplex in patients with significant bilateral carotid stenoses who are to undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients undergoing CEA in our center over a period of 11 years. Pre- and postoperative duplex ultrasonography measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were compared and used to classify the degree of stenosis. Univariate analysis was performed to indicate possible predictors for contralateral stenosis overestimation.

A total of 384 CEA procedures in 357 patients were performed in our hospital. Pre- and postoperative bilateral duplex measurements were available in 135 patients. Forty-four out of 135 patients (33%) were preoperatively identified as having significant stenosis (> 60%) of the internal carotid artery on both sides. In these patients, postoperative duplex measurements of the contralateral carotid showed a decrease in mean (SD) PSV from 2.53 (1.11) m/s to 1.97 (0.87) m/s (P < 0.01) and a decrease in EDV from 0.87 (0.60) m/s to 0.60 (0.36) m/s (P < 0.01). The absolute changes in contralateral PSV and EDV after CEA were larger among patients with a higher degree of stenosis preoperatively. These changes led to reclassification of stenosis to a lesser degree in 24 (55%) patients. In 16 cases (36%), this resulted in a measured stenosis on the contralateral side of less than 60%.

### Proteomic atlas of atherosclerosis: The contribution of proteoglycans to sex differences, plaque phenotypes, and outcomes [^111sLPhe]. Circulation Research (2023). High credibility.

Plaque classification by ultrasound

Carotid duplex ultrasound is commonly used as a first-line diagnostic tool to assess extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Echolucent plaques are associated with an increased risk for future ischemic cerebrovascular events. Carotid plaque area, as well as plaque neovascularization detected in carotid ultrasound, are also predictive for future cardiovascular events. However, this imaging prediction is mainly based on the separation of advanced from early stages of atherosclerosis. In our study, all patients had advanced atherosclerosis. The proteome changes corresponding to echogenic plaques were predominantly fibrillar collagens and few proteins of the calcification signature. Although ultrasound imaging captures the collagen and lipid content of the plaque, it is not able to distinguish between complex lesions with high inflammation and stable fibroatheroma with lipid deposits and low-grade inflammation. Thus, proteomic signatures could complement carotid imaging read-outs to improve prognostication.

Plaque classification by histology

Histological evaluation with the American Heart Association classification is performed after surgery to assess the morphological properties of atherosclerotic plaques. Although there are some data regarding histological plaque properties and patient outcomes in contemporary cohorts, such as the ability of a histology-based Plaque Vulnerability Index to predict outcomes, symptomatic carotid stenosis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms ipsilateral to stenosis during the preceding six months.

### Carotid ultrasound investigation as a prognostic tool for patients with diabetes mellitus [^11615GeZ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Low credibility.

Duplex examinations at baseline were performed on an Acuson 128 XP10 with a 7.5-MHz linear array probe (Acuson, Malvern, PA). The degree of carotid artery narrowing was obtained according to six categories, corresponding to NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) angiographic graduation. A cut-off at 50% degree of carotid narrowing, measured with ultrasound sonography, was set to obtain clinically useful measures for the effect sizes. The rationale behind this was that carotid narrowing (assessed by sonography) less than 50% is generally considered hemodynamically insignificant. Our interobserver agreement was adequate with respect to the absolute degree of stenosis (κ = 0.83, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.88) and with respect to progression of the disease (κ = 0.85, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.89).

Definitions of risk factors and comorbidities were published previously. Briefly, hypertension was considered present in patients with blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg or in patients taking antihypertensive medication. A family history of atherosclerotic disease was considered positive if its presence had been verified in a first-degree relative. Since patients were enrolled between 2002 and 2003, diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting blood glucose levels > 125 mg/dL (i.e. > 7.0 mmol/L) according to the 1997 criteria of the American Diabetes Association. In addition, according to the 2019 classification of diabetes of the American Diabetes Association, patients with baseline glycohemoglobin A1c levels ≥ 6.5% were retrospectively also considered diabetic.

### Validity of duplex ultrasound as a diagnostic modality for internal carotid artery disease [^113Dfs6D]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

There is an increasing trend to rely on duplex ultrasound rather than angiography to measure an internal carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of ultrasound assessment of carotid stenosis performed in community-based vascular laboratories. We compared ultrasound with angiography in 225 patients referred to us for carotid intervention. Mild lesions were diagnosed by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 89%, and a positive predictive value of 89% compared with angiography. Severe lesions had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 67%, and a positive predictive value of 45%.

Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated the optimal ultrasound cut-off value of 66% stenosis as a predictor of > 60% stenosis measured angiographically, is associated with a false positive rate of 38% and a false negative rate of 9%. Similarly, if a cut-off of 76% on ultrasound is used to predict > 70% stenosis measured angiographically, it would be associated with a 29% false positive rate and a false negative rate of 11%. Despite the value of non-invasive testing for carotid disease, duplex ultrasonography performed in non-accredited and some accredited laboratories may produce highly variable results. Using ultrasound as the sole diagnostic test to determine the severity of carotid stenosis may result in a high number of inappropriate operations and a large proportion of patients who may not be offered treatment due to false negative diagnoses.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for carotid artery stenosis, specifically concerning indications for screening before cardiac interventions, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering a carotid duplex ultrasound in stable patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if they have experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the past six months without having undergone carotid revascularization.

### Rule-out and rule-in of carotid near-occlusion using color duplex ultrasound [^1174VhsP]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

The study has several strengths and limitations. It benefits from a large consecutive prospective data collection with state-of-the-art CTA assessments, which is crucial as CNO assessments vary significantly in routine practice. However, it is unclear if the CTA reference would have been even better with standardized CTA protocols.

CDU data were collected at a center where it was routinely performed as a clinical investigation by several experienced operators. No systematic evaluation of inter-operator variability or operator training was undertaken for CDU measurements. The possibility that expert CDU laboratories may achieve better results by visualizing more distal segments of the ICA cannot be excluded. Therefore, investigations into the influence of the distance between the stenosis and the distal ICA are warranted.

Our data provide no explanation for why distal ICA velocity measured with CDU had worse diagnostic performance than distal ICA flow measured with PC-MRA. Direct comparisons between these methods are warranted. While CNO is common, accounting for 30% of symptomatic ≥ 50% stenosis, our higher CNO prevalence of 40% is likely due to our selection criteria. Since our screening criteria are based on predefined cut-off values for sensitivity and specificity, which are generally considered stable across different prevalence rates, we believe that the higher prevalence is of minor concern regarding our aim to develop a diagnostic CDU algorithm.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for carotid artery stenosis, specifically with respect to indications for screening in the general population, the SVS 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a duplex ultrasound. This should be performed in an accredited vascular laboratory and is advised as the imaging modality of choice over CTA, MRA, or other imaging modalities in asymptomatic patients undergoing screening for CAS.

### Magnetic resonance angiography minimizes need for arteriography after inadequate carotid duplex ultrasound scanning [^112sKGUi]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated whether magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enabled the definition of cerebrovascular anatomy after indeterminate or inadequate results at duplex ultrasound scanning to facilitate patient selection for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and for technical planning.

After implementing a protocol in October 1998 to minimize the use of cerebral arteriography, MRA (arch/cervical two-dimensional and cranial three-dimensional time-of-flight technique) was performed in 138 consecutive patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease and inconclusive duplex scans obtained by an ICAVL-approved laboratory. The ability of MRA to define anatomic features unresolved at duplex scanning was compared across categories of duplex scan inadequacies. Operative outcomes were compared between patients requiring MRA before CEA (n = 66) and a cohort undergoing CEA based on duplex scan results only (n = 69).

Incomplete imaging of the carotid bifurcation, due to high bifurcation, long (> 3 cm) internal carotid artery (ICA) plaque, or calcific shadows, was the most common reason for inadequate duplex scans (n = 74, 53%), followed by borderline severe ICA disease (23.17%), suspected extracervical disease (supra-aortic trunk, vertebral, or intracranial, 22, 16%), ICA near-occlusion (12.9%), and diffuse restenosis (7.5%). MRA enabled resolution of duplex scan inadequacies in 95% of patients with disease confined to the carotid bifurcation, and 90% of all patients, but was least accurate for delineation of extracervical lesions.

### Ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced MRA in ICA-stenosis: is conventional angiography obsolete [^115EKu2S]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The standard techniques for the screening and staging of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis are Doppler (continuous wave) and duplex sonography. For the imaging of ICA occlusive disease, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is replacing digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The purpose of this observational study was to assess whether contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) combined with ultrasound provided sufficient information for the planning of surgical treatment.

- **Methods**: CE-MRA was performed in 195 patients (mean age 67.5 years) with sonographic evidence of severe ICA stenosis. The MRA examination protocol contained a heavily T1-weighted contrast bolus-enhanced 3D-gradient echo sequence. The degree of stenosis was estimated retrospectively by two experienced neuroradiologists who were blinded to the sonographic findings.

- **Results**: The consistency of MRA and ultrasound was sufficient to plan thrombendarterectomy in 182 out of 195 patients. The estimations of the degree of stenosis were congruent between MRA and ultrasound in 91% of 197 vessels with high-degree carotid artery stenosis. CE-MRA evaluation had a high interobserver agreement. In 3 cases, the ultrasound examination diagnosed a filiform ICA stenosis that was not visible with MRA. In all these cases, DSA and the intraoperative findings revealed very short (1–2 mm), high-grade, eccentric stenosis. CE-MRA correctly detected patency in 5 patients with high-grade and low-flow carotid artery stenosis, which had been regarded as occluded by ultrasound. Conversely, in CE-MRA, two occluded vessels were falsely considered patent.

### Analysis of atherosclerotic plaque distribution in the carotid artery [^116oCASX]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data collection and statistical analysis were conducted using duplex scans performed on all patients at the health promotion center once during the study period. Carotid plaque presence was defined as a focal wall thickness greater than 1.5 mm or a focal thickening greater than 50% of the adjacent wall segments. To evaluate the distribution of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, we analyzed the circumferential and axial distribution on duplex ultrasound axial images. We classified the location of plaques as anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral sections from the grayscale axial image of the common carotid, at the bifurcation, and in the ICA (Figure 1B). Carotid plaque score (CPS) was calculated by adding one point for each detected section. In cases of multisectional involvement, all involved sections were scored. The χ² analysis was used to compare the axial distribution change of CPS. Two-tailed p < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Comparison of intraoperative and postoperative duplex ultrasound for carotid endarterectomy [^112gYhjz]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Intraoperative (IO) duplex ultrasound (DU) is used to identify correctable technical defects at the time of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Postoperative (p.o.) DU is used to evaluate residual stenosis. We compared IO and p.o. DU to determine their value and significance in the management of patients undergoing CEA. We performed completion IO DU following CEA and p.o. DU a mean of 8 weeks after surgery in 78 patients. IO studies were performed by the operating surgeon, while p.o. studies were conducted in an accredited vascular laboratory.

Peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured in the internal carotid (ICA), external carotid, and common carotid (CCA) arteries. The criteria for an abnormal study were an ICA PSV > 150 cm/sec and a ratio of ICA to CCA PSVs (ICA/CCA) > 3.0. Completion angiograms were also performed on all patients intraoperatively. Technical defects identified on DU or angiogram were corrected whenever possible.

From our results, we concluded that in many patients, early p.o. DU will demonstrate an elevated ICA PSV compared to the IO PSV. If the ICA/CCA ratio remains normal, this increase is unlikely to represent clinically relevant residual stenosis. A postoperative ICA/CCA ratio > 3.0 may be a more reliable indicator of significant stenosis and a lesion that is likely to progress or occlude than PSVs alone.

### Surveillance duplex ultrasound prompted interventions after carotid endarterectomy [^11528gvv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Societal guidelines recommend duplex ultrasound (DUS) surveillance beyond 30 days after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for patients with risk factors for restenosis or who underwent primary closure. However, the appropriate duration of this surveillance has not yet been identified, and the rate at which DUS surveillance prompts intervention is unknown. Multiple calls for decreasing healthcare spending that does not provide value, including unnecessary testing, have been made. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate of intervention prompted by surveillance DUS on the ipsilateral or contralateral carotid artery after CEA and determine the value of continued surveillance by determining the rate of DUS-prompted intervention.

- **Methods**: A single-center, retrospective chart review of all patients older than 18 years who had undergone CEA from August 2009 to July 2022 was performed. Patients with at least one postoperative duplex in our Intersocietal Accreditation Council-accredited ultrasound lab were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with incomplete medical charts or patients who underwent a concomitant procedure. The primary endpoint was a return to the operating room for subsequent intervention based on abnormal surveillance DUS findings. Secondary endpoints were the number of postoperative surveillance duplexes, duration of surveillance, and incidence of perioperative stroke. The study participant data were queried for patients who had a diagnosis of stroke that occurred following their procedure.

Results for this study reported a total of 767 patients, accounting…

### Screening for carotid disease and surveillance for carotid restenosis [^112iwv3r]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Duplex scanning is currently used to screen patients with suspected carotid artery disease, as the sole diagnostic test before carotid endarterectomy, and for follow-up surveillance after carotid surgery. Although the role of screening in patients with neurologic symptoms is generally accepted, noninvasive screening of asymptomatic patients remains controversial. The basic rationale for screening is to detect disease that can be treated to improve the patient's outcome.

Although debate over the value of endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis will continue, there is abundant evidence from natural history studies and clinical trials indicating that patients with asymptomatic high-grade (80% to 99% by duplex) stenoses can benefit from surgery if it can be performed with an acceptably low perioperative complication rate. Therefore, screening appears justified in patients with asymptomatic neck bruits and patients being evaluated for peripheral arterial or coronary artery disease. Those who are found to have moderate stenoses (50% to 79%) should be followed up at 6-month intervals to detect disease progression that may require surgery. Patients with less than 50% carotid stenoses can be followed up annually.

Early restenosis is relatively common after carotid endarterectomy, occurring in about 20% of patients followed up with serial duplex scans, but it appears to have a benign natural history in the majority of patients. Reoperation is indicated only for symptomatic reLesions and selected high-grade asymptomatic restenoses.

### Computational methods to automate the initial interpretation of lower extremity arterial Doppler and duplex carotid ultrasound studies [^115LHKTr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Lower extremity arterial Doppler (LEAD) and duplex carotid ultrasound studies are used for the initial evaluation of peripheral arterial disease and carotid stenosis. However, intra- and inter-laboratory variability exists between interpreters, and other interpreter responsibilities can delay the timeliness of the report. To address these deficits, we examined whether machine learning algorithms could be used to classify these Doppler ultrasound studies.

- **Methods**: We developed a hierarchical deep learning model to classify aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and trifurcation disease in LEAD ultrasound studies. Additionally, a random forest machine learning algorithm was created to classify the amount of carotid stenosis from duplex carotid ultrasound studies, using experienced physician interpretation in an active, credentialed vascular laboratory as the reference standard. Waveforms, pressures, flow velocities, and the presence of plaque were input into a hierarchical neural network. Artificial intelligence was developed to automate the interpretation of these LEAD and carotid duplex ultrasound studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the confusion matrix.

- **Results**: We extracted 5,761 LEAD ultrasound studies from 2015 to 2017 and 18,650 duplex carotid ultrasound studies from 2016 to 2018 from the Indiana University Health system. The results demonstrated the ability of artificial intelligence algorithms and methods, with 97.0% accuracy for predicting normal cases, 88.2% accuracy for aortoiliac disease, 90.1% accuracy for femoropopliteal disease, and 90.5% accuracy for trifurcation disease.

### Duplex criteria for grading of external carotid stenosis [^112wh5ob]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

External carotid artery (ECA) stenosis is an independent predictor of mortality. Furthermore, the progression of both ECA and internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis has been linked to an increased risk of ipsilateral ischemic events in asymptomatic patients. Universally accepted duplex velocity criteria for predicting ECA stenosis do not exist.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients undergoing angiography and carotid duplex assessments were compared (n = 140). Peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the ICA, common carotid artery (CCA), and ECA were recorded. The ECA/CCA PSV ratio was calculated, and these parameters were compared with angiographic ECA measurements. Receiver-operator curve analysis was employed to determine optimal criteria for identifying ECA stenosis greater than 50%.

- **Results**: In patients with minimal ipsilateral ICA disease, for the detection of ECA stenosis of ≥ 50%, an ECA PSV > 148 cm/sec provided a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 76.2%, and an overall accuracy of 77.1%. An ECA/CCA PSV ratio of 1.45 offered a sensitivity of 73.7%, specificity of 66.7%, and accuracy of 68.2%. In patients with ICA stenosis ≥ 50%, for the detection of ECA stenosis of ≥ 50%, an ECA PSV > 179 cm/sec provided a sensitivity of 50%, specificity of 79.6%, and overall accuracy of 71.3%. An ECA/CCA PSV ratio of ≥ 1.89 provided a sensitivity of 71.9%, specificity of 72.7%, and overall accuracy of 72.5%.

- **Conclusions**: ECA PSV and ECA/CCA PSV ratios appear to be useful metrics for the prediction of unilateral high-grade ECA stenosis.

### Rule-out and rule-in of carotid near-occlusion using color duplex ultrasound [^1147RbBt]. Neuroradiology (2025). High credibility.

This study was conducted as a single-centre cross-sectional study at the University Hospital of Northern Sweden, Umeå, Sweden. We prospectively included consecutive patients with ≥ 50% carotid stenosis between 2018 and 2022. The study logistics were managed at the stroke unit, the sole provider of preoperative carotid evaluations for 11 referring hospitals, serving a population of 880,000. Most participants had symptomatic stenosis and were assessed for carotid surgery. Some participants were found to have asymptomatic stenosis during the preoperative assessment, while others with known asymptomatic stenosis were summoned specifically for study purposes. The inclusion criteria required participants to have 50–100% carotid stenosis on at least one side, determined by any exam type. Participants provided informed consent; however, we excluded those who did not undergo CTA and CDU, those without a ≥ 50% atherosclerotic stenosis on at least one side, or those with an unclear cause of small distal ICA on the CTA assessments. Both CDU and CTA were part of the clinical routine but were arranged as part of the study when routine adherence was lacking.

This research is part of several preplanned analyses using the same material. The sample size was calculated to accommodate the analysis requiring the most participants, which was not the case for this study, resulting in an overpowered study. The regional ethics board in Umeå, Sweden, approved the study.

- **CDU**: CDU examinations were performed by several vascular technologists in the Department of…

### Reappraisal of velocity criteria for carotid bulb/internal carotid artery stenosis utilizing high-resolution B-mode ultrasound validated with computed tomography angiography [^116puX7Z]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The reliability of the most commonly used duplex ultrasound (DUS) velocity thresholds for internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis has been questioned, as these thresholds were developed using less precise methods to grade stenosis severity based on angiography. In this study, maximum percent diameter carotid bulb ICA stenosis, following the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) method, was objectively measured using high-resolution B-mode DUS validated with computed tomography angiography (CTA) to determine optimum velocity thresholds for stenosis of ≥ 50% and ≥ 80% in the bulb internal carotid artery (ICA).

- **Methods**: B-mode DUS and CTA images of 74 bulb ICA stenoses were compared to validate the accuracy of the DUS measurements. In 337 instances of mild, moderate, and severe bulb ICA stenoses (n = 232 patients), the minimal residual lumen and the maximum outer bulb/proximal ICA diameter were determined on longitudinal and transverse images, contrasting with the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method, which uses the normal distal ICA lumen diameter as the denominator. Severe calcified carotid segments and patients with contralateral occlusion were excluded. In each study, the highest peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) velocities, as well as the ICA/common carotid artery (CCA) ratio, were recorded. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimum threshold for each hemodynamic parameter was determined to predict stenosis of ≥ 50% (n = 281) and ≥ 80% (n = 62) in the bulb ICA.

- **Results**: The mean age of patients was 74 ± 8 years, with 49% being female. Clinical results continue beyond this point.

### Near-occlusion is difficult to diagnose with common carotid ultrasound methods [^112MpypB]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how to best detect near-occlusion on carotid ultrasound, although it is certain that improvements are needed. First, it is unclear what the best threshold for a "low stenosis velocity" should be. A relevant factor is that cases below this velocity threshold will be diagnosed as either near-occlusions or less than 50% stenosis based on visual inspection of the stenosis severity. We found that three cases were misclassified on such visual inspection in routine practice: two near-occlusions as less than 50% stenosis and one 54% stenosis as near-occlusion, highlighting that this approach is not without problems. Similar misdiagnosis by interpreting near-occlusion with low flow findings as less than 50% stenosis has been reported.

With these three misdiagnoses having stenosis PSV 133–203 cm/s, the best stenosis PSV threshold for "low velocity" is likely slightly above 125 cm/s, but dedicated prospective studies are needed to clarify this issue. Furthermore, suspected near-occlusions were not pre-specified categories, hence not systematically used in our entire cohort, so some with similar findings might have been missed. All these findings have been reported previously, and additional types of unusual findings might be possible. Distal artery size was not systematically assessed, in large part due to the lack of diagnostic threshold for such a measurement. However, in our experience from angiography, the reduced artery size of many near-occlusions is modest (not clear unless comparing with other arteries) and only visible well beyond the bulb, a region commonly not reachable with ultrasound.

### Duplex ultrasound may lead to misclassification of carotid artery stenosis [^113U2adE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Carotid duplex ultrasonography (CDUS) is often the first-line imaging modality for clinical evaluation of carotid disease. Despite improved equipment and standardization of vascular imaging protocols, CDUS can be technician-dependent and unreliable in calcified blood vessels. The aim of this study was to assess variability in carotid stenosis severity measured using CDUS compared to reference high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In this prospective cohort study designed to study long-term brain health outcomes, we enrolled 123 participants with a diagnosis of asymptomatic carotid disease and/or ≥ 2 cardiovascular risk factors between the ages of 50–85 from vascular and cardiology clinics in Tucson, AZ, for the ongoing Carotids and Minds (CAM) study. Using a specialized radiofrequency coil for carotid imaging, high-resolution time-of-flight (0.63 x 0.63 x 1.0 mm³) and T1-weighted (in-plane resolution = 0.63 x 0.63 mm²; slice thickness = 2.0 mm) MRIs were acquired to evaluate carotid stenosis severity. A neuroradiologist, vascular surgeon, and MRI specialist utilized cross-sectional measurements of carotid images to adjudicate stenosis percentage based on NASCET criteria.

Agreement between percent carotid stenosis categories (< 50%, 50–69%, 70–99%, 100%) derived from MRI and clinical CDUS was assessed using Cohen's Kappa with linear weights (κw). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate how well CDUS identifies clinically significant stenosis defined by MRI.

246 carotid arteries were evaluated for percent stenosis using both CDUS and MRI.

### Variability in measurement of internal carotid artery stenosis by arch angiography and duplex ultrasonography — time for a reappraisal [^112i9Qfy]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-observer variability of ICA stenosis measurement using duplex, ECST, and NASCET methods.

The design involved a retrospective review of arch angiograms and carotid duplex scans in 50 patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Carotid stenoses were calculated by three independent observers according to NASCET and ECST methods. Variation between observers for NASCET and ECST was determined. For each observer, the variation between NASCET and ECST was determined. The variation between duplex and both NASCET and ECST was also assessed.

- **Results**: Inter-observer agreement on the degree of ICA stenosis was clinically and statistically good for NASCET but was poorer for ECST. For each observer, comparison between NASCET and ECST showed 95% limits of agreement of around 50 percentage points. Comparison of duplex with NASCET and ECST showed similar 95% limits of agreement.

- **Conclusions**: Arch angiography allows reproducible measurement of carotid stenosis by the NASCET method between different observers. For the ECST method, reproducibility is not as good. Variations in results between NASCET and ECST and between angiography and duplex are significant. In view of the similar results of the NASCET and ECST trials, this suggests that the degree of stenosis may only be a surrogate marker for outcome following carotid endarterectomy.

### Grading of internal carotid artery stenosis: Validation of Doppler/duplex ultrasound criteria and angiography against endarterectomy specimen [^115Lvjnb]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasound has replaced angiography prior to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in many institutions; however, the indications for CEA are based on angiographically controlled studies and widely accepted ultrasound criteria do not exist. Consequently, the reliability of Doppler and/or duplex ultrasound to predict a high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis needs to be proven.

- **Design**: Prospective validation study.

- **Materials**: One hundred and fifty carotid bifurcations assessed by ultrasound and selective angiography, and 68 acrylate outcasts of carotid specimen after eversion CEA.

- **Methods**: ICA stenosis was measured angiographically according to the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria. Combined Doppler acoustic standard criteria (CDASC), peak systolic frequency (PSF), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) served as criteria for the ultrasound assessment. These criteria and the results of angiography were compared to the degree of ICA stenosis determined by specimen measurements.

- **Results**: The median degree of ICA stenosis as assessed by angiography (82%, range 56–97%) and CDASC (83%, range 50–99%) corresponded well to the specimen measurements (80%, range 50–95%). The sensitivity of angiography and CDASC to predict a 70–90% ICA stenosis (ECST criteria) compared to the specimen measurements was 88% and 95%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) reached 92% and 96%, respectively. CDASC were equivalent to angiography and were superior to the best single frequency or velocity parameters. If CDASC do not indicate a ≥ 70% ICA stenosis, in spite of a PSV ≥ 180 cm/s and/or an…

### Pseudo-occlusions of the internal carotid artery: A rationale for treatment on the basis of a modified carotid duplex scan protocol [^115iF5Fr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a modified duplex scanning technique that may detect a patent internal carotid artery (ICA) previously believed to be occluded by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), standard duplex protocols, or both. Additionally, we attempted to develop selection criteria for operability based on the lumen diameter and wall thickness of the post-stenotic ICA segment.

- **Method**: In the past 22 months, 17 patients (12 men, 5 women) with ICA occlusions reported by MRA (10 patients) or duplex scanning (7 patients) were found to have patent arteries when subjected to this duplex scanning protocol. The approach included:
	- The use of low pulse repetition frequency (150–350 Hz), maximal persistence, and enhanced sensitivity of color and power angiography modes.
	- An 8-MHz to 5-MHz probe to visualize the most distal extracranial segment of the ICA.
	- Measurements of the lumen diameter and wall thickness of the post-stenotic ICA.

	- The ages of the patients ranged from 53 to 80 years (mean age, 71 years). Seven patients (41%) were asymptomatic.

- **Results**: Extremely low peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were detected distal to the stenotic segment in the ICA in all cases, ranging from 5 to 30 cm/s (mean, 14 ± 8 cm/s) and 0 to 8 cm/s (mean, 4.5 ± 2.0 cm/s), respectively. The luminal diameter of the post-stenotic ICA varied from 0.7 to 3.6 mm (mean, 2.0 ± 1.1 mm), and the wall thickness ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 mm (mean, 0.9 ± 0.3 mm) in all patients.

### Ultrasound velocity criteria for carotid in-stent restenosis [^115jqmgt]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Low credibility.

To examine duplex ultrasound (US) criteria for carotid in-stent restenosis (ISR), carotid artery stent (CAS) placement presents an alternative to surgery for the treatment of carotid stenosis in high surgical risk patients. US serves as the primary method to monitor carotid stent patency. This study investigates US velocity measurements in carotid ISR.

Two hundred sixty consecutive patients with CAS placement from June 2000 to June 2004 were monitored with serial US. ISR was determined using standard US velocity criteria for nonstented carotid arteries, employing peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and the internal carotid artery to common carotid velocity ratio (ICA/CCA ratio). Patients suspected of having carotid ISR ≥ 50% by US underwent invasive angiography, with stenosis graded by NASCET criteria. Results were compared to patients with nonstented carotid artery stenosis using a two-tailed Student's t-test.

- **Results**: PSV and ICA/CCA ratio increased significantly in ISR. For 50–69% stenotic arteries, the mean ICA/CCA ratio was 2.76 ± 0.7 in the ISR group compared to 2.04 ± 0.3 in the nonstented carotid group (P). In ≥ 70% stenotic arteries, there were increases in PSV (520 ± 93 vs. 362 ± 60, P). Optimal thresholds for ≥ 50% ISR were determined as PSV 240 cm/sec and ICA/CCA ratio 2.45.

### Preoperative evaluation of carotid artery stenosis: Comparison of contrast-enhanced MR angiography and duplex sonography with digital subtraction angiography [^1125TiGM]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced MR angiography and extracranial color-coded duplex sonography are noninvasive, preoperative imaging modalities for the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis. Innovative techniques and improvements in image quality require frequent reassessment of accuracy, reliability, and diagnostic value compared with those of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We evaluated contrast-enhanced MR angiography and duplex sonography compared with DSA for the detection of high-grade carotid artery stenoses.

- **Methods**: Four readers, blinded to clinical symptoms and the outcome of other studies, independently evaluated stenoses on contrast-enhanced MR angiograms in 71 vessels of 39 symptomatic patients. Duplex sonography was also performed in all vessels. The severity of stenosis was defined according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria (0–29%, 30–69%, 70–99%, 100%). Results of both modalities were compared with the corresponding DSA findings.

- **Results**: Contrast-enhanced MR angiography had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.9% and 79.1%, respectively, for the identification of carotid artery stenoses of 70% or greater. Sensitivity and specificity of duplex sonography were 92.9% and 81.9%, respectively. Combining data from both tests revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 81.4%, respectively, for concordant results (80% of vessels).

- **Conclusion**: Concordant results of contrast-enhanced MR angiography and duplex sonography increase the diagnostic sensitivity to 100%. The reliability of MR angiography is comparable to DSA, making it a viable noninvasive alternative for the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis.

### Duplex ultrasound criteria for defining the severity of carotid stenosis [^113EkkYy]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) criteria for grading > 50% carotid artery stenosis is typically divided into broad categories such as 50–79% stenosis, 80–99% stenosis, and occlusion. The purpose of this study is to validate DUS criteria for stratifying 50 to 100% carotid stenosis into 10% intervals using digital subtraction cerebral angiography (DSCA) as the standard of comparison. Between 1996 and 2001, 163 patients were evaluated with duplex ultrasound and angiography. A total of 326 carotid arteries were studied using DUS in an accredited ICAVL vascular laboratory.

Threshold velocity criteria for determining the degree of carotid stenosis was defined according to seven categories: < 50%, 50–59%, 60–69%, 70–79%, 80–89%, 90–99%, and occlusion. Treatment decisions were based on the angiographic findings. In cases where the degree of stenosis as defined by duplex velocity criteria did not correlate with angiographically defined stenosis, each record was reviewed to determine whether the angiographic findings altered the surgeon's treatment decision.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for DUS-defined degree of stenosis as compared to angiographically defined stenosis were determined. There was a high correlation (R = 0.96) between duplex scan and angiography in 93% (302/326) of the cases. Clinical management was altered in only 3% (10/326) of the cases because of the results of angiography. The DUS velocity criteria to grade the severity of carotid disease in 10% intervals is reliable and accurate.

### Follow-up after carotid stenting with the CASPER stent system: A duplex ultrasound evaluation [^1134cHBy]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report the results of duplex ultrasound evaluation of consecutive patients after carotid stenting with the double-layer Carotid Artery Stent designed to Prevent Embolic Release (CASPER) stent system.

Between January 2014 and June 2017, a single-center, retrospective study of 101 consecutive patients (21.8% female; median age, 72.1 years) was performed. Patients with internal carotid artery stenosis treated with the CASPER stent were included. Eligibility criteria for stenting included stenosis of ≥ 70% of the vessel diameter (or ≥ 50% diameter with ulceration) in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, or ≥ 80% stenosis in asymptomatic patients at the carotid artery bifurcation or the proximal cervical internal carotid artery. Duplex ultrasound examination was performed before and within 24 hours of implantation, as well as at 14 days, and 3, 6, and 12 months.

At the 12-month follow-up visit, moderate in-stent restenosis (ISR) (≥ 50% and < 70%) was detected in three stents (2.8%) and severe (≥ 70%) ISR in two (1.9%; including one case of stent occlusion). All but the two latter patients remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period. One patient required retreatment for ISR following a minor stroke, and another patient with stent occlusion also re-presented with a minor stroke. Multivariable logistic regression was unable to detect any significant factors associated with ISR.

In conclusion, duplex ultrasound examination after carotid stenting is a useful tool for patient follow-up and determination of ISR. We found a low incidence of ISR assessed by duplex ultrasound.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for carotid artery stenosis, specifically concerning indications for screening before cardiac interventions, ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering screening for carotid disease with duplex ultrasound in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the following situations. This allows patients to be better informed of the increased risks associated with coronary artery bypass in the presence of concurrent carotid disease:

- **Aged > 70 years**: A higher risk category due to advanced age.

- **History of TIA or stroke**: Indicates a predisposition for cerebrovascular events.

- **Carotid bruit or left mainstem disease**: Physical or diagnostic findings that suggest vascular abnormalities.
