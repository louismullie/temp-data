## Question

Folate level is 3 with elevated homocysteine and no B12 deficiency — what dose of folate should be supplemented?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate folate supplementation dose for a patient with a serum folate of 3, elevated homocysteine, and confirmed absence of vitamin B12 deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnostic context and the safety prerequisite of excluding B12 deficiency. Then, I should verify evidence-based dosing ranges and when higher doses are actually indicated. Next, I will review data on homocysteine-lowering efficacy versus clinical outcomes. After that, I need to determine duration and monitoring, including when to reassess B12 if concerns arise. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safe recommendation and address special circumstances such as malabsorption or drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical and laboratory context before jumping to dosing. A serum folate of 3 ng/mL is frankly deficient by standard ranges, and elevated homocysteine is the expected functional correlate of folate deficiency; however, I should confirm that B12 deficiency has truly been excluded because folate monotherapy can mask B12-related anemia while permitting neurologic damage to progress, which is why labels and guidelines insist on ruling out B12 deficiency prior to folate treatment [^1161thdW] [^112TSbGP] [^111FUsk2] [^113cfAe2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about goals — let me state them explicitly and verify the evidence base. I need to correct the folate deficiency and normalize the CBC, lower homocysteine as a biochemical target, and prioritize safety by avoiding unnecessarily high doses; importantly, I should acknowledge that while folate reliably lowers homocysteine, large trials have not consistently shown reductions in major cardiovascular events, so homocysteine is best treated here as a biochemical marker of folate repletion rather than a guaranteed cardiovascular risk modulator [^116qYLVC] [^114m1Rfv].

> Next, I should review authoritative dosing guidance. The FDA labeling indicates oral therapy as preferred and states that the usual therapeutic dose in adults is up to 1 mg daily, warns not to use doses greater than 0.1 mg unless B12 deficiency is excluded, and notes that daily doses above 1 mg do not enhance hematologic effect and are largely excreted unchanged; maintenance for adults after correction is 0.4 mg daily, with higher maintenance in pregnancy and lactation, and certain comorbid states may necessitate higher maintenance under supervision [^113cfAe2]. Wait, I initially wondered if 5 mg would be more effective across the board, but I need to correct that thought — BSH guidance reserves 5 mg dosing for special circumstances such as chronic hemolysis and dialysis rather than routine folate deficiency, so routine deficiency should follow the standard 0.4–1 mg framework unless special indications exist [^116R2yoW].

> I will now examine the dose–response data for homocysteine lowering because that often guides whether I aim for 0.4 mg versus 0.8–1 mg. A patient-level meta-analysis showed that doses at or above 0.8 mg are typically required to achieve maximal reductions in plasma homocysteine, with greater proportional reductions at higher baseline homocysteine; adding small amounts of B12 can contribute additional lowering, whereas B6 adds little to none in this context [^115Go8Hp]. A dose-finding RCT reported that 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg all reduce homocysteine over time, with 0.8 mg reaching maximal response by about 6 weeks and outperforming lower doses in those with higher baseline homocysteine, though absolute differences between doses were modest overall [^117MSBbb]. Even 0.5 mg daily can meaningfully lower homocysteine over four weeks in postmenopausal women, with larger effects in those starting with higher levels, which reinforces the dose–response relationship and baseline-dependence of effect size [^111gC6dq].

> Let me synthesize an optimal therapeutic dose using both guideline ceilings and efficacy data. Given confirmed absence of B12 deficiency, a starting dose of 0.8–1 mg daily is reasonable to achieve near-maximal homocysteine reduction while staying within the FDA's therapeutic window; doses above 1 mg lack added hematologic benefit and mainly increase urinary excretion, so I should avoid exceeding 1 mg for routine deficiency, and recognize that 0.4 mg may be suboptimal in patients with marked baseline hyperhomocysteinemia [^113cfAe2] [^115Go8Hp].

> Now, I should define duration and monitoring, and let me double-check that I align with diagnostic best practices. Clinically, 4–8 weeks of therapeutic dosing is typical to correct megaloblastic changes, after which I should reassess serum folate, CBC with MCV, and plasma homocysteine to document biochemical and hematologic recovery; serum folate is the first-line test of folate status, and homocysteine can help confirm functional adequacy in special circumstances, with thresholds often using > 15 µmol/L as elevated, though local reference ranges apply [^112TSbGP] [^1161thdW]. If any doubt about emerging B12 issues arises during follow-up, I should check methylmalonic acid and possibly holotranscobalamin, especially when B12 levels are borderline or clinical suspicion remains high, to avoid missing a masked B12 deficiency [^117XBUaq] [^1154xs65].

> But wait, what about malabsorption and drug interactions — do I need parenteral folate or higher doses? Let me verify. Even when patients poorly absorb food folates, orally administered folic acid is absorbed via carrier-mediated transport in the proximal small intestine, making oral therapy generally effective; parenteral folate is rarely required unless there is severe intestinal disease or specialized nutrition support, and selected conditions like chronic hemolytic states or dialysis can justify higher dosing such as 5 mg under specialist direction [^113cfAe2] [^116R2yoW]. I should also remember that MTHFR C677T variants can influence homocysteine physiology, but 0.4–0.8 mg folic acid typically lowers homocysteine across genotypes, with TT genotype often showing the largest proportional benefit, so 0.8–1 mg remains appropriate without genotype tailoring here [^116Uicqm]. Finally, I need to remain vigilant for concomitant metformin-associated B12 decline, which is progressive and can raise homocysteine; monitoring B12 in metformin users is advised in guidelines when suspicion exists, with supplementation as indicated [^117VtTbY] [^111x7sbU].

> I should confirm safety cautions one more time before finalizing. Administering folic acid alone is improper therapy in unrecognized pernicious anemia or other B12-deficient megaloblastic states because it can correct hematologic indices while neurological injury progresses, so continued vigilance for neurologic symptoms is needed even after an initial B12 exclusion, and I should keep the folic acid dose at or below 1 mg daily for routine deficiency since higher daily doses lack additional hematologic benefit and are largely excreted [^111FUsk2] [^113cfAe2].

> Let me now provide a concise, practical plan and double-check that it aligns with the evidence and labeling. Initiate folic acid 0.8–1 mg orally once daily to correct deficiency and achieve near-maximal homocysteine lowering; continue for approximately 4–8 weeks, then recheck serum folate, CBC with MCV, and homocysteine to document response; after normalization, step down to 0.4 mg daily as maintenance, with higher maintenance only for specific states like pregnancy/lactation or under specialist advice, and remain vigilant for neurologic symptoms that would prompt reassessment for B12 with MMA if needed; note that while homocysteine will fall, large trials have not reliably shown cardiovascular event reduction, so this strategy is aimed at correcting deficiency and its hematologic and metabolic consequences rather than guaranteed vascular risk modification [^113cfAe2] [^115Go8Hp] [^112TSbGP] [^116qYLVC].

For elevated homocysteine with normal B12, **0.4–0.8 mg/day** of folic acid is the standard dose to lower homocysteine [^115Go8Hp], with maximal effect by 6–12 weeks [^117MSBbb]. If homocysteine remains high after 12 weeks, **increase to 1 mg/day** [^113cfAe2]; higher doses are rarely needed and excess is excreted [^113cfAe2]. Always confirm B12 sufficiency before starting folate [^111FUsk2], and monitor homocysteine and B12 during therapy [^117XBUaq].

---

## Recommended folate supplementation dosage

- **Standard dosage**: 0.4–0.8 mg/day (400–800 mcg/day) [^115Go8Hp] is effective for lowering homocysteine [^117MSBbb] in adults with normal B12.

- **Maximal effect**: Typically achieved within 6–12 weeks [^117MSBbb] of daily supplementation.

- **Dose escalation**: If homocysteine remains elevated after 12 weeks, increase to 1 mg/day (1,000 mcg/day) [^113cfAe2].

- **Higher doses**: Rarely needed; excess is excreted unchanged in urine [^113cfAe2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended dosage

- **Meta-analysis**: 0.2–0.8 mg/day reduces homocysteine by ~20–30% [^115Go8Hp], with greater reductions at higher baseline homocysteine [^116qYLVC].

- **Dose-finding trial**: 0.4–0.8 mg/day achieves maximal homocysteine reduction by 6–12 weeks [^117MSBbb]; 0.2 mg/day is suboptimal at early time points.

- **Postmenopausal trial**: 0.5 mg/day for 4 weeks [^111gC6dq] reduced homocysteine by ~28%.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Homocysteine monitoring**: Recheck at 6–12 weeks [^117MSBbb] to assess response.

- **B12 monitoring**: Periodically reassess to avoid masking deficiency [^111FUsk2].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for neurological symptoms or adverse effects.

---

## Safety considerations

Safety considerations include **masking B12 deficiency** — confirm B12 sufficiency before starting folate [^111FUsk2] — and generally minimal **adverse effects**, as folate is well tolerated and excess is excreted [^113cfAe2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended folate dosage** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| - Elevated homocysteine <br/> - Normal B12 | 0.4–0.8 mg/day | - Homocysteine at 6–12 weeks <br/> - Periodic B12 |
| Persistent elevation after 12 weeks | Increase to 1 mg/day | Continued homocysteine and B12 monitoring |

---

The standard folate dose to lower homocysteine when B12 is normal is **0.4–0.8 mg/day** [^115Go8Hp]. If needed, increase to 1 mg/day [^113cfAe2], and monitor homocysteine and B12 to ensure efficacy and safety [^117XBUaq].

### Folic acid [^113cfAe2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Oral administration is preferred. Although most patients with malabsorption cannot absorb food folates, they are able to absorb folic acid given orally. Parenteral administration is not advocated but may be necessary in some individuals, such as patients receiving parenteral or enteral alimentation. Doses greater than 0.1 mg should not be used unless anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency has been ruled out or is being adequately treated with a cobalamin. Daily doses greater than 1 mg do not enhance the hematologic effect, and most of the excess is excreted unchanged in the urine.

The usual therapeutic dosage in adults and children, regardless of age, is up to 1 mg daily. Resistant cases may require larger doses.

When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a daily maintenance level should be used: 0.1 mg for infants, up to 0.3 mg for children under 4 years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, but never less than 0.1 mg/day. Patients should be kept under close supervision, and adjustments to the maintenance level should be made if relapse appears imminent.

In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased.

Dietary supplementation with B vitamins that lower blood homocysteine concentrations is expected to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but there has been uncertainty about the optimum regimen to use for this purpose.

- **Objective**: The objectives were to ascertain the lowest dose of folic acid associated with the maximum reduction in homocysteine concentrations and to determine the additional relevance of vitamins B-12 and B-6.

- **Design**: A meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving individual data on 2,596 subjects assessed the effect on plasma homocysteine concentrations of different doses of folic acid and of the addition of vitamins B-12 and B-6.

- **Results**: The proportional reductions in plasma homocysteine concentrations produced by folic acid were greater at higher homocysteine concentrations. Proportional increases were independent of factors such as age, sex, baseline homocysteine concentration, or study duration. In combination with small daily doses of folic acid, vitamin B-12 produced significant additional reductions in plasma homocysteine concentrations, whereas vitamin B-6 did not. Doses ≥ 0.8 mg folic acid are typically required to achieve the maximal reduction in plasma homocysteine concentrations produced by folic acid.

### A dose-finding trial of the effect of long-term folic acid intervention: Implications for food fortification policy [^117MSBbb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The lowest dose of folic acid required to achieve effective reductions in homocysteine is controversial but important for food fortification policy, given recent concerns about the potential adverse effects of overexposure to this vitamin.

- **Objective**: We compared the effectiveness of 0.2 mg folic acid/d with that of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/d at lowering homocysteine concentrations over a 6-month period.

- **Design**: A randomized dose-finding trial with folic acid was conducted. Of 203 participants screened, 101 patients with ischemic heart disease and 71 healthy volunteers completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or folic acid at doses of 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 mg/d for 26 weeks; subsamples of patients with ischemic heart disease were also examined at 6 or 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Participants with higher baseline homocysteine concentrations had the greatest reductions in homocysteine in response to folic acid doses of 0.2 mg (-20.6%), 0.4 mg (-20.7%), and 0.8 mg (-27.8%); in those with lower baseline homocysteine concentrations, the responses were -8.2%, -8.9%, and -8.3%, respectively. No significant differences in homocysteine responses to the different doses were observed. In the patient group sampled at intervals during the intervention, the maximal homocysteine response appeared to be achieved by 6 weeks in the 0.8-mg/d group and by 12 weeks in the 0.4-mg/d group. However, the homocysteine response was suboptimal in the 0.2-mg/d group at both 6 and 12 weeks compared with that at 26 weeks.

- **Conclusions**: A folic acid dose as low as 0.2 mg/d can, if administered for 6 months, achieve significant reduction in homocysteine levels.

### Homocysteine and dementia: An international consensus statement [^114XD9B6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The question of whether lowering tHcy slows cognitive decline or prevents cognitive impairment in humans has been the subject of several clinical trials in which B vitamins have been administered either to normal elderly individuals, to those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or to patients with dementia. Critical reviews of these homocysteine-lowering trials and the meta-analyses based on them have been published. These reviews commented on the futility of conducting trials in which the placebo group showed no cognitive decline over the period of the trial; as one review stated, "you cannot prevent something that is not occurring". It is unfortunate that 76% of the 20,431 participants in the trials included in the largest meta-analysis did not have baseline measures of cognitive function, making it impossible to assess cognitive decline in the placebo group.

In two of the trials within this meta-analysis, involving 2,825 participants, cognitive decline was observed in the placebo group, and significant beneficial cognitive effects of treatment were observed in the B vitamin-treated group who had high tHcy or poor B vitamin status at baseline. The authors of the meta-analysis considered these latter findings to be "due to chance", despite the fact that these two trials were the only ones capable of addressing whether homocysteine-lowering with B vitamins slows cognitive decline.

We suggest that a meaningful clinical trial in this field should satisfy a set of criteria, listed in Table 2, to provide a valid outcome.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to serum homocysteine and MMA, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining further evaluation with MMA, serum total homocysteine, or holotranscobalamin in patients with serum cobalamin levels greater than 148 pmol/L in the presence of a strong clinical suspicion of cobalamin deficiency. They also recommend administering a trial of hydroxocobalamin to ascertain any clinical improvement.

### Homocysteine-lowering trials for prevention of cardiovascular events: A review of the design and power of the large randomized trials [^116qYLVC]. American Heart Journal (2006). High credibility.

Dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 lowers blood homocysteine concentrations by about 25% to 30% in populations without routine folic acid fortification of food and by about 10% to 15% in populations with such fortification. In observational studies, a 25% reduction in homocysteine has been associated with approximately 10% less coronary heart disease (CHD) and about 20% less stroke.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the design and statistical power of 12 randomized trials assessing the effects of lowering homocysteine with B-vitamin supplements on the risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Results**: Seven of these trials are being conducted in populations without fortification (5 involving participants with prior CHD and 2 with prior stroke) and 5 in populations with fortification (2 with prior CHD, 2 with renal disease, and 1 with prior stroke). These trials may not involve a sufficient number of vascular events or last long enough to independently detect reliable effects of homocysteine lowering on cardiovascular risk. However, taken together, these 12 trials involve about 52,000 participants: 32,000 with prior vascular disease in unfortified populations and 14,000 with vascular disease and 6,000 with renal disease in fortified populations. Hence, a combined analysis of these trials should have adequate power to determine whether lowering homocysteine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events within just a few years.

- **Conclusion**: The strength of the association of homocysteine with the risk of cardiovascular disease may be weaker than had previously been believed.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (e.g. metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia.

Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis.

Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

The British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2014 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of prophylactic folic acid in patients with chronic hemolytic states and those undergoing renal dialysis. The suggested dosage is 5 mg of folic acid taken orally, which can be administered daily to weekly, depending on the patient's diet and rate of hemolysis.

### Serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine in major depressive disorder, part 1: Predictors of clinical response in fluoxetine-resistant depression [^115pNtzc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

In the present study, we assessed the relationship between serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels and clinical response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had previously failed to respond to open treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day. These patients were enrolled in a 4-week, double-blind trial of either (1) fluoxetine dose increase, (2) lithium augmentation of fluoxetine, or (3) desipramine augmentation of fluoxetine.

Fifty-five outpatients (mean ± SD age = 41.7 ± 10.6 years; 50.9% women) with MDD, as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, were enrolled in the double-blind trial. They had serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine measurements completed at baseline (prior to fluoxetine treatment initiation). Folate levels were classified as either low (≤ 13.2 micromol/L) or normal. Using logistic regression, we assessed the relationship between (1) low or normal folate levels, (2) normal or low B12 levels, and (3) elevated or normal homocysteine levels and clinical response to double-blind treatment. The study was conducted from November 1992 to January 1999.

Low serum folate levels (chi2 = 3.626, p = .04), but not elevated homocysteine (p > .05) or low vitamin B12 levels (p > .05), were associated with poorer response to treatment. The response rates for patients with (N = 14) and without (N = 38) low folate levels were 7.1%.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency.

Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### The homocysteine controversy [^116Pd4fk]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Recently, the outcome of Mendelian randomization studies and large intervention trials of homocysteine lowering have cast doubt on the role of B vitamins and homocysteine in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In our view, what the intervention trials have indeed convincingly shown is that routine administration of high-dose multi-B vitamins to patients with (a high risk of) CVD has no net benefit and can thus not be recommended. However, abandoning the field of research into the associations between B vitamins, homocysteine, and CVD would be unwise. As outlined, the Mendelian randomization experiments have limitations that preclude final conclusions. Additionally, some characteristics of the intervention trials limit the interpretation of their results. Finally, the possibility that homocysteine lowering is beneficial but is offset by adverse side effects of B-vitamin supplementation on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. As explained, these side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid), or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

There are several implications to what we have discussed. First, we need to increase our understanding of how homocysteine damages the vascular system and explore ways to prevent such damage, besides using high-dose B vitamins. Second, we must study the potential adverse effects of the various forms of (high-dose) B vitamins in cell and animal experiments. Third, we should use epidemiological data to further enhance our understanding of these associations.

### Impact of folic acid supplementation on the epigenetic profile in healthy unfortified individuals - a randomized intervention trial [^113DyJCK]. Epigenetics (2024). Low credibility.

Previous studies have pointed to an increased need for folate among carriers of the MTHFR-C677T variant. We did not detect differences according to the MTHFR variants; however, our study participants had adequate folate blood levels prior to intervention despite the lack of folic acid fortification programs in Germany.

Our study was modest in sample size and duration, limiting the statistical power and generalizability of the results. However, we were able to test two regimens of folic acid interventions, 400 and 800 µg. Our modest study size precluded adjustment for potential confounding of the association between AgeAccel and folate levels, and between changes in these measures over follow-up. While the observed associations may be driven by common causes of change in AgeAccel and folate levels, our study does characterize shared longitudinal variation. Future investigations may illuminate what factors contribute to the observed correlations.

In summary, we observe few and select differences in PBL DNA methylation patterns following supplementation with folic acid in a population with adequate folate levels.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results when evaluating cobalamin status, as there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test. Additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid tests may help clarify uncertainties regarding underlying biochemical or functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential to be a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine might be helpful as a second-line test, although it is less specific than methylmalonic acid. Currently, the availability of these second-line tests is limited.

Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible due to the variety of methodologies used and technical issues; therefore, local reference ranges should be established. In situations where there is discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. The treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended following the guidelines in the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable, provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### High-dose B vitamin supplementation and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis: A randomized controlled trial [^117983wC]. Stroke (2009). High credibility.

Although plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, it remains unclear whether homocysteine is a cause or a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease. We determined whether the reduction of tHcy levels with B vitamin supplementation reduces subclinical atherosclerosis progression.

In this double-blind clinical trial, 506 participants aged 40 to 89 years with an initial tHcy greater than 8.5 micromoles per liter, without diabetes and cardiovascular disease, were randomized to receive high-dose B vitamin supplementation (5 mg of folic acid, 0.4 mg of vitamin B(12), and 50 mg of vitamin B(6)) or matching placebo for 3.1 years. Subclinical atherosclerosis progression across three vascular beds was assessed using high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography to measure carotid artery intima media thickness (primary outcome) and multidetector spiral CT to measure aortic and coronary artery calcium (secondary outcome).

Although the overall carotid artery intima media thickness progression rate was lower with B vitamin supplementation than with placebo, statistically significant between-group differences were not found (P = 0.31). However, among subjects with baseline tHcy greater than or equal to 9.1 micromoles per liter, those randomized to B vitamin supplementation had a statistically significant lower average rate of carotid artery intima media thickness progression compared with placebo (P = 0.02). Among subjects with baseline tHcy less than 9.1 micromoles per liter, there was no significant treatment effect (probability value for treatment interaction = 0.02). B vitamin supplementation had no effect on.

The diagnosis of folate deficiency, particularly through complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear, is addressed in the BSH 2014 guidelines. These recommend considering the suspicion of cobalamin or folate deficiency in patients whose blood films show oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils, especially in the presence of an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

### Efficacy of B vitamins in lowering homocysteine in older men: Maximal effects for those with B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia [^113oVPpr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

A higher plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies, largely in younger individuals, have shown that B vitamins lower tHcy by substantial amounts, with a more pronounced effect in people with higher tHcy and lower folate levels.

- **Methods**: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 299 men aged ≥ 75 years, comparing treatment with a daily tablet containing 2 mg of folate, 25 mg of B6, and 400 µg of B12 or placebo. The study groups were balanced regarding age (mean ± SD, 78.9 ± 2.8 years), B vitamins, and tHcy at baseline.

- **Results**: Among the 13% with B12 deficiency, the difference in mean changes in treatment and control groups for tHcy was 6.74 µmol/L (95% CI, 3.94 to 9.55 µmol/L) compared with 2.88 µmol/L (95% CI, 0.07 to 5.69 µmol/L) for all others. Among the 20% with hyperhomocysteinemia, the difference between mean changes in treatment and control groups for men with high plasma tHcy compared with the rest of the group was 2.8 µmol/L (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9 µmol/L). Baseline vitamin B12, serum folate, and tHcy were significantly associated with changes in plasma tHcy at follow-up (r = 0.252, r = 0.522, and r = -0.903, respectively; P = 0.003, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) in the vitamin group.

- **Conclusions**: The tHcy-lowering effect of B vitamins was maximal in those with low B12 or high tHcy levels. Community-dwelling older men, likely to be deficient in B12 or have hyperhomocysteinemia, may benefit most from such interventions.

### 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotype determines the plasma homocysteine-lowering effect of supplementation with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or folic acid in healthy young women [^116Uicqm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). High credibility.

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a risk factor for vascular disease and neural tube defects. The polymorphism in the gene encoding 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH(2)) (MTHFR) influences the tHcy concentration and the response to tHcy-lowering therapy. Supplementation with folic acid (FA) decreases plasma tHcy, but limited data are available on the effect of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF).

- **Objective**: We evaluated the tHcy-lowering potential of low-dose FA and of MTHF with respect to the MTHFR genotype.

- **Design**: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 160 women received 400 micrograms FA, the equimolar amount of MTHF (480 micrograms, racemic mixture), or a placebo daily during an 8-week treatment period. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks.

- **Results**: Changes in plasma tHcy concentration depended on the supplemented folate derivative and the MTHFR genotype. Supplementation with FA significantly decreased tHcy concentrations by ≥ 13% in women of all three genotypes after both 4 and 8 weeks. The greatest decrease was 20% (P < 0.05) in the women with the TT genotype after 4 weeks. MTHF supplementation also decreased tHcy, but only the women with the CT genotype had a significant decrease after 4 weeks (7%; P < 0.05). The largest nonsignificant reduction (15%) occurred in the women with the TT genotype after 4 weeks of MTHF supplementation.

- **Conclusions**: The response to tHcy-lowering therapy is influenced by MTHFR genotype. Women with the TT genotype seem to benefit the most from supplementation with either FA or MTHF.

### Folotyn [^116wncGG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**:

	- **Pretreatment vitamin supplementation**:

		- **Folic acid**: Instruct patients to take folic acid 1 to 1.25 mg orally once daily beginning 10 days before the first dose of Folotyn. Continue folic acid during treatment with Folotyn and for 30 days after the last dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

		- **Vitamin B12**: Administer vitamin B12 1 mg intramuscularly within 10 weeks prior to the first dose of Folotyn and every 8–10 weeks thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given the same day as treatment with Folotyn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage of Folotyn is 30 mg/m² intravenously over 3–5 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks in 7-week cycles until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

- **Dosage modifications for renal impairment and end-stage renal disease**:

	- **Severe renal impairment** (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m² by MDRD): Reduce the Folotyn dose to 15 mg/m² [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

	- **End-stage renal disease (ESRD)**: (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² by MDRD) with or without dialysis: Avoid administration. If the potential benefit of administration justifies the potential risk, monitor renal function and reduce the Folotyn dose based on adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Monitoring and dosage modifications for adverse reactions**:

	- **Monitoring**: Monitor complete blood cell counts and severity of mucositis at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic function, prior to treatment.

### Low-dose folic acid supplementation reduces plasma levels of the cardiovascular risk factor homocysteine in postmenopausal women [^111gC6dq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2000). High credibility.

The aim of our randomized, controlled trial was to verify the effect of folic acid supplementation on homocysteine levels in postmenopausal women. Thirty-six women were divided randomly into two groups: a placebo group (n = 18) and a group receiving 500 micrograms of folic acid per day for four weeks. To assess concentrations of plasma homocysteine, venous blood samples were taken upon enrollment and after four weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Mean plasma homocysteine levels were 10.9 ± 2.7 micromol/L in the placebo group and 7.8 ± 2.35 micromol/L (P < .01) in the group receiving 500 micrograms of folic acid daily for four weeks. The tertiles of women with the highest baseline homocysteine plasma levels showed the greatest reduction in homocysteine, with a mean decrease of 4.35 micromol/L (32%; P < .01), compared to a decrease of 3.35 micromol/L (29%; P < .01) in the middle tertile and 1.3 micromol/L (22.4%; p = 0.09) in the lower tertile.

The results show that low doses of folic acid are associated with a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of homocysteine. The highest initial levels of homocysteine exhibited the most significant reduction after therapy.

### Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in diagnosis and risk assessment from infancy to adolescence [^114rbYbd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in serum and plasma is elevated in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies, whereas methylmalonic acid (MMA) in serum, plasma, or urine is a specific marker of cobalamin function. The combined measurement of both metabolites is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these deficiency states. In addition, tHcy is elevated under various pathologic states (e.g. renal failure), and hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Biochemical background and associations**:
	- The diagnostic utility of tHcy and MMA concentrations as markers of folate and cobalamin deficiencies in healthy and diseased children has been documented. This article briefly summarizes the biochemical background of tHcy and MMA and the associations of tHcy and MMA with various disease states, focusing on novel data obtained in infants, children, and adolescents, with emphasis on cobalamin status in infants.

- **Extension to infants and children**:
	- The utility of tHcy and MMA as indicators of cobalamin and folate deficiencies in adults can be extended to infants and older children. Furthermore, as in adults, tHcy is related to unhealthy lifestyle factors and is a risk factor for vascular disease. High MMA concentrations in newborns, occasionally denoted as benign methylmalonic aciduria, may reflect impaired cobalamin function.

### Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for the prevention and treatment of healthy elderly and demented people [^115HszUP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Folate deficiency can result in congenital neural tube defects and megaloblastic anemia. Low folate levels may be due to insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption, but impaired metabolic utilization also occurs. Because B12 deficiency can produce a similar anemia to folate deficiency, there is a risk that folate supplementation can delay the diagnosis of B12 deficiency, which can cause irreversible neurological damage. Folic acid supplements may sometimes therefore include vitamin B12 supplements with simultaneous administration of vitamin B12. Lesser degrees of folate inadequacy are associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine, which has been linked with the risk of arterial disease, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. There is therefore interest in whether dietary supplementation can improve cognitive function in the elderly. However, any apparent benefit from folic acid, which was given in combination with B12, needs to be "corrected" for any effect of vitamin B12 alone. A separate Cochrane review of vitamin B12 and cognitive function has therefore been published.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, with or without vitamin B12, on elderly healthy or demented people, in preventing cognitive impairment or retarding its progress.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 10 October 2007 using the terms: folic acid, folate, vitamin B9, leucovorin, methyltetrahydrofolate, vitamin B12, cobalamin, and cyanocobalamin.

### The homocysteine controversy [^1128mgtT]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, independent from classical atherothrombotic risk factors. In the last decade, a number of large intervention trials using B vitamins have been performed and have shown no benefit of homocysteine-lowering therapy in high-risk patients. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies failed to convincingly demonstrate that a genetic polymorphism commonly associated with higher homocysteine levels (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C > T) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Together, these findings have cast doubt on the role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, and the homocysteine hypothesis has turned into a homocysteine controversy.

In this review, we attempt to find solutions to this controversy. First, we explain that the Mendelian randomization analyses have limitations that preclude final conclusions. Second, several characteristics of intervention trials limit interpretation and generalizability of their results. Finally, the possibility that homocysteine lowering is in itself beneficial but is offset by adverse side effects of B vitamins on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. As we explain, such side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid) or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

### Dietary counseling to increase natural folate intake: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in free-living subjects to assess effects on serum folate and plasma total homocysteine [^113NzS95]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). High credibility.

The association between vascular disease and elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations is caused, in part, by inadequate intakes of dietary folate. Increasing folate intake, either through supplements or foods naturally rich in folates, has been shown to decrease tHcy concentrations.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to determine whether a similar reduction in tHcy was possible in free-living persons receiving dietary counseling.

- **Design**: The study included a 4-week placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial in which participants consumed either unfortified breakfast cereal (control group) or an extra 350 micrograms of folate derived from food per day (dietary group). Serum folate and tHcy concentrations in both groups were measured before and after the intervention period, and the concentrations in the dietary group were also measured 17 weeks after the intervention period.

- **Results**: During the 4-week intervention, mean dietary folate intake in the dietary group increased from 263 micrograms per day (95% CI: 225, 307) to 618 micrograms per day (95% CI: 535, 714), resulting in a mean increase in serum folate of 37% (95% CI: 15%, 63%) and a decrease in tHcy from 12.0 micromol/L (95% CI: 10.9, 13.3) to 11.3 micromol/L (95% CI: 10.2, 12.5). A further decrease in tHcy occurred in the dietary group during follow-up, with a final tHcy concentration of 9.7 micromol/L (95% CI: 8.8, 10.8).

- **Conclusions**: Increasing natural folate intake improved folate status and decreased tHcy concentrations to an extent that may significantly reduce the risk of vascular disease. Dietary modification may have advantages over folic acid fortification because the full text was cut off.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in the medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie more in understanding the unique pathophysiology underlying cobalamin deficiency than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiological principles indicate that clinically significant deficiency is more likely to occur and progress when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails, rather than from a poor diet. Most causes take years to manifest as clinically obvious deficiency, and transient defects have little clinical impact.

The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which requires understanding how the deficiency arose. The value of these principles is not always fully acknowledged. Recent developments have complicated diagnosis and management by reducing the ability to assess cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also contend with the premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes, adding many asymptomatic cases of undetermined medical relevance to their caseloads, often expanded by inflated criteria for cobalamin levels. The risk of misattributing non-germane presentations to cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has increased.

Pathophysiologically based management demands systematic attention to each component: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

Regarding the medical management of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning vitamin B12 supplementation without neurological involvement, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for patients with serum levels of subclinical deficiency on two occasions. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Cobalamin levels should be reassessed after 3 months, and second-line tests should be obtained if there is no improvement.

### Folic acid with or without vitamin B12 for cognition and dementia [^114QGbpQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Folates are essential vitamins for the development of the central nervous system. Insufficient folate activity at the time of conception and early pregnancy can result in congenital neural tube defects. In adult life, folate deficiency has long been known to produce a characteristic form of anemia known as "megaloblastic" anemia. More recently, levels of folate inadequacy not severe enough to cause anemia have been associated with high blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine.

Such degrees of folate inadequacy can arise from insufficient dietary intake or inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folates due to genetic variations. Conventional criteria for diagnosing folate deficiency may be inadequate for identifying people who could benefit from dietary supplementation. High blood levels of homocysteine have been linked to the risk of arterial disease, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. There is, therefore, interest in whether dietary supplements of folic acid (an artificial chemical analogue of naturally occurring folates) can improve cognitive function in people at risk of cognitive decline associated with aging or dementia, either by affecting homocysteine metabolism or through other mechanisms.

However, if folic acid is given to people with an undiagnosed deficiency of vitamin B12, it may lead to neurological damage. Vitamin B12 deficiency produces both an anemia identical to that caused by folate deficiency and irreversible damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems.

### Importance of both folic acid and vitamin B12 in reduction of risk of vascular disease [^113b35QK]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Fortification of food with folic acid to prevent neural-tube defects in babies also lowers plasma total homocysteine, which is a risk factor for vascular disease. We investigated the effect of folate and vitamin B12 on homocysteine concentrations. Thirty men and twenty-three women received sequential supplementation with increasing doses of folic acid. After supplementation, the usual dependency of homocysteine on folate diminished, and vitamin B12 became the main determinant of plasma homocysteine concentration. This finding suggests that a fortification policy based on folic acid and vitamin B12, rather than folic acid alone, is likely to be much more effective at lowering homocysteine concentrations, with potential benefits for reducing the risk of vascular disease.

### Nascobal [^114zBvpn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

Vitamin B12 can be converted to coenzyme B12 in tissues and is essential for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine, a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of coenzyme B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from its inactive storage form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, resulting in a functional folate deficiency. Vitamin B12 may also be involved in maintaining sulfhydryl (SH) groups in the reduced form required by many SH-activated enzyme systems. Through these reactions, vitamin B12 is associated with fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Parenteral (intramuscular) administration of vitamin B12 completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. The degree of improvement in neurologic symptoms depends on the duration and severity of the lesions, although the progression of the lesions is immediately arrested. In patients with pernicious anemia, once-weekly intranasal dosing with 500 mcg B12 gel resulted in a consistent increase in pre-dose serum B12 levels during one month of treatment (p < 0.003), surpassing levels observed one month following a 100 mcg intramuscular dose.

### Hyperhomocysteinemia, low folate and vitamin B12 concentrations, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase mutation in cerebral venous thrombosis [^111a1sSt]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine are associated with an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis. Through a case-control study, we examined the potential association among homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 levels, and the common C677→T mutation in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).

- **Methods**: Forty-five patients with CVT and 90 control subjects were studied. Plasma levels of homocysteine (fasting and after methionine load), folate, and vitamin B12 were measured. Genotyping of the MTHFR gene was also performed. The estimated risk of CVT associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, low vitamin levels, and MTHFR mutation were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI (crude and after adjusting by other independent variables).

- **Results**: The adjusted OR for CVT associated with high (> 90th percentile) fasting levels of homocysteine was 4.6 (1.6 to 12.8). The association between low plasma folate values (< 10th percentile) and the presence of CVT was 3.5 (1.2 to 10.0) after adjustment for confounding factors. There was a higher frequency of MTHFR mutation in patients with CVT (22% versus 10%), but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.098). Patients with the MTHFR mutation and low folate levels presented the highest homocysteine levels.

- **Conclusions**: High plasma concentrations of homocysteine and low plasma folate levels were associated with an increased risk of CVT in this population, in which low socioeconomic conditions and deficient nutritional status may contribute to its relatively high prevalence.

### Homocysteine, B-vitamin supplementation, and stroke prevention: From observational to interventional trials [^116fh5fa]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Homocysteine is an amino acid, the metabolism of which is linked to that of several vitamins — especially folic acid, B6, and B12. A high concentration of homocysteine in the plasma is linked to vascular disease, including stroke. Concentrations of homocysteine can be inexpensively and safely lowered by treatment with a combination of folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6. However, whether the association between high plasma concentrations of homocysteine and vascular disease is causal is unclear.

- **Recent developments**: Two studies have assessed the relation between dietary or supplementary B vitamin intake and the risk of stroke. In a prospective observational study of 43,732 healthy men, there was an inverse relation between dietary folate intake and the risk of ischaemic stroke. The Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention study (VISP) was the first large-scale, randomized interventional study that investigated the lowering of homocysteine concentrations with B vitamins in patients with ischaemic stroke. There was an association between baseline homocysteine concentrations and vascular risk in this trial. Plasma concentrations of homocysteine were only modestly reduced by a high-dose versus low-dose formulation, and there was no treatment effect on stroke, coronary events, or deaths.

	- Limitations of VISP included that only patients with mild increases in baseline homocysteine concentrations were studied, only modest reductions of homocysteine concentrations were achieved, and follow-up was short. In addition, fortification of food with folate and treatment.

### Folate, homocysteine, and adverse outcomes after ischemic stroke [^116nFYv9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Different from the widespread concern regarding homocysteine, evidence linking circulating folate with the prognosis of ischemic stroke is sparse. In the VISP trial with 3,680 cerebral infarction patients, high-dose supplementation of B vitamins showed no more treatment effect on either revascular events or death than the low-dose group. The VITATOPS trial included 8,164 patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack, finding that daily administration of B vitamins was not associated with decreased risks of vascular events and death. However, interpretation of the observed null associations should be cautious, as both trials included participants with high folate consumption or were influenced by folate fortification policies.

China has some of the lowest folate levels compared with Western countries, so our study conducted with Chinese participants could provide important population-based evidence for the role of folate in the development of ischemic stroke. In the present large-scale study, we found that high serum folate levels were associated with a favorable prognosis, suggesting that patients with ischemic stroke and low folate levels may benefit more from folate supplement interventions. Therefore, it is of interest to conduct clinical trials among populations with low folate consumption to demonstrate the clinical benefits of folate supplementation on the prognosis of ischemic stroke.

Due to the crucial role of folate in the recycling of homocysteine, we are not surprised to find the reverse associations between folate levels and risk of death or major cardiovascular events.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening.

The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency. Measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12).

Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources.

Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes.

### Long term treatment with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency: Randomised placebo controlled trial [^117VtTbY]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Our study on the long-term effects of metformin treatment on serum concentrations of vitamin B-12, folate, and homocysteine in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin had three main findings.

- **Vitamin B-12 concentrations**: Firstly, metformin significantly reduced concentrations of vitamin B-12, in accordance with findings from previous studies. Importantly, our study shows that this decrease is not a transitory phenomenon, but persists and grows over time.

- **Folate concentrations**: Secondly, a small, significant decrease in folate concentrations was found in the metformin group compared with the placebo group. However, this reduction was not statistically significant after adjustments for body mass index and smoking.

- **Homocysteine levels**: Thirdly, the decrease in vitamin B-12 concentrations was associated with an increase in homocysteine levels, which was not statistically significant. Further analyses, however, showed that homocysteine concentrations did increase in individuals in whom vitamin B-12 levels decreased below the concentration generally considered to indicate clinical deficiency — that is, 150 pmol/l.

The finding of decreases in vitamin B-12 concentration during metformin treatment is not novel and has been reported before. A novel finding here, however, is that the decrease in vitamin B-12 levels is progressive. Furthermore, concentrations in some patients drop to the level at which most authorities agree vitamin substitution is required. This is also a novel finding, because, although earlier trials in well-fed, middle-aged patients showed that metformin decreases vitamin B-12 concentrations, levels recorded remained within a range not necessitating substitution.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for folate deficiency, and more specifically with respect to serum homocysteine, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering plasma total homocysteine levels to confirm suspected folate deficiency only in special circumstances. Consider a level above 15 μmol/L as indicative of folate deficiency, but assess in relation to local reference ranges.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years.

Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms.

Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Homocysteine and dementia: An international consensus statement [^1116hr6n]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Identification of modifiable risk factors provides a crucial approach to the prevention of dementia. Nutritional or nutrient-dependent risk factors are especially important because dietary modifications or the use of dietary supplements may lower risk factor levels. One such risk factor is a raised concentration of the biomarker plasma total homocysteine, which reflects the functional status of three B vitamins: folate, vitamins B12, and B6.

A group of experts reviewed literature evidence from the last 20 years. A consensus statement based on the Bradford Hill criteria concludes that elevated plasma total homocysteine is a modifiable risk factor for the development of cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease in older persons. In various clinical studies, the relative risk of dementia in elderly people with moderately raised homocysteine (within the normal range) ranges from 1.15 to 2.5, and the population attributable risk ranges from 4.3% to 31%. Intervention trials in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment show that homocysteine-lowering treatment with B vitamins markedly slows the rate of whole and regional brain atrophy and also slows cognitive decline.

The findings are consistent with moderately raised plasma total homocysteine (> 11 μmol/L), common in the elderly, being one of the causes of age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Thus, the public health significance of raised tHcy in the elderly should not be underestimated, as it is easy, inexpensive, and safe to treat with B vitamins. Further trials are needed to determine whether B vitamin supplementation can effectively manage this condition.

Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis - **Recommendation 3**: Elevated plasma tHcy is the hallmark of remethylation disorders. We strongly recommend that investigations in patients with a suspected remethylation disorder should start with the measurement of total homocysteine in blood. We recommend the blood sample for tHcy to be centrifuged within an hour and kept at +4°C or frozen until analysis. Immunoassays or chromatographic methods are suitable for tHcy measurement (quality of the evidence: moderate).

- **Recommendation 4**: We strongly recommend against measuring free homocysteine instead of total homocysteine (quality of the evidence: moderate).

- **Recommendation 5**: We strongly recommend that in the case of high total homocysteine, plasma and urine samples for determination of MMA, methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 are to be obtained before treatment is started (quality of the evidence: moderate).

### The effects of long-term daily folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation in elderly subjects [^113sCVy6]. Clinical Epigenetics (2015). Low credibility.

Long-term supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 in elderly subjects with mildly elevated homocysteine levels resulted in changes in DNA methylation of several genes implicated in normal developmental processes and carcinogenesis. These findings may provide unique leads for further research unraveling the mechanisms underlying the effects of B-vitamins on health and disease during the life cycle.

### Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116KepJd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings, based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date evidence, provide support for a modest benefit of folic acid supplementation for the prevention of stroke. There was a 10% reduced risk of stroke and a 4% reduced risk of overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) with folic acid supplementation.

A greater benefit for CVD was observed among participants without preexisting CVD or with lower plasma folate levels at baseline and in studies with a larger decrease in homocysteine levels. We did not observe any significant benefit or harm with folic acid supplementation for the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).

### Biochemical indicators of vitamin B12 and folate insufficiency and cognitive decline [^112AidBd]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

In some prospective studies, associations of serum vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations with cognitive decline have been reported, but few have examined the role of methylmalonic acid, a more specific marker of vitamin B12 deficiency than homocysteine.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to determine whether serum concentrations of vitamin B12 or selected metabolites are related to cognitive decline.

- **Methods**: A total of 516 subjects were selected in a stratified random sampling design from among Chicago Health and Aging Project participants for clinical evaluation. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association of blood markers of vitamin B12 status with changes in cognitive scores over 6 years. Cognitive function was assessed every 3 years and measured as the sum of standardized scores on four tests.

- **Results**: Probable vitamin B12 deficiency was observed in 14.2% of the sample. Elevated serum concentrations of homocysteine were present in 19.2% of subjects, and of methylmalonic acid, in 36.4%. Higher serum methylmalonic acid concentrations were predictive of faster rates of cognitive decline (beta = -0.00016, SE = 0.0001, p = 0.004), and higher serum vitamin B12 concentrations were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (beta = +0.00013, SE < 0.0001, p = 0.005) in multivariable adjusted mixed models. Serum concentrations of homocysteine had no relationship to cognitive decline.

- **Conclusions**: Serum methylmalonic acid and vitamin B12 concentrations may be more important risk factors for cognitive decline compared to homocysteine.

### The homocysteine controversy [^115Afp4P]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

The power of any intervention study is dependent not so much on the effect size of the active treatment but rather on the contrast generated between the intervention groups. Several intervention trials have been compromised by B-vitamin food fortification implemented just prior to or during the intervention period. In addition, the use of multivitamins is so widespread that up to 20% of patients included in the large B-vitamin trials were actually using multivitamins at the time of randomization.

The impact of contrast between the intervention groups has not been sufficiently addressed. In the aforementioned meta-analysis of stroke prevention by B vitamins, however, there was a significant impact of both grain fortification and the degree of homocysteine lowering on the probability of finding a protective effect of B vitamins on stroke incidence. Intervention effects were not observed in fortified study populations or if the degree of homocysteine lowering was less than 20% compared with baseline [Wang et al.].

In conclusion, although the cumulative intervention studies contain a large number of patients, the actual power to detect an intervention effect may be compromised by a duration of follow-up that is simply too short in relation to the time frame of the development of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, conclusions from intervention studies may not apply to patients with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia — for example, exceeding 20 μmol/l — or to patients not exposed to multivitamins or food fortification with B vitamins.

### Concerning the debate about homocysteine, B vitamins, and dementia [^112S8wky]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Low credibility.

We hope that the Lancet Commission will consider the substantial existing evidence of raised homocysteine as an important risk factor for dementia and the possibility of modifying its harm by supplementation with B vitamins. The evidence is as strong or stronger than many of the other modifiable risk factors that the Commission includes in its 2024 publication. Continued dismissal of the potential beneficial effects of B vitamins and homocysteine-lowering in older individuals at risk of dementia represents a major missed opportunity in medicine and public health.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in patients on hormone therapy, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding further investigation in asymptomatic female patients on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy who present with mildly reduced serum vitamin B12. It is advised that these patients review their dietary intake of cobalamin-rich foods and consider initiating cobalamin supplements.

### Treatment of depression: Time to consider folic acid and vitamin B12 [^114tpPJX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

We review the findings in major depression of a low plasma and particularly red cell folate, as well as low vitamin B12 status. Both low folate and low vitamin B12 levels have been found in studies of depressive patients, and an association between depression and low levels of these two vitamins is also observed in studies of the general population. Low plasma or serum folate has been identified in patients with mood disorders treated by lithium. A link between depression and low folate levels has similarly been found in patients with alcoholism.

It is interesting to note that populations in Hong Kong and Taiwan with traditional Chinese diets, which are rich in folate, including patients with major depression, have high serum folate concentrations. However, these countries have very low lifetime rates of major depression. Low folate levels are furthermore linked to a poor response to antidepressants, and treatment with folic acid is shown to improve response to antidepressants. A recent study also suggests that high vitamin B12 status may be associated with better treatment outcomes.

Folate and vitamin B12 are major determinants of one-carbon metabolism, in which S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed. SAM donates methyl groups that are crucial for neurological function. Increased plasma homocysteine is a functional marker of both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated homocysteine levels are found in depressive patients. In a large population study from Norway, increased plasma homocysteine was associated with an increased risk of depression, but not anxiety. There is now substantial evidence supporting these findings.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^116msQ6f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Folate and vitamin B12 are essential in one-carbon metabolism and are the main determinants of homocysteine; a low status of either vitamin leads to elevated plasma homocysteine. Higher homocysteine concentrations, in turn, have been linked with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and higher fracture risk in older adults. Other evidence suggests an independent role for vitamin B12 in bone health. Notably, the Framingham Osteoporosis Study reported that deficient plasma B12 concentrations (< 148 pmol/L) were associated with lower BMD. Likewise, among celiac disease patients in Northern Ireland, serum vitamin B12 was found to be a significant determinant of hip BMD in males.

Furthermore, vitamin B12 deficiency commonly occurs in older people, primarily owing to food-bound B12 malabsorption related to atrophic gastritis and widespread use of proton-pump inhibitor medications (PPIs), rather than as a result of low dietary B12 intakes in higher-income countries. We recently reported high rates of vitamin B12 deficiency in older Irish adults, most notably among those with atrophic gastritis or, to a lesser extent, taking PPIs. With regard to folate, analysis of the Hordaland Homocysteine Study showed that lower plasma folate was associated with low BMD and increased fracture risk among Norwegian women. Although much less well studied compared with folate and B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin are also required for one-carbon metabolism, with some evidence of their potential role in bone health. Vitamin B6 deficiency has also been associated with poor bone health, with reports of greater mean bone loss in B6-deficient individuals.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^1129FKdH]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning patients on metformin, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering initiating oral cobalamin at 50 mcg for 1 month in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency on metformin therapy. Subsequent monitoring of serum cobalamin should be considered after 6 months and then at yearly intervals.

### Reported symptoms and clinical findings in relation to serum cobalamin, folate, methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine among elderly Swedes: a population-based study [^116Wr4NY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The early stages of tissue B12 or folate deficiency often cause diagnostic problems. In this report, the levels of serum cobalamin, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total homocysteine (tHcy), and their relationships with clinical findings and reported symptoms in a representative random population sample are presented.

- **Design**: Cohort study.
- **Setting**: A general central Swedish population 70 years or older.
- **Subjects and methods**: A 20% random sample of persons 70 years or older in a defined geographical area were invited to a survey. A total of 235 (85%) persons responded, of whom 161 had no interfering diseases or medication. Blood specimens for serum cobalamin, folate, MMA, and tHcy analyses were drawn.
- **Main outcome measures**: Presence of anaemic, gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms, obtained by questionnaire, and vibration sense measurement and findings at a physical and Mini Mental State Examination.

Among a large number of symptoms and clinical findings that traditionally have been linked to vitamin B12 or folate tissue deficiency, only changes in the tongue mucosa and mouth angle stomatitis turned out to be significantly associated with abnormal serum tHcy and serum folate levels. There were no relationships to serum cobalamin and serum MMA.

Changes in the oral mucosa were the only signs and symptoms found in this study, indicating that these may be the very early markers of metabolic defects. The traditional symptoms of vitamin deficiency may appear later in the course.

### Meta-analysis of folic acid supplementation trials on risk of cardiovascular disease and risk interaction with baseline homocysteine levels [^114m1Rfv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Experimental models and observational studies suggest that homocysteine-lowering therapy with folic acid (FA) may prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, FA also stimulates cell proliferation and might promote the progression of atherosclerosis. Our objectives were to perform a meta-analysis of FA supplementation trials on CVD events and to explore a potential interaction between FA supplementation and baseline homocysteine levels on CVD events.

We searched MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials of FA supplementation to prevent CVD events (January 1966 to July 2009) and performed meta-analyses using random effects models. For trials that reported responses to FA supplementation stratified by baseline levels of homocysteine, we pooled within-trial estimates of differences in log-relative risks by baseline homocysteine levels using a random effects model.

Overall, FA supplementation did not affect primary cardiovascular clinical end points (relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 1.13, p = 0.66) or stroke (relative risk 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08, p = 0.43). However, in trials that reported analyses stratified by baseline homocysteine, the effect of FA supplementation differed by strata of baseline homocysteine (p for interaction = 0.030). Specifically, risks of primary clinical CVD events comparing FA supplementation to control were 1.06 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) in strata with mean baseline homocysteine levels > 12 μmol/L and 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.03) in strata with baseline homocysteine levels < 12 μmol/L.

In conclusion, FA had no effect on CVD or stroke.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112yFs6M]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the evaluation of pernicious anemia, the British Society for Haematology's 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. This helps identify early or latent presentations of pernicious anemia in patients with low serum cobalamin levels, especially when anemia and food malabsorption (or other causes of deficiency) are absent.

The frequencies depicted in Table 1 are derived from collated case reports and may not be fully representative; however, they do not significantly deviate from published case series. The true prevalence of organ manifestations also depends on the extent of technical investigations, especially in relation to milder forms of microangiopathy and retinopathy that may escape clinical detection. Due to the very small number of reported cblJ cases, these have not been included.

### Homocysteine and holo-transcobalamin and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease: a prospective study [^1161QJ6R]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) levels may be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in some studies, although the evidence is mixed. Another marker of vitamin B12 deficiency, holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC), has not been studied in a prospective setting.

- **Objective**: To investigate the association between tHcy and holo-TC and the subsequent development of dementia and AD in a prospective study.

- **Methods**: A sub-sample of 228 non-demented subjects was taken from the Kungsholmen Project, a population-based longitudinal study amongst persons 75+ years. tHcy and holo-TC were analyzed at baseline.

- **Results**: Increasing tHcy levels were related to an increased risk of dementia (n = 83) and AD (n = 61) following a mean follow-up time of 6.7 years. Persons with high tHcy (the fourth quartile) had more than twice as high a risk of developing AD than persons with low tHcy, even after adjusting for confounding or mediating factors. The third quartile of holo-TC was associated with a reduced risk of AD, after adjusting for Hcy and other confounders.

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that Hcy is involved in the development of dementia and AD. The role of holo-TC was less clear and this marker needs to be studied further.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of the cobalamin-related remethylation disorders cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG, cblJ and MTHFR deficiency [^11442jTX]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

These guidelines are the result of the evaluation of available information from the literature based on the GRADE methodology and are aimed at delivering recommendations based on the best available data. The rarity of cobalamin-related remethylation disorders and MTHFR deficiency, the absence of larger data samples from international registries until recently, and data mainly derived from case reports, case series, or expert opinion results in a low quality of the evidence for several of the recommendations made. The working group responsible for this guideline commits itself to revise this work in the future.

### Cardiovascular manifestations of intermediate and major hyperhomocysteinemia due to vitamin B12 and folate deficiency and/or inherited disorders of one-carbon metabolism: A 3.5-year retrospective cross-sectional study of consecutive patients [^116EnMhK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

The association of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) (15–30 μmol/L) with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has been challenged by the lack of benefit of vitamin supplementation in lowering homocysteine. Consequently, the results of interventional studies have confused the debate regarding the management of patients with intermediate/severe HHcy.

- **Objective**: We sought to evaluate the association of intermediate (30–100 μmol/L) and severe (> 100 μmol/L) HHcy related to vitamin deficiencies and/or inherited disorders with CVD outcomes.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study on consecutive patients who underwent a homocysteine assay in a French University Regional Hospital Center. Patients with CVD outcomes were assessed for vitamin B12, folate, Hcy, methylmalonic acid, and next-generation clinical exome sequencing.

- **Results**: We evaluated 165 patients hospitalized for thromboembolic and other cardiovascular (CV) manifestations among 1006 patients consecutively recruited. Among them, 84% (138/165) had Hcy > 30 μmol/L, 27% had Hcy > 50 μmol/L (44/165), and 3% had Hcy > 100 μmol/L (5/165). HHcy was related to vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency in 55% (87/165), mutations in one or more genes of one-carbon and/or vitamin B12 metabolisms in 11% (19/165), and severe renal failure in 15% (21/141) of the studied patients. HHcy was the single vascular risk factor retrieved in almost 9% (15/165) of patients. Sixty percent (101/165) of patients received supplementation to treat HHcy, with a significant decrease in median Hcy from 41 to 17 µmol/L (IQR: 33.6–60.4).

### Effects of homocysteine lowering with B vitamins on cognitive aging: Meta-analysis of 11 trials with cognitive data on 22,000 individuals [^115UGbZC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

The FACIT trial examined the effects of lowering homocysteine concentrations with a low dose of folic acid of 0.8 mg daily on five different cognitive domains. It reported significant effects on the three-year change in memory, equivalent to cognitive performance of someone that is 4.7 years (95% CI: 1.1, 8.3 years) younger in age in 818 healthy participants with homocysteine concentrations ≥ 13 μmol/L. On average, participants in the FACIT trial were younger (60 compared with 66 years) and had lower mean plasma folate concentrations (12 compared with 15 nmol/L) than those in all of the global cognition trials.

However, the present study found no effect of supplementation on MMSE-type scores in subgroups with lower folate concentrations or at younger ages (Supplemental Figure 3 under "Supplemental data" in the online issue). Additionally, the participants in the FACIT trial were individuals with elevated homocysteine concentrations and normal serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (≥ 200 pmol/L). The present meta-analysis found no heterogeneity in the effects of supplementation among those with vitamin B-12 concentrations < 250 pmol/L compared with those with higher plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations (Supplemental Figure 4 under "Supplemental data" in the online issue).

Although it is possible that the results of the FACIT trial may reflect some special attributes of the FACIT trial population or design (e.g. correction of folate deficiency in individuals after excluding those with vitamin B-12 deficiency), the present meta-analysis does not provide any support for such an interpretation.
