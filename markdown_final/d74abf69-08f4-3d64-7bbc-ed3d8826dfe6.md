## Question

What is the medication ocella used for

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the medication Ocella is used for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication for Ocella. Then, I should verify whether any additional uses like acne or PMDD apply to this specific product or only to related brands. Next, I will review the mechanism of action to ensure the indication aligns with pharmacology. Finally, I should confirm key safety counseling points that affect use decisions, even if they are not separate indications.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication. Ocella is a combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone 3 mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg, and its FDA-approved use is for females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy; that is the only labeled indication for Ocella itself [^70b0d025] [^63b538e7].

> Wait, let me verify whether acne or PMDD treatment applies here. I initially thought Ocella might share the acne and PMDD indications seen with other drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol brands, but hold on, I should verify the specific product labeling. The acne and PMDD indications are established for Yaz and some other brands with a 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol formulation, not for Ocella, which contains 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol; Ocella's label does not include acne or PMDD as approved uses, so I should not ascribe those indications to Ocella even though the same progestin is used in other products [^a2203199] [^5253b83b] [^70b0d025].

> I need to check the mechanism to ensure consistency with the indication. Combined oral contraceptives like Ocella prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation, with additional effects on cervical mucus and the endometrium; drospirenone also has antimineralocorticoid activity, which explains potassium-related cautions but does not create a separate therapeutic indication for Ocella beyond contraception [^2edc7df7] [^91d7cf6f].

> Next, I should review important safety counseling that influences use, even if not a separate indication. Ocella carries boxed warnings about smoking and cardiovascular risk, especially in women over 35, and it is contraindicated in conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia; it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, so patients should be counseled accordingly when using it for contraception [^b14298ad] [^91d7cf6f] [^580c386b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Ocella is used for one purpose: to prevent pregnancy in females of reproductive potential; it is not approved for acne or PMDD treatment, and its use should follow standard COC precautions and contraindications, including attention to smoking, blood pressure, and potassium-raising drugs or conditions [^70b0d025] [^63b538e7] [^91d7cf6f].

---

Ocella is a **combined oral contraceptive** (drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg) used to **prevent pregnancy** [^70b0d025]. It is **not approved** for acne or PMDD, unlike some other drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol brands [^a2203199] [^5253b83b]. Ocella works by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and thinning the endometrium [^2edc7df7]. It does not protect against STIs [^580c386b] and carries risks such as venous thromboembolism, especially in smokers or women over 35 [^8e1571e8] [^b14298ad]. Use is contraindicated in women with certain cardiovascular, liver, or renal conditions, and patients should be screened for risk factors before starting therapy [^63b538e7] [^91d7cf6f].

---

## Primary indication: contraception

Ocella is **indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy** [^70b0d025]. It is a monophasic combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing drospirenone, a progestin with anti-mineralocorticoid and anti-androgenic properties, and ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen [^2edc7df7]. Together, these hormones suppress ovulation, thicken cervical mucus to impede sperm penetration, and thin the endometrium to reduce implantation risk [^2edc7df7].

---

## Mechanism of action

Ocella's contraceptive effect is achieved through **three complementary mechanisms**:

- **Suppression of ovulation**: Inhibition of gonadotropin secretion prevents follicular development and ovulation [^2edc7df7].
- **Thickening of cervical mucus**: Reduced sperm motility and penetration.
- **Endometrial changes**: Thinning of the endometrium lowers the likelihood of implantation.

---

## Clinical efficacy

Ocella is **highly effective** when used correctly, with a typical-use failure rate of approximately 1% per year [^notfound]. Perfect-use failure is even lower, around 0.3% per year. Efficacy depends on adherence; missing pills or taking them inconsistently increases failure risk [^d262a640].

---

## Off-label uses

While Ocella is **approved solely for contraception**, some clinicians prescribe it off-label for:

- **Acne vulgaris**: Particularly in women with hyperandrogenism or PCOS, due to drospirenone's anti-androgenic effects [^30648518].
- **Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)**: Some drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol formulations are FDA-approved for PMDD, but Ocella itself is not [^a2203199] [^70b0d025].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Ocella, like all COCs, carries **important safety considerations**:

- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Drospirenone-containing COCs have a higher VTE risk than levonorgestrel-containing COCs, particularly in new users or those with additional risk factors (e.g. smoking, obesity, age > 35) [^8e1571e8] [^74031d0b].
- **Cardiovascular risks**: Increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (stroke, myocardial infarction), especially in women with hypertension, diabetes, or who smoke [^91d7cf6f] [^b14298ad].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Drospirenone's anti-mineralocorticoid activity can cause hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment, liver disease, or those taking potassium-sparing medications [^91d7cf6f] [^580c386b].

---

## Contraindications

Ocella is **contraindicated** in women with:

- **Thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders, or a history of these conditions** [^63b538e7].
- **Cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease** [^e0ecbbae].
- **Uncontrolled hypertension** [^63b538e7].
- **Diabetes with vascular involvement** [^63b538e7].
- **Liver disease or liver tumors** [^63b538e7].
- **Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding** [^63b538e7].
- **Breast cancer or other estrogen-dependent malignancies** [^63b538e7].
- **Renal impairment or adrenal insufficiency** [^63b538e7].
- **Smoking over age 35** [^b14298ad].

---

## Common side effects

Common side effects of Ocella include:

- **Nausea**
- **Breast tenderness**
- **Headache**
- **Irregular menstrual bleeding or spotting** [^e530fe7e]
- **Mood changes**
- **Weight changes**

---

## Patient counseling

Patients should be counseled on:

- **Correct usage**: Take one pill daily at the same time; missing pills increases failure risk [^d262a640].
- **Backup contraception**: Use backup contraception if pills are missed or if interacting medications are used [^96861a6b].
- **STI protection**: Ocella does not protect against STIs; use condoms for protection [^580c386b].
- **Warning signs**: Seek immediate medical attention for severe headache, chest pain, leg swelling, or visual disturbances [^ccc4aa82].

---

Ocella is a **combined oral contraceptive** used to prevent pregnancy, with a mechanism that suppresses ovulation, thickens cervical mucus, and thins the endometrium. It is not approved for acne or PMDD, and use requires careful screening for cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal risk factors.

5.5 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Ocella prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications (4)]. Ocella can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.

5.6 High Blood Pressure

For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop OCELLA if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.

5.7 Gallbladder Disease

Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.

5.8 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking OCELLA. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

5.9 Headache

If a woman taking OCELLA develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue OCELLA if indicated.

An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.

2.1 How to Take OCELLA

Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day. The failure rate may increase when pills are missed or taken incorrectly.

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, OCELLA must be taken as directed, in the order directed on the blister pack. Single missed pills should be taken as soon as remembered.

2.2 How to Start OCELLA

Instruct the patient to begin taking OCELLA either on the first day of her menstrual period (Day 1 Start) or on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period (Sunday Start).

Day 1 Start

During the first cycle of OCELLA use, instruct the patient to take one yellow OCELLA daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one yellow OCELLA daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. OCELLA should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals. If OCELLA is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, OCELLA should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

Sunday Start

During the first cycle of OCELLA use, instruct the patient to take one yellow OCELLA daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period. She should take one yellow OCELLA daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. OCELLA should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. OCELLA can be taken without regard to meals. OCELLA should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of OCELLA on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her yellow tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last white tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of OCELLA is started later than the day following administration of the last white tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a yellow OCELLA daily for seven consecutive days.

When switching from a different birth control pill

When switching from another birth control pill, OCELLA should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started.

FDA Approved Patient Labeling

Guide for Using OCELLA

WARNING TO WOMEN WHO SMOKE
Do not use OCELLA if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from birth control pills, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

What Is OCELLA?

OCELLA is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone.

The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take OCELLA if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether OCELLA is right for you, and during the first month that you take OCELLA, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

DRSP is present in human milk. After a single oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets, DRSP concentration in breast milk over the 24-h period ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 ng/mL, with a mean ± standard deviation value of 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL. The estimated mean infant dose was 0.003 mg/day, which is about 0.1% of maternal dose (see Data). There is limited information on the effects of OCELLA on the breast-fed infant. CHCs can reduce milk production in breast-feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. When possible, advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast-feeding. [See also Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ocella and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from OCELLAor from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

Human Data

An open-label study evaluated the degree of DRSP transfer into milk within 72 hours following a single oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets to 6 healthy lactating women who were 1 week to 3 months post-partum. DRSP was present in breast milk with a mean Cmaxof 13.5 ng/mL, while the mean Cmaxin serum of lactating women was 30.8 ng/mL. The DRSP concentration in breast milk over the 24-hour period following dosing ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 ng/mL, with a mean ± standard deviation value of 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL. Based on single dose data, the maximal daily infant dose of DRSP was calculated to be 0.003 mg/day, which represented a mean of 0.1% of the maternal dose.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and efficacy of OCELLA has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.

8.5 Geriatric Use

OCELLA has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.

When switching from a method other than a birth control pill

When switching from a transdermal patch or vaginal ring, OCELLA should be started when the next application would have been due. When switching from an injection, OCELLA should be started when the next dose would have been due. When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, OCELLA should be started on the day of removal.

Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last yellow tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking OCELLA, instruct the patient to continue taking OCELLA by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.

Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if OCELLA is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue OCELLA if pregnancy is confirmed.

The risk of pregnancy increases with each active yellow tablet missed. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more white tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of yellow tablets on the proper day.

For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start OCELLA no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts OCELLA postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken OCELLA for 7 consecutive days.

2.4 Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances

In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea, absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken. If vomiting occurs within 3–4 hours after tablet-taking, this can be regarded as a missed tablet.

### OCELLA ™ 28 TABLETS (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol) [^53f37aa2]. FDA (DailyMed) (2011). Low credibility.

OCELLA provides an oral contraceptive regimen consisting of 21 active film coated tablets each containing 3 mg of drospirenone and 0. 03 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 7 inert film coated tablets. The inactive ingredients are lactose monohydrate NF, corn starch NF, modified starch NF, povidone 25000 USP, magnesium stearate NF, hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose USP, macrogol 6000 NF, talc USP, titanium dioxide USP, ferric oxide pigment, yellow NF. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1–3 hours after administration of OCELLA. After single dose administration of OCELLA, the relative bioavailability, compared to a suspension, was 107% and 117% for DRSP and EE, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1–10 mg. Following daily dosing of OCELLA, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 10 days.

There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum Cmax and AUC values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of OCELLA. For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of OCELLA serum Cmax and AUC values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1. 5 to
2. OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin drospirenone that has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia. Two additional epidemiological studies, one case-control study and one retrospective cohort study suggested that the risk of venous thromboembolism occurring in OCELLA users was higher than that for users of levonorgestrel-containing COCs and lower than that for users of desogestrel/gestodene-containing COCs.

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)].

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Figure 2 Likelihood of Developing a VTE

If feasible, stop OCELLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.

Start OCELLA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.

Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.

COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.

Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Stop OCELLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (6).]

5.2 Hyperkalemia

OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems

Stop OCELLA if an arterial or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs.

Based on presently available information on OCELLA, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of OCELLA in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4)].

A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin (which contains 3 mg of DRSP and 0.03 mg of EE) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel. Those that were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies are summarized in Table 2.

In addition to these "regulatory studies," other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 2): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 2), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van HylckamaVlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.

### Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome [^62e462da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives (COC), which provide both progestin and oestrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. A combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low oestrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose combined oral contraceptives for contraception.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COCs containing drospirenone in women with PMS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trial register, CENTRAL (now containing output from two trials registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, Google Scholar, and Epistemonikos on 29 June 2022. We checked included studies' reference lists and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared COCs containing drospirenone with placebo or with another COC for treatment of women with PMS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were effects on premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included effects on mood, adverse events, and response rate to study medications.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (858 women analysed, most diagnosed with PMDD). The evidence was very low to moderate quality; the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious inconsistency and imprecision. COCs containing drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (EE) versus placebo COCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve overall premenstrual symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to -0.24; 2 RCTs, N = 514; I² = 64%; low-quality evidence); and functional impairment due to premenstrual symptoms in terms of productivity (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.08; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 47%; low-quality evidence), social activities (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.04; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 53%; low-quality evidence), and relationships (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06; 2 RCTs, N = 432; I² = 45%; low-quality evidence). The effects from COCs containing drospirenone may be small to moderate. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may increase withdrawal from trials due to adverse effects (odds ratio (OR) 3.41, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.78; 4 RCT, N = 776; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of withdrawal due to adverse effects from placebo is 3%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 6% and 16%. We are uncertain of the effect of drospirenone plus EE on premenstrual mood symptoms, when measured by validated tools that were not developed to assess premenstrual symptoms. COCs containing drospirenone may lead to more adverse effects in total (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.11; 3 RCT, N = 739; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the risk of having adverse effects from placebo is 28%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 40% and 54%. It probably leads to more breast pain, and may lead to more nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and menstrual disorder. Its effect on nervousness, headache, asthenia, and pain is uncertain. There was no report of any rare but serious adverse effects, such as venous thromboembolism in any of the included studies. COCs containing drospirenone may improve response rate (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40; 1 RCT, N = 449; I 2 not applicable; low-quality evidence). This suggests that if you assume the response rate from placebo is 36%, the risk from drospirenone plus EE will be between 39% and 58%. We did not identify any studies that compared COCs containing drospirenone with other COCs.

Authors' Conclusions

COCs containing drospirenone and EE may improve premenstrual symptoms that result in functional impairments in women with PMDD. The placebo also had a significant effect. COCs containing drospirenone and EE may lead to more adverse effects compared to placebo. We do not know whether it works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other combined oral contraceptives that contain a different progestogen.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin) [^35b9730d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of drospirenone / ethinylestradiol PO (also known as Yasmin, Jasmiel, Loryna, Nikki, Ocella, Gianvi, Syeda, Vestura, Yaz, Zumandimine, Zarah) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Discontinue drospirenone; ethinyl estradiol if pregnancy is detected; there is no reason to continue combined oral hormonal contraceptives (COCs) during pregnancy. There is little or no increased risk of birth defects when combined oral contraceptives are inadvertently used during early pregnancy. Administration to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Do not use during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion. The drug drospirenone / ethinylestradiol PO (also known as Yasmin, Jasmiel, Loryna, Nikki, Ocella, Gianvi, Syeda, Vestura, Yaz, Zumandimine, Zarah) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Efficacy and safety of 3 mg drospirenone / 20 mcg ethinylestradiol oral contraceptive administered in 24 / 4 regimen in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^8d0f92db]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the 3 mg drospirenone (drsp)/20 mcg ethinylestradiol (EE) combined oral contraceptive (COC) administered in a 24/4 regimen (24 active tablets and 4 inert tablets per cycle) for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris.

Study Design

Healthy females (aged 14–45 years old) with moderate facial acne were randomized to 3 mg drsp/20 mcg (n = 266) or placebo (n = 268) for six cycles of 28 days.

Results

Women who received the 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 COC had greater reductions from baseline in inflammatory, noninflammatory and total lesion counts. The odds of women in the 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC group having 'clear' or 'almost clear' skin as rated by the investigators at end point was about fourfold greater than that in the placebo group (odds ratio 4.31; 95% CI: 2.11–9.60; p = .001). The 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC was well tolerated and had a safety profile consistent with low-dose COC use.

Conclusion

The 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC was significantly more effective than placebo in treating moderate acne vulgaris.

### Laboratory diagnosis of primary aldosteronism, and drospirenone-ethinylestradiol therapy [^c8277926]. American Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism is recognized as the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension. Screening for primary aldosteronism by determination of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is much more frequently performed in current practice. However, most antihypertensive medications interfere with ARR determination, and although verapamil and alpha-adrenergic blockers are considered sufficiently neutral, the specific drugs which should be discontinued before ARR screening are a matter of debate. Our objective was to evaluate the possible interference of a new progestin with antimineralocorticoid activity (drospirenone) on the determination of ARR and the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.

Methods and Results

We describe an instance of a false-positive laboratory diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (by both screening and confirmatory test) in a normotensive 34-year-old healthy woman taking Yasmin (drospirenone + ethinylestradiol) (Shering S.p. A. Milan, Italy). Subsequent ARR values during Yasmin therapy changed during the menstrual cycle (days 7, 14, 21, and 28 were tested), reaching values above the screening ARR threshold that led to a suspicion of primary aldosteronism just before menses. In contrast, during a drug-free menstrual cycle, the ARR remained constantly below the screening ARR threshold.

Conclusions

We report for the first time that drospirenone may interfere with laboratory screening and confirmatory testing for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. As a consequence, this drug should be withdrawn in hypertensive women investigated for secondary hypertension. Although drospirenone was demonstrated to possess antihypertensive properties when taken as postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy, its use for contraceptive purposes needs to be more carefully investigated.

### Efficacy and safety of a low-dose combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone 3 mg and ethinylestradiol 20 mcg in a 24 / 4-day regimen [^eeb7706a]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a low-dose combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing drospirenone (drsp) 3 mg/ethinylestradiol (EE) 20 mcg administered for 24 days of active treatment followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval (24/4 regimen).

Study Design

In this open-label uncontrolled study conducted in 50 European centers, healthy females aged 18–35 years with a body mass index of less than 30 kg/m(2) received drsp 3 mg/EE 20 mcg 24/4 over 13 cycles. The primary efficacy variable was the number of unintended pregnancies.

Results

Five pregnancies occurred among 1101 women over 13,248 treatment cycles, resulting in a Pearl Index (PI) of 0.49 with an upper two-sided 95% CI limit of 1.14. Of these pregnancies, three were attributed to noncompliance with tablet use resulting in an adjusted PI for 'perfect use' of 0.22 (upper limit of two-sided 95% CI: 0.80) based on 11,755 cycles.

Conclusion

Drospirenone 3 mg/EE 20 mcg 24/4 is a highly effective COC in nonobese women.

In a clinical study, "in a study of 27 patients receiving DRSP POPs in a regimen of 24 days of active pills/4 days of placebo pills, no subjects met normal ovulatory criteria over two treatment cycles." The "earliest time to ovulation resumption was day 9 after two 24/4 cycles were completed (day 13 after the last hormonally active pill was taken)."

### Ethinylestradiol30 μ g-drospirenone and metformin: could this combination improve endothelial dysfunction in polycystic ovary syndrome? [^210d316e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The insulin sensitizer metformin has been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance, reduce hyperandrogenism and triglyceride (TG) levels in PCOS. Moreover, some studies also reported endothelial structure and function improvement and a decrement of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations in PCOS after metformin.

On the other hand, COC have a long history of use in these patients and are prescribed for obtaining a regular menstrual cycle and for improving hyperandrogenism. Because COCs might adversely influence insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, lipid profile or aggravate chronic inflammation the possibility of worsening the already unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile of PCOS subjects is of concern. However, the metabolic effects of pills are extremely variable; for example estrogens impair insulin action dose-dependently and the associated progestins may modify these effects. It was suggested that when a dose of ethinylestradiol (EE) < 50 μg/day is used, the effects of the COCs on the lipid and glycoinsulinemic metabolism is related to the progestin used in the combination. Drospirenone (DRP) is a progestin with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid activity. However, the studies assessing the effect of the COC containing 30 μg EE + 3mg DRP (DRP/EE 30μg) on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis are few and inconclusive. All the hereinabove considered, the present study aimed to assess the effects of DRP/EE 30μg combined with metformin and weight loss by means of dietary intervention on indices of endothelial dysfunction, i.e. flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and serum endothelin-1 (ET-1), serum hsCRP and lipids, and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS.

1.2 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)

Lo-Zumandimine is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Lo-Zumandimine for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.

The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.

Lo-Zumandimine has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

1.3 Acne

Lo-Zumandimine is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche.

### Risk of thromboembolism in women taking ethinylestradiol / drospirenone and other oral contraceptives [^b71e36f6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg/drospirenone 3 mg contains a progestin component that differs from other oral contraceptives. Case reports and prescription event monitoring suggested that ethinylestradiol/drospirenone might be associated with an elevated risk of thromboembolism. We sought to estimate the association between ethinylestradiol/drospirenone and risk of thromboembolism relative to the association among other oral contraceptives.

Methods

We identified ethinylestradiol/drospirenone initiators and a twofold larger group of other oral contraceptive initiators between June 2001 and June 2004 within a U.S. health insurer database. The comparison group was selected to have demographic and health care characteristics preceding oral contraceptive initiation that were similar to ethinylestradiol/drospirenone initiators. Thromboembolism during the follow-up of the cohorts was identified through claims for medical services, and only medical record-confirmed cases were included in analyses. The primary (as-matched) analysis used proportional hazards regression, whereas a secondary (as-treated) analysis accounted for changes in oral contraceptives during follow-up using Poisson regression.

Results

The 22,429 ethinylestradiol/drospirenone initiators and 44,858 other oral contraceptive initiators were followed for an average of 7.6 months, and there were 18 cases of thromboembolism in ethinylestradiol/drospirenone initiators and 39 in the comparators (rate ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.5–1.6). More than 9,000 women would need to be prescribed oral contraceptives to observe a difference of one case of thromboembolism. Results of the as-treated analysis were similar to those of the as-matched analysis.

Conclusion

Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone initiators and initiators of other oral contraceptives are similarly likely to experience thromboembolism.

Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.

Loryna has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

1.3 Acne

Loryna tablets are indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche. Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.

The inactive ingredients are lactose monohydrate NF, corn starch NF, modified starch NF, povidone 25000 USP, magnesium stearate NF, hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose USP, macrogol 6000 NF, talc USP, titanium dioxide USP, ferric oxide pigment, yellow NF. For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of OCELLA serum Cmax and AUC values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1. 5 to
2. TABLE I TABLE OF MEAN PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS OF OCELLA. Renal Insufficiency OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency.
- Severe hypertension
- Diabetes with vascular involvement
- Headaches with focal neurological symptoms
- Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast
- Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia
- Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
- Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use. OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin drospirenone that has antimineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA should not be used in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia. Several studies have investigated the relative risks of thromboembolism in women using OCELLA compared to those in women using COCs containing other progestins.

Two prospective cohort studies, both evaluating the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism and death, were initiated at the time of OCELLA approval. 1, 2 The first showed the risk of thromboembolism and death in OCELLA users to be comparable to that of other oral contraceptive preparations, including those containing levonorgestrel.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs.
Counsel patients that the increased risk of VTE compared to non-users of COCs is greatest after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4-week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.
Counsel patients about the information regarding the risk of VTE with DRSP-containing COCs compared to COCs that contain levonorgestrel or some other progestins.
Counsel patients that drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Counsel patients on Warnings and Precautions associated with COCs.
Counsel patients that drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets contains DRSP. Drospirenone may increase potassium. Patients should be advised to inform their healthcare provider if they have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because the use of drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets in the presence of these conditions could cause serious heart and health problems. They should also inform their healthcare provider if they are currently on daily, long-term treatment (NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, heparin or aldosterone antagonists) for a chronic condition or taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Inform patients that drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets are not indicated during pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs during treatment with drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets, instruct the patient to stop further intake.
Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed.
Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs.
Counsel patients who are breastfeeding or who desire to breastfeed that COCs may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established.
Counsel any patient who starts COCs postpartum, and who has not yet had a period, to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light pink to pink tablet for 7 consecutive days.
Counsel patients that amenorrhea may occur. Rule out pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea in two or more consecutive cycles.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol [^4fbffbfe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a less serious set of symptoms occurring before menstruation. If you or your healthcare provider believe you have PMS, you should take drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets only if you want to prevent pregnancy; and not for the treatment of PMS.

Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets may also be taken to treat moderate acne if all of the following are true:

Your healthcare provider says it is safe for you to use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets.
You are at least 14 years old.
You have started having menstrual periods.
You want to use a birth control pill to prevent pregnancy.

How Well Does Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Work?

Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills. The better you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.

Based on the results of one clinical study, 1 to 2 women out of 100 women, may get pregnant during the first year they use drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in effectiveness. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box on the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Gianvi) [^ccc4aa82]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills and on less-selective use of pills than is practiced today. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. However, all women, especially older women, are cautioned to use the lowest-dose pill that is effective.

WARNING SIGNALS

If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor immediately:

Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung)
Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg)
Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack)
Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke)
Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)
Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show you how to examine your breasts)
Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)
Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)
Jaundice or a light yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark-colored urine, or light-colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems)

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin) [^59b3e406]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.

The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.

Figure 2 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives, for women who use oral contraceptives, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.

The aim of this open-label, multicenter, noncomparative study was to determine the efficacy, safety and bleeding profile of a new low-dose, monophasic combined oral contraceptive containing 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol and 3 mg drospirenone administered daily for 24 days followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval. Contraceptive efficacy was analyzed for 1018 women completing 11,140 treatment cycles. Eleven pregnancies occurred, giving a Pearl Index (PI) of 1.29 (upper limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30); of these pregnancies, five were considered due to method failure, giving an adjusted PI of 0.72 (upper limit of the 95% CI, 1.69). A total of 7 (0.7%) women discontinued study medication because of irregular bleeding, suggesting a favorable bleeding profile. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with an excellent safety profile. The majority of women (86%) stated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the treatment and over 70% of women would have continued with the study medication.

### Effect of a combination of ethinylestradiol 30 microg and drospirenone 3 mg on tolerance, cycle control, general well-being and fluid-related symptoms in women with premenstrual disorders requesting contraception [^2600d376]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Positive effects on premenstrual symptoms have been observed with low-dose oral contraceptives. Drospirenone is a synthetic progestogen with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid effects. This open-label, multicenter study evaluated the effects of a combination of ethinylestradiol 30 microg and drospirenone 3 mg on safety, cycle control, general well-being and fluid-related symptoms in women with premenstrual disorders requesting contraception.

Materials and Methods

A total of 241 healthy volunteers with symptoms of premenstrual disorder was enrolled in the study. Of the final sample, 203 completed the six-cycle treatment and were included in the efficacy analysis whereas 236 were included in the tolerability analysis. The subjects recruited to the study were required to fill up the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI).

Results

There was no significant change in body weight or blood pressure throughout the treatment. Adverse events reported by patients during treatment consisted of those already known to be associated with oral contraceptive use. PGWBI scores were significantly higher after six cycles of treatment compared with baseline values (p < .0001). A total of 198 (84.2%) subjects reported a great improvement in premenstrual symptoms.

Conclusions

The results of this study confirm that oral use of a combination of ethinylestradiol 30 microg and drospirenone 3 mg provides good cycle control, is well tolerated and has a positive impact on symptoms of premenstrual disorder.

### Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome [^c13fac51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Combined oral contraceptives, which provide both progestin and estrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. An oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and a low estrogen dose has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose oral contraceptives for contraception.

Objectives

To review all randomized controlled trials comparing a combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone to a placebo or another combined oral contraceptive for effect on premenstrual symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched for studies of drospirenone and premenstrual syndrome in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and POPLINE (20 Dec 2011); EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health Organization (02 Mar 2011). We also examined references lists of relevant articles and wrote to known investigators to find other trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing drospirenone with a placebo or with another COC for effect on premenstrual symptoms. The primary outcome included affective and physical premenstrual symptoms that were prospectively recorded. Adverse events related to combined oral contraceptive use were examined.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed with 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, the Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated.

Main Results

We included five trials with a total of 1920 women. Two placebo-controlled trials of women with PMDD showed less severe premenstrual symptoms after three months with drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 μg than with placebo (MD -7.92; 95% CI -11.16 to -4.67). The drospirenone group had greater mean decreases in impairment of productivity (MD -0.31; 95% CI -0.55 to -0.08), social activities (MD -0.29; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.04), and relationships (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). Side effects more common with the use of the drospirenone COC contraceptive were nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and breast pain. The respective odds ratios were 3.15 (95% CI 1.90 to 5.22), 4.92 (95% CI 3.03 to 7.96), and 2.67 (95% CI 1.50 to 4.78). Total adverse events related to the study drug were more likely for the drospirenone COC group (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.44). Three trials studied the effect of drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 μg on less severe symptoms. A placebo-controlled six-month trial had insufficient data for primary outcome analysis. Another six-month study used levonorgestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg for the comparison group but did not provide enough data on premenstrual symptoms. In a two-year trial, the drospirenone COC group had similar premenstrual symptoms to the comparison group given desogestrel 150 µg plus ethinyl estradiol 30 µg (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22). The groups were also similar for adverse events related to treatment (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33).

Authors' Conclusions

Drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 μg may help treat premenstrual symptoms in women with severe symptoms, that is, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The placebo also had a large effect. We do not know whether the combined oral contraceptive works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other oral contraceptives. Larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to address these issues. Trials should follow CONSORT guidelines.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^30648518]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — combined oral contraceptives (COCs) approved options and efficacy are summarized as follows: There are currently 4 COCs approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne — ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone acetate/ferrous fumarate, ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone, and ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone/levomefolate; the mechanism of action is antiandrogenic and trials show COCs reduce acne, including inflammatory and comedonal lesion counts. A 2012 Cochrane metaanalysis included 31 trials with a total of 12,579 women; Nine trials compared a COC to placebo and all reduced acne; Seventeen trials compared 2 COCs with no consistent differences; and Only 1 small study versus an oral antibiotic found no significant difference in self-assessed improvement. A recent study of drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 μg in moderate truncal AV showed significant reductions in lesion counts, and FDA approval specifies treatment of acne in women who also desire contraception.

Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 3 mg drospirenone (drsp) plus 20 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) administered in 24 days of active treatment followed by a four-day hormone-free interval (24/4 regimen) compared with placebo for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris.

Methods

Healthy females (14–45 years old) with moderate facial acne were randomized to 3 mg drsp/20 microg EE 24/4 (n = 270) or placebo (n = 268) for six cycles. The secondary efficacy variables measured included change from baseline to endpoint (cycle 6) in individual lesion count for nodules, papules, pustules, open and closed comedones.

Results

There were significantly greater reductions in individual lesion counts from baseline to endpoint in the 3 mg drsp/20 microg EE group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05 from parametric model).

Conclusion

The 3 mg drsp/20 microg EE COC administered in a 24/4 regimen significantly reduced acne lesions.

A two-group Chi-squared test was used for the second co-primary endpoint (treatment responders, defined as a 50% improvement in the adapted mFG score) and was repeated for same subgroups as the first primary endpoint, and trial completers. The difference in the response rates was demonstrated with 98.75% CI, and the p-value of Fisher's exact test was determined (1.25% one-sided significance level).

The primary analysis was conducted using the full analysis set (FAS; defined as all participants who received at least one dose of the trial drug and who had at least one post-baseline assessment of primary efficacy measurement), and supportive analyses were repeated on the per-protocol set (PPS). The relative change of the adapted mFG total score from baseline to end of Cycle 9/EDV was assessed for the overall population and for the trial completers only.

### An open-label randomized comparative study of oral contraceptives between medications containing 3 mg drospirenone / 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg levonogestrel / 30 microg ethinylestradiol in Thai women [^6ad7bcd8]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to compare the cycle control, efficacy and adverse events of a new low-dose oral contraceptive pill regimen containing 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP)/30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE), with a widely prescribed 150 microg levonogestrel (LNG)/30 microg EE. The results of this comparative trial demonstrated that the two preparations had no statistically significant difference in terms of cycle control, efficacy and adverse events. The occurrence of spotting and breakthrough bleeding was low and was not different between the two regimens. There was neither amenorrhea nor pregnancies reported in either group. The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea, headache and breast tenderness. Also statistically significant changes were found in body weight and blood pressure in both groups at the end of the study. In conclusion, the 3 mg DRSP/30 microg EE regimen provides good cycle control with reliable contraceptive efficacy and a low incidence of adverse events equal to the 150 microg LNG/30 microg EE preparation. Compared with the 150 microg LNG/30 microg EE preparation, the 3 mg DRSP/30 microg EE preparation demonstrated a more favorable effect on body weight and blood pressure, with the mean body weight and mean blood pressure remaining lower than baseline mean. The new formulation may be especially beneficial for women susceptible to body weight gain and rise in blood pressure.

### See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.[^74031d0b]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on presently available information on OCELLA, DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. If feasible, stop OCELLA at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism. Start OCELLA no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Stop OCELLA if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions.

Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. OCELLA contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. OCELLA is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia. Discontinue Ocella prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. Ocella can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop OCELLA if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.

Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and OCELLA discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs.

### Rate of pregnancy after using drospirenone and other progestin-containing oral contraceptives [^b77b8479]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether prior oral-contraceptive use has a negative effect on the ability of women to conceive in both the short-term and long-term.

Methods

The European Active Surveillance Study on Oral Contraceptives (EURAS-OC) was a controlled, prospective, noninterventional cohort study of 59,510 users of oral contraceptives containing drospirenone or other progestins in clinical practice in seven European countries. In a planned secondary analysis, pregnancy outcomes were investigated in 2,064 participants in EURAS-OC who stopped oral-contraceptive use after study entry because of planned pregnancy. The influence of age, parity, progestin type, ethinylestradiol dose, duration of oral-contraceptive use, and smoking status on the rate of pregnancy was assessed.

Results

Overall, 21.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.4–23.0%) of the past oral-contraceptive users were pregnant one cycle after oral-contraceptive cessation. This rate increased to 79.4% (95% CI 77.6–81.1%) at 1 year (13 cycles). Progestin type, ethinylestradiol dose, duration of oral-contraceptive use, and parity had no major influence on the rate of pregnancy after oral-contraceptive cessation. Up to age 35 years, age had only a minor influence on the rate of pregnancy. Rates of pregnancy were reduced in women older than 35 years and in current smokers.

Conclusion

Previous oral-contraceptive use does not negatively affect initial and 1-year rates of pregnancy after oral-contraceptive cessation. A comparison of these data with data external to this study indicates that the negative effect of aging on fecundity is not amplified by oral-contraceptive use.

### Ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, flutamide-metformin, or both for adolescents and women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism: opposite effects on adipocytokines and body adiposity [^07dbf3a6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism with anovulation, the so-called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is the most frequent endocrine disorder of young women. One of the stigmata of PCOS is a deficit of lean mass and an excess of fat, in particular, abdominal fat, even in the absence of obesity. Adiponectin and IL-6 are among the adipocytokines that have recently been related to abdominal fat excess, insulin resistance states, and cardiovascular disease risk. We studied the effects of two new treatment options, ethinylestradiol-drospirenone and flutamide-metformin, and of their combination on adipocytokinemia and body adiposity in adolescents and women with PCOS. Adolescents with PCOS (n = 32; age, approximately 15 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to receive the oral contraceptive (OC) ethinylestradiol-drospirenone, or the low-dose generic duo of flutamide (62.5 mg/d) plus metformin (850 mg/d). Young women with PCOS (n = 22; age, approximately 19 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)) were randomized to receive the same OC, either alone or with flutamide-metformin. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, lipids, androgens, IL-6, adiponectin, and body composition (by absorptiometry) were assessed at the start, and after 3 and/or 9 months. At the start, serum concentrations of the proinflammatory IL-6 were high, and those of the antiinflammatory adiponectin were low; body composition was adipose in each subpopulation. Abnormal adipocytokine levels, hypertriglyceridemia, and body adiposity diverged further from the norm in adolescents on OC; in contrast, girls on flutamide-metformin reverted all study indices toward normal, lost part of their fat excess, and reduced their lean mass deficit. In comparison to the girls on OC, those on flutamide-metformin lost a mean of approximately 4 kg of fat and gained approximately 4 kg of lean mass. Similarly, abnormal adipocytokine levels and adiposity were aggravated in women on OC alone and improved in women on OC plus flutamide-metformin; within 9 months, the latter subgroup lost a mean of approximately 3 kg of fat and gained approximately 3 kg of lean mass, in comparison to women on OC alone. In conclusion, young and nonobese PCOS patients were found to be in a low-grade, chronic inflammation state, and to have a body adiposity that evolves according to the balance of circulating adipocytokines and lipids, rather than to androgen excess or fasting hyperinsulinemia. Monotherapy with ethinylestradiol-drospirenone may not be a prime choice for PCOS, given its inefficacy to attenuate abnormal adipocytokine levels and body adiposity; ethinylestradiol-drospirenone plus flutamide-metformin, however, is a first OC combination that was found capable of reverting both the adipocytokine balance and the body composition toward normal, and that may therefore improve the long-term cardiovascular perspectives of women with PCOS.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Gianvi) [^8ba6f904]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

You should only use Gianvi for treatment of PMDD if you:

Have already decided to use oral contraceptives for birth control, and
Have been diagnosed with PMDD by your healthcare provider.

Gianvi has not been shown to be effective for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a less serious cluster of symptoms occurring before menstruation. If you or your healthcare provider believes you have PMS, you should only take Gianvi if you want to prevent pregnancy; and not for the treatment of PMS.

Gianvi may also be taken to treat moderate acne in women who are able to and wish to use the Pill for birth control.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who needs contraception (birth control) and chooses to use an oral contraceptive should understand the benefits and risks of using the Pill. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to help you decide if you should use the Pill for contraception and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the Pill. It will tell you how to use the Pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the Pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the Pill.

### Oral contraceptives containing drospirenone for premenstrual syndrome [^2e88af64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), which have both progestin and estrogen, have been examined for their ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms. A COC containing drospirenone and low estrogen has been approved for treating PMDD in women who choose COCs for contraception.

Objectives

To review all randomized controlled trials comparing combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone versus a placebo or another COC for effect on premenstrual symptoms.

Search Strategy

We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for studies of drospirenone and premenstrual syndrome. We also examined references lists of relevant articles, and wrote to known investigators to find other trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in any language that compared a COC containing drospirenone versus a placebo or another COC for effect on premenstrual symptoms. Primary outcome was the prospective recording of premenstrual symptoms (affective and physical). Adverse events related to COC use were examined.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed study quality.

Main Results

We included five trials with a total of 1600 women. Two placebo-controlled trials of women with PMDD showed less severe premenstrual symptoms after three months with drospirenone (plus ethinyl estradiol (EE) 20g) than with the placebo (WMD -7.83; 95% CI -10.91 to -4.75). The drospirenone group had greater decreases in impairment of productivity (WMD -0.42; 95% CI -0.64 to -0.20), social activities (WMD -0.39; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.15), and relationships (WMD -0.38; 95% CI -0.61 to -0.51). Side effects more common with COC use were nausea, intermenstrual bleeding, and breast pain. Little effect was found on less severe symptoms when comparing drospirenone plus more estrogen to another COC. A six-month study showed fewer symptoms with drospirenone, while a two-year trial found the groups to be similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Drospirenone plus EE 20 mug may help treat premenstrual symptoms in women with PMDD. The placebo also had a large effect. We do not know whether the COC works after three cycles, for women with less severe symptoms, or better than other COCs. Larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to address these issues. Trials should follow CONSORT reporting guidelines.

### Bleeding patterns and menstrual-related symptoms with the continuous use of a contraceptive combination of ethinylestradiol and drospirenone: a randomized study [^aa3a821d]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare bleeding patterns of women using a contraceptive combination of 30 mcg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) continuously or cyclically. Menstrual-related symptoms were also evaluated.

Study Design

This open, prospective, randomized study evaluated 78 women using the EE/DRSP combination continuously for 168 days or for six 28-day cycles, each followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval. A diary with pre-established scales was used to assess the frequency and intensity of bleeding and menstrual-related symptoms.

Results

Amenorrhea increased with continuous use; 62.2% of women with continuous use were amenorrheic at the end of treatment (95% CI: 46.6–77.8%). Dysmenorrhea, headache, acne, nausea, edema and increased appetite improved significantly in the continuous-use group, and mastalgia and edema in the cyclic-use group (p < .05). Six subjects in the continuous-use group (15.4%) and three in the cyclic-use group (7.7%) discontinued due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Continuous use was associated with amenorrhea and fewer menstrual-related symptoms compared to cyclic use.

### Special considerations for women of reproductive age on anticoagulation [^caf12293]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of combined estrogen-progestin medications by patients at increased risk of thrombosis is controversial. Estrogen has been shown to have a dose-dependent thrombotic risk, with the highest thrombotic risk in patients treated with 50μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel and the lowest in 20–30μg ethinylestradiol-levonorgestrel. A Cochrane meta-analysis on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk associated with different combined oral contraceptives among women who were not anticoagulated found that when compared to levonorgestrel, other progestins' pooled relative risk (95% confidence interval, CI) of VTE was 1.33 (1.08–1.63) for gestodene, 1.93 (1.31–2.83) for desogestrel, and 1.67 (1.10–2.55) for drospirenone. A prior systematic review also found that levonorgestrel was associated with lower thrombotic risk compared to other progestins: relative risk of VTE (95% CI) of ethinylestradiol with progestins in patients taking combined oral contraceptives versus non-users was 2.9 (2.2–3.8) for levonorgestrel, 6.6 (5.6–7.8) for desogestrel, and 6.4 (5.4–7.5) for drospirenone.

Tranexamic acid is another option for managing heavy menses, which has been available without a prescription in Scandinavia for decades. For women at risk of recurrent thrombosis, however, the safety of this medication remains controversial. One large historical prospective cohort study showed an increased incidence of VTE in women of reproductive age treated with tranexamic acid (without anticoagulation) compared to those not treated, though this small increase in VTE risk is not clinically significant for use during menstruation alone (number needed to harm per 5 days of treatment was 78,549 persons). A meta-analysis of a more general, non-surgical patient population treated with tranexamic acid for indications including but not limited to menstrual bleeding demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality without increased venous or arterial thrombotic complications. While further studies that control for indication for anticoagulation are needed, many clinicians cautiously recommend tranexamic acid to control troublesome menstrual bleeding in women treated with anticoagulation.

### The use of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and drospirenone in an extended regimen over 126 days [^c1298b7e]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the bleeding profile, acceptance and safety of an extended 126-day regimen of the oral contraceptive Yasmin [30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 3 mg drospirenone (DRSP)].

Methods

Using daily diaries, 177 women recorded bleeding events throughout the 126-day cycle. At end of treatment, the women completed questionnaires reflecting their satisfaction with the extended regimen. A subset of 30 women underwent endometrial histology sampling after completion of the extended regimen.

Results

Of 177 women assigned to the extended regimen, 80.8% completed the extended 126-day regimen. Approximately 40% of the women reported complete absence of bleeding, while in 60% a shift towards less intense bleeding was observed. The first onset of bleeding occurred after a median of 99.0 days into the extended cycle. The acceptance of the extended regimen was high, with 68.4% of the women expressing satisfaction. The general safety profile with the extended use was comparable to that seen with the conventional 21+7-day regimen. All endometrial biopsies with sufficient material for analysis were normal and supported the endometrial safety of the extended regimen.

Conclusion

This study showed that the continuous use of a 30-microg EE and 3-mg DRSP formulation over 126 days was safe, efficacious, well accepted by the users and resulted in a considerable reduction of bleeding.

### Ethinylestradiol / chlormadinone acetate for use in dermatological disorders [^da2a4fb0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Two patients (cases 2 and 4) had PCOS and sought treatment for their acne (one of these patients also wanted birth control); treatment for associated fertility problems/anovulation was not requested.

Acne may be treated with topical and/or systemic drugs. Topical agents include retinoids, antibiotics or benzoyl peroxide. Systemic agents include antibiotics or retinoids, alone or in combination with COCs. COCs are considered first-line treatment in women with acne who desire contraception provided no contraindications exist; compared with placebo, COCs reduce acne lesion counts, lesion severity and self-assessed acne. COCs containing a progestin with anti-androgenic effects or an anti-androgen (e.g. cyproterone, drospirenone and chlormadinone) should be considered in the first place. Numerous studies support the use of COCs composed of low-dose estrogens (defined as ethinylestradiol < 50 μg) plus anti-androgenic agents or progestins with anti-androgenic properties.

EE/CMA is composed of a low-dose estrogen component (ethinylestradiol) and an anti-androgenic component (chlormadinone acetate), and was selected as an appropriate hormone therapy for each of the patients in this case series because, like other COCs, the estrogen component reduces androgen levels via their action on other hormones (LH, FSH, sex hormone-binding globulin), and anti-androgenic progestins have androgen receptor and/or 5α-reductase inhibitory activity. EE/CMA has not been investigated in clinical trials in patients with FPB or hirsutism, but subgroups of patients receiving EE/CMA in trials evaluating its efficacy in the treatment of acne and/or seborrhea have reported beneficial effects (as described in detail in the accompanying review article. All four patients were successfully treated with EE/CMA. It was also well tolerated; no treatment-related adverse events were reported by any of the patients in this case series.

EE/CMA has a favorable hormone profile, and appears to improve acne and other dermatological conditions; it is also well tolerated and patient compliance is generally high. Although confirmatory evidence of its efficacy in hirsutism and androgenetic alopecia in large, well-controlled studies is required, EE/CMA may be a valuable option among available COCs in the management of hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia and acne.

### Flutamide-metformin plus ethinylestradiol-drospirenone for lipolysis and antiatherogenesis in young women with ovarian hyperandrogenism: the key role of early, low-dose flutamide [^fb8fc128]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

A low-dose combination of flutamide-metformin and ethinylestradiol-drospirenone was recently found to reduce the excess of total and abdominal fat, to diminish the deficit in lean mass, and to attenuate the dysadipocytokinemia of young women with ovarian hyperandrogenism, a variant of polycystic ovary syndrome. We questioned the need to give flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, together with an oral contraceptive that contains drospirenone, a progestin claimed to have antiandrogen properties. The additive effects of low-dose flutamide (62.5 mg/d) were assessed over 3 months in young patients with hyperinsulinemic ovarian hyperandrogenism (n = 40; age, approximately 17 yr; body mass index, approximately 22 kg/m(2)); all participants started on metformin (850 mg/d) and a fourth-generation contraceptive (ethinylestradiol 30 microg plus drospirenone 3 mg, 21 d/month), and they were randomized to receive flutamide in addition (n = 20) or not (n = 20). Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, testosterone, adiponectin, and IL-6 were determined at baseline and after 3 months, together with body composition (by dual x-ray absorptiometry) and with Doppler assessment of ovarian arterial resistance. At start, the pulsatility and resistance indices of ovarian arteries were elevated. By comparison of 3-month changes between randomized subgroups, the addition of low-dose flutamide was found to have consistently (more) normalizing effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, IL-6, and adiponectin, lean body mass, total and abdominal fat mass, and arterial flow in the ovaries. In conclusion, low-dose flutamide is herewith identified as a pivotal component within a first contraceptive combination therapy that has been shown to attenuate the hypoadiponectinemia, ovarian vascular hyperresistance, lean mass deficit, and central adiposity of young women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Finally, these data challenge any claim that drospirenone, as currently used in a contraceptive, is a clinically significant antiandrogen.

2.1 How to Take Yasmin

Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day. The failure rate may increase when pills are missed or taken incorrectly.

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Yasmin must be taken as directed, in the order directed on the blister pack. Single missed pills should be taken as soon as remembered.

2.2 How to Start Yasmin

Instruct the patient to begin taking Yasmin either on the first day of her menstrual period (Day 1 Start) or on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period (Sunday Start).

Day 1 Start

During the first cycle of Yasmin use, instruct the patient to take one yellow Yasmin daily, beginning on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle. (The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one yellow Yasmin daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. Yasmin should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Yasmin can be taken without regard to meals. If Yasmin is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, Yasmin should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

### Ethinylestradiol / chlormadinone acetate: dermatological benefits [^906924be]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

6. Rationale for the Use of Oral Contraceptives for the Treatment of Pilosebaceous Unit Disorders

The use of oral hormonal treatments for acne vulgaris, hirsutism, FPHL and seborrhea has a physiological rationale. Combined oral contraceptives contain an estrogen (such as ethinylestradiol or mestranol) and a progestin (such as desogestrel, drospirenone, levonorgestrel or chlormadinone). Together they reduce the effect of androgens by reducing ovarian and adrenal androgen production and by blocking the action of androgens in the PSU. The ethinylestradiol component inhibits luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) thus reducing serum androgen levels. In addition, ethinylestradiol increases sex hormone-binding globulin levels, which decrease circulating serum testosterone levels. The progestin component blocks the androgen receptor in the PSU (i.e. is anti-androgenic). Because of these properties, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are a recommended treatment option in the management of acne vulgaris.

EE/CMA is among the most commonly used combined oral contraceptives, and has an anti-androgenic effect; a review of its potential use for the improvement of dermatological manifestations associated with hyperandrogenemia follows.

Drospirenone progestin-only pills (DRSP POPs) — transition and start guidance: DRSP POPs are noted as more similar to combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in mechanism (inhibition of ovulation), and "the recommendations for starting and using a back-up method are similar to COC recommendations." When switching to DRSP POPs from another hormonal contraceptive, "consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after starting DRSP POPs." When switching to norethindrone or norgestrel POPs from another contraceptive method, "consider continuing their previous method for 2 days after starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs." The report also states that "No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting norethindrone or norgestrel POPs at different times of the cycle" and "No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting DRSP POPs at different times of the cycle."

1.1 Oral Contraceptive

Nikki™ (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.

1.2 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)

Nikki (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg is also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of Nikki (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.

The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.

Nikki (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

1.3 Acne

Nikki (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women at least 14 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche. Nikki (drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP), 3 mg/0.02 mg should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.

Mode-of-action studies showed that, while E2 activates both the nuclear and membrane estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), E4 binds to nuclear ERα, but does not activate membrane ERα in specific tissues (resulting in, eg, improving endothelial healing, and a minimal impact on liver function and on normal and malignant breast tissue). In addition, when coincubated with E2 in vitro, E4 was able to partially antagonize the E2-induced proliferation of human breast epithelium.

In 2015, E4 was out-licensed to the Belgian company Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Liege, Belgium) for further development in nononcological women's health applications. Phase 3 thirteen-cycle studies in 3,027 participants revealed that 15 mg E4 combined with 3 mg drospirenone is a safe and effective COC with a predictable bleeding pattern and Pearl Indices of 0.44 (European/Russian study) and 2.42 (USA/Canadian study). Moreover, it has limited effects on hemostasis, and beneficial effects on lipids, carbohydrate metabolism and bone turnover. Its adverse event profile aligns with other COCs. Compared with ethinylestradiol COCs, E2-COC and E4-COC appear to have a safer thrombotic profile, based on pharmacovigilance data on reported venous thromboembolism. Since 2022, the E4/drospirenone COC is available worldwide. In a phase 2 trial, 15 mg E4 was effective for the relief of vasomotor symptoms, as shown by a significantly decreased frequency and severity of hot flushes, and decreased symptoms related to signs of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause. This has been confirmed in phase 3 studies investigating 15 mg and 20 mg daily doses. It is expected that E4 for MHT will become available in 2026.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin) [^7dbf8fda]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Sunday Start

During the first cycle of Yasmin use, instruct the patient to take one yellow Yasmin daily, beginning on the first Sunday after the onset of her menstrual period. She should take one yellow Yasmin daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one white tablet daily on Days 22 through 28. Yasmin should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Yasmin can be taken without regard to meals. Yasmin should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.

The patient should begin her next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of Yasmin on the same day of the week that she began her first regimen, following the same schedule. She should begin taking her yellow tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last white tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of Yasmin is started later than the day following administration of the last white tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a yellow Yasmin daily for seven consecutive days.

When switching from a different birth control pill

When switching from another birth control pill, Yasmin should be started on the same day that a new pack of the previous oral contraceptive would have been started.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol [^2edc7df7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Drospirenone is a spironolactone analogue with anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. The estrogen in drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol is ethinyl estradiol.

 Contraception

Two studies evaluated the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations on the suppression of ovarian activity as assessed by measurement of follicle size via transvaginal ultrasound and serum hormone (progesterone and estradiol) analyses during two treatment cycles (21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period). More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen.

 Acne

Acne vulgaris is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of EE and DRSP increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established. The impact of the antiandrogenic activity of DRSP on acne is not known.

### Bioequivalence study of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol / drospirenone / levomefolate calcium relative to ethinylestradiol / drospirenone and to levomefolate calcium alone [^5b41cc5f]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A new tablet formulation containing 0.02 mg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone/0.451 mg levomefolate calcium (calcium salt containing 0.416 mg L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) was assessed for bioequivalence compared to the approved oral contraceptive (OC) tablet containing identical amounts of ethinylestradiol and drospirenone and to a tablet containing 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium.

Study Design

Forty-four subjects received in an intraindividual crossover design single doses of the new tablet formulation or the established ethinylestradiol/drospirenone tablet or the levomefolate calcium tablet.

Results

Bioequivalence was demonstrated for ethinylestradiol, drospirenone and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (active moiety of levomefolate calcium) between the investigated tablet formulations. The geometric mean ratios of the AUC((0-tlast)) and C(max) values for all three compounds and their 90% confidence intervals were well within the 80%-125% range generally accepted to demonstrate bioequivalence.

Conclusion

The rate and extent of absorption of ethinylestradiol and drospirenone were not affected by the concomitant administration of levomefolate calcium and vice versa.

### Cardiovascular risks associated with the use of drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives [^a4c01a7b]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The "Long-term Active Surveillance Study for Oral Contraceptives" investigated the risks of long-term use of a 21-day regimen of drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (DRSP) compared to established oral contraceptives (OCs) in a routine clinical setting.

Study Design

Prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study conducted in seven European countries with three main exposure groups: new users of DRSP, levonorgestrel-containing OCs (LNG), and OCs containing other progestogens (Other OCs). All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest (OoI) were validated via attending physicians and relevant source documents. Main OoI were serious clinical outcomes, in particular cardiovascular events. Comprehensive follow-up procedures were implemented. Statistical analyses were based on Cox regression models.

Results

A total of 1,113 study centers enrolled 59,510 women. Overall 28%, 26% and 45% of these women used DRSP, LNG and Other OCs, respectively. Study participants were followed for up to ten years (mean value, 5.4years), which generated 318,784 woman-years (WY) of observation. Low loss to follow-up and drop-out rates of 2.9% and 16.8% were achieved. DRSP, LNG, and Other OCs showed similar incidence rates of venous thromboembolism. Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) were close to unity. For arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) and initiation of antihypertensive treatment statistically significant lower risks were found for DRSP compared to LNG and Other OCs.

Conclusion

DRSP use was associated with similar general health risks and a low risk of ATE compared to OCs containing other progestogens.

Implication Statement

The 21-day regimen of drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives is associated with similar risk of VTE compared to other combined oral contraceptives as well as potentially with a lower risk of ATE.

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^316118e9]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Specific types or doses of progestins, oestrogens or combinations of COCP cannot currently be recommended due to insufficient data among women and adolescents with PCOS. Practice should be informed by general population guidelines. This was a conditional and low GRADE quality evidence-based recommendation in relation to the use of specific types of COCP and was based on evidence of COCP use in the general population and World Health Organisation Guidelines as there were no trials evaluating this in women or adolescents with PCOS (see Section 4.2 and 4.3 in the Technical Report). A practice point for this section includes that COCPs with 35 μg of ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate should not be used as first-line therapy due to the absence of evidence of greater efficacy and the presence of higher risks, including deep venous thrombosis. All COCPs are associated with an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, but the risk is higher with COCPs containing 30–35 μg of ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate or drospirenone when compared to the COCP containing 30 μg of ethinylestradiol with levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone) or norgestimate. Lower-risk COCP preparations should be recommended as first-line therapy.
2 Combined COCP and metformin

The COCP in combination with metformin could be considered in adolescents with PCOS and a BMI > 25 kg/m 2 where the COCP and lifestyle changes do not achieve desired goals. This was a conditional and low GRADE quality evidence-based recommendation based on a single RCT including 79 adolescents followed over 6 months and supported by 6 RCTs in adult women that highlighted the differential effects according to BMI categories. Although the combination of metformin and the COCP offers additional benefits, these did not surpass the impact of the COCP plus lifestyle interventions and hence the combination was indicated when the COCP and lifestyle interventions have failed to meet the treatment goals. Since the COCP in combination with metformin lead to mild gastrointestinal side effects, these potential side effects need to be discussed with the adolescent and her family (see Section 4.2 and 4.3 in the Technical Report).

### Evaluation of effects of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol combined with drospirenone on adrenal steroidogenesis in hyperandrogenic women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^3bc0061d]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether the administration of an oral contraceptive containing the new antiandrogenic drospirenone is associated with reduced adrenal androgen synthesis in hyperandrogenic women with diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. Drospirenone, an analogue of spironolactone and aldosterone antagonist, is a novel progestin under clinical development that is similar to the natural hormone progesterone, combining potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Healthy volunteers in University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Patient(S)

Fifteen women ages 18 to 28 years with the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Intervention(S)

Three months of contraceptive use (30 mcg ethinylestradiol, 3 mg drospirenone).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

An adrenocorticotropic hormone test was performed before and after the study.

Result(S)

Adrenal production of cortisol was unchanged after therapy with oral contraceptives. An interesting observation was reduced basal concentrations of androgens such as androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and free testosterone during therapy. The ratios of the areas of substrates to products before and after oral contraceptive administration were compared for differences in 17alpha-hydroxylase (17-hydroxyprogesterone/progesterone) and 17,20-lyase (androstenedione/17-hydroxyprogesterone); activities were significantly reduced, indicating a reduction in the activities of these enzymes.

Conclusion(S)

The present results show for the first time that oral contraceptives containing drospirenone affect adrenal steroidogenesis by reducing synthesis and release of androgens in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone, leaving adrenal production of cortisol unchanged.

### Effects of an oral contraceptive containing estetrol and drospirenone on ovarian function [^96a11d2a]. Contraception (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of estetrol 15 mg/drospirenone 3 mg on ovarian function.

Study Design

Single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel study in healthy young women with proven ovulatory cycles. Participants received either estetrol 15 mg/drospirenone 3 mg (E4/DRSP) (n = 41) or ethinylestradiol 20 µg/drospirenone 3 mg (EE/DRSP) (n = 41) in a 24/4-day regimen for 3 consecutive cycles. Follicular size and endometrial thickness were measured by transvaginal ultrasound every 3 days in cycles 1 and 3. Blood was sampled for hormone analysis. Ovarian function expressed as Hoogland score was based on follicular size, serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) concentrations. Ovulation was defined as a ruptured follicle-like structure > 13 mm with serum E2 concentrations > 100 pmol/L and serum P concentrations > 5 nmol/L. We assessed return of ovulation after treatment cessation, and safety throughout the study.

Results

None of the participants ovulated with E4/DRSP use, while one participant ovulated once and one participant ovulated twice during EE/DRSP treatment. Most participants had a Hoogland score of 1 (no ovarian activity) in cycle 1 (85.0% and 82.9% of participants on E4/DRSP and EE/DRSP, respectively) and in cycle 3 (65.8% and 83.8%, respectively). E4/DRSP suppressed follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone to a lesser extent than EE/DRSP, whereas both treatments comparably suppressed E2 and P and endometrial thickness. Return of ovulation occurred, on average, 15.5 days after E4/DRSP treatment discontinuation. E4/DRSP was safe and well-tolerated.

Conclusions

E4 15 mg/DRSP 3 mg results in adequate ovulation inhibition and ovarian function suppression, comparable to a marketed combined oral contraceptive containing EE/DRSP.

Implications Statement

Treatment with E4 15 mg/DRSP 3 mg showed complete ovulation inhibition, despite less suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone compared to EE/DRSP. If it becomes commercially available, E4/DRSP, containing a naturally occurring estrogen, should be as effective as EE/DRSP.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1.000000000000000e+00 VAGINAL BLEEDING

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the Pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.

2.000000000000000e+00 CONTACT LENSES

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

3.000000000000000e+00 FLUID RETENTION

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

4.000000000000000e+00 MELASMA

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

5.000000000000000e+00 OTHER SIDE EFFECTS

Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^67c0b47f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Medical options for menstrual suppression — oral progestins — include regimens that vary by progestin (e.g., norethindrone acetate 5 mg bid–tid; medroxyprogesterone acetate). Amenorrhea outcomes include: norethindrone 0.35 with low rates; norethindrone acetate 5 mg with rates of up to 76%; and drospirenone 4 mg with data limited, with menstrual irregularity appearing to improve with more prolonged use. These may be useful if estrogens are contraindicated and oral dosing is adjustable versus DMPA, but there is inconsistent achievement of amenorrhea, higher expense than combined OCPs, and a need for consistent and strict adherence.

5.3 Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Yasmin is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

5.4 Liver Disease

Discontinue Yasmin if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.

Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.

e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease

There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women aged 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups. In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small. However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.

2. ESTIMATES OF MORTALITY FROM CONTRACEPTIVE USE

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table V). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is below that associated with childbirth.

The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's — but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.

Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.

Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, women of all ages who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^d702a819]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptive (COC) with spironolactone — hyperkalemia safety: "Because the progestin drospirenone is an analog of spironolactone, there has been some concern that using a drospirenone-containing COC and spironolactone together might increase the risk of hyperkalemia." In 1 study, "27 women with acne were treated with a COC containing drospirenone 3 mg and ethinyl estradiol 30 μg and spironolactone 100 mg each day," and "There were no significant elevations of serum potassium and there were no additional side effects significant enough to discontinue treatment."

### Effect of a combined oral contraceptive containing 3 mg of drospirenone and 30 microg of ethinyl estradiol on the human endometrium [^f504674d]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an in-depth assessment of the effects of the combined oral contraceptive containing 30 microg of ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg of drospirenone (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin) on the endometrium by means of endometrial morphometry in comparison to an untreated cycle.

Design

The open, multicenter study consisted of one untreated precycle and 13 treatment cycles.

Setting

Four gynecologic clinics in Belgium, The Netherlands, and Switzerland were involved.

Patient(S)

Forty women with a history of regular menstrual cycles.

Intervention(S)

Before the commencement of the trial, 3 months without any hormonal intake was obligatory. The first endometrial sample was done in the untreated precycle, adjusted to the day of LH peak plus 5 to 6 days. During the medication phase, endometrial samples were taken at cycle 3, 6 and 13.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Primary outcome measure of the study was the morphologic assessment of the endometrium with measures such as glandular diameter, glandular epithelial height, and number of vacuolated cells per 1,000 glandular cells. Furthermore, the endometrial thickness was measured by ultrasound.

Result(S)

After 13 cycles of medication use the endometrium had an atrophic appearance in 63% of the subjects. The size of the glands, the glandular epithelial height, and the number of glands per square millimeter were already significantly reduced after 3 months' use. Histological and ultrasonographical evaluation of the endometrium indicated a suppression of the proliferative activity of the endometrium.

Conclusion(S)

The combination of 30 microg of ethinyl estradiol with 3 mg of drospirenone induces changes of the endometrium that are comparable with other combined oral contraceptives and exhibits a marked antiproliferative effect on the endometrium. The medication was proven to be an effective oral contraceptive and revealed good cycle control characteristics.

### Effects of low-dose combined drospirenone-ethinylestradiol on perimenstrual symptoms experienced by women with endometriosis [^51c43298]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of a 24/4-day regimen of a low-dose combination drospirenone-ethinylestradiol oral contraceptive in alleviating perimenstrual symptoms among Japanese women with endometriosis.

Methods

The present prospective, non-randomized study enrolled women diagnosed with endometriosis radiographically or surgically at the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine hospital, Japan, between December 1, 2010 and August 31, 2013. Patients received treatment with oral drospirenone-ethinylestradiol for six treatment cycles. Dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia severity were assessed using visual analog scale scores after three and six treatment cycles, and changes in perimenstrual symptoms were assessed using the menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ) scores.

Results

In total, 46 patients were recruited for the study. Dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia were all significantly reduced after both three and six treatment cycles in comparison with baseline (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). After six treatment cycles, significant reductions were observed for all menstrual MDQ measures and for the premenstrual water retention and negative-effect MDQ measures (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Combination drospirenone-ethinylestradiol was effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and somatic/psychological symptoms in Japanese women with endometriosis.
