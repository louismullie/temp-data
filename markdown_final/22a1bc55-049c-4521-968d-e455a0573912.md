## Question

What blood pressure medication should i start

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to choose an initial blood pressure medication, including when to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, which drug classes to select, and how to individualize treatment based on comorbidities, race/ethnicity, age, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging hypertension. Then, I should verify the general principle that BP lowering itself drives benefit. Next, I will decide monotherapy versus combination therapy based on stage and baseline BP. After that, I need to select the specific first-line classes and preferred combinations. Then, I will individualize by comorbidities and race/ethnicity, consider age and frailty, and finally address special populations, adherence strategies, and a practical follow-up plan with targets and escalation steps.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and staging, because treatment thresholds and intensity hinge on accurate classification and risk. I should double-check that office BP is confirmed with proper technique and, when feasible, corroborated by home or ambulatory monitoring, and then stage as Stage 1 (130–139/80–89 mmHg) or Stage 2 (≥ 140/90 mmHg) per contemporary guidelines, noting that pharmacologic treatment is generally recommended at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and that lower thresholds apply when clinical CVD is present or risk is high, which materially changes the urgency and intensity of therapy [^111cisfQ] [^116nKqcH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about drug class effects before anchoring the principle that the magnitude of BP reduction is the dominant driver of cardiovascular risk reduction. I need to ensure I emphasize that across major classes, the relative risk reduction is broadly similar per mmHg lowered, so the key is to achieve targets efficiently and safely, with the caveat that beta-blockers are generally less protective for stroke prevention than the other first-line classes in the absence of compelling indications [^115V4yM2] [^113wcFJf].

> Now, I will decide monotherapy versus combination therapy based on stage and baseline BP. For Stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg), I should confirm that initiating two first-line agents of different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination, is recommended to improve the likelihood and speed of BP control, whereas for Stage 1 hypertension (130–139/80–89 mmHg), starting with a single first-line agent and titrating or adding sequentially is reasonable, especially if baseline BP is only modestly above target and risk is lower [^111kNc8j] [^114xvW8W] [^116nKqcH].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for initial combination therapy. The Cochrane reviews have not shown definitive differences in hard outcomes between initial combination versus monotherapy due to small event numbers, but they and contemporary guidelines consistently show faster and greater BP lowering with initial combination, which is mechanistically linked to better outcomes, and single-pill combinations improve adherence, so the practical and physiologic rationale remains strong despite the evidence gap for mortality endpoints [^113i4TjW] [^115Q3UvG] [^111NJokU] [^1124e2kh].

> Next, I should review which drug classes are first-line and which to avoid initially. I need to ensure I list thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs as the four evidence-based first-line classes, and explicitly reserve beta-blockers for compelling indications such as HFrEF, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmia control, given their inferior stroke prevention and tolerability profile in uncomplicated hypertension [^113wcFJf] [^113u9ZD3] [^117E9Ho2].

> I will now examine preferred combinations when starting with two drugs. Let me think about synergistic mechanisms: pairing a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) with either a dihydropyridine CCB or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic is preferred, and using a fixed-dose single-pill combination improves adherence and simplifies titration, which I should prioritize when combination therapy is indicated [^111rJjTU] [^11475XTt] [^1124e2kh].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific comorbidities that shift the optimal initial choice. I should confirm that in proteinuric CKD, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred initially or as add-on for kidney outcomes, and that in diabetes with hypertension, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is often prioritized, with combination therapy favored when baseline BP is ≥ 150/90 mmHg to reach tighter targets more reliably [^116VhNKh] [^113hhZjA] [^116Q1srx].

> I need to check race/ethnicity considerations carefully. For Black adults without compelling indications, thiazide-type diuretics or dihydropyridine CCBs are preferred as part of initial therapy because of smaller average BP responses to ACE inhibitors as monotherapy, yet I should avoid overgeneralization since individual BP response distributions overlap substantially, so a risk-based, guideline-concordant approach with early combination therapy often mitigates this concern and improves equity of BP control [^115grVaK] [^1124e2kh] [^116FTHSg].

> Let me consider age and frailty, because these modify both targets and starting intensity. In adults ≥ 85 years or those with symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or treated BP in the 120–139/70–89 mmHg range, I should avoid initial combination therapy and start low and go slow with monotherapy, reassessing for falls, cognition, and tolerability, whereas in noninstitutionalized older adults who are ambulatory, targeting < 130/80 mmHg is reasonable if tolerated [^116nKqcH] [^115syZP7].

> Next, I should review special populations and compelling indications. In pregnancy or women planning pregnancy, I must avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs and use alternatives such as labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa, and in children and adolescents, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, long-acting CCBs, or thiazides are appropriate first-line choices with avoidance of ACE inhibitors/ARBs in pregnancy and preference for ACE inhibitors/ARBs in pediatric CKD with proteinuria [^1149JzKk].

> I should double-check adherence and implementation strategies because they materially affect real-world control. Using single-pill combinations when combination therapy is indicated, aligning dosing to the patient's routine to support habit formation, and reinforcing that morning or bedtime dosing yields similar outcomes can all improve persistence and time to control, which is crucial given the early hazard of uncontrolled BP after diagnosis [^11475XTt] [^115DsvNA] [^116qXZgi] [^112FXV7A].

> Now, I will outline a practical follow-up and escalation plan. I need to ensure reassessment within about 4 weeks to titrate or add therapy, escalate to a three-drug combination (ACE inhibitor or ARB plus CCB plus thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic) if BP remains above target on maximally tolerated dual therapy, and consider spironolactone as the fourth agent for resistant hypertension, while avoiding simultaneous ACE inhibitor plus ARB or renin inhibitor combinations due to harm [^112anHrA] [^1159oxhV] [^1112fAjs].

> Let me synthesize a concrete recommendation for a typical adult with newly diagnosed Stage 2 hypertension at 155/95 mmHg and no compelling indications. I would initiate a single-pill combination of an ARB with a thiazide-like diuretic (for example, valsartan 160 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or an ARB with a dihydropyridine CCB (for example, telmisartan 40 mg/amlodipine 5 mg), reassess in 4 weeks, and if not at target, intensify to triple therapy with ARB plus CCB plus thiazide-like diuretic, while counseling on lifestyle and home BP monitoring to close the loop on control and safety [^111rJjTU] [^11475XTt] [^112anHrA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost defaulted to saying "beta-blockers are never first-line", but I should correct that nuance. Beta-blockers remain first-line when there is a compelling indication such as HFrEF, angina, post–myocardial infarction care, or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, so the accurate statement is that they are not preferred for routine initial therapy in uncomplicated hypertension absent such indications [^117E9Ho2] [^113wcFJf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overarching message is clear: choose therapy based on stage and baseline BP to decide mono versus combination, select from the four first-line classes, pair complementary mechanisms in fixed-dose combinations when appropriate, individualize by comorbidity and race/ethnicity without overgeneralization, and escalate promptly to triple therapy if dual therapy fails, all while prioritizing adherence and close follow-up to realize the cardiovascular benefits of timely BP control [^111kNc8j] [^113u9ZD3] [^112anHrA].

Start with a **two-drug combination** [^116nKqcH] of a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic [^111rJjTU], using a single-pill combination when possible [^11475XTt] to improve adherence and speed control [^1124e2kh] [^111N7KCo]. Use **monotherapy only** for stage 1 hypertension in low-risk patients [^114xvW8W] or when dual therapy is not tolerated [^notfound]. Avoid beta-blockers unless there is a compelling indication (e.g. heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia) [^113wcFJf] [^117E9Ho2]. Adjust therapy every 2–4 weeks until the target is reached [^notfound], and avoid combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs [^1112fAjs].

---

## General principles for initial antihypertensive therapy

- **Combination therapy**: Most patients should start with two drugs from different classes to achieve faster, more reliable control [^116nKqcH] [^111rJjTU].

- **Single-pill combinations**: Preferred to improve adherence and simplify regimens [^112XTFfx] [^11475XTt].

- **Monotherapy**: Consider only for stage 1 hypertension in low-risk patients or when dual therapy is not tolerated [^114xvW8W] [^116v5PnZ].

- **Beta-blockers**: Not first-line unless there is a compelling indication (e.g. heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia) [^113wcFJf] [^117E9Ho2].

---

## Recommended first-line drug classes

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril <br/> - Ramipril | - First-line for most patients <br/> - Especially with diabetes or CKD [^113u9ZD3] [^113hhZjA] |
| Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan <br/> - Candesartan | - First-line for most patients <br/> - Especially with diabetes or CKD [^113u9ZD3] [^113hhZjA] |
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | - Amlodipine <br/> - Felodipine <br/> - Diltiazem | - First-line <br/> - Especially in older adults or Black patients [^113u9ZD3] [^115grVaK] |
| Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Indapamide <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | - First-line <br/> - Especially in older adults or Black patients [^113u9ZD3] [^115grVaK] |

---

## Recommended initial combinations

Preferred combinations include an **ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a CCB** — for example, lisinopril with amlodipine or losartan with amlodipine [^111rJjTU] — or an **ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic**, such as lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide or valsartan with chlorthalidone [^111xhpHY]. These combinations are supported by guidelines and improve adherence and control [^1124e2kh] [^111xhpHY].

---

## Situations requiring individualized initial therapy

- **Diabetes or CKD**: Start with an ACE inhibitor or ARB to reduce proteinuria and slow renal decline [^113hhZjA] [^116VhNKh].

- **Black patients**: Start with a thiazide-like diuretic or CCB; ACE inhibitors are less effective as monotherapy [^115grVaK] [^112FZ2Lx].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid ACE inhibitors and ARBs; use methyldopa, labetalol, or nifedipine [^1149JzKk].

- **Elderly or frail patients**: Start low and titrate slowly to avoid hypotension and falls [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Recheck **BP every 2–4 weeks** and titrate or add agents until the target is reached. Typical targets are < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, or < 140/90 mmHg in older or frail patients [^115syZP7]. If dual therapy fails, escalate to triple therapy (ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide) [^112anHrA] or add spironolactone or a beta-blocker if indicated [^112zkx4m].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Most patients**: Start with two drugs (ACEi/ARB + CCB or thiazide), preferably as a single-pill combination [^116nKqcH] [^11475XTt].

- **Stage 1 or low-risk patients**: Consider monotherapy, titrating and adding as needed [^114xvW8W].

- **Avoid**: Beta-blockers unless indicated; do not combine ACE inhibitors and ARBs [^113wcFJf] [^1112fAjs].

- **Adjust**: Titrate every 2–4 weeks to reach target BP [^notfound].

---

Initial therapy should be a **two-drug combination** of a renin–angiotensin system blocker plus a CCB or thiazide, using single-pill combinations when possible, with monotherapy reserved for select low-risk stage 1 cases and beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111NJokU]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — rationale for initial two‑drug therapy for most patients: With the emphasis on achieving a BP target in most patients of < 130/80 mmHg, the majority of patients will require combination therapy, and initial combination therapy is invariably more effective at BP lowering than monotherapy, with even low‑dose combination therapy usually more effective than maximal dose monotherapy. Two‑drug combinations as initial therapy have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, with no or only a small increase in the risk of hypotensive episodes. Although no RCT has compared major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes between initial combination therapy and monotherapy, observational evidence indicates that shorter time to achieve BP control is associated with lower risk, and compared with initial monotherapy, starting with a two‑drug combination exhibits more frequent BP control after 1 year. Previous Guidelines acknowledged initial combination therapy for patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension or patients at high or very high risk, and initial monotherapy was only recommended for grade 1 hypertension and low‑ or moderate‑risk patients. Some low‑ or moderate‑risk patients with grade 1 hypertension may achieve their BP target with monotherapy, but this is unlikely in those with initial SBP > 150 mmHg who would require a BP reduction of > 20 mmHg; however, in patients with high–normal BP and a high CV risk or in frail older patients, treatment initiation with monotherapy may be appropriate because only a small BP reduction may be required to achieve the BP target.

Uptitration of treatment to three-drug combination therapy — two-drug combination therapy will control blood pressure (BP) in approximately two-thirds of patients; for patients whose BP is not controlled by two-drug therapy, the logical option is escalation to three-drug therapy, usually a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic. Studies suggest that a three-drug combination should control BP in ≥ 80% of patients. The guideline states, We do not recommend three-drug combinations as initial therapy.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Initial combination therapy for rapid and effective control of moderate and severe hypertension [^113xQWJy]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Moderate (grade 2) and severe (grade 3) hypertension are important public health problems associated with high cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure (BP) control becomes more difficult to achieve as hypertension progresses. Therefore, early and effective treatment is essential to prevent hypertensive urgencies and emergencies and reduce cardiovascular risk. Currently, less than 50% of patients being treated for moderate or severe hypertension in the United States achieve their BP goal as recommended by treatment guidelines. This review examines the cardiovascular risk and physician inertia associated with moderate and severe hypertension, and concludes that increased use of initial combination therapy can overcome many of the barriers to effective BP control. Furthermore, initial combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor and diuretic has the potential to rapidly and effectively reduce BP across a range of baseline BPs, with a comparable adverse event profile to monotherapy.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^115uF4Ru]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine and valsartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

Amlodipine and valsartan may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on either monotherapy.

Amlodipine and valsartan may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

The choice of amlodipine and valsartan as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the lowest dose of amlodipine and valsartan.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111xhpHY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guideline — single-pill combination treatment strategy to improve blood pressure control states the preferred use of two-drug combination therapy for the initial treatment of most people with hypertension, a single-pill treatment strategy for hypertension with the preferred use of single-pill combination (SPC) therapy for most patients, and simplified drug treatment algorithms with the preferred use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), combined with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, as the core treatment strategy for most patients, with beta-blockers used for specific indications.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### First-line treatment for hypertension… [^114uHcvd]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

1 ACE inhibitors and CCBs reduced mortality and morbidity as much as thiazide diuretics, but the evidence is less robust. Because the use of thiazide diuretics is supported by a strong body of evidence and no other class of antihypertensive medications has been shown to be better at improving outcomes, they are the first-line drugs for most patients with hypertension. Current evidence does not support using beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension. Cochrane Abstract Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug is the best first-line option. This review answers that question.

Objectives: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Practice Pointers The choice of hypertension medication should be informed by evidence about its effectiveness in reducing adverse health outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality. In this Cochrane review, the authors quantified the effectiveness of four classes of antihypertensive medications versus placebo in reducing mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, and cardiovascular events.

1 In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, neither amlodipine nor lisinopril were found to be superior to chlorthalidone in reducing the rate of developing end-stage renal disease. 3 Subsequent analyses of the ALLHAT and other clinical trials have confirmed that alpha blockers, ACE inhibitors, and CCBs were no better than thiazide diuretics as initial therapy for the reduction of cardiovascular or renal risk.
4. 1 However, there is no evidence supporting the use of beta blockers over other antihypertensives. 1, 2. The strongest body of evidence indicates that for most patients with hypertension, thiazide diuretics are the best proven first-line treatment in reducing morbidity and mortality. They are particularly effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in all patients with hypertension, and in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — For adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate a three-drug combination, usually a renin-angiotensin system blocker, a CCB, and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, if BP is not controlled with the initial two-drug combination with the maximum recommended and tolerated dose of the respective components.

### Trends in initial antihypertensive medication prescribing among > 2.8 Million veterans newly diagnosed with hypertension, 2000 to 2019 [^1123xKgr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This analysis of > 2.8 million Veterans with high BP initiating antihypertensive treatment across 20 years has several important findings. First, initiation of antihypertensive monotherapy remained high in all systolic BP subgroups and increased over time, even among those with systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg (64.2%). Although most Veterans initiating treatment did not have a compelling indication for a BB (89.0%), BB was initiated in ≈20% of this group, especially with monotherapy, signaling potentially inappropriate use of BB as first‐line antihypertensive treatment even in recent years. Finally, when dual antihypertensive therapy was initiated, the use of evidence‐based first‐line classes increased, particularly ARBs, and combinations with potassium‐sparing diuretics (primarily used to correct electrolytes rather than for BP‐lowering) decreased.

The high and increasing initiation of monotherapy observed in this study and others, may be due to several factors. The reliance upon the initial stepped care "start low, go slow" treatment strategy may induce inappropriate inertial monotherapy. In this approach, 1 antihypertensive medication class is initiated, and its dose is slowly maximized, repeating as needed until BP control is achieved. Theoretically, this strategy minimizes the risk of adverse events from using multiple medications and reduces pill burden. However, in contemporary clinical practice, where the average time between office visits is 14 weeks, stepped care may not be equitable for patients who may not be willing or able to follow through with the increased level of monitoring required by stepped care to control BP. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines encourage initial combination therapy for most but state that stepped care may be reasonable depending on the patient's systolic BP, age, or history of hypotension or drug‐induced adverse effects, highlighting a lack of comparative effectiveness evidence. All versions of the VA/DoD guidelines have encouraged initial combination therapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension or if systolic/diastolic BP is ≥ 20/10 mm Hg from goal, also noting that for initial treatment, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of other medications. The findings from the current analysis suggest that, even in integrated health systems, targeted interventions are needed to improve the uptake of initial multi‐drug regimens for hypertension, particularly for patients with high pretreatment systolic BP.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects an estimated 120 million individuals in the United States and is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. Nearly all of these individuals ultimately require antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure control, and as a consequence, several antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Consensus US and international guidelines have long recommended certain antihypertensive classes as "first‐line" therapies — namely, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and, until relatively recently, β‐blockers. However, for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, guidelines generally do not prioritize any of these classes except in select circumstances, leaving prescribers to choose from some 30 to 40 antihypertensive drugs when initiating antihypertensive therapy.

Real‐world antihypertensive utilization patterns have been studied extensively, but in almost all cases, the focus of these studies has been on treatment patterns in prevalent hypertension cohorts. These studies provide useful insight into overall antihypertensive use in populations. However, they rarely have distinguished between patients who are early in their treatment course from those with long‐standing hypertension and who may have extensive treatment histories and multidrug regimens that have evolved over time. Thus, very little is known about contemporary patterns of early antihypertensive care, including initial antihypertensive regimens and to what extent these accord with care typically recommended in consensus guidelines. These gaps are noteworthy in light of the fact that only ≈1 in 5 US patients with hypertension have blood pressure controlled to < 130/80 mm Hg. Thus, delays in achieving blood pressure control are exceedingly common in routine practice and extend high‐risk periods, leading to worse outcomes. A greater understanding of how antihypertensive regimens emerge and evolve early in therapy may aid in identifying quality care gaps for which interventions can be achieved.

To address this gap, we used the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium (hereafter, OneFlorida+) to characterize initial treatment regimens among a diverse cohort of new users of antihypertensive therapy. We were principally interested in the distribution of classes, specific antihypertensive drugs within classes, how these distributions differed in prespecified demographic and clinical groups, and their trends over time.

### Initial antihypertensive regimens in newly treated patients: real world evidence from the oneFlorida + clinical research network [^1176NXSr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large, population‐based study, we characterized antihypertensive regimens among patients with newly treated hypertension. We focused our cohort among Medicare and Medicaid recipients who initiated ≥ 1 first‐line antihypertensive classes (including β‐blockers, considered first‐line therapy during a portion of our study years), to better understand treatment initiation patterns and to complement existing literature that provide data on prevalent hypertension cohorts. Our principal findings are that initiation of monotherapy remains remarkably common, and significant variation exists in initial antihypertensive regimens, with ≤ 41% of patients prescribed any single class in either study population. Within classes, there exists very little variation in choice of initial antihypertensive drug, especially among current first‐line therapies (ACEI, ARB, CCBs, and thiazides), in which a single drug predominates in ≥ 70% of cases. Time trends in antihypertensive initiation have remained fairly stable, although ACEI and β‐blocker use (among Medicaid recipients) has decreased significantly, replaced by increased dihydropyridine CCB and ARB use between 2013 and 2021. Finally, we observed notable differences in antihypertensive initiation in stratified analyses across demographic and clinical characteristics. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest and most detailed characterizations of real‐world utilization of antihypertensives in newly treated patients.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy can be recommended for patients with BP > 150/95 mm Hg.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### Initial antihypertensive regimens in newly treated patients: real world evidence from the oneFlorida + clinical research network [^111ECKM4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limited data have been published regarding initial use of antihypertensive classes. A recent study examined time trends in first‐line antihypertensives between 2008 and 2017 in Medicare recipients, primarily focused on patients initiating monotherapy. In that population, thiazide initiation decreased and CCB initiation increased, similar to our findings. In contrast, they found reduced initiation of β‐blockers over time, whereas we observed stable β‐blocker initiation, though β‐blockers remain one of the most commonly initiated antihypertensives through 2017 in both studies. Finally, they observed increased use of ACEIs and ARBs, particularly among individuals without any comorbidities. It remains unclear to what extent this finding was driven by increased ACEI initiation, ARB initiation, or both. Among both our Medicare and Medicaid populations, we found consistent decreases in ACEI initiation over time, whereas ARB initiation increased in both cohorts. Thus, it is possible that these findings are consistent. On the other hand, our data suggest that comparatively few patients initiate ARBs compared with ACEIs, even in the most recent years. Few other studies have explicitly characterized antihypertensive new user regimens; however, some additional insights may be gleaned from "real‐world" comparative effectiveness studies enrolling only new antihypertensive users. For example, the LEGEND‐HTN (Large scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases for hypertension) study included only new antihypertensive users of first‐line antihypertensives from multiple claims and EHR‐based cohorts and found, similar to our study, that ACEIs were the most common antihypertensive initiated across multiple claims and EHR‐based cohorts, followed by dihydropyridine CCBs, thiazides, ARBs, and nondihydropyridine CCBs (β‐blockers were not studied).

### Amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil [^114EkmR4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension are at relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient's risk.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Comparative analysis of first-line antihypertensive treatment classes [^1122MqMj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The best first-line monotherapy for hypertension remains uncertain, as current guidelines suggest that thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are appropriate in the absence of specific comorbidities. We aimed to compare the outcomes of first-line antihypertensive classes in a real-life setting with a long follow-up period.

Methods

This nationwide retrospective new-user cohort study included patients insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We included patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension between 2008 and 2021 who initiated treatment with a single first-line drug for hypertension. Outcomes were assessed with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, or heart failure (HF).

Results

A total of 97,639 patients initiated antihypertensive treatment with a single drug as first-line therapy. The most commonly prescribed class was ACEis/ARBs (66,717, 68.3%), followed by CCBs (15,922, 16.3%), beta-blockers (BBs, 12,869, 13.2%), and thiazides (2,131, 2.2%). For the primary outcome, the hazard ratios (HRs) for BBs, CCBs, and ACEis/ARBs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.25–1.66), 1.10 (95% CI 0.96–1.27), and 1.13 (95% CI 0.99–1.29), respectively, when compared to thiazides.

Conclusion

When initiating pharmacotherapy for hypertension with a single drug, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers were associated with similar risk of MI, ACS, stroke, or HF when compared to thiazides, while beta-blockers were associated with increased risk.

Conclusion

Initial choice of antihypertensive agent differentially effects immediate DBP reduction, but not SBP reduction, in patients presenting with acute ICH, with nicardipine appearing to be more efficacious than labetalol. While this study cannot advise on longer-term effects of initial antihypertensive choice after ICH, future prospective, real-word evidence trials would be required, if warranted, to optimise patient-specific initial BP therapy.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### The place of diuretics in preventing cardiovascular events [^115xgoAp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Low-dose diuretics are recommended for the initial choice of antihypertensive therapy in the 7th US Joint National Committee report and are accepted as an appropriate choice among other classes of drugs in the 2003 European Society of Hypertension guidelines. The rationales for the use of low-dose diuretics include the following: Renal dysfunction interfering with normal natriuresis is likely a fundamental defect in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Subtle renal insufficiency that interferes with sodium excretion is a common consequence of uncontrolled hypertension. Diuretic-based therapy has been clearly documented in placebo-controlled, randomized trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly in the treatment of elderly hypertensives. In multiple comparative trials, diuretic-based therapy has been shown to provide equal cardiovascular protection to that provided by newer agents. Diuretics enhance the antihypertensive efficacy of all other classes of agents. As lower blood pressure goals of therapy have been found to be needed, diuretic enhancement of other agents' efficacy has become even more essential. With such low doses, side effects are minimal in degree and infrequent in appearance.

### Individualization of antihypertensive drug treatment [^113gBMkP]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drug classes are usually classified as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th or 5th choice to help physicians select the drug most suitable for treatment initiation among the very many classes available to lower blood pressure (BP) in patients with a BP elevation. However, this approach was appropriate decades ago when several drugs had inconveniences that made their use in monotherapy inadvisable. An example was the then widely used vasodilator hydralazine whose sodium-retaining and tachycardic effects made its administration recommendable only with a diuretic or a β-blocker, with, thus, a classification as a 2nd- or 3rd-choice drug. This is no longer the case because several current antihypertensive drug classes are characterized by a similar BP-lowering effect, a good tolerability profile, and evidence of cardiovascular protection in prospective randomized trials. As recently argued in a document of the European Society of Hypertension, this implies that rather than classifying drugs as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and further choice, it might be more appropriate to help physicians select the drug (or drug combination) that might be preferred for treatment initiation in a given patient or a given clinical condition. This article will discuss the factors that may help physicians move toward this more individualized treatment approach.

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^115jzTRA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

The commentary adds that medication selection "should consider all aspects of the patient, including their comorbid conditions, age, and lifestyle factors", and highlights that with "severely elevated urinary albumin excretion, an ACE inhibitor or an ARB would be first-line therapy".

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. When better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control is achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment, fewer cardiovascular events occur during this time interval. – Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is a key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with 2 different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy (TI) during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension that was uncontrolled led to more prompt and better BP control over time than when TI did not occur in the first month. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the decision to initiate treatment during the first month following diagnosis of hypertension than later time points.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline — lower PREVENT risk (< 7.5%) without clinical CVD (DBP pathway). In adults without clinical CVD and at lower 10-year predicted CVD risk based on PREVENT (< 7.5%), there are limited data about the net benefit of initiation of antihypertensive therapy at a lower threshold with an average DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg; therefore, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged first to lower BP. However, lifestyle interventions may not be successful at lowering DBP, and even when successful initially, it can be difficult to sustain optimal DBP levels; therefore, if average DBP is ≥ 80 mm Hg, initiation of antihypertensive therapy is advised as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

Initiation of pharmacologic BP treatment in the context of overall CVD risk — synopsis: Evidence from meta-analyses of clinical trial data, large observational studies, and simulation models has consistently shown the benefits of antihypertensive therapy initiation can be maximized by prioritizing those at highest cardiovascular risk with the use of absolute risk estimation. Across a wide range of BP thresholds and predicted CVD risk, a risk-based strategy for targeting antihypertensive therapy in primary prevention patients is more effective than a BP-alone based strategy in terms of events avoided and numbers-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 CVD event. The benefit and efficiency of antihypertensive therapy initiation is greater using a risk-based strategy rather than a BP level-only strategy in simulation models.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Trends in initial antihypertensive medication prescribing among > 2.8 Million veterans newly diagnosed with hypertension, 2000 to 2019 [^111fdJHG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

A strength of the current analysis is the use of robust clinical and medication use data from the largest integrated health care delivery system in the United States, allowing capture of high‐quality medication‐dispensing data, vital and laboratory data at the time of prescribing, and prevalent comorbidities. The data span 20 years, allowing us to observe secular trends indistinguishable in shorter‐term data sets. An important limitation is that the VHA data do not generalize well to the national population of patients receiving treatment for hypertension, and our findings may differ in other data sets with a larger proportion of women, non‐White races, Hispanic ethnicity, or different distribution of comorbidities. Although we used high‐quality medication fill data and restricted our analyses to Veterans with a diagnosis of high BP, it is still possible that a small proportion of Veterans used antihypertensive medications to treat other medical conditions (eg, α‐1 blockers for posttraumatic stress disorder or benign prostatic hyperplasia). Veterans who initiated treatment while hospitalized would also be included as incident users in our cohort upon the first outpatient fill of their discharge regimen. Together, these limitations may explain some of our results; for example, the > 48 000 Veterans ≥ 75 years old in our cohort who initiated ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications could be highly comorbid or recently discharged from the hospital. Additionally, due to the size of the data set, we could not determine clinical appropriateness of each regimen for each patient. Owing to the complexity of the data, we also did not evaluate medication dose, which may be informative for future studies to optimize initial treatment. The use of medications is influenced by the VHA national formulary, which changed over the study period due to cost or generic availability. Our medication variables are based on dispensing data within the VHA system or as noted in Medicare‐linked data, and we were unable to capture data for Veterans who received prescriptions outside of these systems. As such, these findings may not be generalizable to the entire Veteran population. Our findings rely on the underlying accuracy of the available data, and results may differ according to variability in coding practices or if including patients who may not have met our inclusion criteria.

### Newer renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker combinations: is there an advantage? [^1178Mdxh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The necessity for new and more effective management approaches to achieve blood pressure goals is still present in spite of the number of antihypertensive medications available. One of the cornerstones of successful therapy is implementation of drug combinations that act on complementary biological pathways. This review article focuses on the evaluation of recent data supporting newer combinations involving inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with other drug classes such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics.

Recent Findings

New angiotensin receptor blockers as well as renin inhibitors, with a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect than their predecessors, have emerged recently. The data presented in this text also strongly supports a combination therapy approach as initial therapy to achieve blood pressure goals in a timely fashion. Additionally, the blood pressure-lowering effect is more robust with lower-dose, single-pill combinations than with highest doses of single agents alone. Therefore, using combination agents is less prone to side effects. The challenges for such single-pill combinations remain affordability. For this reason, payers and patients have traditionally not preferred such agents in spite of better blood pressure control and adherence rates.

Summary

The new combinations of renin inhibitors and the new angiotensin receptor blocker combinations add to the armamentarium of agents to control blood pressure. Whereas the new angiotensin receptor blocker offers greater efficacy on blood pressure control over other agents in the class and the availability of the only chlorthalidone combination, no outcome data exist yet with any of the new agents.

Initial antihypertensive therapy — evidence, preferences, and cost considerations are described: The Work Group determined that the benefits of the reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes outweighed the harms, and although the four main drug classes for initial therapy were supported by the evidence base, there is variation in personal choices and patient-to-patient tolerability of adverse events. An important implication in terms of resource use is cost, with drug copayments for VA and TRICARE beneficiaries varying by dispensing venue and generic versus branded formulation, and cost may be less of an issue for active duty personnel. The Work Group agreed on a "Strong for" recommendation due to the robust and extensive body of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and systematic reviews (SRs) supporting use of the four main antihypertensive drug classes, but the confidence in the quality of evidence was moderate because outcomes were adjusted so that blood pressure reductions in each drug class were similar, and the conclusion that drugs from the same classes have the same blood pressure lowering effect may or may not be true. Overall, the consensus of the Work Group was that the four antihypertensive drug classes produced similar effects on reducing composite cardiovascular events.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Trends in initial antihypertensive medication prescribing among > 2.8 Million veterans newly diagnosed with hypertension, 2000 to 2019 [^114c4RKJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

This study observed findings both counter to, and concordant with, guideline‐directed optimal care. The current study and others, demonstrate that many patients are prescribed BBs for first‐line treatment, even among those without compelling indications for a BB. The 2014 Eighth National Joint Committee Panel Member Reportand the 2014 VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline recommended first‐line BB use only among those with compelling indications due to evidence indicating that BBs are inferior to ACEI, ARB, CCB, and thiazides in protecting against stroke and all‐cause mortality, especially for patients ≥ 60 years old. The current analysis revealed a small decline in BB initiation from 22% to 19%. In this population, we further observed a decline in the use of atenolol, which has a short half‐life and may be responsible for its observed inferior BP‐lowering compared with other BBs or other antihypertensive classes (eg, thiazides). Additionally, use of ARBs alone or in combination increased over time overall and in subgroups, reflecting guideline recommendations for first‐line ARB use in addition to generic availability during the study period (losartan first went generic in 2010, followed by valsartan in 2012). Finally, thiazide or CCB monotherapy was highest among Veterans of Non‐Hispanic Black race and ethnicity in the current analysis, concordant with guideline recommendations and evidence that these classes may provide superior BP‐lowering and cardiovascular disease risk reduction for this population. Due to the large sample size, even the small changes observed over time in this analysis would be rendered statistically significant, underscoring the clinical importance of such changes and the numbers of patients who may be affected.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112zkx4m]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — drug treatment strategy states that among all antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCBs, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are indicated as the basis of therapy because they have demonstrated effective reduction of BP and cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials. Combination treatment is recommended for most hypertensive patients as initial therapy, and preferred combinations should comprise a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic, though other combinations of the five major classes can be used. It is recommended that beta-blockers are combined with any of the other major drug classes when there are specific clinical situations such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control. It is recommended to initiate antihypertensive treatment with a two-drug combination, preferably in a single-pill combination (SPC), with exceptions for frail older patients and those at low risk and with grade 1 hypertension (particularly if SBP < 150 mmHg). It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a two-drug combination, treatment should be increased to a three-drug combination, usually a RAS blocker with a CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably as an SPC. It is recommended that if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination, treatment should be increased by the addition of spironolactone or, if not tolerated, other diuretics such as amiloride or higher doses of other diuretics, a beta-blocker, or an alpha-blocker. The combination of two RAS blockers is not recommended.

CONCLUSIONS

The current analysis highlights important areas for improving quality of initial treatment in the VHA: (1) increasing uptake of combination therapy if appropriate, especially among those presenting with high systolic BP; and (2) reducing inappropriate initial BB use overall among those without compelling indications to use a BB. Importantly, these prescribing gaps in the initial treatment phase persist despite the use of treatment protocols and clinical practice guidelines, warranting creative solutions to implement evidence‐based prescribing.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — adults initiating antihypertensive drug therapy are recommended first-line options from thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence "supports 4 classes of first-line agents", and a meta-analysis reported "50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals", while "all other antihypertensive agents are considered secondary" and "BBs were less effective than first-line antihypertensive classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications".

### Patient predictors of combination therapy as initial hypertension treatment: the AOURP (all of Us research program) registry [^112jqcKP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension control rates remain on the decline following years of improvement. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for first‐line hypertension treatment recommend 4 classes of medications: angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazide diuretics. However, > 70% of hypertensive individuals require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve blood pressure (BP) goals. There are numerous fixed‐dose combination treatment pills available, such as between an ACEi with a CCB (eg, Lotrel) or diuretics (eg, Zestoretic). Recent studies show greater reduction in BP with combination therapy versus monotherapy with no increase in adverse events and improved adherence. As recommended by clinical guidelines, this benefit is significant for those with higher systolic blood pressure (> 160/100 mm Hg), or 20 mm Hg over systolic blood pressure target, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. However, prescribing combination therapy as first‐line treatment remains uncommon. To our knowledge, no real‐world study has tried to determine common patient demographic and clinical factors that contribute to the initial prescription of combination therapy, which may uncover potential systemic barriers. Here, we used electronic health records and survey data from the nationally sourced AOURP (All of Us Research Program) registry to explore patient characteristics associated with combination versus monotherapy as first‐line treatment for hypertension.

### Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^114oRtan]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Add-On Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy.

Replacement Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the titrated components.

Initial Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.

The choice of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^115ZRxpK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of dual therapy, either with 2 different subclasses of antihypertensive agents, given as separate medications, or as an FDC medication for patients with stage 2 hypertension (JNC 8 report defines as ≥ 160/100 mm Hg; 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines define as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) or whose baseline BP was > 20/10 mm Hg above the BP target. However, our analysis revealed a declining trend in the use of FDC, which is not consistent with the guidelines. FDC have been advocated as a beneficial choice for BP treatment, as they can reduce the pill burden, enhance patient uptake and adherence, achieve adequate BP control, and lower rates of adverse events. However, contrary to the recommendation, and in accordance with our findings, FDC use has consistently declined over time in our study, NHANES, Medicare, and national prescription sales data from 2009 to 2014. The low uptake of FDC may be due to limited options for combinations of subclasses in FDC compared with individual medications and a restricted ability to flexibly titrate medications. Cost is unlikely to be a major factor, as 90% of FDC medications are available in generic form. Since 2017, other guidelines such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertensionand the World Health Organization 2021 guideline on the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adultshave also emphasized the use of combination therapy, preferably with FDC, as an initial treatment for those requiring pharmacological treatment. Although FDCs continue to have a role in hypertension management, clinical guidelines could promote specific FDCs that should be used as first‐line therapy, with clear guidance on how to best combine antihypertensive subclasses to promote necessary polytherapy and more aggressive BP management. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for this decline and its implications for patient outcomes.

### Association of race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated among Medicare beneficiaries with the eighth Joint National Committee panel member report [^112FZ2Lx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC8) published a report with evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients initiating antihypertensive medication. Both the JNC8 panel member report and the previous seventh (JNC7) guideline recommended thiazide-type diuretics as first-line therapy, regardless of race/ethnicity, among patients without compelling indications for specific classes of antihypertensive medication. However, the JNC8 panel member report differed from the JNC7 guideline by including race/ethnicity-specific recommendations for additional initial medications, either alone or as components of combination therapy. For non-Black adults, the JNC8 panel member report recommended thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Black adults were recommended thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs. The panel did not recommend β-blockers as first-line therapy in the absence of either coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The race/ethnicity-specific treatment recommendations in the JNC8 panel member report were based on randomized trial data showing that Black adults have smaller blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk decreases than White adults when treated with an ACEI. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that the risks of stroke, heart failure, and CVD were higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a thiazide-type diuretic, and the risk of stroke was higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a CCB. No differences were present for White participants. β-Blockers were not recommended for first-line therapy because there is evidence of increased CVD risk with β-blockers compared with ARBs.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changes in the initial antihypertensive medication regimens filled between 2011 and 2018 among older US adults who were Black, White, or of other race/ethnicity. In addition, we evaluated changes in the initial classes of antihypertensive medication filled before vs after December 18, 2013, the date the JNC8 panel member report was published.

In such situations, "the BP should be reduced by no more than 25% of the planned reduction over the first 8 hours, with the remainder of the planned reduction over the next 12 to 24 hours", and "The ultimate short-term BP goal in such patients should generally be around the 95th percentile". Key Action Statement 27 states: "In children and adolescents with acute severe HTN and life-threatening symptoms, immediate treatment with short-acting antihypertensive medication should be initiated, and BP should be reduced by no more than 25% of the planned reduction over the first 8 hours (grade expert opinion D, weak recommendation)".

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^112NPu8q]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Telmisartan and amlodipine tablets may also be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.

Base the choice of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets as initial therapy for hypertension on an assessment of potential benefits and risks including whether the patient is likely to tolerate the starting dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets.

Patients with moderate or severe hypertension are at relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. Consider the patient's baseline blood pressure, the target goal, and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared with monotherapy when deciding whether to use telmisartan and amlodipine tablets as initial therapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient's risk.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^111bTQCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

### What should be the target blood pressure for this older patient with hypertension? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115HjVeL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is prevalent and the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Controversy exists regarding the optimum threshold above which to begin antihypertensive therapy and the optimum target blood pressure once medication is begun. This controversy is particularly true for older patients, who may be more likely to benefit from treatment because of their higher risk for cardiovascular events, but may also be more at risk for adverse effects of treatment. Two guidelines published in 2017 address this issue. The American College of Physicians/American Academy of Family Physicians guideline recommends initiating antihypertensive therapy for older patients (aged 60 years or older) if systolic blood pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher and to treat to the same target. They recommend a lower threshold for starting treatment and a lower target systolic blood pressure (140 mm Hg) for patients with cerebrovascular disease and potentially those at high risk for cardiovascular events. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, which is based primarily on SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), advises a target systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg for community-dwelling ambulatory patients aged 65 years or older. This article presents the case of a 79-year-old man who is contemplating antihypertensive therapy. Two experts discuss the optimal approach for the patient and suggest how to apply the 2 guidelines to his care.

Clinical Perspective

Since 2000, hypertension management has significantly changed due to the publication of landmark trials, changes in clinical guideline recommendations, and increased generic availability of first‐line antihypertensive medications. Consequently, clinical practice guidelines also evolved, and in some instances have even conflicted with one another on the blood pressure (BP) threshold to initiate treatment, the preferred classes of medications for first‐line therapy, the goal BP level to target, and the specific patient groups necessitating tailored treatment approaches.

The 2014 Eighth National Joint Committee Panel Member Report and the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommended initiating ≥ 2 medications among those with stage 2 hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg in the ACC/AHA guidelines) or when the systolic BP is ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP is ≥ 10 mm Hg above goal. The Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) BP clinical practice guidelines in 2004 and 2014 also recommended initiating combination therapy if systolic/diastolic BP was ≥ 20/10 mm Hg above goal and stated an overall preference for initiating a thiazide/thiazide‐like diuretic (hereafter, "thiazide"). The updated 2020 VA/DoD guidelines recommended that a thiazide, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin‐II receptor blocker (ARB), or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) could be used first‐line. Nonetheless, discrepancies between US guideline‐recommended practices and real‐world medication use patterns persist, including the use of monotherapy among patients with stage 2 hypertension and use of β‐blockers (BBs) as first‐line among patients without compelling indications.

As the largest integrated US health care delivery system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) allocates significant resources to controlling high BP, including multilevel programs incorporating BP control metrics, dashboards, home BP monitoring, treatment algorithms, and team‐based care. To identify target areas for system‐level improvement, we sought to investigate trends in initial hypertension treatment patterns in the VHA over 20 years.

Conclusion

Recent trends suggest to target treatment when BP is greater than 140/90. When achieved without undue treatment burden, BP targets of less than 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, like the young, with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic CV disease risk factors. Tighter targets of less than 140/90 mmHg in patients 70–80 years old and of less than 150/90 in the elderly (more than 80 years old) seem appropriate. Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100.

ACEI/ARBs are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are probably appropriate as second-line agents. Newer antidiabetes medications such as SGLT2i have antihypertensive properties and may help in treatment decision-making and choices. Once the BP target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued in order to promote CV risk reduction. Future trials are needed to determine the appropriate BP targets for patients with diabetes.

### Hypertension Canada's 2020 comprehensive guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of hypertension in adults and children [^111EZEWp]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to add additional antihypertensive drugs if target BP levels are not achieved with standard-dose monotherapy.
Choose add-on drugs from first-line choices, such as thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs with either ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers.
Be cautious when combining a nondihydropyridine CCB and a β-blocker.
Do not combine an ACEi and an ARB.
