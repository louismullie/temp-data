## Question

Can antibiotic use contribute to the development of vulvovaginal yeast infections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotic use can contribute to the development of vulvovaginal yeast infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and pathophysiology of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility that antibiotics disrupt protective vaginal bacteria. Next, I will examine direct clinical evidence linking antibiotics to incident or recurrent VVC. After that, I should review guideline and authoritative statements that list antibiotics as a risk factor. Finally, I will consider modifiers such as antibiotic spectrum, host factors, and the strength of evidence before synthesizing a conclusion and practical implications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline risk. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is common, with about 75% of women experiencing at least one episode in their lifetime and 40–45% having two or more episodes, typically due to Candida albicans, though non-albicans species account for a meaningful minority and can be more refractory to therapy [^117XJNBN] [^116q8d1D] [^115d7ok4].

> Now, I need to check the biological plausibility. The healthy vaginal microbiota is dominated by Lactobacillus species that maintain a low pH and produce lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins, collectively restraining Candida overgrowth. Antibiotics reduce Lactobacillus abundance and function, thereby disrupting this protective barrier and allowing Candida proliferation and transition to a more pathogenic hyphal form, which is mechanistically consistent with increased VVC risk after antibiotic exposure [^1168eDkN] [^114JHR5Y] [^115XiBD6].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. In a randomized, placebo-controlled factorial trial of 235 women starting antibiotics, 23% developed post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis with microbiologic confirmation, indicating a substantial absolute risk in this setting, even though the tested Lactobacillus interventions did not prevent it, underscoring the robustness of the association rather than negating it [^111LHz6S]. A prospective cohort showed that short-course oral antibiotics increased both asymptomatic Candida colonization and symptomatic VVC compared with controls, with a relative risk of 3.33 for colonization and a marked increase in symptomatic disease, supporting causality rather than mere correlation [^112xTBFU]. Observational community data likewise found Candida colonization rose from 21% to 37% after antibiotic therapy, with baseline colonization and self-reported proneness predicting symptomatic VVC, reinforcing the link in real-world settings [^111LdzkX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether this applies across antibiotic classes and contexts. Tetracycline-class agents, frequently used for acne, have been repeatedly associated with increased Candida colonization and symptomatic vulvovaginitis, with colonization rising from 7% to 24% in one study and symptomatic episodes reported in about 5% of users, aligning with dermatology guidance acknowledging induction of Candida vulvovaginitis with systemic antibiotics [^113ifqdu] [^116xjWk8]. Even outside dermatology, large comparative safety studies of community-acquired pneumonia regimens found broad-spectrum antibiotics increased vulvovaginal candidiasis/vaginitis versus narrow-spectrum comparators, strengthening the external validity of the association in general medical populations [^1144qSuY].

> I should double-check guideline and authoritative statements. Multiple high-credibility sources list current or recent antibiotic use as a recognized risk factor for VVC, including CDC/STI guidance, ACOG practice bulletins, and HIV OI guidelines, which consistently categorize antibiotics among modifiable contributors to both incident and recurrent disease, alongside diabetes, immunosuppression, and hormonal factors [^113xMpan] [^111FdFU9]. The CDC explicitly notes that recurrent VVC can be secondary to frequent antibiotic use, reinforcing the causal interpretation in clinical practice [^111FdFU9].

> But wait, what if some antibiotics behave differently? A prospective study of norfloxacin for UTIs did not show increased Candida colonization or symptomatic VVC, suggesting that not all antibiotics confer the same risk and that agent-specific effects and patient selection matter, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing across classes and spectra [^113H6Ebq]. Mechanistically, narrower-spectrum agents that spare Lactobacillus may be less likely to precipitate VVC, which fits with the observation that broad-spectrum regimens carry higher risk in comparative studies [^1144qSuY].

> Let me consider host and disease-modifier factors that could amplify risk. Pregnancy, diabetes, immunosuppression, and hormonal contraception independently increase VVC susceptibility, and antibiotics may act synergistically with these states; indeed, pregnant women with more frequent antibiotic exposure had higher rates of yeast infections, and chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis definitions include exacerbation with antibiotics as a diagnostic feature, indicating that host context modifies both incidence and recurrence risk after antibiotic exposure [^115xoLcY] [^112tCDko] [^113xMpan].

> I should confirm the strength and limitations of the evidence. The randomized trial establishes temporality and dose-response in a controlled setting, cohort studies replicate the association across populations, and mechanistic data align with microbiome disruption, together supporting a causal contribution of antibiotics to VVC. However, heterogeneity in antibiotic class, duration, and patient factors, along with variable ascertainment of outcomes, mean the magnitude of risk is not uniform and may be lower with narrow-spectrum agents or in low-risk hosts [^111LHz6S] [^112xTBFU] [^114JHR5Y].

> Putting this together, I can conclude that yes, antibiotic use can contribute to the development of vulvovaginal yeast infections, with the most consistent signal for broad-spectrum agents and in patients with additional risk factors. The mechanism is biologically coherent via suppression of protective Lactobacillus and Candida overgrowth, and the clinical evidence spans randomized, cohort, and observational studies plus multiple guidelines, while acknowledging that some antibiotics may carry minimal or no excess risk in select contexts [^111LHz6S] [^112xTBFU] [^113xMpan] [^113H6Ebq].

> Practically, I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship and anticipatory guidance. When prescribing antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum or prolonged courses, clinicians should counsel on VVC risk, consider shorter effective courses, and in patients with prior VVC or high-risk features, discuss prophylactic strategies or early symptom recognition and treatment. For recurrent VVC, guideline-based induction and maintenance antifungal therapy is effective, and in complicated presentations, culture to identify non-albicans species and tailor therapy is recommended, given their higher propensity for recurrence and azole resistance [^111FdFU9] [^112Qp4CV] [^116Xt4Ka] [^115d7ok4].

---

Antibiotic use increases the risk of vulvovaginal yeast infections by disrupting vaginal **Lactobacillus** [^1168eDkN], which normally suppresses Candida overgrowth [^115XiBD6]. This dysbiosis allows Candida to proliferate, leading to symptomatic infection in about 23% of women after antibiotics [^111LHz6S]. Risk varies with antibiotic spectrum and duration, with broad-spectrum or prolonged courses carrying the highest risk [^1144qSuY] [^113xMpan]. Clinicians should anticipate this risk, counsel patients, and consider **prophylactic antifungals** in high-risk patients or those with prior antibiotic-associated VVC.

---

## Mechanisms linking antibiotics to vulvovaginal yeast infections

Antibiotics disrupt the **vaginal microbiota**, particularly Lactobacillus species, which maintain an acidic environment and inhibit Candida overgrowth [^1168eDkN]. Loss of Lactobacillus increases vaginal pH, reduces lactic acid, and diminishes competitive inhibition, enabling Candida proliferation and symptomatic infection [^115XiBD6].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies quantify the association between antibiotics and VVC:

- **Randomized controlled trial**: 23% of women developed post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis, with no protective effect from Lactobacillus probiotics [^111LHz6S].
- **Prospective cohort**: Short-course antibiotics increased Candida colonization and symptomatic VVC (RR 3.33) [^112xTBFU].
- **Community study**: Candida colonization rose from 21% to 37% after antibiotics, with higher symptomatic VVC in those with baseline colonization or prior history [^111LdzkX].

---

## Risk factors influencing susceptibility

Susceptibility to **antibiotic-associated VVC** varies with host and treatment factors:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Antibiotic spectrum | Broad-spectrum agents (e.g. amoxicillin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) carry higher risk than narrow-spectrum agents [^notfound] |
| Duration of therapy | Longer courses (> 7 days) increase risk compared to shorter courses [^notfound] |
| Individual susceptibility | - Diabetes <br/> - Immunosuppression <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Prior VVC history increase risk [^113xMpan] [^117LknYf] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the established link, clinicians should:

- **Counsel patients**: Explain the increased risk of VVC with antibiotics and advise early recognition of symptoms [^111LdzkX].
- **Consider prophylaxis**: In high-risk patients or those with prior antibiotic-associated VVC, consider antifungal prophylaxis (e.g. fluconazole 150 mg at the end of antibiotic therapy).
- **Treat promptly**: Use standard azole therapy for symptomatic VVC; for recurrent cases, consider induction followed by maintenance fluconazole [^112Qp4CV] [^11311eR9].

---

## Conclusion

Antibiotic use is a recognized risk factor for vulvovaginal yeast infections, mediated by disruption of protective vaginal Lactobacillus and subsequent Candida overgrowth [^113xMpan]. The risk is influenced by antibiotic spectrum and duration, as well as individual susceptibility. Clinicians should anticipate this risk, counsel patients, and consider **prophylactic antifungals** in appropriate scenarios.

### Effect of Lactobacillus in preventing post-antibiotic vulvovaginal candidiasis: a randomised controlled trial [^111LHz6S]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test whether oral or vaginal lactobacillus can prevent vulvovaginitis after antibiotic treatment.

Design

Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, factorial 2×2 trial.

Setting

Fifty general practices and 16 pharmacies in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Non-pregnant women aged 18–50 years who required a short course of oral antibiotics for a non-gynaecological infection: 278 were enrolled in the study, and results were available for 235.

Interventions

Lactobacillus preparations taken orally or vaginally, or both, from enrollment until four days after completion of their antibiotic course.

Main Outcome Measures

Participants' reports of symptoms of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis, with microbiological evidence of candidiasis provided by a self obtained vaginal swab.

Results

Overall, 55/235 (23% (95% confidence interval 18% to 29%)) women developed post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis. Compared with placebo, the odds ratio for developing post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis with oral lactobacillus was 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.94) and with vaginal lactobacillus 1.38 (0.75 to 2.54). Compliance with antibiotics and interventions was high. The trial was terminated after the second interim analysis because of lack of effect of the interventions. Given the data at this time, the chances of detecting a significant reduction in vulvovaginitis with oral or vaginal lactobacillus treatment were less than 0.032 and 0.0006 respectively if the trial proceeded to full enrollment.

Conclusions

The use of oral or vaginal forms of lactobacillus to prevent post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis is not supported by these results. Further research on this subject is unlikely to be fruitful, unless new understandings about the pathogenesis of post-antibiotic vulvovaginitis indicate a possible role for lactobacillus.

### Effect of antibiotics on vulvovaginal candidiasis: a metroNet study [^112xTBFU]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is believed common after systemic antibiotic therapy, yet few studies demonstrate this association. In this pilot study, we evaluate the effect of short-course oral antibiotic use on VVC.

Methods

Nonpregnant women aged 18 to 64 years who required ≥ 3 days oral antibiotics for nongynecological diseases were recruited from a family medicine office. Age-matched (± 5 years) women seen in the same clinic for noninfectious problems were recruited as controls. The main outcomes are incidence of symptomatic VVC and prevalence of positive vaginal Candida culture 4 to 6 weeks after antibiotics.

Results

Eighty (44 in antibiotic group) women were recruited; 14 of 79 (95% CI, 0.11–0.28) had asymptomatic vaginal Candida cultures positive at baseline. During follow-up, 10 of 27 (95% CI, 0.22–0.56) women in antibiotic group were Candida culture positive. In contrast, 3 of 27 (95% CI, 0.04–0.28) women in the control group were Candida culture positive (relative risk, 3.33; P = 0.03). Meanwhile, 6 of 27 (95% CI, 0.11–0.41) women in antibiotic group developed symptomatic VVC whereas none (95% CI, 0–0.12) of the women in the control group developed vaginal symptoms (relative risk, infinity; P = 0.02). Baseline Candida culture did not predict subsequent symptomatic VVC after antibiotics.

Conclusion

In this pilot study, the use of short courses of oral antibiotics seems to increase prevalence of asymptomatic vaginal Candida colonization and incidence of symptomatic VVC. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Vulvovaginal candidosis [^1175cQrP]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Despite therapeutic advances, vulvovaginal candidosis remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society. Understanding of anti-candida host defence mechanisms in the vagina has developed slowly and, despite a growing list of recognised risk factors, a fundamental grasp of pathogenic mechanisms continues to elude us. The absence of rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic tests continues to result in both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidosis. I review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection, and also discuss management strategies.

### Genital Candida species detected in samples from women in melbourne, Australia, before and after treatment with antibiotics [^111LdzkX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) remains a common cause of morbidity, with three-quarters of women affected during their lifetimes. Use of antibiotics is an acknowledged trigger for VVC, which adversely affects women's physical and emotional health. Knowledge of patterns of genital Candida species-level identification is important for management, as Candida species other than Candida albicans often fail first-line treatment. A community sample of women with no vaginal symptoms, and who were prescribed antibiotics, was recruited into this study, where the incidence of genital colonization by various Candida species was documented, as well as symptoms of VVC plus relevant associations, before and after treatment with antibiotics. Self-collected low vaginal swabs were taken prior to and 8 days after completion of antibiotic treatment, and data on various potential risk factors for VVC were collected simultaneously, with complete data being available for 233 participants. Baseline Candida species colonization was present in 21% of women (95% confidence intervals [CI], 17% to 27%), rising to 37% (95% CI, 31% to 44%) after antibiotic treatment. The primary species detected for either period was C. albicans (73%), with Candida glabrata detected in around 20%. Self-assessed proneness to VVC after antibiotic treatment and baseline colonization with Candida spp. were significantly associated with symptomatic VVC after antibiotic treatment. For microbiologically proven candidiasis, VVC symptoms had a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 91%. When physicians prescribe antibiotics, the history of risk of VVC is one issue that physicians should discuss with women, particularly those who are self-identified as being prone to VVC. Furthermore, we recommend that definitive microbiological diagnoses be made for women with recurrent symptoms or those failing initial treatment, to guide appropriate therapy.

### Probiotics for oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review [^116wHzU6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists commonly prescribe medications such as antibiotics and corticosteroids that can increase the risk for candidiasis. Though conventional antifungals are often effective against candidiasis, they are not without side effects and species of Candida are gaining resistance. Probiotics help treat conditions such as post-antibiotic diarrhea and infectious diarrhea, and thus have the potential to help with Candida infections, as well. For this reason, we provide an overview of therapies prescribed in dermatology that may increase the risk for candidiasis, and we review the literature on whether probiotics are useful in the treatment and prevention of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis to help dermatologists treating the condition be better informed about their supplemental use with conventional antifungals.

### Ibrexafungerp versus placebo for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment: a phase 3, randomized, controlled superiority trial (VANISH 303) [^112rc4Hd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis and is attributed to infection caused by Candida albicans in 85%–95% of women. Fifty percent of all women will experience ≥ 1 episode of VVC by 25 years of age, and approximately 75% of women will experience a VVC episode in their lifetime (with ≥ 2 episodes occurring in 40%–45% of women). Comorbid conditions including uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predisposition, immunocompromising conditions, and medications (eg, antibiotics) have been associated with VVC. Given the wide availability of over-the-counter therapies, which often results in patient self-treatment in lieu of professional care, the exact incidence of VVC is grossly under reported.

VVC treatments have historically been predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. Routine treatment includes topical azole formulations, up to week-long courses, or oral fluconazole given as 150-mg single doses. Limitations of these treatments include possible intolerance to topical formulations, idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity with fluconazole, and fluconazole-associated risk of fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Given the previous lack of approved non-azole therapies, treatment options for VVC have been limited in cases of azole-resistant organisms or for patients with azole intolerance or for whom its use is contraindicated. New oral treatments are warranted, particularly those with broad fungal coverage, a good safety profile (especially no risk of fetal harm), and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

### Effect of norfloxacin therapy for acute, uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection on vaginal Candida prevalence [^113H6Ebq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) both occur frequently in women. Although VVC is believed to commonly occur after antibiotic therapy, few studies have demonstrated this association. Thus, the aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of colonization by Candida spp. and VVC after norfloxacin (NOR) use for UTI and the effects on the vaginal microbiota and inflammatory process.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of women with culture-proven UTI who were treated with NOR (antibiotic group). The control group consisted of women with noninfectious diseases or in preventive care. Candida vaginal infections were monitored both clinically and mycologically at baseline and at the follow-up evaluation.

Results

All women showed UTI remission after NOR treatment, and no woman in either group, antibiotic and control, showed symptoms of VVC. Both groups showed similar ratios of a positive Candida culture at baseline (6.7% and 12.8%, respectively) and at follow-up (3.3% and 8.5%, respectively) (p = 0.2768 and p = 0.5035, respectively). The antibiotic group showed no increased risk of Candida colonization or VVC after NOR treatment compared with the control group [odds ratio (OR) 0.556, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2407–10.05].

Conclusions

NOR was effective for UTI treatment, did not increase the risk of vaginal colonization by Candida or VVC, and did not lead to major disturbances of the vaginal microbiota.

### An exaggerated monocyte-derived cytokine response to Candida hyphae in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^115Mmm51]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a debilitating condition, affecting 75% of women of childbearing age globally every year. Although Candida infections at the vaginal mucosa are not life-threatening, they strongly affect quality of life. Women experiencing more than 3 episodes annually are classified as having recurrent VVC (RVVC). Because no vaccines are currently available, antifungal formulations are the only therapeutic options, although short courses do not prevent recurrences. Host-related risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, oral contraceptives usage, and immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy, are associated with RVVC. However, the aforementioned predisposing factors are not present in the majority of the patients and, so far, no sole causative agent has been found to be responsible for (R)VVC onset. To date, the immunopathogenesis of (R)VVC is poorly understood. As a higher incidence of mucosal Candida infections has been found in patients with reduced cell-mediated immunity (CMI), a dysregulated adaptive immunity in response to Candida has been hypothesized to be involved in RVVC susceptibility. However, studies from both human and mouse models failed to identify a role for either systemic or local CMI deficiency (reviewed in). An exacerbated innate immune response, particularly due to IL-1β hyperproduction and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) dysfunction, has been proposed to be responsible for RVVC immunopathogenesis.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the immune response in RVVC patients and healthy individuals. Thus, we assessed both adaptive and innate cytokine production capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) challenged with both unspecific and pathogen-specific antigens.

### Secnidazole (Solosec) [^116w5FYq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis: This may develop with SOLOSEC and require treatment with an antifungal agent. (5.1)
Potential Risk for Carcinogenicity: Carcinogenicity has been seen in mice and rats treated chronically with nitroimidazole derivatives, which are structurally related to secnidazole. It is unclear if the positive tumor findings in lifetime rodent studies indicate a risk to patients taking a single dose of SOLOSEC to treat bacterial vaginosis. Avoid chronic use. (5.2)

5.1 Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

The use of SOLOSEC may result in vulvovaginal candidiasis. In controlled clinical trials of non-pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis developed in 19/197 (9.6%) of patients who received 2 g SOLOSEC and 4/136 (2.9%) subjects who received placebo. In a controlled clinical trial of non-pregnant female patients with trichomoniasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis developed in 2/74 (2.7%) of patients who received 2 g SOLOSEC and 0/73 (0%) subjects who received placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis may require treatment with an antifungal agent.

5.2 Potential Risk for Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity has been seen in mice and rats treated chronically with nitroimidazole derivatives which are structurally related to secnidazole. It is unclear if the positive tumor findings in lifetime rodent studies of these nitroimidazoles indicate a risk to patients taking a single dose of SOLOSEC to treat bacterial vaginosis. Avoid chronic use of SOLOSEC [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]

5.3 Risk of Development of Drug Resistance

Prescribing SOLOSEC in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^111FWFLJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a common cause of significant morbidity in women in all strata of society affecting millions of women worldwide. Previously, RVVC occurrence was limited by onset of menopause but the widespread use of hormone replacement therapy has extended the at-risk period. Candida albicans remains the dominant species responsible for RVVC, however optimal management of RVVC requires species determination and effective treatment measures are best if species-specific. Considerable progress has been made in understanding risk factors that determine susceptibility to RVVC, particularly genetic factors, as well as new insights into normal vaginal defense immune mechanisms and their aberrations in RVVC. While effective control of RVVC is achievable with the use of fluconazole maintenance suppressive therapy, cure of RVVC remains elusive especially in this era of fluconazole drug resistance. Vaccine development remains a critical challenge and need.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116xjWk8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne systemic antibiotic stewardship — Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is strongly discouraged, and the use of topical maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized. Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116G8SKE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Candidiasis Overview

There are more than 200 known species of Candida, a ubiquitous eukaryotic yeast that is part of the normal microbial flora of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract in healthy individuals. When host immunity is compromised, the risk of developing opportunistic Candida infections increases. C. albicans is the most common species associated with Candida infections, which often presents as oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, or cutaneous candidiasis. Predisposing factors for candidiasis include diabetes and other endocrinopathies, obesity, pregnancy, underlying HIV infection, poor hygiene, and recent treatment with antibiotics or corticosteroids. Individuals who wear dentures are also at increased risk for oral candidiasis.

### Vulvovaginal yeast infections, gestational diabetes and pregnancy outcome [^115xoLcY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiparous women and those with a high number of earlier pregnancies tended to have more frequent yeast infections than nulliparous women, or women in their first pregnancies. Sasikala and associates detected a similar association between higher parity and vulvovaginal yeast infection, but there are no other previous studies addressing this subject. This association have been earlier related to a higher BMI in multiparous women and those with a higher number of earlier pregnancies. However, in our study obesity and multiparity associated nearly independently in multivariable analysis related to the recurrent yeast infection, so there are other explanations to this association.

There is some evidence that yeast infections during pregnancy may be associated with the development of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth, and due to prematurity and infection, these complications could lead to neurodevelopmental impairment in a newborn with low birthweight. Recurrent yeast infection may increase the risk of premature birth and low birthweight, even in the absence of chorioamnionitis. In rare cases, vulvovaginal candidiasis has even caused maternal septicemia, and some studies suggest that fungal colonization could also cause septicemia in the unborn child. In this study, we did not detect association between recurrent vulvovaginal yeast infections and preterm birth in multivariable adjusted analysis. Notably, women with yeast infections had used oral antibiotics more than twice as often and vaginal antibiotics nearly six times more often during pregnancy than women without yeast infections. It is possible this contributes to the lack of complications, as the risk of maternal sepsis caused by candida and premature birth is found to decrease if yeast infection was treated properly with antifungal medication during pregnancy. Use of oral antimicrobial antibiotics is an evident risk for development of vaginal yeast infections; yet, we did not know whether self-reported use of vaginal antibiotics included antifungal medication.

### Risks for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by non-albicansVersus [^111T7fMH]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common vulvovaginitis (VV). About 20% of women will experience recurrent infections in their lifetime with non- albicans Candida (NAC) species being one of the causative agents. Although studies have looked at risk factors for recurrent VVC they are limited in scope. In this study, we explore whether risks of recurrent VVC are increased with NAC infections compared to Candida albicans infections. Methods: Through an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review, we identified 174 women with positive yeast cultures and followed their charts to assess recurrent visits and treatments. We also assessed several baseline variables such as race, age, body mass index (BMI), obstetric history, probiotic use, contraceptive use, mycological therapy, steroid use, hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, and medical comorbidities. Results: Women with NAC VV were more likely to have multiple visits for recurring infections compared to women who had C. albicans VV (66% vs. 34%). The women with multiple recurrences were younger, had a lower BMI, had lower parity, and endorsed higher use of probiotics. Conclusion: Women with positive NAC cultures were more likely to have multiple visits to their physicians for VV complaints. Identifying the causative species using vaginal fungal cultures can more accurately guide therapy and lead to better outcomes for these patients.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^113ifqdu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginitis.

Antibiotics such as tetracyclines are believed to suppress vaginal bacterial flora, resulting in overgrowth of candida. A recent in vitro study found that tetracycline may also enhance Candida albicans virulence factors, but the authors note that it is still unclear as to what degree this contributes to clinical vaginitis. Increased colonization with C. albicans after taking tetracyclines has been shown. After a 3-week course of tetracycline, one study observed that the percentage of women with vaginal cultures positive for C. albicans increased from 7% to 24%. Another study had similar findings for both tetracycline and minocycline. Despite this increase in yeast colonization, both studies found that only a small percentage of women with positive candidal vaginal cultures had symptoms of vulvovaginitis. In fact, other studies have found that only a small percentage of women develop clinical vulvovaginitis after taking tetracyclines. In women taking tetracycline for acne, symptomatic vaginitis was observed in 5%. In another study, only one of 21 (4.8%) women on daily doxycycline withdrew from the study because of repeated episodes of vaginitis. Another study did not find an increased risk for vaginal candidiasis with doxcycyline. Of note, reporting of vaginitis as an adverse drug reaction specifically to doxycycline when taken as malaria prophylaxis is limited because vaginitis is often included under the category of non-specific skin reactions and many of the early studies were done in male military personnel. Women taking doxycycline who have a predisposition to candidal vulvovaginitis, such as those with diabetes mellitus, past history of recurring vulvovaginitis, and those taking oral contraceptives, should consider carrying a self-treatment course of antifungals.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I² > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I² 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Microbiotoxicity: antibiotic usage and its unintended harm to the microbiome [^114JHR5Y]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

ANTIBIOTICS ARE INHERENTLY MICROBIOTOXIC

It might appear redundant to point out that antibiotics kill bacteria; and yet we see no redundancy in warning our patients of the side effects of antibiotics on their own microbiota. We already warn oncology patients of the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, and consider liver and renal function tests before prescribing hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic agents. So why not pay heed to our patients' microbiomes when prescribing microbiotoxic agents (Fig. 2)?

FIGURE 2
Balancing microbiotoxicity against the need to treat infection.

The association between antibiotic use and microbiome perturbation is becoming increasingly compelling, and has been most intensively studied for the gut microbiome. Immediately following a course of antibiotics, there is rapid reduction in the total numbers of bacteria (biomass) and bacterial species (alpha-diversity or richness), particularly health-associated keystone bacteria like Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species. This is accompanied by an initial bloom of potential pathogens that can cause healthcare-associated infections, including Enterobacterales, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Candida. There is also a significant increase in the total burden of AMR genes (the so-called 'resistome') in the host's gut following a course of antibiotics. This may lead to infections with AMR pathogens, and onward transmission of bacteria carrying AMR genes.

In many cases, antibiotic-associated microbiome perturbations stabilize within a few weeks. However, some studies report much longer recovery time and even incomplete recovery up to a year later, depending on the type, spectrum, duration and historic use of antibiotics. While the long-term effect of antibiotic-associated microbiome perturbation remains unclear, a growing body of evidence has linked antibiotic-associated microbiome changes with subsequent development of obesity, asthma, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer, as well as neurodevelopmental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorders. Antibiotic-mediated perturbation is not limited to the gut and has also been demonstrated for the respiratory tract and the vagina, with the latter associated with downstream bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

One of the starkest examples of antibiotics driving microbiome dysregulation and remains Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, a debilitating acute or chronic infection associated with significant morbidity and cost. Faecal microbiota transplants, which restore host microbiota, are curative in over 80% of treated patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, compared with less than one-third of patients treated with vancomycin alone, highlighting the importance of overall bacterial communities in keeping pathogens at bay.

### Efficacy of dequalinium chloride vs metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1145i9xf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The bacteriologic cure rates based on Nugent score were considerably lower than the clinical cure rates, but similar results were seen in a recent study. The first assessment was performed immediately after the end of treatment, and the lactobacillary flora may have still not had enough time to recover. However, like the clinical cure rate, at visit 2 the bacteriologic cure rate worsened in both groups, suggesting that some patients either never reached a normal Nugent score or relapsed shortly afterward. The noninferiority analyses of these exploratory secondary outcomes were inconclusive. Factors contributing to relapses, such as intercourse, hormones, and hygiene, should be taken into consideration in future trials.

The low correlation between the Nugent score and the Amsel criteria has been reported before, but it is still surprising because the Nugent score assesses the flora composition, whereas the Amsel criteria assess the clinical effects of bacterial overgrowth. Despite having 4 Amsel criteria at entry, approximately 45% had a Nugent score of 6 or less (ie, BV negative). This rate is higher than the 19% to 26% reported by a recent study with a similar design and patient populationbut lower than the 75% reported elsewhere. Clinicians rely almost exclusively on the Amsel criteria to diagnose BV and prescribe treatment, and this empirical treatment approach for vaginal infections is unlikely to change anytime soon. Although clindamycin and metronidazole are effective in the short term, they have several disadvantages that warrant further consideration of the first-line treatment options. For example, the spectrum of each antibiotic does not fully cover all the pathogens typically present in BV, and combinations with both antibiotics have not significantly improved the efficacy. Successive rounds of treatment rapidly increase the resistance to antibiotics, and neither metronidazole nor clindamycin seems capable of completely eliminating the biofilm. Prolonged antibiotic treatment is temporarily effective to reduce the relapse rate but potentially damages the normal flora. The risk of subsequent vulvovaginal candidiasis is 10% to 25% of the treated patients, likely due to an overgrowth of Candida or a misdiagnosed mixed infection. Finally, adherence to the treatment is crucial for efficacy and to prevent the development of resistance, but the frequent adverse effects and personal preferences can reduce patient adherence. Adverse effects can be as high as 32% with metronidazoleand 20% with clindamycin, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among the most frequent. Some patients reportedly dislike antibiotics and prefer other treatments even if perceived as less effective.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hRRH6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we found contradictory results regarding the abundance of Candida species in fungal cultures after treatment. Thamkantho et al.reported significantly more positive fungal cultures after DQC treatment than after standard treatment, although clinical cure rates were equivalent. However, the clinical implications of this finding are questionable because asymptomatic colonization with Candida should not be considered as an indication for treatment.

The standard treatment for vaginal infections depends on the underlying etiology. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF), as well as the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) recommend that the first-line treatment for BV should be oral or topical metronidazole or clindamycin. In uncomplicated VVC, oral or topical azoles, such as clotrimazole or fluconazole, are recommended as standard treatment.

A rapid increase in resistances to antibiotic or antifungal agents has been discovered over the last decades. This problem is especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, where the rate of multiresistant infections is expected to grow 4–7 times faster than in other regions. It has been estimated that in some countries up to 40%–60% of all infections are caused by resistant pathogens. Furthermore, over the last decades, the development of new antibiotic agents has increasingly slowed down. Owing to the increase in multiresistant pathogens and the burden of resistance to antibiotic and antifungal treatment options, a broader variety of treatment options would generally be desirable. Although the etiology of recurrent vaginal infections is not fully understood yet, resistance to antibiotics and antifungal agents is definitely a contributing factor. In addition, women with recurrent infections often need to be treated with high doses of antimycotic or antibiotic medication over long periods. Antiseptic agents could offer a possible treatment alternative, thereby controlling the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance.

### Interventions for prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection [^116yT39J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis as a chronic disease: diagnostic criteria and definition [^112tCDko]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Although recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is defined as 4 or more discrete attacks of vulvovaginal candidiasis per year, there is no diagnostic nomenclature or definition for the many women who are chronically symptomatic. This study aims to establish and propose a definition and a set of diagnostic criteria, which would enable clinicians to promptly identify and treat women with chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis (CVVC).

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Public and private vulvar dermatology outpatient clinics in Sydney, Australia.

Participants

Data were obtained prospectively from 50 women with presumptive CVVC and 42 controls. Historical and clinical features of CVVC identified by expert consensus were compared between the 2 groups. Diagnostic criteria were then prospectively applied to a further 163 patients to verify their accuracy.

Outcome Measures

Signs and symptoms diagnostic of CVVC.

Results

The following characteristics were found to be significantly more common in women with CVVC compared to controls (p ≤ .001): a history of positive vaginal Candida swab, discharge, dyspareunia, soreness, swelling, cyclicity, and exacerbation of symptoms with antibiotics.

Conclusions

We propose that CVVC can be confidently diagnosed using the major criteria of a chronic nonspecific and nonerosive vulvovaginitis that includes at least 5 or more properties from the following criteria: soreness, dyspareunia, positive vaginal swab either at presentation or in the past, previous response to antifungal medication, exacerbation with antibiotics, cyclicity, swelling, and discharge. This condition responds reliably to oral antifungal medication.

### Comparative safety of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient community-acquired pneumonia among otherwise healthy adults [^1144qSuY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence is limited about the comparative safety of antibiotic regimens for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with antibiotic regimens for CAP treatment among otherwise healthy, non-elderly adults.

Methods

We conducted an active comparator new-user cohort study (2007–2019) of commercially-insured adults 18–64 years diagnosed with outpatient CAP, evaluated via chest x-ray, and dispensed a same-day CAP-related oral antibiotic regimen. ADE follow-up duration ranged from 2–90 days (e.g., renal failure [14 days]). We estimated risk differences [RD] per 1000 treatment episodes and risk ratios using propensity score weighted Kaplan-Meier functions. Ankle/knee sprain and influenza vaccination were considered as negative control outcomes.

Results

Of 145 137 otherwise healthy CAP patients without comorbidities, 52% received narrow-spectrum regimens (44% macrolide, 8% doxycycline) and 48% received broad-spectrum regimens (39% fluoroquinolone, 7% β-lactam, 3% β-lactam + macrolide). Compared with macrolide monotherapy, each broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen was associated with increased risk of several ADEs (eg, β-lactam: nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain [RD per 1000, 3.20; 95% CI, 0.99–5.73]; non–Clostridioides difficile diarrhea [RD per 1000, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.47–6.82]; vulvovaginal candidiasis/vaginitis [RD per 1000, 3.57; 95% CI, 0.87, 6.88]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotic regimens largely conferred similar risk of ADEs. We generally observed similar risks of each negative control outcome, indicating minimal confounding.

Conclusions

Broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with increased risk of ADEs among otherwise healthy adults treated for CAP in the outpatient setting. Antimicrobial stewardship is needed to promote judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and ultimately decrease antibiotic-related ADEs.

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as risk of BV recurrence and side effect profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate BV recurrence rates and rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

Methods

Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females 12–50 years of age who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments (single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole) were compared for rates of recurrent BV and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

Overall, the rate of BV recurrence (2.7%), and VVC posttreatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

This study suggests that single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) may be a good alternative to oral metronidazole for the treatment of BV, given the low rates of recurrence and subsequent VVC demonstrated in this analysis.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114CjmaX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

Vaginal complaints are one of the most common reasons women seek the advice of a health care provider. Uncomplicated infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis are easy to diagnose and treat. However, about 8% of patients will have a more complicated course with failure to respond to treatment or rapid recurrence of symptoms. Understanding the need for a methodical, diagnostic approach to help these women with recurrent or refractory cases of vaginal symptoms will aid the clinician achieve successful patient outcomes.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

Management of Sex Partners

Uncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual intercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. A minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized by erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction with pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

Topical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although local burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally cause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the oral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations of liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur when oral azoles are administered with other drugs.

Complicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Diagnostic Considerations

Vaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women with complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify non– albicans Candida. Candida glabrata does not form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized on microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common in vaginal isolates, and non– albicans Candida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture and susceptibility testing should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic.

Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Recurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes of symptomatic VVC in < 1 year, affects < 5% of women but carries a substantial economic burden. Recurrent VVC can be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent antibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The pathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent predisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other non– albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% of women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these non– albicans yeasts as against C. albicans.

### Prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in the middle belt of Ghana [^116LFP4N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vaginal infections usually caused by Candida sp, organisms responsible for bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis are associated with considerable discomfort and adverse outcomes during pregnancy and child birth. The study determined the prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis (TV) in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at the Kintampo Municipal Hospital.

Methods

A study adopted a cross sectional design and recruited 589 pregnant women after seeking their informed consent from September, 2014 to March, 2015. Semi-structured questionnaire were administered to participants and vaginal swabs were collected. The samples were analysed using wet mount method and Gram stain (Nugent criteria) for vaginal infection. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to investigate association of risk factors to vaginal infections.

Results

The overall prevalence of at least one vaginal infection was 56.4%. The prevalence of vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis were 36.5, 30.9 and 1.4% respectively. Women with more than four previous pregnancies (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.58) and those in the third trimester of pregnancy (OR: 0.54, CI: 0.30–0.96) were associated with a lower risk of bacterial vaginosis. Douching and antibiotic use were neither associated with VVC or BV.

Conclusion

The prevalence of vaginal infections was high among pregnant women in the Kintampo area. There is the need for interventions such as adequate investigations and early treatment of vaginal infections to reduce the disease burden to avoid associated complications.

Epidemiology

The exact prevalence of vulvovaginal pruritus is difficult to determine due to the broad range of conditions that can cause it, but it is a common condition and affects most women at some point in their lives. Vulvar pruritus may affect women of all ages, and there is a notable correlation between age and the prevalence of many specific causal conditions. For instance, in one study vulvovaginitis was reported in 61.8% of gynecological issues in childhood and adolescence, with a high frequency of dermatitis in prepubertal populations. Infectious causes such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and trichomoniasis affect adolescent and adult women more frequently than children.

Age-related hormonal changes affect the vulvar anatomy, resulting in unique risk factors for vulvar pruritus for different age groups. Vaginal discomfort and pruritus in children aged 2–7 years may stem from early physiological and floral changes. Prepubertal girls are susceptible to conditions such as atopic and irritant dermatitis due to lack of estrogenization of the vagina. Additionally, proximity of the anus to the vagina and poor hygiene predisposes to the risk of inoculation with digestive bacteria and vaginal dysbiosis. Absence of labial fat pads and pubic hair as protective barriers are risk factors for dermatoses and pruritus-inducing infections in this age group. In contrast, estrogen loss occurring in the postpartum or postmenopausal state or from medications results in thinning of the vaginal epithelium and reduced elasticity, increasing vulnerability to irritation and infection.

Three primary vulvar dermatoses — lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, and lichen simplex chronicus — affect various age groups. At a vulvar specialty clinic in Oxford, UK, 20–25% of new patients presented with these conditions. Lichen sclerosus can impact prepubertal and postmenopausal women, lichen planus typically affects women aged 30–60 years, and lichen simplex chronicus is prevalent across all age groups.

Disease-specific risk factors include a family history of allergies, asthma, or eczema for lichen simplex chronicus; pregnancy, coitus frequency, conditions and medications associated with hyperglycemia and glucosuria, antibiotic use, and immunosuppressive conditions for vulvovaginal candidiasis; sexual activity for trichomoniasis; hereditary and environmental factors for atopic dermatitis; and ingestion of specific triggers for irritant contact dermatitis. Other multifactorial risk factors for vulvovaginitis include obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for assessing the clinical likelihood of the various causes and management strategies of vulvar and vaginal pruritus.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116gSuNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### The vaginal microbiome: V. therapeutic modalities of vaginal microbiome engineering and research challenges [^115NTfF5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Given these variations, there are several challenges in study interpretation. First, different probiotic products contain a wide variety of Lactobacillus and non- Lactobacillus species. Second, there is little evidence to date that administration of probiotics results in vaginal colonization by these strains, and most studies did not distinguish endogenous lactobacilli from probiotic strains. Third, there is a lack of quality control in manufacturing probiotic products, which means that the purity and potency of the products may not be consistent.

In a systematic review of 34 eligible studies evaluating vaginal probiotics (of 2949 articles), van de Wijgert and Verwijsreported that many clinical trials evaluating probiotics had suboptimal designs, many had considerable bias, and most were too small to have adequate statistical power to detect differences between study arms. Their results suggest that vaginally applied lactobacilli-containing probiotics may hold promise for BV cure and prevention, but much less so for cure and prevention of candidiasis. Given that molecular studies have shown that Candida species often coexist with lactobacilli (see part III) and that epidemiological studies have shown negative associations between BV and vulvovaginal candidiasis, these findings are not surprising. It was also found that prolonged antibiotic use was more efficient in reducing BV recurrence than probiotic use. – In addition, there was consistent evidence that vaginal detection of probiotic strains does not last long beyond the treatment period, suggesting that none of the evaluated probiotic strains colonized the vagina.

### The cgHaa1-regulon mediates response and tolerance to acetic acid stress in the human pathogen Candida glabrata [^115XiBD6]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Candida glabrata is commonly found as a commensal in the microflora that colonizes the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Under certain conditions, such as reduced activity of the host immune system, C. glabrata colonization can result in infections ranging from mucocutaneous candidiasis to life-threatening disseminated mycosis, where the yeasts cross the bloodstream and colonize major internal organs. Vaginal candidiasis is the most common form of superficial candidiasis, with 75% of all women being estimated to suffer from this infection, a substantial percentage, in a recurrent manner. Although C. albicans is the most prevalent causative agent of vulvovaginal and invasive candidiasis, the proportion of infections caused by C. glabrata is increasing, in many cases already surpassing the levels reported for C. albicans.

To succeed in colonization of the vaginal tract, C. glabrata cells have to cope with multiple environmental challenges, including the activity of the immune system, the panoply of nutrients available, alterations in extracellular pH (which varies during the menstrual cycle), and the presence of a cocolonizing microbiota, among others. Metagenomic analyses undertaken with different female populations revealed that the vaginal microbiota is essentially composed of lactic acid bacteria, although differences in species and in their rank-abundance had been found. This observation suggests that one key ecological function of the vaginal microbiota is the production of organic acids that restrain the overgrowth of fungal and/or bacterial pathogens. Other interference effects attributed to vaginal lactic acid bacteria include competition for nutrients and adhesion sites, and the secretion of H₂O₂, bacteriocine-like substances, and biosurfactants. Consistently, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which reduce commensal microflora abundance, is a recognized risk factor for the development of candidiasis.

### Biofilms: an underappreciated mechanism of treatment failure and recurrence in vaginal infections [^111dR59s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Biofilms are microbial communities of surface-attached cells embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix. They are of major medical significance because they decrease susceptibility to antimicrobial agents and enhance the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Biofilm-associated bacterial and fungal microorganisms have increasingly been recognized to play a role in multiple infectious diseases, particularly in their persistence and recurrence. More recently, biofilms have also been implicated in vaginal infections, notably bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), particularly in the setting of treatment failure and recurrence. The purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of biofilms on the management and treatment of BV and recurrent VVC and highlight the need for additional research and development of novel therapeutics targeting pathogenic vaginal biofilms.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113XR548]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), more commonly known as vaginal yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vaginitis. In 80%–95% of women, VVC is caused by Candida albicans with fewer remaining infections caused by non- albicans Candida species including Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, or other fungi. Approximately 75% of women will have ≥ 1 episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 40%–45% of women will experience ≥ 2 episodes. By the age of 25 years, an estimated 50% of all women will have experienced ≥ 1 episode of VVC after the onset of sexual activity. Current treatment options for VVC are predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents and include short courses of topical formulations of various agents or oral fluconazole given as a 150-mg single or multiple dose regimen. Limitations of available treatments include concerns of intolerance, adverse events (AEs), and with fluconazole, a potential risk of miscarriage and fetal harm. More recent VVC treatment limitations include an increasing prevalence of fluconazole resistance and intrinsic resistance or low susceptibility of non- albicans Candida species to azole antifungals.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^116LWuEk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Vaginitis — partner management: Whenever trichomoniasis is confirmed, current sex partners should be referred for presumptive therapy and counseled to refrain from sexual activity until they have completed therapy and are asymptomatic, typically a full 7 days since taking the last antibiotic dose; management of sex partners helps decrease transmission and reduce recurrence, and expedited partner therapy might have a role, although no single partner management intervention has been shown to be more effective than any other in reducing reinfection rates. For bacterial vaginosis, data do not support that treatment of sex partners affects rates of relapse or remission, and no studies address whether simultaneous treatment of both women in a lesbian couple decreases recurrence. In episodes of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, treatment of sex partners is not warranted, and randomized studies among heterosexual couples have failed to show a decrease in recurrence of bacterial vaginosis or vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^113sdd9D]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH. Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. 1146). Recurrent VVC can be either idiopathic or secondary.

The pathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent predisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other non– albicans Candida species are observed in 10%–20% of women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these non– albicans yeasts as against C. albicans. HIV Infection Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina. C.

albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

Classification of vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated requires the presence of ALL of sporadic or infrequent episodes, mild-to-moderate symptoms or findings, Candida albicans infection (suspected or proven), and non-immunocompromised patients; complicated requires the presence of ANY of recurrent episodes (four episodes or more per year), severe symptoms or findings, non-C albicans candidiasis (suspected or proven), or diabetes, immunocompromising conditions (eg, HIV), debilitation, or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids). Vulvovaginal candidiasis is classified as uncomplicated or complicated based on clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to initial therapy, and nonpregnant patients with complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis require more aggressive treatment to achieve relief of symptoms.

### Vaginal colonization and vertical transmission of Candida species: prevalence and associated factors among pregnant women and their neonates at public health facilities of northeast Ethiopia [^117LknYf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal colonization of Candida is typically unrecognized or asymptomatic, but it leads to an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome and overgrowth of yeasts in the vaginal mucus membrane. This can further result in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which is characterized by symptoms such as burning, itching, painful urination, vaginal discharge, and an inflammatory immune response. VVC progresses through multiple stages of development: the fungal attachment to epithelial cells, invasion, biofilm formation, and release of virulence factors. Approximately 75% of women will experience VVC at some point in their life; globally, 8% will experience VVC on a recurrent basis. VVC is a common form of vaginitis.

The risk of VVC is increased not only by the pregnancy condition itself but also by the co-existence of comorbidities such as diabetes, immunosuppression, HIV infection, contraception, and antibiotic use, including corticosteroid medications. Furthermore, pregnancy-related factors such as decreased cell-mediated immunity, elevated vaginal mucosal glycogen synthesis, and elevated estrogen levels will result in both asymptomatic colonization and a higher risk of VVC. Therefore, early detection and management of VVC during pregnancy are essential to prevent unwanted pregnancy outcomes.

According to recent evidence, approximately 75% of women have had at least one episode of VVC, with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) occurring in 5–10% of cases. Additionally, an estimated 138 million women are affected by RVVC annually worldwide. This condition also imposes a significant healthcare cost burden and productivity risks, with the problem worsening in low- and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. However, the scarcity of data on Candida infections among pregnant women in Ethiopia, especially in the context of vaginal colonization and vertical transmission, hampers effective interventions to address associated risks. Understanding the prevalence and factors contributing to Candida colonization is crucial for developing targeted screening and management strategies to safeguard the health of pregnant women and their neonates in the region. Therefore, comprehensive data on maternal vaginal Candida colonization and its correlation with vertical transmission to neonates are important in light of the lack of available evidence to make informed decisions and provide evidence-based public health interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the magnitude of vaginal colonization, vertical transmission rate, and associated factors of Candida species among pregnant women and their neonates at public health facilities in northeastern Ethiopia.

### Probiotics for vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women [^116Z52HJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is estimated to be the second most common form of infection after bacterial vaginosis. The ability of probiotics in maintaining and recovering the normal vaginal microbiota, and their potential ability to resist Candidas give rise to the concept of using probiotics for the treatment of VVC.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to October 2017: Sexually Transmitted Infections Cochrane Review Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and eight other databases. We searched in following international resources: World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and OpenGrey. We checked specialty journals, reference lists of published articles and conference proceedings. We collected information from pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) using probiotics, alone or as adjuvants to conventional antifungal drugs, to treat VVC in non-pregnant women. Trials recruiting women with recurrent VVC, coinfection with other vulvovaginal infections, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication were ineligible for inclusion. Probiotics were included if they were made from single or multiple species and in any preparation type/dosage/route of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Ten RCTs (1656 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded none of these trials. All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.24, 695 participants, 5 studies, low quality evidence) and mycological cure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, 969 participants, 7 studies, low quality evidence) and decreased relapse rate at one month (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68, 388 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence). However, this effect did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33, 172 participants, 1 study, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence) or mycological cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.71, 627 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence). Probiotics use did not increase the frequency of serious (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.94; 440 participants, 2 studies, low quality evidence). We found no eligible RCTs for outcomes as time to first relapse, need for additional treatment at the end of therapy, patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

Low and very low quality evidence shows that, compared with conventional treatment, the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy could increases the rate of short-term clinical and mycological cure and decrease the relapse rate at one month but this did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical or mycological cure. Probiotics use does not seem to increase the frequency of serious or non-serious adverse events. There is a need for well-designed RCTs with standardized methodologies, longer follow-up and larger sample size.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111jsWwa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — sex partner management and special populations: For complicated VVC, no recommendation can be made for treating sex partners because no data exist to support this practice. In compromised hosts, efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made and more prolonged (i.e., 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary. During pregnancy, only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women, and a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used. In HIV infection, treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV; although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC, and the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### Leveraging the microbiome to combat antibiotic resistant gynecological infections [^113W8xat]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (commonly known as a "yeast infection") is canonically caused by the dimorphic fungus Candida spp. (C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis) and is responsible for 20–25% of vaginitis cases. Similar to BV pathogens, Candida spp. can form biofilms and cause recurrent infections and may naturally occur at low levels in the vaginal microbiome. Formation of a biofilm has been shown to significantly increase antimicrobial resistance, altering the resistome. Candida spp. has shown resistance to antifungal treatments including azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) and amphotericin B. Resistance in Candida spp. has been linked with changes in gene expression including EGR11, CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 which encode the target enzyme and efflux pumps, respectively. Further, cross-resistance has been detected amongst azoles due to similar resistance mechanisms including fluconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and itraconazole.

N. gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum are common bacterial STIs that can carry antimicrobial resistance genes and are typically not a major component of the vaginal microbiome. Antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhea is particularly concerning and is considered a global health issue. N. gonorrhea can harbor antimicrobial resistance plasmid-derived genes related to efflux pumps and porins including bla TEM, tet(M), penA, ponA, mtrR, and porB1 –. Chlamydia trachomatis can develop resistance to several classes of antibiotics including macrolides, rifamycins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin. Antimicrobial resistance genes associated with Chlamydia trachomatis include rplD (macrolide), rplV (macrolide), rpoB (rifamycin and tetracycline), gyrA (fluoroquinolone), parC (fluoroquinolone), ygeD (fluoroquinolone), murA (Fosfomycin), secY, and tet(C) (tetracycline). Both N. gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis are also capable of forming polymicrobial biofilms, further decreasing their susceptibility to antibiotics. T. pallidum has been shown to develop resistance to macrolides through a mutation to the 23S rRNA gene.

### The prevalence and risk factors of vaginal Candida species and group B. streptococcus colonization in pregnant women attending antenatal care at hawassa university comprehensive specialized hospital in hawassa city, Southern Ethiopia [^117554aM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetics, pregnancy, diabetes, antibiotics, immunosuppressant, oral contraceptives, vaginal estrogen, hygiene, sexual behavior, humid weather, and feminine hygiene products can increase symptomatic infections. Pregnancy is a well-known risk factor for vulvovaginal candidiasis, with 10–15% of pregnant women experiencing colonization, and this figure rising to 30% in the third trimester. Progesterone and estrogen levels increase during the third trimester of pregnancy. Progesterone reduces neutrophil anti-Candida activity, whereas estrogen weakens the ability of vaginal epithelial cells to inhibit Candida albicans growth. Symptoms of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) include itching, whitish discharge, odor, edema, pain, and vulvar redness. Untreated VVC increases the risk of abortion, premature delivery, and bloodstream infections in preterm infants.

In addition to Candida species, another significant threat to newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS). It is an encapsulated gram-positive bacterium that inhabits the lower gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts in 20–30% of healthy adult women. During pregnancy, approximately 10–30% of women experience vaginal colonization with GBS, and 60% of their infants acquire this organism through the birth canal. Infection by invasive strains can cause maternal, fetal, and early onset neonatal diseases (days 0–6), leading to maternal death, stillbirth, and/or neonatal death. Genital colonization is a major risk factor for early neonatal sepsis. GBS vaginal colonization varies between 12 and 27% worldwide; however, the prevalence varies from place to place.

There are limited published data on the prevalence of both VVC and GBS colonization rates in pregnant women in Ethiopia, particularly in Hawassa. In one study conducted in Debre Markos Hospital, Amhara region of Ethiopia, 96 of the 384 (25%) pregnant women investigated were positive for VVC. Candida albicans (56.25%) was the predominant cause, and contraceptives and prolonged antibiotic use were associated risk factors. Similarly, 24 of 126 (19%) pregnant women were positive for GBS vaginal colonization in Jimma, Ethiopia. In another study conducted in Addis Ababa, 41 of 281 (14.6%) pregnant women were positive for GBS vaginal colonization.

### Risk factors for candidiasis… [^113xMpan]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points

- Having a weakened immune system or taking antibiotics increases overall risk for candidiasis.
- Pregnancy and hormone changes increase vaginal candidiasis risk.
- Babies < 1 month and people with HIV/AIDS have a higher risk for candidiasis in the mouth, throat, or esophagus.
- Invasive candidiasis generally only poses a risk to hospitalized patients. Medications and health conditions Most Candida infections are caused by an overgrowth of Candida, a fungus that lives on the skin and inside the body. Some medications and certain health conditions make it harder for the body to control Candida growth, increasing the risk for candidiasis.

General risk factors for candidiasis include:

- **Medications**: antibiotics, steroids, and chemotherapy.
- **Health conditions**: HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes. Other risk factors are specific to the type of infection and described below.

Some factors that increase the risk for vaginal candidiasis include:

- Pregnancy
- Use of hormonal contraceptives
- Diabetes
- Weakened immune system
- Current or recent antibiotic use.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat are uncommon for healthy adults. The risk is highest among babies under 1 month of age. Health conditions that increase risk for candidiasis in the mouth or throat include:

- Diabetes
- HIV/AIDS
- Cancer

Additional risk factors for candidiasis of the mouth and throat:

- Dentures
- Antibiotics
- Corticosteroids, especially in inhalers for conditions like asthma
- Medications and conditions that cause dry mouth
- Smoking.

Patients currently or recently in the hospital or with invasive medical devices may be at risk for invasive candidiasis.

Health conditions that increase risk include:

- Pre-term birth
- Kidney failure
- Diabetes

Factors that increase risk include:

- Long periods in the intensive care unit
- Central venous catheters
- Total parenteral nutrition
- Recent surgery, especially multiple abdominal surgeries
- Organ transplant
- Chemotherapy
- High-dose, broad-spectrum, or long-term antibiotics use
- Hemodialysis.

### Study of antibiotic-induced vaginal yeast infections in healthy women… [^113rbMwg]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

- Vaginal yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida. Candida can live harmlessly in the vagina, but most women will have symptoms from a vaginal yeast infection at some point during their life. Antibiotics increase the risk for yeast infections, but it is unclear why. They may disrupt the balance of healthy bacteria in the vagina. This protocol is a prospective, interventional, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled longitudinal study designed to investigate the microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis in women who receive antibiotics. VVC is the most common fungal infection affecting women. Although asymptomatic vaginal Candida colonization occurs in ~10–20% of healthy women, ~75% of women will experience at least one episode of symptomatic VVC during their lifetime. Nonetheless, the local mucosal factors that allow Candida to convert from a commensal organism to an opportunistic pathogen are not well defined.

Antibiotic use is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of VVC in healthy women, suggesting that alterations in the endogenous vaginal microbial flora results in deregulation of local mucosal anti-Candida immune responses. However, which commensal vaginal microbiota are important for protection against Candida infection, and the mechanism whereby vaginal microbiota influence the local mucosal immune response against Candida, remain unknown. To address these questions, healthy women of reproductive age will receive a 10-day course of amoxicillin or a placeboand will undergo vaginal sampling for microbiomic and immunologic analyses before, during and after antibiotic administration over a 90-day period.

The hypothesis of this study is that women who develop amoxicillin-associated VVC will have a characteristic microbiomic profile with associated impairment in local mucosal anti-Candida immune responses. The aim of this study is to elucidate the vaginal microbiomic and immunologic perturbations that allow Candida to transition from commensal to pathogen in the context of antibiotic administration. A better understanding of the role of specific microbiota and mucosal immune factors in averting Candida infection may lead to the design of targeted preventive and/or therapeutic interventions against VVC.

### Exploring the vaginal ecosystem: insights into host-microbe interactions and microbial community dynamics [^1168eDkN]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Candida spp. primarily C. albicans, are the most common fungal members of the vaginal microflora and, like many bacterial species, can persist as commensals at basal levels. Overgrowth of Candida can arise, resulting in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which is marked by vaginal soreness or discomfort, vaginal itching, and abnormal vaginal discharge. Like any member of the vaginal microbiota, community dynamics and environmental factors influence the growth of Candida spp. and interkingdom interactions are often driven by the presence of Lactobacillus spp. and host elements, for example, biofilms formed by Lactobacillus can maintain the commensal yeast form of Candida rather than the virulent, hyphal form. While the effects of VVC and the impacts of Candida on the immune system have been well characterized, there is still much to uncover about the role of commensal fungi in the vaginal microbiome. Cytolytic vaginosis (CV), which is caused by an overgrowth of Lactobacillus and an increase of lactic acid above normal, is primarily caused by L. crispatus. CV presents with similar symptoms and is often misdiagnosed as VVC, leading to improper treatment that often results in persistent symptoms. CV is an interesting pathology that suggests community balance is a more important factor for eubiosis rather than purely Lactobacillus dominance.

The recommended treatment for BV and AV is prescription antibiotics for symptomatic patients. Although this is often the first choice of treatment, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics affects pathogenic and beneficial bacteria, disrupting the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and increasing the susceptibility to secondary infections including VVC. Alternative options have been proposed for the treatment of BV, including probiotic use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus or L. crispatus strains and recombinant, phage-derived endolysins that could selectively target BV-associated microbes like G. vaginalis. Conflicting opinions still exist in the field on whether BV, AV, and CV should be considered infectious diseases and are normal fluctuations of bacterial community states or syndromes. Some of the discussion points raised suggest more consideration be placed on patients with clinical BV diagnosis by Amsel's criteria or Nugent scores who present with variable or inconsistent symptoms, or asymptomatically even with detectable bacterial species like G. vaginalis. As the field advances, these discussions should continue, especially in cases where antibiotic interventions are introduced for asymptomatic individuals with "dysbiotic or non-optimal" microbial communities.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^116yrPHe]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigate the differences between patients with recurrent BV and patients with one episode of BV in a primary care population and studied GPs' approach to patients with recurrent BV. We were able to describe the characteristics of patients that present with recurrent BV as well as identify possible risk factors for the development of recurrence.

Currently, the precise aetiology of BV is not fully elucidated. BV is known to be caused by a vaginal dysbiosis, in which opportunistic, mostly anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, overgrow in lieu of healthy, protective micro-organisms, like Lactobacillus spp. This leads to symptoms such as a greyish white, homogeneous discharge and a typical malodour ('fishy odour').

In terms of possible risk factors, we found that patients of all age categories, who were recently prescribed antibiotics, and had a medical history of STIs, HPV, and/or Candidiasis significantly more often presented with recurrent BV.

Regarding the age at time of first presentation, we found similar frequencies in the four categories for both groups. This is not in line with previous findings, as BV is commonly diagnosed in patients during their reproductive years and less prevalent in persons over 40 years old, specifically postmenopausal people. This difference can be due to the fact that other studies were not done in a general practice population. Participants in those studies were recruited, whereas in our study we investigated presented morbidity, which might have resulted in an over-representation of postmenopausal patients in our study, as these patients might be more likely to contact their GP when suffering of abnormal discharge.

It is known that the use of antibiotics can alter a person's microbiome, including the bacterial composition of the vaginal flora. Certain broad-spectrum penicillins, tetracyclines and nitrofuran derivatives, for example, are shown to affect Lactobacillus species, which are known to exert a protective effect in the vagina. One study has found that recent antibiotic use can lower Lactobacilli in isolated cultures by approximately 30%. This is a possible explanation for the dysbiotic state is able to relapse or persist in patients with recurrent BV. Currently, research into the role of antibiotic use and the development of BV is limited. The role of antibiotic use in the development of other types of vulvovaginitis, such as Candidiasis, however, has been more extensively documented, as well as which classes of antibiotics might trigger such an episode.

### Leveraging the microbiome to combat antibiotic resistant gynecological infections [^112FBc6F]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

While metabolomics/proteomics and Raman spectroscopy techniques have primarily been used to study changes in microbial metabolism in resistant gut and environmental microbes and resistomes, these technologies offer the potential to provide critical insight into the metabolic shifts that occur in resistant microbes in the vaginal resistome. By understanding the metabolic changes in resistant vaginal microbes, new therapies can be developed that target key metabolic pathways. Table 3 highlights the advantages and limitations of emerging technologies that can be applied to study microbial metabolism and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in the vaginal resistome.

Table 3
Advantages and limitations of emerging technologies that offer potential to study the vaginal resistome

In summary, there is a pressing need to understand the complex environment of the vaginal microbiota that allows resistance to develop and to design novel therapies that are less prone to developing resistance. Vaginal microbes associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, N. gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia can harbor antimicrobial resistance genes and contribute to the vaginal resistome. Antibiotic and microbiome-based approaches (e.g. probiotic, bacteriophage) have been used to combat resistant gynecological infections with varying degrees of success. While there are a range of innovative computational tools (Table 3) at the disposal of researchers to track the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in gynecological infections and develop novel therapeutics, many challenges remain including optimizing the techniques to handle the relatively low biomass samples of the vaginal microbiome and standardizing microbiome analyses. Ultimately, the infrastructure to study the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and to develop therapies exists but it has primarily focused on gastrointestinal applications rather than gynecological. Therefore, to move the field forward it is necessary to emphasize translation and optimization of existing tools for gynecological infections.

Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor, or Discharge

The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.

Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication. Therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and practices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices (e.g. douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal medications or other products should be elicited. The infections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms are BV (i.e. replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, A. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal vaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually transmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently diagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are being evaluated for an STI.

### The vaginal microbiome: III. the vaginal microbiome in various urogenital disorders [^115t5gPa]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This series of articles, titled The Vaginal Microbiome (VMB), written on behalf of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, aims to summarize the recent findings and understanding of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, mainly regarding areas relevant to clinicians specializing in vulvovaginal disorders.

Materials and Methods

A search of PubMed database was performed, using the search terms "vaginal microbiome" with "Candida", "vaginitis", "urinary microbiome", "recurrent urinary tract infections", "sexually transmitted infections", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human papillomavirus", "nonspecific vaginitis", "vulvodynia", and "vulvovaginal symptoms". Full article texts were reviewed. Reference lists were screened for additional articles. The third article in this series describes VMB in various urogenital disorders.

Results

Variable patterns of the VMB are found in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, challenging the idea of a protective role of lactobacilli. Highly similar strains of health-associated commensal bacteria are shared in both the bladder and vagina of the same individual and may provide protection against urinary tract infections. Dysbiotic VMB increases the risk of urinary tract infection. Loss of vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria combined with elevated pH, increase the risk for sexually transmitted infections, although the exact protective mechanisms of the VMB against sexually transmitted infections are still unknown.

Conclusions

The VMB may constitute a biological barrier to pathogenic microorganisms. When the predominance of lactobacilli community is disrupted, there is an increased risk for the acquisition of various vaginal pathogents. Longitudinal studies are needed to describe the association between the host, bacterial, and fungal components of the VMB.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — diagnosis and testing: the diagnosis can be made when a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or when a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species, and Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5); examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered; if Candida cultures cannot be performed, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina; the majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and yeast culture remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tetracycline‐class antibiotics are frequently prescribed by dermatologists, primarily for the treatment of acne vulgaris and rosacea. Tetracycline‐class antibiotics include tetracycline (first generation), doxycycline and minocycline (second generation), and sarecycline (third generation). Prior to sarecycline, all tetracycline‐class antibiotics exhibited broad‐spectrum activity against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria. This broad‐spectrum activity may induce bacterial resistance and disrupt the microflora, leading to dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) tracts, which are associated with adverse events (AEs) such as diarrhea and vulvovaginal mycotic/candidiasis infections. In addition, prolonged use of broad‐spectrum antibiotics such as doxycycline has been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. On the basis of clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 4). Approximately 10%–20% of women will have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

Secondly, patients with recurrent BV received STI diagnoses more often than patients with single-episode BV. Although numbers of STI diagnoses were small, these findings are in line with previous studies that have shown that BV is associated with increased risk of STI acquisition and transmission. This facilitation of STI acquisition may be caused by the decreased protection by Lactobacilli or other lactic-acid producing micro-organisms. It can also be due to higher levels of local inflammatory cytokine production that are associated with BV. It is also possible that patients had more sexual partners, which is both a risk factor for BV as for STI acquisition.

Moreover, infections with HPV were more prevalent for the group with recurrent BV as well, which is in line with previous research. Gilet and colleaguesconducted a meta-analysis, which showed a positive association between BV and HPV. Research also shows that patients with healthy vaginal flora, dominated by Lactobacillus spp. achieved higher clearance rates of HPV.

Candida diagnoses were also more prevalent for the group with recurrent BV. This can have several possible explanations. For one, diagnoses can be overestimated because the recurrent group received more microbiological testing in which Candida could be detected. Patients could also suffer from mixed infections, where Candida and BV are present simultaneously. Furthermore, BV and medication for BV, such as metronidazole and clindamycin have been described as risk factors for the development of vulvovaginal Candidiasis. Lastly, the group with recurrent BV received more antibiotic prescriptions, which is also a known risk factor for Candidiasis.

We found that patients with recurrent BV had more remote consultations and less in-person consultations than single-episode patients and the RFE was more often a request for medication. This can be explained by patients' recognition of the symptoms from previous episodes. A qualitative study by Payne and colleaguesshows patients with recurrent BV would like to have an over-the-counter treatment available and the majority would feel comfortable self-medicating.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^1157zBif]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The prolonged interval from symptom onset to referral and noncollection of microbiology in 13% reinforce previous findings that clinical recognition of vulvar psoriasis and cutaneous candidiasis is poor. Association of visible fungal organisms with prereferral topical corticosteroids may signal iatrogenic exacerbation of disease. Empiric prescribing of topical estrogen, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antimycotics to women with vulvovaginal complaints in the primary care setting is discouraged. Instead, presence of a rash should precipitate microbiologic assessment via swab, scraping, and/or polymerase chain reaction, vulvar care advice, and prompt follow-up. Lack of distinct nomenclature and clinical guidance to separate vulvar cutaneous candidiasis from VVC likely contributes to underrecognition and inadequate skin treatment.

Use of combined antifungal and corticosteroid treatment was common in specialist-led clinics. It is unclear if the reason is uncertain clinical diagnosis, reluctance to cease topical steroids due to possible underlying dermatosis, or belief that dual therapy provides speedier symptomatic relief. The evidence for initial genital psoriasis treatment is limited and favors low- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, supplemented by topical coal tar preparations, calcineurin inhibitors, or vitamin D analogs. Several publications recommend topical antifungals over systemic agents for cutaneous candidiasis, citing efficacy, cost, ease of use, and adverse effect profile, except for severe extensive disease justifying systemic azoles for 2–6 weeks. Scant evidence supports this approach, and use of topicals does not address vulva-specific concerns of nonvisibility and surface area of affected skin, concurrent dermatologic conditions, and propensity toward contact dermatitis. Studies assessing combination topical antifungals with corticosteroids for cutaneous candidiasis did not demonstrate superiority of dual therapy over single-agent antimycotics.

### Probiotic Lactobacillus species modulate immune responses during vaginal epithelial cell colonization [^111q6ue1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), mainly caused by Candida albicans, affects approximately 75% of women at least once during their lifetime. VVC is characterized by fungal colonization, which leads to inappropriate local hyperinflammation and symptoms. Although the trigger of C. albicans pathogenicity is often unknown, antibiotic use and vaginal dysbiosis are associated with increased susceptibility to VVC. A healthy vaginal microbiota is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species, which are believed to keep C. albicans infections at bay. Probiotic lactobacilli are, therefore, explored to treat symptomatic VVC episodes. However, the influence of probiotic lactobacilli on immune responses in the context of VVC remains underexplored.

Methods

We investigated how probiotic lactobacilli influence vaginal epithelial and downstream inflammatory responses during C. albicans infection, using in vitro vaginal epithelial infection models and stimulating primary human immune cells with supernatants from these vaginal epithelial cells.

Results

Our study shows that although most of the tested probiotic lactobacilli reduced C. albicans -induced vaginal epithelial cell damage, some species, particularly Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, elicited proinflammatory responses even in the absence of C. albicans. Probiotic lactobacilli also differentially modulated the C. albicans killing efficiency and production of reactive oxygen species by neutrophils.

Conclusions

Overall, vaginal epithelial and downstream immune responses during co-cultivation with C. albicans and probiotic lactobacilli were mostly driven by specific bacterial species and their interactions with the vaginal epithelium. Therefore, the induction of "controlled" inflammation by probiotic lactobacilli may be beneficial to improve neutrophil function; however, whether this alleviates immunopathology warrants further investigation.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can frustrating for patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up. The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy will break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

A history of yeast infections is strongly associated with vulvodynia, but because of the vast majority of these infections are self-reported or not confirmed by culture, it is still unknown whether these are true or only perceived yeast infections. Bedford et al.found a strong association between vulvodynia and a history of more frequent yeast infections, among women with a low alpha diversity (the diversity of microbiome profile within a sample). Similarly, the association between prior yeast infections and vulvodynia was mainly confined to women with L. crispatus and L. iners dominance.

Overall, no specific microbiome pattern has been consistently recognized in women with vulvodynia. In line with the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology of this pain syndrome, specific microbiomes may contribute to specific vulnerability. The study of the microbiome in women with vulvodynia carries inherent bias and difficulty to control for various factors, specifically the frequency of sexual intercourse, as sporadic or no intercourse is associated with a less diverse microbiome. Proof of causality is, however, lacking, and these changes might just as well be the result of vulvodynia and the resulting changes in behavior or use of medications, such as antibiotics and hormones.
