## Question

what are the indications to perform carotid doppler ultrasound in assimpyomatyc T2DM patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for performing carotid Doppler ultrasound in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline positions on routine screening. Then, I should verify the evidence base for selective screening in higher-risk subgroups. Next, I will examine the prognostic data linking carotid stenosis and plaque to outcomes in diabetes. After that, I need to check the balance of benefits versus harms, including false positives and downstream procedural risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a clear bottom line with caveats about uncertainty and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the top-tier guidance, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond consensus. The USPSTF gives a D recommendation against routine screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population, citing no proven benefit and potential harms from false positives and unnecessary procedures, and this applies to people with diabetes as well unless they fall into a higher-risk subgroup, so universal screening in T2DM is not advised [^0276407d] [^6030a117]. The ADA Standards of Care similarly recommend against routine screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic adults with diabetes, emphasizing that outcomes are not improved when ASCVD risk factors are optimally treated, which aligns with a conservative stance toward indiscriminate carotid ultrasound as well [^4708f8e6] [^734b4496]. The Society for Vascular Surgery advises against routine screening in individuals without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors, again underscoring that screening should be selective rather than routine [^371544f9] [^062e1604].

> Wait, let me verify the selective screening signals before I jump ahead. The SVS suggests considering screening in selected asymptomatic patients at increased risk, particularly if they would contemplate carotid intervention if significant stenosis were found, which introduces a patient-preference and risk-factor–driven nuance rather than a blanket endorsement [^cd84141f] [^f4720f8c]. The ESVS 2023 guideline supports selective screening in patients with two or more vascular risk factors, with the aim of optimizing risk-factor control rather than identifying candidates for revascularization, which reframes the purpose toward medical therapy intensification [^1180f82b]. The ESC 2024 peripheral arterial disease guidance also advises considering screening when multiple cardiovascular risk factors are present, reinforcing a targeted approach rather than population-wide screening [^b9e5eadb].

> I will now examine the prognostic data in diabetes, because I need to ensure that any selective use is grounded in outcomes. Observational cohorts show that asymptomatic patients with T2DM and carotid stenosis ≥ 50% have markedly higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality over long-term follow-up, with survival around 20% at 12 years in one study, supporting the concept that discovering significant carotid disease can refine risk stratification in this subgroup [^4e8c7293] [^9c45390b]. Carotid plaque presence has also been associated with obstructive coronary artery disease and future cardiovascular events in asymptomatic T2DM cohorts, suggesting that carotid ultrasound can uncover systemic atherosclerosis that may not be captured by traditional risk scores alone [^ac43187d] [^bb0ac9f0]. Hold on, I should verify that these are observational and not randomized; yes, these are observational data, so causality and treatment-effect inference are limited, but they do support prognostic value in higher-risk phenotypes [^4e8c7293] [^ac43187d].

> Next, I should review the balance of benefits and harms, because even if prognostic associations exist, screening must improve clinically meaningful outcomes. The USPSTF highlights that screening yields false positives in low-prevalence settings, leading to confirmatory angiography and interventions that carry perioperative stroke and death risks, and that contemporary medical therapy has reduced stroke rates in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, diminishing the absolute benefit of revascularization in unselected patients [^0276407d] [^6030a117]. Let me consider the prevalence context: in general populations, significant asymptomatic carotid stenosis is uncommon, and screening only becomes cost-effective when prevalence is around 20% or higher, which is why targeted strategies focus on enriched-risk cohorts rather than all-comers [^c01a866d] [^bf3a7839]. I should double-check that this aligns with vascular society guidance; yes, SVS and ESVS emphasize selective screening in higher-prevalence subgroups to avoid net harm from overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^cd84141f] [^1180f82b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach, and I need to ensure it aligns with the evidence and guidelines. Routine carotid Doppler ultrasound is not recommended for all asymptomatic T2DM patients, but selective screening can be considered in those with multiple vascular risk factors or when results would change management, such as intensifying statins, blood pressure control, antiplatelet therapy, or lifestyle interventions [^4708f8e6] [^1180f82b]. High-yield scenarios include patients with additional risk factors like hypertension, smoking, PAD, advanced age, or long diabetes duration, and those with a carotid bruit or other cerebrovascular symptoms, where the pretest probability and potential to alter therapy are higher [^716b3f24] [^21d253d6]. Hold on, I should verify that bruit alone is not enough; indeed, auscultation has poor accuracy, so bruit should prompt consideration of duplex rather than serve as a standalone indication, and results should be interpreted in accredited vascular laboratories to minimize variability and false positives [^729a6888] [^59b758b8].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on maximal medical therapy and the result won't change treatment? I need to ensure we avoid screening when results are unlikely to alter management. Imaging should not be performed if the findings would not be expected to change therapy, which is a consistent principle across cardiovascular imaging recommendations in diabetes and aligns with the ADA's stance against routine CAD screening that doesn't improve outcomes when risk factors are treated [^38398b6a] [^4708f8e6]. I should confirm that this applies to carotid ultrasound as well; yes, the same principle of net clinical benefit and actionability applies, reinforcing a selective, patient-centered approach rather than routine screening [^38398b6a] [^4708f8e6].

> I should also consider special contexts where screening is more compelling, but I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize. Preoperative settings such as planned CABG with recent TIA or stroke, or high-risk surgical cohorts, may warrant carotid duplex to inform perioperative stroke risk and management, though this is outside the realm of routine primary care screening and should be individualized [^d67ebdd4] [^21d253d6]. Let me reconsider whether any of this contradicts the general principle; it does not, because these are targeted indications in specific clinical scenarios rather than population screening, which remains consistent with guideline logic [^d67ebdd4] [^0276407d].

> Bottom line, I should state this clearly and then sanity-check it against the guidelines. Universal carotid Doppler screening is not recommended for asymptomatic T2DM patients, but selective screening can be considered for those with multiple vascular risk factors, when results would change management, or when clinical features increase pretest probability, with the understanding that the goal is risk-factor optimization rather than routine revascularization, and that shared decision-making is essential given the potential for false positives and downstream harms [^0276407d] [^4708f8e6] [^1180f82b]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality impact from screening itself; there are no randomized data proving that screening asymptomatic T2DM patients with carotid ultrasound reduces hard outcomes, so any adoption of selective screening should be framed as risk refinement and therapy intensification rather than proven mortality benefit from screening alone [^0276407d] [^4708f8e6].

---

Routine carotid Doppler ultrasound is **not recommended for all asymptomatic T2DM patients** [^0276407d] because it does not improve outcomes when ASCVD risk factors are optimally managed [^4708f8e6]. It should be reserved for **selective screening** in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (age ≥ 65, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or PAD) [^1180f82b] [^b9e5eadb] or when a carotid bruit is detected on exam [^716b3f24]. Carotid ultrasound is also reasonable before major cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG) in patients with recent TIA/stroke or high-risk features [^d67ebdd4] [^21d253d6]. Routine screening is not advised for low-risk patients, as false positives can lead to unnecessary interventions without proven benefit [^0276407d] [^6030a117].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Several authoritative organizations provide **guidelines on carotid ultrasound screening** in asymptomatic patients, including those with T2DM:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) | Recommends against routine screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) in the general adult population, including patients with diabetes, due to lack of evidence that screening improves outcomes and potential harms from false positives and unnecessary interventions [^0276407d] [^6030a117]. |
| American Diabetes Association (ADA) | Does not recommend routine screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic patients with diabetes, as it does not improve outcomes when ASCVD risk factors are treated [^4708f8e6] [^734b4496]. |
| European Society of Cardiology (ESC) | Recommends selective screening for ACAS in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, primarily to optimize risk factor control rather than to identify candidates for carotid interventions [^1180f82b] [^b9e5eadb]. |
| Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) | Recommends against routine screening for ACAS in individuals without cerebrovascular symptoms or significant risk factors. Selective screening may be considered in high-risk patients, particularly if they are willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is discovered [^371544f9] [^cd84141f]. |

## Evidence supporting selective screening in T2DM patients

While routine screening is not recommended, **selective screening** may be beneficial in specific high-risk subgroups of T2DM patients:

- **High-risk cardiovascular profile**: Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. age ≥ 65 years, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or peripheral artery disease) may benefit from carotid ultrasound to identify subclinical atherosclerosis and guide aggressive risk factor management [^1180f82b] [^b9e5eadb].

- **Carotid bruit**: Detection of a carotid bruit during physical examination may indicate significant carotid stenosis and warrants further evaluation with carotid ultrasound [^716b3f24] [^0f5fb637].

- **Preoperative assessment**: Patients scheduled for major cardiac surgeries (e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting) with recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke may benefit from carotid ultrasound to assess stroke risk and guide perioperative management [^d67ebdd4] [^21d253d6].

---

## Potential benefits and limitations of carotid ultrasound screening

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of subclinical atherosclerosis, enabling timely intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk [^99163a00], and **risk stratification**, as carotid ultrasound findings can refine cardiovascular risk assessment and guide aggressive risk factor management [^b0d5f8ae].

---

### Limitations

- **False positives**: Screening in low-prevalence populations can lead to false-positive results, potentially causing anxiety and unnecessary interventions [^0276407d] [^6030a117].

- **Limited impact on outcomes**: There is insufficient evidence that routine screening improves clinical outcomes in asymptomatic T2DM patients when ASCVD risk factors are optimally managed [^4708f8e6] [^734b4496].

- **Cost and resource utilization**: Routine screening may impose unnecessary costs and strain healthcare resources without proven benefit [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where carotid ultrasound may be considered

Based on current evidence and guidelines, **carotid ultrasound may be considered** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Multiple cardiovascular risk factors**: Age ≥ 65 years, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or peripheral artery disease [^1180f82b] [^b9e5eadb].

- **Carotid bruit**: Detected on physical examination [^716b3f24] [^0f5fb637].

- **Preoperative assessment**: Before major cardiac surgeries in patients with recent TIA or stroke [^d67ebdd4] [^21d253d6].

- **Patient preference**: Patients who specifically request screening after counseling about potential benefits and limitations [^cd84141f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine carotid Doppler ultrasound screening is **not recommended** for asymptomatic T2DM patients, as it does not improve clinical outcomes when ASCVD risk factors are optimally managed [^4708f8e6] [^734b4496]. Selective screening may be considered for high-risk patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, carotid bruit, or specific clinical scenarios, with decisions individualized based on patient preference and clinical judgment [^1180f82b] [^b9e5eadb].

Methods

In this single-center study, we prospectively enrolled 1363 consecutive patients who underwent ultrasound investigations of the extracranial carotid arteries between March 2002 and March 2003. Study design, inclusion, and exclusion criteria have been published previously. Patients with prevalent atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, defined by the presence of non-stenotic plaques or carotid stenosis of any degree that were neurologically asymptomatic at the time of screening, were enrolled. The main indications for performing ultrasound investigation were carotid bruits, prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, and known atherosclerotic diseases in other vessel areas. Patients with current infectious, inflammatory diseases or active malignancies, symptomatic of carotid artery disease that necessitated revascularization therapy, patients having undergone bilateral carotid occlusions, bilateral stent implantation, or bilateral carotid endarterectomy, as well as patients with a myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or peripheral vascular surgery during the preceding 6 months, were excluded from the study. Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were assessed by searching the national death register for the specific cause of death (according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision). Only the specific cause of death (e.g. acute myocardial infarction) was used to categorize death as either all-cause, cardiovascular, or non-cardiovascular death. In 43% of deaths, the underlying cause was assessed by autopsy.

Clinical and laboratory data

Every enrolled patient completed a detailed study questionnaire that was reviewed by a physician assessing the patient's medical history, current medication, biometric data, and family history. All clinical characteristics were ascertained by 2 independent observers. Antecubital venous blood samples were drawn and analyzed directly without freezing according to local laboratory standard procedures within 2 to 4 h of sampling. Serum levels of Hba1c were determined at admission (DADE Behring, IL, USA). Treating physicians and ultrasonographers were blinded for all laboratory values, color-coded duplex sonography, and grading of internal carotid artery stenosis.

### Carotid ultrasound investigation as a prognostic tool for patients with diabetes mellitus [^d4c00ca6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diabetic patients with carotid stenosis ≥ 50% are at exceptional high risk for all-cause and cardiovascular death. Thus, routinely ultrasound investigation of the carotid arteries might be a valuable prognostic tool for patients with diabetes mellitus. However, further research is warranted to evaluate the clinical usefulness of ultrasound investigations of the carotid arteries as a screening tool in patients with diabetes mellitus and whether adjusted therapeutically intervention improves outcome in these patients.

Second, the utility of screening patients with type 2 diabetes for asymptomatic CAD is still controversial. Previous studies showed long-term safety and efficacy of intensive medication therapy and coronary revascularization in type 2 diabetic patients. However, many cardiologists are now skeptical of revascularization of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, because the BARI2D study did not show any substantial difference between intensive medical therapy and revascularization, such as coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in type 2 diabetic patients with stable CAD. Thus, it is still controversial regarding which patients benefit from coronary artery revascularization and how it is clinically important to identify severe but asymptomatic CAD. Therefore, it is unclear if a long-term clinical benefit was achieved in 17 subjects who had coronary revascularization in the current study. To evaluate whether carotid ultrasonography really leads to the improvement of difficult clinical outcomes (e.g. myocardial infarction), another trial should be performed.

Fifth, although carotid ultrasonography can be performed noninvasively and relatively inexpensively, its use for universal screening in type 2 diabetic patients is not feasible. Therefore, the kind of diabetic population that should be given preference in receiving this clinical examination also must be clarified in further studies.

Finally, it is noted that the subjects of this study were Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. Thus, it would be premature to generalize our findings to other race or ethnic groups and nondiabetic subjects.

Notwithstanding these limitations, our study indicates that measurement of carotid maximum IMT can provide useful information for identifying subjects at high risk for CAD.

In conclusion, our study suggests that carotid maximum IMT is useful for screening asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with severe CAD equivalent to revascularization.

Background

Experimental and clinical data indicate a major influence of diabetes on atherogenesis. We aimed to assess whether the effect of diabetes on long-term mortality in asymptomatic patient with carotid stenosis is contingent upon the degree of the carotid atherosclerotic burden.

Methods

1065 patients with neurological asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis as evaluated by duplex sonography were prospectively followed for cause-specific mortality.

Results

During a median of 11.8 years, a total of 549 deaths, including 362 cardiovascular deaths, were recorded. Diabetes and glycohemoglobin A1c (Hba1c) levels were significantly associated with mortality. Diabetes displayed an independent risk for all-cause (adjusted HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.35–1.94) and cardiovascular death (adjusted HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.40–2.19). The adjusted hazard ratio per increase of 1% of Hba1c levels was 1.21 (P < 0.01) for all-cause and 1.31 (P < 0.01) for cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Patients with diabetes mellitus and a higher degree of carotid stenosis and were at great risk of adverse outcome. Only 21% of the asymptomatic diabetic patients with carotid narrowing over 50% survived, whereas 62% of the patients without diabetes and with carotid atherosclerosis below 50% were still alive after 12-years of follow-up. The high risk for all-cause and cardiovascular death of these patients remained significant after adjustment for various established cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable regression analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 2.4, P < 0.001; compared to patients without diabetes and < 50% carotid atherosclerosis).

Conclusion

Diabetic patients with carotid stenosis ≥ 50% are at exceptional high risk for all-cause and cardiovascular death. Thus, routinely ultrasound investigation of the carotid arteries might be a valuable prognostic tool for patients with diabetes mellitus.

Diabetes, atherogenesis and cardiovascular outcome

The association between diabetes and the development of cardiovascular disease has been well established in the last decades or so. More recently, it has been shown that patients with late onset autoimmune diabetes in the adult (LADA) are at increased macrovascular risk despite a "healthier" risk profile as compared to patients with type 2 diabetes. It appears, that especially in "younger" populations inflammation and plaques composition are main triggers for adverse outcome, since atherosclerotic plaques with thin fibrous caps and large necrotic cores are clearly associated with cardiovascular events and death. In this context, fibrinogen was recently found to be inversely associated with intraplaque hemorrhage- and necrotic core-volume, independently of inflammation. Fernández-Friera et al. lately described that arterial inflammation is highly prevalent in middle-aged individuals with known subclinical atherosclerosis, and thus may trigger early cardiovascular events.

Our results are in line with previous outcome studies which predominantly investigated the role of carotid intima media thickness in patients at cardiovascular risk. There have also been reports that information about the presence of carotid atherosclerosis can be used for the prediction of outcome in patient with coronary artery disease and that the combined assessment of IMT and interadventitia common carotid artery diameter is useful to stratify a patient's individual cardiovascular risk profile. However, our study oversees a 12-year period of follow-up and provides robust data on long term outcome in patients with prevalent or advanced carotid atherosclerosis among a well-defined cohort.

Diabetes as well as carotid atherosclerosis are frequently referred to as "silent killers" and our study not only confirms, but also emphasizes the strong additive effect of both risk factors. The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in patients older than 60 years is high and the same holds true for diabetes. Based on our data, we believe that a screening method for subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes might be a useful tool for risk stratification. According to the current guidelines of the American Diabetes Association for Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management, screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus and a high risk profile for cardiovascular disease, is currently not recommended. This is mainly attributed to the screening methods for coronary artery disease which are costly, often risky for the patient, time-consuming and require certain infrastructure. On the contrary, the performance of an ultrasound investigation of the carotid arteries is simple, cost-effective and does not pose any risk to the patient.

Discussion

Our study found a clear association between the presence of carotid atherosclerosis and mortality among diabetic patients. In a combined assessment, we identified that subjects with diabetes and asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥ 50% are at an exceptional high risk for adverse outcome. If a patient at time of inclusion was diagnosed with both diabetes mellitus and carotid stenosis above 50%, the patient had only a ~ 20% chance to survive the following 12 years. These findings are more than alarming, considering that the whole cohort had a survival rate of ~ 50%. Further, diabetic patients with carotid stenosis ≥ 50% had a near 2.5-fold increase in risk of cardiovascular death compared to non-diabetic patients with carotid atherosclerosis below 50% narrowing. These latter findings were independent of various established cardiovascular risk factors or previous cerebro- or cardiovascular events. We further identified that combining carotid stenosis with diabetes mellitus improved the risk stratification by near 40% for the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, respectively. In contrast, the clinical diagnosis diabetes mellitus, based on hba1c and serum glucose levels alone, displayed a highly significant, but rather weak association with (cardiovascular) mortality in patients in asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis after 12-years of follow-up.

### Hunting for a coronary artery disease diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus: if, how and when [^7e29fb08]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with T2DM. It is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, including atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (ACAD), carotid artery disease, and lower extremity artery disease (LEAD). To mitigate the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, it is essential to manage glucose levels effectively, alongside controlling atherosclerotic risk factors through lifestyle changes and pharmacological interventions. Moreover, the timely detection of CVD, including ACAD, LEAD, and carotid artery disease, is critical for individuals with T2DM.

The PADDIA/CADDIA survey, an European medical research collaboration, evaluated the current management and screening practices for ACAD and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in individuals with T2DM across Europe, using the 2013 ESC/EASD (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes) guidelines as a benchmark.

One major point of debate of the survey was when physicians should screen for ACAD, carotid artery disease, or LEAD. Among the six potential answers for each question, the majority of physicians (58% to 79%) reported that they screen for CVD only when symptoms suggestive of CVD are present. A smaller proportion of physicians (29%, 32%, and 37%) would consider screening all patients with T2DM for ACAD, carotid artery disease, and LEAD, respectively.

The effectiveness and methods for detecting silent ACAD are still subjects of debate.

The aim of our review is to shed light on the rationale, if any, for the screening of asymptomatic ACAD and to determine the most effective method to use.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to patients with other vascular diseases, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to implement the same diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategies (medical, surgical, or endovascular) in patients with diabetes and carotid artery disease or aortic aneurysm as in patients without diabetes.

### The utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying severe coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of coronary artery disease [^82c3f8b0]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of death in diabetic patients and once it has developed, diabetic patients have worse outcome as compared with nondiabetic patients. One reason for this is the difficulty of early diagnosis of CAD. Many cases of coronary atherosclerosis develop without symptoms, especially in diabetic patients. It is reported that in patients with development of ischemic heart disease, frequency of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is approximately three-times to six-times higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. According to Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetes study, as much as 22% of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients aged 50–70 years were revealed to have SMI when they were screened for myocardial ischemia with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Therefore, early detection of asymptomatic severe CAD and rapid intervention are important to reduce mortality in the management of diabetes.

Sophisticated cardiac study such as exercise electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, and coronary angiography can determine disease severity with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. However, it is unrealistic to screen for SMI with these tools in all diabetic patients, because these tests are limited by the potential of significant adverse effects, technical difficulty, availability, and cost. Therefore, a noninvasive and inexpensive risk prediction tool of SMI is required for identifying individuals at high-risk for CAD.

Cardiovascular risk assessment based on conventional risk factors is recommended for predicting cardiovascular risk, although validation studies showed moderate performance. However, carotid intima media thickness (IMT) has been shown to be a reliable marker of risk for CAD and cardiovascular events in previous studies. Moreover, measurement of carotid IMT with high-resolution ultrasound can be assessed quickly, noninvasively, and inexpensively. Some studies have shown that carotid IMT could improve the prediction ability for cardiovascular disease over and above conventional coronary risk factors. These findings suggest that measurement of carotid IMT could be useful for identifying individuals at high-risk for CAD who should undergo SMI screening tests.

In this study, we investigated the usefulness of carotid IMT for identifying severe CAD equivalent to coronary revascularization based on the cross-sectional analysis in 333 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients who underwent screening tests for SMI.

### Signs of subclinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients at increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^9eeaeb10]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

We aimed to study carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) in asymptomatic patients with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in a pre-diabetic state.

Methods

Diabetes risk assessment was performed in 2420 participants in a voluntary screening program between 2011 and 2013. The risk of T2DM was estimated by the Findrisc scoring system (FR). A FR ≥ 12 was considered as increased risk. HbA1c% between 5.7 and 6.4% signified a pre-diabetic state. Carotid duplex scan was performed and CIMT above 0.9 mm was regarded as pathological. Patients with T2DM or a history of cardiovascular disease were excluded.

Results

Overall 1475 subjects were included. Four groups were compared: "control" (normal HbA1c, FR < 12), "HbA1c only" (HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%, FR < 12), "Findrisc only" (normal HbA1c, FR ≥ 12) and "combined" (HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%, FR ≥ 12). Frequency of pathological maximal CIMT was 9.4%, 19.7%, 27.4% and 36.4% in the groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to control subjects, sex and risk factor-adjusted Odds Ratios for the presence of pathological maximal CIMT were 2.2 (p < 0.001), 3.4 (p < 0.001) and 5.1 (p < 0.001) for the groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Evaluation of Findrisc score and HbA1c at population level may facilitate early recognition of subclinical vascular complications even in the pre-diabetic state.

Preclinical Atherosclerosis Evaluation (Vascular Ultrasound)

The identification of preclinical atherosclerosis using carotid ultrasound has been shown to be correlated with cardiovascular events in T2D. In the general population, showing the ultrasound results to patients with preclinical atherosclerosis improves cardiovascular risk at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Moreover, the identification of carotid plaques by carotid ultrasound in T1D has caused clinicians to intensify cardioprotective treatment.

Carotid ultrasound is performed to check for the presence of plaque and assess the carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT). A standardized protocol for image acquisition is used, as described elsewhere.

The presence of carotid plaque is defined as focal echo structures that encroach into the arterial lumen with an IMT ≥ 1.5 mm or involve at least 50% of the surrounding IMT, as measured from the media–adventitia interface to the intima–lumen surface. Data on the mean and maximum C-IMT values of the common carotid artery, bulb, and right and left internal carotid arteries as well as data on the presence of plaques (i.e. location and maximum height) are collected (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Acquisition of carotid ultrasound for the evaluation of preclinical atherosclerosis

The following patients with T1D and no history of CVD are eligible for the assessment of preclinical atherosclerosis by carotid ultrasound:

Indications for Additional Complementary Tests

According to the latest clinical guidelines, systematic screening for silent ischaemic heart disease is not recommended as it does not improve the prognosis compared to the appropriate treatment of different cardiovascular risk factors.

However, in some selected patients with T1D, additional complementary explorations may be indicated to more accurately stratify cardiovascular risk.

Prevalence and detection of coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetes

CAD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D. Previously, T2D was considered a CAD equivalent by European and American guidelines implying a high (> 20%) 10-year CV risk for all patients with T2D. However, the validity of this assumption has been questioned in recent years based on data indicating the potentially wide heterogeneity in CV risk among T2D patients. For example, a meta-analysis by Bulugahapitiya et al. included 45,108 patients and revealed a 43% lower risk of developing CAD in patients with T2D without prior myocardial infarction (MI) as compared to patients without T2D with previous MI. Given this heterogeneity, various studies have been performed utilizing methods such as nuclear imaging, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and exercise stress-testing, to evaluate the impact of non-invasive screening for CAD in asymptomatic patients with T2D. According to these studies, the estimates of CAD prevalence in asymptomatic patients with T2D vary widely with results ranging from 8 to 50%. For example, the DIAD study showed that 22% of patients had abnormal stress myocardial perfusion imaging whereas Rajagopalan et al. found that 58% of asymptomatic patients with T2D patients had abnormal SPECT imaging.

Importantly, surrogate markers of CAD obtained from non-invasive testing carry important prognostic information in asymptomatic individuals with T2D, including coronary artery calcium (CAC) by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), carotid atherosclerosis and plaques, and aortic stiffness. Despite this and the diverging results of occult CAD prevalence, current guidelines do not recommend universal screening for CAD among patients with T2D, partly based on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) studies showing that a sizeable proportion of patients (25–30%) do not have demonstrable plaque on CTA. The ABCD trial is the first trial to date to perform invasive IVUS imaging, a gold-standard technique for evaluation of CAD, in asymptomatic patients with T2D and reveals a CAD prevalence of 84%, indicating a significantly higher burden of disease than previously assumed. Given the increased vulnerability observed in coronary plaques in subjects with diabetes and CAD this prevalence is important to consider. Current guidelines although differentiating their recommendations for choice of glucose lowering medication according to the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, do however not consider prevalent occult CAD in T2D patients and a refined accurate estimate of risk and disease prevalence is warranted in an effort to improve the applicability and validity of T2D management guidelines.

Results

Study population

A total of 1363 patients were enrolled in the study. Ninety-five (7%) of these patients had missing duplex ultrasound follow-up data, and 203 patients (16%) were lost to clinical follow-up, leaving 1065 patients for the final analysis. The 298 patients who had to be excluded did not significantly differ from the patients who were included in terms of baseline and demographic parameters (data not shown).

In total, 1065 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age was 69 years (IQR 61–76 years) at the time of inclusion and 668 (62.7%) were male (Table 1). Within a period of 11.9 years (IQR 6.0–12.4 years), we recorded 548 (51.5%) deaths from any cause. Of these, 367 patients (67%) died from cardiovascular causes, 142 (13.3%) of malignant diseases, and 45 (4.2%) of other causes.

Guidelines Recommendations for screening CAD in asymptomatic patients

The 2024 American Diabetes Association Guidelines section of Cardiovascular disease and risk management suggest that routine screening for ACAD is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals, as it does not improve outcomes when ACAD risk factors are properly managed, and consider investigating ACAD if any of the following are present: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of associated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, PAD, or electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g. Q waves) Table 2.

Table 2
Guidelines about screening ACAD in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes

Entries in bold correspond to the key information

According to these guidelines, screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals at high risk is not recommended, partly because these individuals should already be receiving intensive medical therapy, which provides benefits similar to those of invasive revascularization. There is also evidence suggesting that silent ischemia may resolve over time, which adds to the controversy surrounding aggressive screening strategies. In prospective studies, coronary artery calcium has been identified as an independent predictor of future ACAD events in individuals with diabetes, and it consistently outperforms both the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine and the Framingham Risk Score in predicting risk in this population.

The 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of CV disease in patients with diabetes suggest that in diabetic patients with asymptomatic ASCVD (including documented ACAD confirmed by imaging) and elevated CV risk, the potential benefit of platelet inhibition with aspirin (ASA) may be greater, making it important to tailor therapy to the individual.

The 2024 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for Chronic Coronary Syndromes suggest about screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals when coronary artery calcification findings from prior chest CT scans are available. It may be beneficial to use these findings to improve risk stratification and guide the management of modifiable risk factors, (level of evidence IIa class C); CACS could be considered to enhance risk classification at treatment decision thresholds; Total risk estimation using a risk-estimation system such as SCORE is recommended for asymptomatic adults > 40 years of age without evidence of CVD (level of evidence I class C). CACS may be considered to improve risk classification around treatment decision thresholds (level of evidence IIb, class C).

Subclinical atherosclerosis as a tool to refine CV stratification

While risk scores and biomarkers reflect a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood of developing CVD, imaging tests for atherosclerosis seek to measure disease directly in its subclinical stage. As such, imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis can integrate all of a patient's risk determinants — ranging from genetic to environmental to modifiable — into a single measure of disease and vulnerability (tissue impact) in the vascular bed of interest. Decades have studies have shown discordance between risk scores and subclinical disease burden, as some patients with no risk factors can have advanced disease, and some patients with multiple risk factors can live to old age without any detectable plaque. Across all risk scores ever tested, adding imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis substantial improve risk discrimination. Imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis tend to perform best in lower risk patients with risk modifiers or in intermediate risk patients where treatment decisions remain uncertain. The CAC score, which provides a measure of coronary plaque using non-contrast cardiac-gated CT, is the most researched tool for CV risk stratification and receives a Class IIA recommendation from many guidelines. Beyond its prognostic value, CAC scoring has several practical clinical applications. CAC = 0 is associated with very low short-to-intermediate term risk, and in such cases, it may be reasonable to defer pharmacologic interventions, focusing instead on lifestyle optimization, unless other high-risk features are present. A CAC score between 1 and 99 indicates subclinical atherosclerosis and may justify initiating or intensifying statin therapy in patients with borderline or intermediate estimated risk. Scores between 100 and 299 identify individuals at high risk, for whom guideline-directed therapies, including high-intensity statins, aggressive modifiable risk-factor control, and possibly aspirin in selected cases, should be strongly considered. CAC ≥ 300 reflects a very high-risk profile, akin to patients with established CAD, warranting comprehensive secondary-prevention-level therapy and closer clinical follow-up.

In the 2025 ESC/EAS focused update on dyslipidaemias, an increased CAC score is explicitly recognised as a risk modifier in individuals at moderate cardiovascular risk or those near treatment decision thresholds, helping to improve risk stratification (Class IIa, Level of evidence B).

However, other imaging tools are also effect. Carotid ultrasound, particularly when interpreted as a carotid plaque score, is a strong predictor of risk. Total plaque burden by coronary CTA is also an emerging tool in asymptomatic patients, particularly with new protocols that decrease ionizing radiation and AI-tools that automate volumetric quantification of non-calcified and calcified total coronary plaque burden.

### Carotid atherosclerosis progression and cerebrovascular events in patients with diabetes [^fe74ed0e]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

Carotid atherosclerosis progression is associated with a higher risk of cerebrovascular events but there is no specific data for diabetes. We assessed in a cohort of patients with diabetes the rate of atherosclerosis progression by Doppler ultrasonography and the association with cerebrovascular events.

Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 342 patients with a mean duration of diabetes of 13.6 ± 10.6 years. The mean delay between the first and last Doppler ultrasonography was 6.4 ± 4.6 years, with a mean of 3.4 examinations per person. Cerebrovascular events were noted.

Results

A progression of carotid atherosclerosis was observed in 20.1% of cases. No factor was significantly associated with progression. A prophylactic carotid endarterectomy was performed on 6 of the 27 patients with a stenosis ≥ 50%. A cerebrovascular event occurred in 1.2% of patients; none of them had carotid atherosclerosis progression.

Conclusions

Carotid atherosclerosis progression in patients with diabetes is frequent but surgical treatment and cerebrovascular events are low. The benefit of a systematic follow-up of carotid atherosclerosis seems limited.

### Incremental predictive value of carotid ultrasonography in the assessment of coronary risk in a cohort of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic subjects [^dd9b5bdd]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Consensus guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk assessment as the initial step of primary prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incremental predictive value for coronary events conferred by carotid ultrasonography in addition to risk assessment by Framingham score and screening for silent myocardial ischemia in a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

We prospectively studied 229 patients free of any cardiovascular complication with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. At baseline, all patients had an exercise treadmill test, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement, and coronary risk assessment by Framingham score. Cardiovascular events were registered during a 5-year follow-up period.

Results

Age, carotid IMT, carotid plaques, number of risk factors, Framingham score, and suboptimal exercise electrocardiogram were associated with incident cardiovascular events (P < 0.05). Carotid IMT was an independent predictor of cardiovascular events (P = 0.045). The predictive value for coronary events was similar for carotid IMT and Framingham score as assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. An improvement in risk prediction was conferred by addition of carotid IMT in a Cox model (global chi(2) increased from 14.1 to 18.1, P = 0.035).

Conclusions

This prospective study confirms that carotid IMT is a marker of cardiovascular risk in this type 2 diabetic cohort, establishes that carotid IMT provides a similar predictive value for coronary events than Framingham score, and suggests that the combination of these two indexes significantly improves risk prediction for these patients.

Carotid artery disease

Approximately 10%–20% of thromboembolic stroke is thought to be from significant extracranial carotid artery disease. Generally, significant stenosis refers to a > 50% stenosis estimated using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method. In clinical trials, patients are often stratified to 50%–69% stenosis and 70%–99% stenosis. Revascularisation is not indicated for a near-occluded or occluded carotid artery. A carotid stenosis is defined as 'symptomatic' if there is ischaemic symptoms within preceding 6 months. Abnormalities on brain imaging studies without symptoms are generally not considered 'symptomatic'.

Early revascularisation is well-established as the standard of care for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (figure 2). Multiple randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have consistently found carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to be superior to medical therapy alone in this population. Clinical features associated with higher benefits from CEA are more severe carotid lesions (70%–99%), male sex, older age (> 75 years) and hemispheric and cortical strokes (as opposed to retinal or lacunar strokes). The benefits of CEA are greatest within 14 days of the ischaemic event and decline as time passes.

Figure 2
Diagnostic algorithm for patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. *Symptoms of stroke/transient ischaemic attack within 6 months.

The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is more controversial. Early trials found better outcomes with CEA compared with medical therapy for significant carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. However, medical therapy has evolved greatly since the 1990s and early 2000s when there were little statin use, no antithrombotic option other than aspirin and no specific goal for treating blood pressure and diabetes. Lacking newer data, the ESC/ESVS guideline only recommends revascularisation in asymptomatic patients with 60%–99% who have additional risk factors, such as a history of contralateral transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction or anatomically high-risk findings on imaging (lipid-rich core or intraplaque haemorrhage on MRA, large echolucent and hypoechogenic plaque on ultrasound or rapid stenosis progression) (Figure 3). The ongoing CREST-2 (carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke) trial will help determine whether CEA, carotid artery stenting (CAS) or modern medical therapy is the best strategy for patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis.

### The utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying severe coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of coronary artery disease [^1939724d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Third, among 55 subjects with SMI, 6 patients rejected coronary CT angiography and coronary angiography. In this study, they were classified into the nonsevere CAD group, because our purpose was to examine whether carotid IMT is useful as a screening test for asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with severe CAD equivalent to revascularization therapy. However, the results of statistical analyses did not change even though these six patients were excluded.

Fourth, previous studies have shown that the natural history, patterns of risk factors, and the prediction of cardiac and cerebral events are different for "carotid plaque," which is a focal structure encroaching into the arterial lumen, and the "traditional IMT," which is measured in a region free of plaque, whereas both share some common atherosclerosis risk factors. In European countries, it is recommended that measurement of IMT should be performed in a region free of plaque and the distinction between IMT and plaque should be clearly made. However, the Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine recommends that measurement of IMT should be performed at the site of greatest thickness, including plaque lesions. A few studies performed in Japan adopted this method and reported that this IMT was useful as a marker for cardiovascular events and CAD. The current study was performed in Japan and the IMT was measured at the site of greatest thickness including plaque lesions according to Japanese guideline. As a result, in 88% cases of all measurements, maximum IMT represented plaque lesion. Thus, the definition of maximum IMT in our study and those of previous studies are different, and it would not be appropriate to make a simple comparison between our findings and previous ones. Interestingly, the results of our study indicates that maximum IMT including plaque lesion and the number of carotid plaques were both useful for identifying severe CAD (AUC, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively). On the contrary, even when measurement of mean IMT was performed, whether in a region free of plaque, the prediction ability of mean IMT was relatively poor (AUC, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively). These findings seem to be consistent with previous reports suggesting that presence of plaque was more strongly associated with cardiovascular events than "traditional IMT" excluding plaque lesion.

Carotid CIMT reporting — communication and reference ranges: Study results should be provided to the ordering provider in an understandable and clinically applicable fashion, and the report should clearly identify the type of study being performed, state that it is not a replacement for a clinically indicated carotid duplex ultrasound, and that the results do not indicate the presence or absence of clinically significant obstruction, unless noted otherwise. Because semiautomated border detection programs tend to produce somewhat thicker CIMT values than seen with manual tracing, their use should be considered by the reader when making recommendations, and current ultrasound instrumentation and digital imaging also provide better resolution, which may make CIMT values somewhat smaller. Communication of CIMT results is facilitated by qualitatively describing broad ranges of percentiles, which avoids the appearance of greater precision than is achievable when mapping CIMT values to a reference population; reporting ranges helps mitigate differences across laboratories. The normative reference values used in the report must describe the same CIMT measurement (ie, mean or maximum) because these values differ substantially.

### The utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying severe coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of coronary artery disease [^e0cacc1b]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Although many studies have shown that carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), it remains inconclusive whether assessment of carotid IMT is useful as a screening test for asymptomatic but severe CAD in diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 333 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of CAD underwent exercise electrocardiogram or myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of silent myocardial ischemia, and those whose test results were positive were subjected to coronary computed tomography angiography or coronary angiography. The ability of carotid IMT to identify severe CAD corresponding to treatment with revascularization was examined by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.

Results

Among the 333 subjects, 17 were treated with revascularization. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that maximum IMT was an independent predictor of severe CAD even after adjustment for conventional risk factors. ROC curve analyses revealed that the addition of maximum IMT to conventional risk factors significantly improved the prediction ability for severe CAD (from area under the curve, 0.67 to 0.79; P = 0.039). The greatest sensitivity and specificity were obtained when the cut-off value of maximum IMT was set at 2.45 mm (pretest probability, 5%; posttest probability, 11%; sensitivity, 71%). When we applied age-specific cut-off values, the sensitivity of screening further increased in both the nonelderly (pretest probability, 6%; posttest probability, 10%; sensitivity, 100%) and the elderly subjects (pretest probability, 5%; posttest probability, 15%; sensitivity, 100%).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that carotid maximum IMT is useful for screening asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with severe CAD equivalent to revascularization.

When we applied age-specific cut-off values, the sensitivity of screening further increased in both the nonelderly (pretest probability, 6%; posttest probability, 10%; sensitivity, 100%) and the elderly subjects (pretest probability, 5%; posttest probability, 15%; sensitivity, 100%).

CONCLUSIONS

Our study suggests that carotid maximum IMT is useful for screening asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with severe CAD equivalent to revascularization.

Diabetes mellitus in carotid atherosclerosis — An elevated fasting glucose level was associated with an increased risk for stroke in patients with carotid atherosclerosis, but despite achieving hemoglobin A1c levels < 6.5%, no reduction in stroke risk was identified in trials of tight control. Glucose control to nearly normoglycemic levels (target hemoglobin A1c < 7%) is recommended among diabetic patients to reduce microvascular complications and, with lesser certainty, macrovascular complications other than stroke.

### Usefulness of carotid plaques as predictors of obstructive coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals with diabetes mellitus [^ac43187d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement and carotid plaque detection by B-mode ultrasound are frequently used as surrogates to predict coronary artery disease (CAD). However, their systematic use in routine clinical management of asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) has not been studied. The aim of the study was to identify carotid parameters that predict cardiovascular events in patients with asymptomatic type 2 DM by evaluating the relation between carotid disease and CAD. This multicenter, observational, prospective study included 259 asymptomatic patients with type 2 DM followed-up for 34 months after measurement of CIMT and carotid plaque with carotid ultrasound, and CAD assessment with computed tomography coronary angiography. Statistically significant differences between patients with and without carotid plaque were found for coronary plaque > 50% stenosis (59 vs 36, p = 0.02). Greater maximal CIMT was associated with an increased risk of coronary plaque > 50% (odds ratio 1.21 [1.02, 1.44], p = 0.03) and > 70% stenosis (odds ratio 1.23 [1.01, 1.50], p = 0.04) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. At 34-month follow-up, the occurrence of total major adverse cardiovascular event was estimated to be 7.1% (mean age 68 years, 6% male and 1.1% female) in the whole study population. The subgroup of patients with carotid plaque showed increased incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event compared with patients with no carotid plaque (p = 0.005). In conclusion, carotid plaque was a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events and may be a prognostic marker in asymptomatic patients with type 2 DM. Carotid plaque and maximal intima-media thickness were independently associated with obstructive CAD.

### The case against identifying carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients [^3144531b]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Carotid ultrasonography is performed frequently to identify carotid stenosis in patients with no history of carotid-territory cerebrovascular ischemia. The premises of such testing are that the potential benefit of endarterectomy or stenting exceeds the potential harm in patients with asymptomatic stenosis and that discovery of asymptomatic stenosis may trigger beneficial changes in lifestyle or medical management that otherwise would not have occurred. However, given low contemporary rates of stroke in medically managed patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, invasive carotid procedures cannot be justified in this population. Moreover, among patients at increased cardiovascular risk, there is no evidence that carotid imaging motivates behavioral change or improves risk stratification beyond consideration of conventional risk factors. In this focused review, we address topics that should help health care professionals advise patients who inquire about carotid screening and patients in whom asymptomatic carotid stenosis has already been identified. We conclude that there is currently no role for carotid imaging in patients without a history of carotid-territory stroke or transient ischemic attack.

### Sonographic carotid plaque morphologic characteristics and vascular risk factors: results from a population study [^c68a2345]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of vascular risk factors in atherosclerosis development is well established, whereas risk factors involved in determining plaque vulnerability are still a matter of debate. We investigated the vascular risk factor distribution in patients with carotid plaques.

Methods

We consecutively assessed sonographic plaque morphologic characteristics, the degree of stenosis, and the common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) in 1655 patients. Demographic data, a documented history of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and the presence of vascular risk factors were collected. According to literature, heterogeneous hypoechoic plaques with an irregular surface or ulcerations and those with a severe degree of stenosis (≥ 70%) have been considered "complex" plaques at "major" risk of stroke; homogeneous hyperechoic plaques with smooth surface lesions have been considered "simple" plaques at minor risk.

Results

Univariate analysis showed that all vascular risk factors were associated with the presence of carotid atherosclerotic lesions. Multiple logistic regression showed an independent association of hypertension and diabetes with complex plaques, which also had a thicker IMT. A history of CVD was observed more frequently in complex plaques, which had a higher stenosis percentage even after patients with a severe degree of stenosis (≥ 70%) and indications for carotid surgery were excluded.

Conclusions

Hypertension and diabetes are related to a thicker IMT and more severe complex plaques, which may reflect the instability of atherosclerotic process. Because two-thirds of the patients with complex plaques were asymptomatic for CVD, this raises the importance of surveillance sonography to monitor plaque evolution for prevention of symptomatic CVD.

### The peripheral atherosclerotic profile in patients with type 1 diabetes warrants a thorough vascular assessment of asymptomatic patients [^23e13bac]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Epidemiological data on subclinical atherosclerotic disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) are scarce. We aimed to estimate the subclinical atherosclerosis profile of asymptomatic patients with DM1 and an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI).

Material and Methods

In a cross-sectional design (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02910271), we estimated ABI in 289 consecutive asymptomatic patients with DM1. An abnormal ABI led to measurements of toe-brachial index (TBI) and peripheral doppler ultrasound (DUS) to diagnose peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or atherosclerotic carotid plaques (ACP).

Results

A reduced (≤ 0.9) or increased (> 1.2) ABI was detected in 17 (6%) and 75 (26%) patients, respectively. PAD was confirmed by TBI and DUS in 9 (53%) patients with a reduced ABI and 28 (37%) patients with an increased ABI, resulting in a 12.8% (9.4–17.2) prevalence of asymptomatic PAD. Fourteen patients with an abnormal ABI also exhibited ACP [4.8% (2.9–7.9)], with 64% of these patients showing bilateral disease. Artery stenosis was mild or moderate in 21% and 29% of patients, respectively. Thus, 46 [16% (12–21)] patients showed asymptomatic PAD, ACP, or both. According to our data, we would have to explore three asymptomatic patients with DM1 and normal pulses to unmask one case of PAD, and seven asymptomatic patients showing abnormal ABI values to detect one carotid disease.

Conclusions

Peripheral artery disease is often undiagnosed in asymptomatic patients with DM1. However, its presence may change medical management in a substantial percentage of cases, highlighting the potential benefit of a thorough vascular assessment on these patients.

### The utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying severe coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of coronary artery disease [^bc5c8e99]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It has been thought that carotid IMT is associated with future risk for cardiovascular disease, but it remains controversial whether measurement of carotid IMT is clinically useful as a screening test for CAD. Our study showed that the addition of maximum IMT to conventional coronary risk factors could substantially improve the prediction ability for severe CAD equivalent to coronary revascularization in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients. This finding suggests that measurement of carotid IMT in these patients is clinically useful for screening individuals at high-risk for severe CAD.

It has been reported that in healthy populations, 2.5–10% of middle-aged men have asymptomatic but active CAD. In diabetic patients, the prevalence of SMI determined by noninvasive imaging is reported to be 12–31% (,–). In this study, we found that the prevalence of abnormal SMI screening findings was 17% in our asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, which was consistent with the previous findings. It should be noted that many of them had coronary arteriosclerosis; 75% of them were revealed to have significant coronary artery stenosis (≥ 50%) by subsequent coronary CT angiography or coronary angiography, and 31% of them actually were treated with revascularization (Fig. 1). Therefore, it would be clinically worthwhile to screen patients with asymptomatic CAD (especially those who should be treated with revascularization) in the management of diabetes, although the utility in identifying severe but asymptomatic CAD is still debated.

First, we confirmed that maximum IMT was significantly associated with severe CAD equivalent to revascularization. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that maximum IMT was an independent predictor of severe CAD in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of CAD. Next, we evaluated the incremental effect of adding maximum IMT to the conventional risk factors for identifying severe CAD by ROC curves. The predictive abilities of CCA, carotid bulb ICA, and combined maximum IMT (CCA or carotid bulb ICA, whichever is greater) estimated by the AUC were 0.62, 0.72, and 0.74, respectively. These results suggest that carotid bulb ICA maximum IMT is more closely associated with severe CAD rather than CCA maximum IMT, and that combined maximum IMT most directly reflects it. Taken together, our findings are consistent with previous reports showing that the ICA IMT is more useful for predicting cardiovascular events than mean IMT. The AUC significantly increased after the addition of maximum IMT to conventional risk factors, suggesting that maximum IMT substantially improves the prediction ability of severe CAD in these patients (Fig. 2 A).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Medium credibility.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) testing — patient selection and risk interpretation: Measuring CIMT and identifying carotid plaque can be useful for refining cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment in patients at intermediate CVD risk (ie, patients with a 6%-20% 10-year risk) and might be considered for those with family history of premature CVD, individuals younger than 60 years old with a single severe risk factor who otherwise would not be candidates for pharmacotherapy, or women younger than 60 years old with at least two CVD risk factors. This test can be considered when the aggressiveness of therapy is uncertain, and imaging should not be performed unless results would be expected to alter therapy. The presence of carotid plaque or CIMT greater than or equal to 75th percentile for age and sex, and race/ethnicity indicates increased CVD risk and may signify the need for more aggressive risk-reduction interventions, while serial CIMT studies to address progression or regression are not recommended.

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque

Carotid-wall intima-media thickness (CIMT) is the distance from the lumen-intima interface to the media-adventitia interface of the artery wall, determined by a carotid artery ultrasound. CMIT is a surrogate marker for new acute myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals above 65 years old, when maximal IMT is above 1.11 mm, both in common and in internal carotid arteries. Increased CIMT above 1 mm is also predictive for CHD in younger individuals without previous cardiovascular events. The addition of maximal CMIT measurement of the internal carotid to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) only modestly (7.6% p < 0.001) improves its accuracy for predicting cardiovascular events. In patients with T2DM, CMIT above 1.9 mm is predictive of coronary artery stenosis, improving the FRS and UKPDS risk engine scores accuracy in Japanese population. Interestingly, CMIT seems to perform better in obese than in lean T2DM patients.

A carotid plaque is defined as the thickness of the intima above 1.0 mm, 1.1 mm or even 1.5 mm. The total plaque area determination is a simple and highly reproducible method to quantify atherosclerosis. It improves significantly the sensitivity of FRS as a screening tool to reclassify intermediate and high risk in non-diabetic patients. In asymptomatic patients with T2DM, the sum of the maximum plaque thickness above 1.1 mm from both sides of the carotid wall carotid plaque, increases the predictive value for detecting coronary stenosis greater than 50% (obstructive CAD). This seems to be independent of age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and HbA1c.

Although promising, CIMT and carotid plaque detection are currently not recommended for routine use for risk assessment by AHA/ACC 2013 guidelines. The panel considers that additional research is needed to quantify the cost effectiveness and the impact of imaging for subclinical atherosclerosis on cardiovascular risk factor management and patient outcomes.

Carotid disease in the absence of CAD

Interestingly, almost one-third of subjects in our study who did not have CAD were found to have carotid artery plaque on carotid ultrasound. This represents a potentially intriguing subgroup, as these subjects are low risk — by virtue of their absence of CAD — from a coronary perspective but may have elevated cerebrovascular risk, especially since diabetes itself is also a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. A similar population of patients — with carotid atherosclerosis but without coronary disease — was described in a recent paper by Cohen et al. who demonstrated that, in a cohort of 150 predominantly non-diabetic patients referred for coronary CTA, 52% (33 of 63) of those without any CAD on coronary CTA had carotid plaque.

The exact clinical implications of this finding, however, remain unclear, and data are mixed as to whether carotid plaque represents a significant cerebrovascular risk factor in diabetics above and beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, as associations between carotid plaque and stroke often do not retain statistical significance in multivariate models or do so only in certain subsets of patients. Carotid atherosclerosis may also herald atherosclerosis in other vascular beds, and this population may be at increased risk of developing incident cardiovascular disease other than stroke. Thus, future studies are warranted regarding the prognostic implications of having carotid plaque in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis.

Other markers of risk

Our data also show higher prevalence of CAD in subjects on insulin therapy and an association between the presence of CAD and both insulin use and duration of diabetes. Subjects receiving insulin and those who had carried a diagnosis of diabetes for a longer period of time had greater prevalence of CAD, and insulin use was the most specific single clinical characteristic for the presence of coronary disease. Insulin use has previously been associated with a greater extent of coronary disease in diabetics, and duration of diabetes has also been associated with worse clinical outcomes. However, these two characteristics are rarely highlighted as part of a practical, clinical approach to risk stratification, despite the presence of a potential pathophysiological link and potential clinical utility of those findings.

### Carotid Doppler findings of high risk group of stroke… [^dad797c4]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Carotid Doppler Findings of High Risk Group of StrokeClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Atherosclerosis of carotid arteries is a common serious condition that develops when sticky plaque builds up inside carotid arteries that deliver blood to brain, so carotid artery diseases cause about 10–20 percent of strokes which is a medical emergency that can leave the brain with permanent damage. Doppler sonography of the cervical segment of carotid arteries is a popular non-invasive tool for evaluation of anatomy and hemodynamics of carotid artery, its ability to measure intimal media thickening and characterizes the morphology of carotid atheroma makes it a reliable modality to determine the etiology and severity of stroke.

Carotid intimal media thickening is measured as the distance between the leading edges of the two echogenic layers of the wall using the posterior wall, in addition color Doppler ultrasonography permits measurement of flow based on reflection of ultrasound waves utilizing both pulse Doppler and color Doppler ultrasound. Visualization of color coded flow information about direction and velocity, so with high grade lesions are more easily detected with color than with pulsed Doppler ultrasound although the later allows direct estimation of flow velocity The peak systolic velocity is used for quantification of stenosis, however end diastolic velocity, carotid index and spectral wave form analysis are also used for assessment of stenosis. Also, color integration is used to identify areas of abnormal flow.

There are a number of pitfalls when using velocity based estimation of ICA stenosis, such as higher velocities in females, and elevated velocities where there's contra lateral carotid artery occlusion. If there is a severe tortuosity of an artery, high carotid bifurcation, obesity, or extensive calcification of the vasculature, these will reduce the sonographic accuracy; if carotid artery stents are already in situ, vessel wall compliance can be diminished accelerating flow velocity. Ultrasound may also be unable to distinguish between partial and complete vessel occlusion, despite the distinction being critically clinically important. In this study we present analysis of findings of carotid ultrasound examination among patients with clinical suspicion and risk for cerebrovascular diseases in New Valley. Ultrasonography in this study is used to measure intimal thickening as well as flow characteristics of carotid artery with focus on internal carotid artery.

The most common variant to this anatomy is the common origin of brachiocephalic and left CCA from aortic arch. The common carotid arteries bifurcate into the external carotid artery and internal carotid artery at the upper border of the thyroid. The carotid bulb is the location of a bifurcation and the ICA origin. ICA is generally posterior and lateral to ECA and is usually bigger in caliber compared to ECA. ECA supplies the musculature of face and neck and tapers distally giving off extra cranial branches. Coloured Doppler sonography using 5–10 MHZ multifrequency linear transducer, the scan is performed in both transverse and longitudinal dimensions. The patients are scanned in supine position on the examination table, the patient's head is turned away from the side and the neck a little extended. The examination is carried out either from the patient's Side or sitting at the patient's head. Coupling gel is applied on each side of the neck.

### The role of non-invasive imaging in the risk stratification of asymptomatic diabetic subjects [^745358a6]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. Patients often present with advanced and asymptomatic disease. Proposed strategies that may favourably affect CAD risk and outcomes in this patient population include identifying diabetic patients with subclinical disease at high risk of future cardiac events. The purpose of this article was to review the role of both atherosclerosis imaging tests (coronary calcium imaging and high-resolution ultrasound assessment of carotid intima-media thickness) and functional imaging techniques [stress echocardiography and radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)] in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of asymptomatic diabetic subjects.

Methods and Results

We identified studies using MEDLINE searches (1966 to April 2005) and by reviewing reference lists. A comprehensive list of search terms was applied. All stress echocardiography and MPI studies evaluating the prevalence and/or prognostic value of myocardial ischaemia (n = 19) and coronary calcium imaging studies (n = 2) evaluating the prognostic value of subclinical atherosclerosis in diabetic patients were included.

Conclusion

Asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia can be detected in a significant proportion of diabetic subjects by non-invasive imaging tests such as MPI and stress echocardiography. The results of ongoing and future studies may be helpful in guiding the selection of asymptomatic diabetic subjects to undergo non-invasive imaging, establishing the cost-effectiveness of various testing strategies and their impact on prognosis.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and patients

The study was carried out in the cardiovascular diseases and Internal Medicine departments of the Soavinandriana Hospital Center, Antananarivo, capital of Madagascar. These are reference departments for the management of cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases at the Hospital.

This was an analytical cross‐sectional retrospective study, conducted over a period of 2 years and 6 months from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2022. The study population consists of patients with T2DM seen in its departments. We included all known or newly diagnosed T2DM, benefited from a vascular Doppler ultrasound of the supra‐aortic trunks and presenting or not carotid atherosclerosis. We excluded from this study patients with incomplete medical records.

2.2 Determination of

Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); glycated haemoglobin ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) associated with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia. Type 2 typing was retained in view of the patient's age (> 35 years), overweight/obesity, family history of T2DM and the absence of obvious secondary causes (chronic pancreatitis, endocrinopathies, long‐term glucocorticoid use).

2.3 Determination of carotid atherosclerosis

The search for carotid atherosclerosis was done using a Mindray Resona I9® brand vascular doppler ultrasound with a high frequency linear probe (7.5 MHz). In order to measure the carotid intima‐media thickness (CIMT), longitudinal sections in 2D mode of the right and left common carotid arteries were taken 1–2 cm upstream of the carotid bifurcations.

Carotid plaque was defined as a focal structure encroaching into the arterial lumen or focal thickening of the surrounding wall > 50% or CIMT > 1.5 mm. Carotid atherosclerosis has been defined as the presence of carotid plaque or diffuse thickening of the carotid wall (mean CIMT ≥ 1.1 mm). The results were classified into three Strandness categories: normal (no atherosclerotic lesions), stenosis < 50% and stenosis ≥ 50%.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis in Korean type 2 diabetic patients [^c40a961d]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis in Type 2 diabetic patients.

Methods

This study included 406 patients aged 40–79 years with Type 2 diabetes (male 55.4%, female 44.6%). Both carotid arteries of each patient were examined by carotid duplex scanning. The duplex ultrasound criteria based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) measurement method were used for the identification of carotid stenosis.

Results

Extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis ≥ 40% by velocity criteria was detected in 5.2% of the patients. The prevalence of carotid stenosis increased with advancing age: 1.0% at 40–49 years of age, 5.0% at 50–59 years, 7.3% at 60–69 years and 9.5% at 70–79 years. The degree of stenosis was > 70% in 42.9% of patients with stenosis, Bilateral stenosis was detected in 14% of patients. Of the patients with ≥ 40% carotid stenosis, 33% had a decreased ankle-brachial index, 38% had a previous history of stroke, and only one patient (5%) had a documented history of coronary artery disease. Multivariate analysis, including variables determined to be significantly different by univariate analysis between patients with or without ≥ 40% stenosis, indicated that age, systolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (inverse correlation) were independent risk factors associated with carotid stenosis.

Conclusions

Carotid duplex scanning is a useful strategy in identifying carotid stenosis in older Type 2 diabetic patients with high systolic blood pressure, or low levels of HDL cholesterol. The early identification and subsequent appropriate management of carotid stenosis, particularly in this group of patients, may facilitate efforts to reduce the incidence of macrovascular complications.

### Use of imaging and clinical data to screen for cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic diabetics [^022ca782]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence to suggest that not all individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have equal risk for developing cardiovascular disease. We sought to compare the yield of testing for pre-clinical atherosclerosis with various approaches.

Methods

98 asymptomatic individuals with T2DM without known coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled in a prospective study and underwent carotid ultrasound, exercise treadmill testing (ETT), coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).

Results

Of 98 subjects (average age 55 ± 6, 64% female), 43 (44%) had coronary plaque detectable on CTA, and 38 (39%) had CAC score > 0. By CTA, 16 (16%) had coronary stenosis ≥ 50%, including three subjects with CAC = 0. Subjects with coronary plaque had greater prevalence of carotid plaque (58% vs. 38%, p = 0.01) and greater carotid intima media thickness (0.80 ± 0.20 mm vs. 0.70 ± 0.11 mm, p = 0.02). Notably, 18 of 55 subjects (33%) with normal CTA had carotid plaque. Eight subjects had a positive ETT, of whom five had ≥ 50% coronary stenosis, two had < 50% stenosis, and one had no CAD. Among these tests, CAC scoring had the highest sensitivity and specificity for prediction of CAD.

Conclusion

Among asymptomatic subjects with T2DM, a majority (56%) had no CAD by CTA. When compared to CTA, CAC was the most accurate screening modality for detection of CAD, while ETT and carotid ultrasound were less sensitive and specific. However, 33% of subjects with normal coronary CTA had carotid plaque, suggesting that screening for carotid plaque might better characterize stroke risk in such patients.

Hence, the identification of subclinical disease during the asymptomatic phase has emerged as a public health and economic objective. Cardiovascular risk assessment is generally recommended based on conventional risk factors. However, the predictive ability is only moderate, and a significant percentage of patients, irrespective of the conventional risk factors, present with subclinical atherosclerosis on DUS imaging along with coronary artery calcification. Although DUS screening of the carotid artery can identify potentially high-risk patients in whom subsequent MACE may occur, and some studies have assessed the association between CAS and MACE risk, the impact of both diabetes duration and CAS on the MACE risk of patients with T2DM without clinical CVD remains unclear. Furthermore, although previous studies had described the risk of MACE conferred by the presence and severity of CAS in blacks and whites, there are very few reports available for Asians. According to the data from the Department of Measurement and Health Information of the World Health Organization, there is a significant difference in the risk of MACE between different racial–ethnic groups; stroke is more prominent than MI in Asian general populations compared with Western general populations. Therefore, our findings may serve as novel data that could aid in the optimal surveillance and management of MACE risk in Asian patients with T2DM without clinical CVD.

Glucose intolerance and diabetes are risk factors for stroke and MI in Asia, as in Western countries. Although Asian populations are presently less obese than Western populations, the recent Westernization of dietary habits has resulted in increasing body mass index in most Asian countries. Moreover, the prevalence of glucose intolerance and diabetes may increase further. A large-scale meta-analysis project, the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration, showed that the HRs of diabetes for ischemic stroke and MI are similar for both Asian and Western countries. The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing throughout Asia, and the speed of increase is much faster than in Western countries. Trends in increased prevalence of diabetes and higher risks of diabetes-related MACE reported by several population-based studies showed the importance of the development of primary prevention programs for this vulnerable and fastest-growing higher-risk population in Asia. In our study, the degree of CAS, as detected by using carotid DUS screening, is a simple and noninvasive marker of subclinical atherosclerosis associated with an increased risk of MACE in patients with T2DM, without clinical CVD. Furthermore, DUS screening could be a valuable tool that can assist in cardiovascular risk stratification for the application of preventive strategies.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^77592504]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for selection of carotid imaging modalities — Carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) in an accredited vascular laboratory is the initial diagnostic imaging of choice for evaluating the severity of stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and unequivocal identification of stenosis of 50% to 99% in neurologically symptomatic patients or 70% to 99% in asymptomatic patients is sufficient to make a decision regarding intervention (GRADE I, Level of Evidence A). CDUS in an accredited vascular laboratory is the imaging modality of choice to screen asymptomatic populations at high risk (GRADE I, Level of Evidence B). When CDUS is nondiagnostic or suggests stenosis of intermediate severity (50% to 69%) in an asymptomatic patient, additional imaging with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is required before embarking on any intervention (GRADE I, Level of Evidence B). When evaluation of vessels proximal or distal to the cervical carotid arteries is needed for diagnosis or to plan therapy, imaging with CTA, MRA, or catheter angiography in addition to CDUS is indicated, and CTA is preferable to MR or MRA for delineating calcium.

### Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and the risk of ischemic stroke according to subtype in patients with clinical manifest arterial disease [^bfc4dbf9]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Because best medical treatment is improving, the risk of stroke in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) may decline. We evaluated the risk of ischemic stroke and stratified it according to stroke subtype in patients with ACAS during long-term follow-up.

Methods

In total, 4319 consecutive patients in the Second Manifestations of Arterial disease study with clinically manifest arterial disease or specific risk factors, but without a history of cerebrovascular disease, were included. Degree of stenosis was evaluated with duplex ultrasound scanning. Strokes during follow-up were classified according to subtype. Cox-proportional hazard-regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between ACAS and future stroke.

Results

We identified 293 (6.8%) patients with ACAS 50% to 99%, of whom 193 had 70% to 99% stenosis. In these subgroups, mean follow-up was 6.2 and 6.0 years, respectively. In total, 94 ischemic strokes occurred, of which 8 in ACAS 50% to 99% patients. The any territory annual ischemic stroke risk was 0.4% in 50% to 99% ACAS and 0.5% per year for 70% to 99% ACAS patients. The risk of ischemic stroke was not significantly increased in patients with ACAS 70% to 99% (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.7–3.5). Patients with ACAS 50% to 99% and ACAS 70% to 99% tended to have nonsignificantly more large vessel disease strokes (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–4.2 and hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–5.6).

Conclusions

Patients with clinically manifest arterial disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus have a low risk of developing ischemic stroke, irrespective of its subtype and independent of the degree of ACAS stenosis.

### Increased carotid intima-media thickness as a predictor of the presence and extent of abnormal myocardial perfusion in type 2 diabetes [^e827fb47]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The prognostic value of SPECT imaging has been confirmed in diabetic patients. In particular, a favorable cardiovascular prognosis has been described in patients with normal myocardial perfusion, whereas significantly higher adverse event rates were observed in patients with severely abnormal perfusion. SPECT has therefore been proposed as a screening tool for identification of asymptomatic diabetic patients with obstructive CAD. However, considering the high global prevalence of type 2 diabetes, a broad screening strategy of all asymptomatic patients using SPECT perfusion imaging does not appear feasible or cost-effective. The American Heart Association/American Diabetes Association therefore initially suggested more aggressive medical treatment and assessment of CAD only in the presence of two additional risk factors. Nonetheless, baseline analysis of SPECT data in the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics Study demonstrated that a selection strategy based on a minimum of two additional risk factors underestimates the presence of abnormal perfusion in a large proportion of patients (41%). Accordingly, the key question remains how asymptomatic diabetic patients with severe CAD should be identified from the general diabetic population.

Assessment of CIMT has been previously proposed for this purpose. Moreover, the truly noninvasive, inexpensive, and radiation-free nature of CIMT may represent an important advantage over other suggested screening techniques such as coronary calcium scoring. However, the relation of CIMT with CAD has not been fully established in asymptomatic diabetic patients. In the current study, increased CIMT was shown to be a strong predictor of the extent of abnormal perfusion and improved identification of patients with severely abnormal perfusion (28%). Normal CIMT values on the other hand were associated with a low risk for abnormal perfusion. Importantly, only few asymptomatic diabetic patients with normal CIMT values had severely abnormal perfusion (3%). However, it must be acknowledged that a nondiabetic control group was not available for comparison. Also, patients were referred from a diabetes clinic and may thus represent a more high-risk group than the general asymptomatic population with diabetes. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that initial risk stratification using CIMT may allow selective referral of asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes requiring further imaging and intensification of therapy, thereby improving patient outcome while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

### Should we screen this patient for carotid artery stenosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^7ed7c559]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In July 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published a clinical guideline on screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The guideline recommended against screening in asymptomatic adults, based primarily on the results of 3 large randomized trials (grade D recommendation). The principal screening test was carotid ultrasonography, and the intervention in the 3 trials was carotid endarterectomy for patients with stenosis exceeding 50% to 60%. In a meta-analysis, carotid endarterectomy reduced rates of 1) perioperative stroke, death, or subsequent ipsilateral stroke and 2) perioperative stroke, death, or any subsequent stroke. The corresponding absolute risk differences were -2.0% (95% CI, -3.3% to -0.7%) and -3.5% (CI, -5.1% to -1.8%), respectively. However, perioperative stroke and death were substantially less common among the 3 randomized trials than in contemporaneous cohort studies (1.9% vs. 3.3%). In addition to stroke or death in patients receiving carotid endarterectomy, a harm of screening included the risk for angiography prompted by abnormal results on carotid ultrasonography. In this article, 2 discussants address the risks and benefits of screening for carotid artery disease as well as how to apply the guideline to an individual patient who is deciding whether to be screened.

### Diabetic retinopathy as an independent predictor of subclinical cardiovascular disease: baseline results of the PRECISED study [^892cd066]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

The high prevalence of type 2 diabetes precludes implementing a generalized screening for CVD in asymptomatic patients. On the other hand, the traditional risk factors associated with diabetes (ie, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) are estimated to contribute in less than 40% of CV events. In fact, these factors are not useful for identifying the coronary asymptomatic patients in which the screening could be cost-effective. Therefore, cheap and routinely available measures that identify those patients at high risk of developing CVD are needed.

Carotid ultrasound to measure carotid intima–media thickness (CIMT) and a coronary artery calcium scan to quantify coronary calcification have been used as non-invasive techniques to identify subclinical atherosclerosis.CIMT has been widely used as a marker to identify subclinical atherosclerosis, as increased CIMT has been associated with a high prevalence of CAD and future CV events. A recent study has found that carotid plaque is predictive of underlying silent coronary atherosclerosis prevalence, severity, and extent in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients. Extensive data indicate a close relationship between the coronary artery calcium score (CACs) and clinical coronary events among individuals with and without diabetes. In addition, it has been shown that the prognostic significance of elevated CACs in predicting coronary events appears to be greater in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes, and it can further enhance the predictions provided by established risk models. Moreover, the CACs has been related to moderate to large perfusion defects assessed by scintigraphy. For all these reasons, the Imaging Council of the American College of Cardiology concluded that CAC screening is the most sensitive risk stratification tool among asymptomatic persons with diabetes. Patients are typically stratified by Agatston units (AU), yielding a CACs < 100 (low risk), 100 to 400 (moderate risk), and > 400 (high risk). Notably, the finding of a CACs of < 10 AU may facilitate risk stratification by enabling the identification of people at very low risk within the overall high-risk population of diabetic patients. In this regard, it should be noted that the absence of coronary calcium portends a remarkably favorable prognosis despite the presence of DM, with no patients experiencing adverse cardiac events during 5 years of follow-up. Nevertheless, widespread screening for silent CAD in diabetes cannot be recommended at this timeand, consequently, the identification of a more targeted population in which the CACs would be more cost-efficient seems warranted.

### The utility of carotid ultrasonography in identifying severe coronary artery disease in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients without history of coronary artery disease [^b71046e7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Measurement of carotid IMT

B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid artery was performed using an ultrasound machine (Toshiba SSA-790CE; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer. Scanning of the extracranial common carotid artery (CCA), the carotid bulb, and the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the neck was performed bilaterally in three different longitudinal projections as well as transverse projections. The IMT was measured as the distance between two parallel echogenic lines corresponding to the blood–intima and media–adventitia interface on the posterior wall of the artery using manual reading system equipped with the ultrasonograph. The greatest thickness of IMT (including plaque lesions) in the CCA, the carotid bulb, and the ICA were measured separately, and the greatest value of them was defined as maximum IMT and used as the representative value for each individual. In addition, three determinations of IMT were conducted at the site of the thickest point and two adjacent points (located 1 cm upstream and 1 cm downstream from the thickest point) in the CCA. These three determinations were averaged (mean IMT) and the greatest value among the six mean IMTs (three from the left and three from the right) was used as the representative value for each individual. Carotid plaque was defined as a focal structure encroaching into the arterial lumen or demonstrating a thickness > 1.5 mm as measured from the media–adventitia interface to the intralumen interface.

To confirm the utility of maximum IMT in predicting severe CAD in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic subjects, we performed similar analyses using another cohort of asymptomatic type 2 diabetic subjects who were recruited at Osaka University Hospital. In this hospital, all scans were conducted by experienced laboratory physicians using the same ultrasound system and the same measuring method of IMT that were used in Osaka Police Hospital. Reproducibility analysis of 20 replicate measurements yielded absolute mean differences of 0.03 ± 0.05 and 0.05 ± 0.05 mm for maximum IMT and mean IMT, respectively. The interobserver coefficient of variation for measurement of maximum IMT and mean IMT were 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively.

### Screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6030a117]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — test performance, benefits, and harms: The task force cites "adequate evidence that duplex ultrasonography has reasonable sensitivity and specificity for detecting clinically relevant carotid artery stenosis," but it "yields many false-positive results when screening the general population," and "auscultating the neck for carotid bruits has poor accuracy." It finds "inadequate direct evidence that screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis reduces adverse health outcomes," and "adequate evidence that treating asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis using CEA or CAS provides no to small benefit" versus current medical therapy. Harms are described as "known harms associated with confirmatory testing and intervention," with "adequate direct evidence that treating asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis using CEA or CAS can cause harms, including stroke or death," and the "overall magnitude of harms… is small to moderate." Overall, "the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening… has no benefit and may be harmful."

Carotid ultrasound evidence base and external guidance — scale of data and policy statements: Prospective studies including at least 1000 asymptomatic participants have examined CIMT and CVD risk, and 9 large studies have demonstrated similar or greater predictive power for carotid plaque and CVD. The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid has established a Current Procedural Terminology code (0126T) for a common CIMT study. Prior expert panels have stated cautious uses: an American Heart Association panel concluded that CIMT "can now be considered for further clarification of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment at the request of a physician," provided that it is performed by an experienced laboratory, and the National Cholesterol Education Program stated that CIMT "could be used as an adjunct in CHD risk assessment" and that "the finding of an elevated CIMT (eg, ≥ 75th percentile for age and sex) could elevate a person with multiple risk factors to a higher risk category," while "expense, lack of availability, and difficulties with standardization preclude a current recommendation for its use in routine risk assessment."

Carotid ultrasound measurement protocol and plaque definition — standardized acquisition targets: CIMT measurements should be limited to the far wall of the common carotid artery and supplemented by a thorough scan of the extracranial carotid arteries for plaque to increase sensitivity for identifying subclinical vascular disease. Carotid plaque is defined as focal wall thickening at least 50% greater than the surrounding vessel wall or as a focal region with CIMT greater than 1.5 mm that protrudes into the lumen and is distinct from the adjacent boundary.

### Ultrasonic tissue characterization of carotid plaque improves the prediction of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients: a pilot study [^891a0f89]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, the number of the study subjects was quite small, even though the current study had been originally designed as a pilot study. In fact, the number of the subjects included was less than intended, because we had difficulties in enrollment of eligible individuals in this study. Many candidates did not agree to participate because the schedule for the carotid assessment was rigid. This phenomenon may produce a selection bias, because those who agreed to enter this study may have had more concerns for their health for any reason. In addition, the actual number of the subjects included in the current study was ∼1/20 of the estimated number of the patients who met the eligibility criteria, which holds a certain risk of yielding some kind of selection bias. It is well-known that some types of selection biases spuriously increase the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test.

### Should we screen for occult coronary artery disease among asymptomatic patients with diabetes? [^6044cc79]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus predisposes people to premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). The risk of a myocardial infarction in diabetics without overt evidence of obstructive CAD matches that of patients without diabetes who have had a previous myocardial infarction. The available data suggest that occult CAD is a common finding among asymptomatic diabetics, ranging from 20% to > 50%. The diagnostic accuracy of myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in diabetics appears to be comparable to that observed in nondiabetic individuals. As shown in other patient groups, the ischemic burden assessed by stress SPECT in subjects with diabetes is also linked to their increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Among patients with normal stress SPECT, however, those with diabetes are at significantly greater risk than non-diabetics. Testing diabetics with an abnormal resting electrocardiogram or with evidence of peripheral or carotid occlusive arterial disease appears to result in an excellent yield of abnormal SPECT findings, as does testing in the setting of dyspnea. However, recent evidence suggests that achieving an adequate yield in asymptomatic diabetics without overt evidence of CAD is a greater challenge. Further investigation of sequential testing strategies is needed in order to identify an efficient means for screening asymptomatic patients with diabetes.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^2832b5a0]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis — duplex ultrasound screening and progression risk: Duplex ultrasound, the method of choice for screening patients with known atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis, has the lowest cost/risk. Ipsilateral stroke risk was highly dependent on degree of stenosis: < 5% after 5 years for moderate stenosis and 15% with severe stenosis. Progression is prognostic; the association of ipsilateral neurological events with yearly luminal narrowing was highly statistically significant (P ≤ 0.001) for patients who had progression of > 2 categories in 1 year. Independent predictors of progression include male sex, high creatinine, not taking lipid-lowering therapy, less severe low grade of stenosis, and increased plaque area. Once patients have been diagnosed with > 50% carotid stenosis, annual follow-up with carotid duplex may be reasonable to identify stenosis progression and subsequent risk of stroke.

### Ultrasonic tissue characterization of carotid plaque improves the prediction of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients: a pilot study [^17ce99ce]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Thirdly, the current study focused on the question whether measurement of Calibrated-IBS values can provide any useful information for identifying subjects with a high risk for CVE at a certain point in their long life with diabetes; it did not consider the changes in metabolic control and therapeutic regimen during the follow-up period, which affect both Calibrated-IBS values and the development of CVE. Therefore, whether longitudinal monitoring of Calibrated-IBS can add any beneficial information to the daily medical practice based on the monitoring of classic risk factors should be examined by further studies. Another prospective study needs to be performed to examine whether the risk stratification using Calibrated-IBS will lead to improved treatment decision making.

Finally, it is noted that the subjects of this study were Japanese T2DM patients with carotid plaque. It would thus be premature to generalize our findings to other races or ethnic groups, nondiabetic subjects, and subjects without carotid plaque.

Notwithstanding these limitations, our pilot study indicates that ultrasonic tissue characterization of carotid plaques using IBS analysis can provide useful information for identifying subjects with a high risk of CVE.

In conclusion, Calibrated-IBS value, a marker for tissue characteristics of carotid plaque that can be assessed quickly, noninvasively, and cheaply with ultrasound, can improve the risk prediction of CVE in asymptomatic T2DM patients with carotid plaque. A large-scale prospective study is needed to establish the usefulness of Calibrated-IBS as a predictive factor for the development of CVE in T2DM patients.

Society for Vascular Surgery — screening indications and high-prevalence cohorts: Association guidelines noted that screening before CABG is probably indicated for the following subset of patients: age ≥ 65 years; left main coronary artery stenosis; a history of smoking, TIA, stroke, or carotid bruit; and PAD. Based on these and other reports, the SVS does advocate carotid artery screening for high-risk patients aged ≥ 55 years with appropriate cardiovascular risk factors. Reported prevalence signals include higher rates in diabetes (8.7% vs 2.8%) and in patients requiring hemodialysis with tunneled catheter placement (9.8%), with an overall prevalence of significant stenosis of 5.2% in a study of 1500 subjects. One investigator reported that screening of asymptomatic patients is appropriate if they were aged ≥ 60 years and had three or more traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. A systematic review and meta-analysis found screening in these defined populations revealed a benefit for mortality and less so for stroke, and identified cohorts expected to have an approximate prevalence of ≥ 20% of significant carotid stenosis even if asymptomatic — making them appropriate to consider for screening — including patients with current cigarette smoking; patients with hypertension and CAD; patients with renal failure and diabetes, hypertension, or CAD; and patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and CAD.

Summary of evidence

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study followed 13,145 individuals without previous CVD (57% women, age: 54.0 ± 8.5 years, 10% with diabetes) for a mean of 15.1 years, during which 1812 CHD events occurred. CIMT (categorized as < 25th percentile, 25th–75th percentile or > 75th percentile for sex) or plaque presence, defined in the presence of at least 2 of 3 criteria — abnormal wall thickness (CIMT > 1.5 mm), abnormal shape (protrusion into the lumen, loss of alignment with adjacent arterial wall boundary), and abnormal wall texture (brighter echoes than adjacent boundaries) — were superior for risk discrimination and reclassification in comparison with risk factors alone. According to the authors, when plaque information (abnormal wall thickness) and CIMT were considered in addition to risk factors, 8.6, 37.5, 38.3, and 21.5% of the overall sample were reclassified in the < 5, 5–10, 10–20, and > 20% 10-year estimated risk groups respectively. Adding plaque and CIMT reclassified 17.4, 32.8, 36.6, and 25.2% of the men and 5.1, 40.2, 38.4, and 24.9% of the women in the same risk groups.
The prospective cohort BioImage Study enrolled 5808 asymptomatic adults without previous cardiovascular events to evaluate the role of vascular imaging in cardiovascular risk prediction. All patients were evaluated for carotid plaque burden score based on a novel 3-dimensional carotid ultrasound and CAC score at baseline, and followed up for a median of 2.7 years. The main study outcome was the presence of MACE defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. The authors analyzed the carotid plaque burden (cPB) through the sum of the areas of carotid plaques as seen along both carotid arteries and their ramifications. cPB was analyzed in tertiles. After adjustments for risk factors, and compared with individuals without any cPB, hazard ratios (HR) for MACE at tertiles 1, 2, and 3 were 0.78 (95% CI 0.31–1.91), 1.45 (95% CI 0.67–3.14), and 2.36 (95% CI 1.13–4.92) respectively. The net reclassification index (NRI) significantly improved in 23%. Thus, detection of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis improves risk prediction and reclassification compared with traditional risk factors.
