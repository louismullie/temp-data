## Question

What is the typical platelet count fall in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical platelet count fall in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary diagnostic feature, which is the relative platelet count fall. Then, I should verify the usual absolute nadir range and what it implies about severity. Next, I will review the temporal patterns (classic, rapid-onset, delayed-onset) and recommended monitoring windows. After that, I should check how major guidelines (ASH, BCSH, FDA labeling) operationalize thresholds and pretest probability scoring. Finally, I will integrate risk context, special scenarios, and how these data inform the 4Ts framework and immediate management, making sure to self-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the primary diagnostic signal: in HIT, the platelet count typically falls by more than 50% from the patient's post-heparin "baseline" (often the highest count after starting heparin), and this relative drop is more informative than any single absolute value because patients with high starting counts can still have counts above 100 × 10⁹/L and yet meet HIT criteria, which is why I need to prioritize the percentage decline over the absolute number [^112kRvsb] [^116SrZwP] [^1177i6an].

> I need to verify the expected absolute nadir; the thrombocytopenia in HIT is usually moderate, with a median nadir around 50–60 × 10⁹/L, which aligns with a consumption/activation process rather than marrow failure, and while I initially thought severe nadirs were rare, I should confirm that counts below 20 × 10⁹/L can occur in a minority, especially with DIC, and that bleeding is uncommon because the syndrome is paradoxically prothrombotic [^1153Fy9g] [^112kRvsb] [^113ddSHp].

> Hold on, timing is critical; classic-onset HIT appears between days 5–10 after starting heparin, so I should ensure platelet monitoring focuses on days 4–14 in at-risk patients, but I also need to check for rapid-onset HIT within hours if there was heparin exposure in the last ~100 days (median onset about 10.5 hours), and remember delayed-onset HIT can declare itself days to weeks after heparin has been stopped, often with a modest count at readmission that drops sharply upon re-exposure [^115i1r16] [^112Kgv8B] [^115asjJM] [^114zmRxp].

> Next, I should review how thresholds are applied in guidelines; BCSH suggests suspecting HIT with a platelet fall of at least 30% between days 4–14, improving sensitivity, whereas ASH recommends using the 4Ts score to estimate pretest probability and guide testing and treatment decisions, and the FDA label's < 100 × 10⁹/L threshold is a practical safety alert rather than a diagnostic standard; wait, I almost misstated the ASH criterion as an absolute " < 50% of baseline", but that's not right — let me correct that: the 4Ts thrombocytopenia component awards points for percentage fall and for nadir levels, not a single absolute percent-of-baseline cutoff, so I need to keep the percent decline and nadir together in scoring [^115QhPj5] [^112QnEsB] [^112xsjix] [^113ywZeH].

> I will now examine risk context and monitoring intensity; cardiopulmonary bypass patients and other postoperative settings carry elevated pretest probability and merit platelet checks every 2–3 days from day 4–14, unfractionated heparin confers higher risk than low-molecular-weight heparin, and prior heparin exposure within 30 days justifies earlier monitoring from day 0 given the potential for rapid-onset HIT, which I should not overlook [^1122fUzy] [^115i1r16] [^115rBd9A] [^117EAKLe].

> But wait, what if the presentation is "delayed-onset" with thrombosis and only a mild thrombocytopenia at readmission; I should double-check that re-exposure often triggers a steep subsequent fall (mean nadir near 39 × 10⁹/L in one series), and also remember that new thrombosis occurs in roughly half of acute HIT cases, reinforcing why even moderate nadirs can mask high thrombotic risk and demand prompt action [^114zmRxp] [^112kRvsb].

> Let me consider key differentials and pitfalls; early thrombocytopenia within the first 4 days is usually non-immune (type I HIT or other causes), ICU patients frequently have alternative reasons for low platelets, and overdiagnosis can be reduced by disciplined use of 4Ts plus appropriate laboratory sequencing (immunoassay first, functional assay if positive), so I should not jump to conclusions based on a single low value without timing and percent fall alignment [^117KJToA] [^112xsjix] [^114HsTCY].

> I should confirm testing and action steps; in intermediate/high 4Ts probability, obtain an anti–PF4/heparin immunoassay and, if positive, pursue a functional assay when feasible, and crucially, stop heparin immediately and initiate a non-heparin anticoagulant while awaiting confirmation, because the danger is thrombosis, not bleeding, and I need to ensure I screen for asymptomatic proximal DVT in acute isolated HIT when appropriate [^112xsjix] [^117JQ6DL] [^111nRuxo].

> In summary, I need to ensure the interpretation centers on a greater-than-50% platelet fall with typical nadirs of 50–60 × 10⁹/L, aligned with day 5–10 onset unless rapid-onset or delayed-onset patterns apply, and integrate guideline-informed thresholds and the 4Ts to avoid both missed diagnoses and overtesting; if the relative fall, timing, and lack of alternative explanation point to intermediate/high probability, I should act immediately by stopping heparin and starting non-heparin anticoagulation while confirming the diagnosis [^112kRvsb] [^1153Fy9g] [^112xsjix] [^117JQ6DL].

The platelet drop in HIT is defined as a **≥ 50% fall from baseline** or a nadir of 20–100 × 10⁹/L [^112bxPYQ], typically starting **5–10 days after heparin initiation**; with recent heparin exposure, the drop can occur within 24 hours [^115asjJM], and delayed-onset HIT can present days to weeks after stopping heparin [^114zmRxp]. The platelet count usually **recovers within 4–7 days** after stopping heparin and starting a non-heparin anticoagulant, but recovery may be delayed if thrombosis or DIC occurs [^112kRvsb]. HIT should be suspected with a **≥ 50% platelet fall** [^112bxPYQ], new thrombosis, or skin necrosis between days 4–14 of heparin exposure [^1173t8Sc], and confirmed with immunoassays and functional assays [^112xsjix] [^114HsTCY].

---

## Clinical definition and diagnostic criteria

- **Platelet count drop**: A ≥ 50% fall from baseline [^112QnEsB], typically to a nadir of 20–100 × 10⁹/L [^112kRvsb].

- **Timing**: Usually 5–10 days after starting heparin [^112kRvsb]; within 24 hours if recent exposure [^115asjJM]; delayed-onset HIT can occur days to weeks after stopping heparin [^114zmRxp].

- **Thrombosis**: New thrombosis or skin necrosis between days 4–14 of heparin exposure [^112bxPYQ] [^112kRvsb].

- **Laboratory confirmation**: Immunoassays (e.g. ELISA) and functional assays (e.g. serotonin release assay) [^112xsjix] [^114HsTCY].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

HIT is an **immune-mediated disorder** caused by antibodies against PF4–heparin complexes, leading to platelet activation, aggregation, and consumption, creating a paradoxical **prothrombotic state** [^114njnsk] [^112ikzJe]. Key mechanisms include **antibody formation** — IgG antibodies bind PF4–heparin complexes and activate platelets via FcγRIIa, causing aggregation and consumption [^114njnsk] [^112kRvsb] — and a **prothrombotic state**, in which platelet activation releases procoagulant microparticles that increase thrombin generation and thrombosis risk [^1159zkpP].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

The platelet drop in HIT is **clinically significant** because of the **high risk of thrombotic complications**, including:

- **Venous thrombosis**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) [^111Zwpj3] [^112kRvsb].

- **Arterial thrombosis**: Stroke, myocardial infarction, and limb ischemia [^113ddSHp] [^112kRvsb].

- **Skin necrosis**: At heparin injection sites [^112bxPYQ] [^112kRvsb].

- **Adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis**: Rare but severe complication [^112kRvsb] [^112thWcR].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

### Monitoring platelet counts

Obtain a **baseline platelet count** before starting heparin therapy [^114vWZwd] [^116YexcQ]. From day 4 to 14, or until heparin is discontinued, **monitor platelet counts every 2–3 days** [^1139z6fE] [^115i1r16]. If the platelet count **falls by ≥ 50% or drops below 100 × 10⁹/L**, discontinue heparin immediately and initiate alternative anticoagulation [^116vAGSq] [^117JQ6DL].

---

### Management strategies

- **Discontinue heparin**: Immediately stop all heparin products [^117JQ6DL] [^112kRvsb].

- **Alternative anticoagulation**: Initiate non-heparin anticoagulants (e.g. argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, or DOACs) [^111Zwpj3] [^115Rdn5B] [^112kRvsb].

- **Avoid platelet transfusions**: Unless severe bleeding or invasive procedures are required [^116qLmAX] [^112kRvsb].

- **Monitor recovery**: Platelet counts typically recover within 4–7 days after stopping heparin and starting alternative anticoagulation [^1153Fy9g] [^112kRvsb].

---

## Prognostic implications

The platelet drop in HIT carries significant **prognostic implications**, with a **high risk of thrombotic complications** including DVT, PE, stroke, and myocardial infarction [^111Zwpj3] [^112kRvsb]. Mortality risk is increased due to these **thrombotic events** [^112sabCx]. With appropriate management, platelet counts typically **recover within 4–7 days** [^1153Fy9g] [^112kRvsb].

---

The platelet drop in HIT is a **≥ 50% fall from baseline** [^112QnEsB], typically 5–10 days after heparin initiation [^115asjJM], and is clinically significant due to the high risk of thrombotic complications [^111Zwpj3]. Immediate **discontinuation of heparin** and initiation of alternative anticoagulation are essential for management [^117JQ6DL].

### Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias [^112kRvsb]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

The key clinical feature of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a drop in platelet count of more than 50% from the highest value upon the first heparin administration, usually starting 5–10 days after beginning heparin treatment. However, HIT can occur earlier in patients who are re-exposed to heparin within 100 days of a previous exposure (rapid onset HIT). In a subgroup of HIT patients characterized by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a more significant drop in platelet count (< 20 × 10⁹/L) might be observed.

Thrombosis represents the most severe complication of HIT and contributes significantly to disease-related morbidity and mortality. A new thrombotic complication is observed in almost 50% of patients with acute HIT; deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common. Notably, patients with HIT may develop asymptomatic thrombosis in veins in the lower and upper extremities, highlighting the importance of examining all four extremities in HIT. Rare complications of HIT include thrombosis in cerebral and splanchnic veins, as well as catheter-associated thrombosis. Although less frequent, arterial thrombosis has also been reported and usually involves the lower-limb, cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and brachial arteries. In a few cases, severe HIT-associated DIC triggers microthrombosis and critical limb ischemia. Finally, skin necrosis at heparin injection sites and adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis are rare clinical manifestations of HIT.

### Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114zmRxp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes.

- **Objective**: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed.

- **Design**: Retrospective case series.

- **Setting**: Three large urban hospitals with active cardiovascular surgery programs.

- **Patients**: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications.

- **Measurements**: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of heparin-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes.

- **Results**: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure — in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized — only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial (4 patients) or both. Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 × 10⁹ cells/L; mean nadir after heparin re-exposure, 39 × 10⁹ cells/L). Results of serologic tests for heparin-induced antibodies were positive in all patients.

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114WNZwX]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2024). High credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of nonheparin anticoagulation in these complex patients, who have both increased thrombotic risk and possible increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources. Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high-quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A contemporary clinical approach to diagnosis and management [^113ddSHp]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia following heparin administration can be associated with an immune reaction known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a prothrombotic disorder mediated by an IgG antiplatelet factor 4/heparin antibody, which induces the activation of platelets, endothelial cells, monocytes, and other cellular elements, leading to thrombin generation and thrombotic complications. Indeed, HIT can also be regarded as a serious adverse drug effect.

Importantly, HIT can be a life-threatening and limb-threatening condition frequently associated with severe and extensive thromboembolism (both venous and arterial), rather than with bleeding. This article provides an overview of HIT, with an emphasis on clinical diagnosis and management.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a profoundly dangerous, potentially lethal, immunologically mediated adverse drug reaction to unfractionated heparin or, less commonly, to low-molecular-weight heparin. In this comprehensive review, the authors highlight heparin-induced thrombocytopenia's risk factors, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnostic principles, and treatment. Special emphasis is placed on the management of patients requiring procedures using cardiopulmonary bypass or interventions in the catheterization laboratory. Clinical vigilance of this disease process is crucial to ensure its recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Misdiagnosis of the syndrome, as well as misunderstanding of the disease process, continues to contribute to its morbidity and mortality.

### Platelet count monitoring and laboratory testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^1177i6an]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction that is paradoxically associated with a brief but dramatically increased risk for thrombosis (transient acquired thrombophilia). The objective of this article is to provide practical recommendations for platelet count monitoring in patients receiving heparin, as well as for the selection of laboratory assays to detect pathogenic HIT antibodies.

Relevant literature focusing on the frequency and timing of HIT in various clinical settings and laboratory testing for HIT antibodies was critically appraised. The author prepared a preliminary manuscript including recommendations presented at the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia (November 10, 2001). Support of at least 70% of conference participants was required for recommendations to be adopted.

The risk of immune HIT varies depending on the type of heparin, with unfractionated heparin posing a greater risk than low-molecular-weight heparin, and the patient population, with surgical patients at higher risk than medical patients. Thus, the intensity of platelet count monitoring should be stratified based on the clinical situation. Platelet count monitoring should focus on the period of highest risk, usually days 5 to 10 after starting heparin, and should use an appropriate platelet count baseline, generally the highest platelet count beginning 4 days after the start of heparin. However, earlier platelet count monitoring is appropriate in certain situations.

### Temporal aspects of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115asjJM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a relatively common antibody-mediated drug reaction. We studied the temporal relation between previous or heparin therapy and the onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

- **Methods**: We examined the time between the start of heparin therapy and the onset of thrombocytopenia in 243 patients with serologically confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. We also investigated the persistence of circulating heparin-dependent antibodies by performing a platelet serotonin-release assay and an assay for antibodies against platelet factor 4. The outcome in seven patients who had previously had an episode of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and were later treated again with heparin was also examined.

- **Results**: A fall in the platelet count beginning four or more days after the start of heparin therapy occurred in 170 of the 243 patients (70 percent); in these patients, a history of previous heparin treatment did not influence the timing of the onset of thrombocytopenia. In the remaining 73 patients (30 percent), the onset of thrombocytopenia was rapid (median time of onset, 10.5 hours after the start of heparin administration); all these patients had been treated with heparin within the previous 100 days. During recovery from thrombocytopenia, heparin-dependent antibodies in the serum fell to undetectable levels at a median of 50 to 85 days, depending on the assay performed. In the seven patients who were given heparin again after the disappearance of heparin-dependent antibodies, a new episode of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed.

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^1145P51z]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the more than 100 such patients that we see yearly, patients have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT, such as history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to just stop heparin therapy; even with isolated HIT, therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be used not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors makes it more important to maintain awareness of and vigilance for this syndrome.

### Measurement of procoagulant platelets provides mechanistic insight and diagnostic potential in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^1159zkpP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). High credibility.

Early and accurate detection of HIT is critical for improved patient outcomes, yet this remains a clinical challenge. An increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIT is helpful for improved diagnostic platforms and therapeutics. Procoagulant platelets play an important role in hemostasis by providing a surface for the assembly and propagation of coagulation factors, enabling thrombin generation and subsequent clot stabilization through fibrin formation.

A well-known paradox in HIT is that thrombin generation, demonstrable on calibrated thrombography, is enhanced instead of reduced in the presence of heparin. Expanding on the work of Tutwiler and colleagues on coated platelets and HIT, we confirm the marked increase in the procoagulant platelet proportion in donor platelets by HIT+ patient plasma in the presence of heparin as a potential mechanism for this paradox.

We demonstrate that low-dose GPCR agonist sensitizes platelets to the mechanism of heparin-dependent HIT plasma induction of a procoagulant platelet response in a process that is fully dependent on active FcγRIIa. Furthermore, measurement of SFLLRN-induced procoagulant platelet formation in donor platelets under these conditions can accurately differentiate HIT from non-HIT thrombocytopenia by detecting a heparin-dependent, antibody-mediated increase in procoagulant platelet proportions.

These results provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying thrombosis in HIT and suggest that our flow cytometry-based procoagulant platelet assay may be a viable strategy for rapid yet accurate diagnosis.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and cardiovascular surgery [^114pxu5c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

Clinicians generally counsel patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) to avoid heparin products lifelong. Although many alternative (nonheparin) anticoagulants are now available, heparin avoidance remains challenging for cardiac surgery. Heparin is often preferred in the cardiac surgery setting based on the vast experience with the agent, ease of monitoring, and reversibility.

To "clear" a patient with a history of HIT for cardiac surgery, hematologists must first confirm the diagnosis of HIT, which can be difficult due to the ubiquity of heparin exposure and the frequency of thrombocytopenia in patients in the cardiac intensive care unit. Next, the "phase of HIT" (acute HIT, subacute HIT A/B, or remote HIT) should be established based on platelet count, immunoassay for antibodies to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes, and a functional assay (e.g. serotonin release assay). As long as the HIT functional assay remains positive (acute HIT or subacute HIT A), cardiac surgery should be delayed if possible.

If surgery cannot be delayed, an alternative anticoagulant (preferably bivalirudin) may be used. Alternatively, heparin may be used with either preoperative/intraoperative plasma exchange or together with a potent antiplatelet agent. The optimal strategy among these options is not known, and the choice depends on institutional experience and availability of alternative anticoagulants. In the later phases of HIT (subacute HIT B or remote HIT), brief intraoperative exposure to heparin followed by an alternative anticoagulant as needed in the postoperative period.

### How we manage patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia [^112JxFyZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) remains a rare but significant condition related to mortality and morbidity. The incidence has decreased with reduced use of unfractionated heparin, with the exception of cardiac surgery. Due to the high risk of thrombosis, a switch to a non-heparin anticoagulant is required until platelet counts normalize.

In the acute setting, argatroban, fondaparinux, and direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are therapeutic options. For patients with HIT-associated thrombosis or those requiring long-term anticoagulation, warfarin remains the preference, but DOACs are attractive alternatives.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: diagnosis and management [^116SrZwP]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction in response to platelet factor 4-heparin complexes, which results in increased platelet activation and thrombocytopenia beginning on the 4th to 5th day after heparin exposure, induced by IgG antibody production. Platelet activation can lead to arterial thrombosis; more commonly, however, platelet microparticle formation contributes to venous thrombosis.

Accurate diagnosis of HIT is based on clinical features, including a 50% fall in platelet count, appropriate timing of thrombocytopenia, development of new thrombosis despite thrombocytopenia and heparin therapy, and the absence of a more likely cause of thrombocytopenia. Documentation of an anti-PF4-heparin antibody is necessary, but not sufficient, to make the diagnosis since antibody formation occurs in various clinical settings without the development of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis.

Once HIT is suspected or confirmed, all forms of heparin should be discontinued, and an alternative form of anticoagulation should be administered until the platelet count recovers. Treatment options include the intravenous administration of argatroban, lepirudin, and bivalirudin; subcutaneous administration of fondaparinux has also been described. Warfarin therapy, if indicated, should be avoided until platelet recovery. Re-exposure to heparin can be avoided by using alternative anticoagulants for most circumstances.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been the focus of increasing attention over the past 15–20 years. As interventions for HIT are developed, there…

### Usefulness of pretest clinical score (4Ts) combined with immunoassay for the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114UooM3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This review addresses the clinical and biological strategy to be applied for the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a severe prothrombotic disease caused by immunoglobulin G antibodies, which bind to platelet factor 4 and activate platelets, resulting in increased thrombin generation. Venous and arterial thromboses are frequent, necessitating the substitution of heparin with a potent alternative anticoagulant such as danaparoid, lepirudin, or argatroban in every affected patient. However, diagnosing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is often challenging and requires reliance on clinical criteria and reliable laboratory tests, including immunoassays and platelet activation tests. The profiles of platelet count evolution suggestive of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in cardiac surgery patients are now well defined. In other clinical settings, the usefulness of the '4Ts' scoring system, which estimates the probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia before laboratory testing combined with an immunoassay allowing specific detection of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies, has been recently documented.

Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of combining a pretest clinical score (4Ts) and biological assays to diagnose heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The algorithms that need to be applied in clinical practice are now better defined.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115Rdn5B]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

Even though the level of evidence is sparse for some of the drugs (e.g. argatroban), the results of the systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there are no major differences among non-heparin anticoagulants for the treatment of acute HIT with respect to safety and effectiveness. These findings support fondaparinux and DOACs as viable alternatives to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of acute HIT in clinical practice. Fondaparinux and DOACs are cost-effective, easy to manage, and potentially safer than intravenous anticoagulants. Ideally, this hypothesis should be tested in an adequately designed RCT. However, given that conducting RCTs in patients with HIT remains extremely difficult, our results represent the best level of evidence available. Future high-quality observational studies will improve the findings of meta-analyses, and we encourage investigators of observational studies to conduct longer follow-up, refine the measurements of clinical outcomes, and improve reporting of results.

In conclusion, pooling data from 119 treatment groups and 4,698 patients to estimate important clinical outcomes (platelet recovery, TE, major bleeding, death), we did not identify major differences among non-heparin anticoagulants for the treatment of acute HIT. These findings were not affected by the patient population, diagnostic testing strategies, study design, or type of publication. Our results support fondaparinux and DOACs as viable alternatives to conventional agents for the treatment of acute HIT in clinical practice.

### Prospective evaluation of a rapid functional assay for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis in critically ill patients [^115BhUAB]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Overdiagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia remains an unresolved issue in the ICU, leading to the unjustified switch from heparin to alternative anticoagulants or delays in anticoagulation. Platelet function assays significantly improve the specificity of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis, but they are not readily available, involve technical difficulties, and have a long turnaround time. We evaluated the performance of a rapid and easy-to-perform functional assay for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis in ICU patients, known as "heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry".

In this observational prospective study, patients were tested with the immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the serotonin release assay, and heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry. Heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry was assessed against heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis (clinical picture in favor, serotonin release assay, and immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positive) and the serotonin release assay.

The study was conducted in the medical or surgical ICUs of 35 medical centers on patients suspected of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hospitalized from January 2013 to May 2013.

- **Measurements and main results**: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis was retained in 12 patients (14%). Using heparin-induced thrombocytopenia diagnosis as a reference, heparin-induced multiple electrode aggregometry showed an excellent negative predictive value and sensitivity at 98%.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: When a low platelet count is a mandate for anticoagulation [^1153Fy9g]. Hematology American Society of Hematology Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated disorder caused by the development of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. The thrombocytopenia is typically moderate, with a median platelet count nadir of approximately 50 to 60 × 10⁹ platelets/L. Severe thrombocytopenia has been described in patients with HIT; in these cases, antibody levels are high, and severe clinical outcomes have been reported, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation with microvascular thrombosis.

The timing of the thrombocytopenia in relation to the initiation of heparin therapy is critically important, with the platelet count beginning to drop within 5 to 10 days of starting heparin. A more rapid drop in the platelet count can occur in patients who have been recently exposed to heparin (within the preceding 3 months) due to preformed anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies. A delayed form of HIT has also been described that develops within days or weeks after the heparin has been discontinued.

In contrast to other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT is characterized by an increased risk for thromboembolic complications, primarily venous thromboembolism. Heparin and all heparin-containing products should be discontinued, and an alternative, non-heparin anticoagulant should be initiated. Alternative agents that have been effectively used in patients with HIT include lepirudin, argatroban, bivalirudin, and danaparoid, although the last agent is not available in North America. Fondaparinux has been used in a small number of patients with HIT and generally appears to be safe.

### Limitations of a platelet count-based clinical decision support system to facilitate diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^117Ez4Qd]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare complication of heparin exposure with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Early identification and treatment can prevent catastrophic thrombosis. Herein, we report the performance of a platelet count-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) where providers received a notification when a patient had a platelet count decline of ≥ 50%.

In the 90-day study period, the CDSS sent 302 notifications on 270 patients. Notifications were frequently inappropriate; 25% had an expected platelet count decline (organ donation, stem cell transplant), an inaccurate count, or no heparin exposure. Patient testing for HIT prompted by the CDSS was not in accordance with best practice guidelines in most circumstances. For example, 36% had a low probability 4Ts score, while 42% with an intermediate or high probability 4Ts score were not tested. Due to concern for lack of efficacy, the CDSS was discontinued.

Analysis of an 8-month period before and after discontinuation showed a significant decrease in the number of enzyme immunoassays ordered (547 vs. 386) without a change in the number of patients with HIT identified (13 vs. 13) or the rate of thrombosis in those with confirmed HIT (62% vs. 62%).

In conclusion, a CDSS based on platelet count decline contributed to "alert fatigue" via inappropriate notification and did not improve evidence-based HIT testing. Its removal did not decrease or delay HIT identification. Additional efforts are needed to better define how CDSS can support the rapid diagnosis and appropriate management of HIT.

### The unique immunological features of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^112ikzJe]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious drug reaction that leads to a decrease in platelet count and a high risk of thrombosis. HIT patients produce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to complexes of platelet factor-4 (PF4) and heparin. HIT immune complexes crosslink Fc receptors, resulting in platelet and monocyte activation. These events lead to the release of procoagulant chemokines and tissue factor, which together create an intensely prothrombotic state. HIT represents an atypical immune response because it has features of both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent mechanisms.

The disorder is characterized by newly formed anti-PF4/heparin IgG antibodies, which are characteristic of a T cell-dependent mechanism; however, re-exposure to heparin, months after HIT, does not lead to a memory response, which is consistent with a T cell-independent mechanism. In this review, we discuss the immunobiological events that can explain these features, including the role for T cell-dependent and T cell-independent mechanisms in HIT antibody generation, the immunogenic characteristics of the PF4/heparin antigen, and the concept of a temporary loss in immune regulation contributing to the onset of HIT. We also present a novel immunobiological model to explain the atypical immune response that is characteristic of HIT.

### How I treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114FY6jz]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a prothrombotic adverse drug effect induced by platelet-activating antibodies against multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Diagnosis relies on a clinical assessment of disease probability and laboratory testing. Management involves the immediate discontinuation of heparin and the initiation of an alternative anticoagulant. Due to the frequency of thrombocytopenia among heparinized patients, the limited specificity of widely available immunoassays, the limited availability of more specific functional assays, and clinicians' fears of missing a true disease case, overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment have become common. As a result, a substantial number of thrombocytopenic patients are unnecessarily exposed to costly alternative anticoagulants and their attendant risk of bleeding. In this review, we describe not only our approach to the evaluation and management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but also the measures we use to minimize misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of patients without the disease. Furthermore, we propose areas of investigation for improving the diagnosis and management of this potentially fatal disorder.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the critically ill patient [^117KJToA]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality. Patients who are critically ill are commonly thrombocytopenic and exposed to heparin. Although HIT should be considered, it is not usually the cause of thrombocytopenia in the medical-surgical ICU population. A systematic approach to the critically ill patient with thrombocytopenia, based on clinical features and complemented by appropriate laboratory confirmation, should lead to a reduction in inappropriate laboratory testing and reduce the use of more expensive and less reliable anticoagulants.

If the patient is deemed to be at intermediate or high risk for HIT or if HIT is confirmed by means of the serotonin-release assay, heparin should be stopped. Heparin-bonded catheters should be removed, and a direct antithrombin or fondaparinux should be initiated to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Warfarin is absolutely contraindicated in the acute phase of HIT; if administered, its effects must be reversed using vitamin K.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Temporal pattern of thrombocytopenia in relation to initial use or reexposure to heparin [^115ER8VT]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated adverse drug reaction associated with a decrease in platelet counts that usually begins after at least 5 days of heparin treatment. Uncertainty exists regarding the risk of early onset of HIT (i.e. < 5 days) in relation to previous heparin exposure. We therefore analyzed the temporal pattern of thrombocytopenia in patients with laboratory-confirmed HIT to assess whether patients with previous heparin exposure have an increased risk of early onset of HIT.

Platelet count patterns in patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of HIT were examined in a retrospective chart review of a clinical study database. The onset of thrombocytopenia < 100 × 10⁹/L associated with heparin treatment (mainly unfractionated heparin) was analyzed using nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation.

A total of 119 patients with 125 treatment episodes were assessed. HIT developed in 79 patients during initial exposure to heparin and in 46 patients during reexposure. Early onset (< 5 days) of thrombocytopenia was associated with very recent heparin exposure. Patients reexposed to heparin within 3 months had an earlier onset of thrombocytopenia compared to patients reexposed to heparin after 3 months (4.9 ± 4.4 days vs. 11.5 ± 5.5 days [mean ± SD], p = 0.001). There was no difference in the onset of thrombocytopenia < 100 × 10⁹/L between patients reexposed to heparin within 3 to 12 months and after 1 year (9.7 ± 6.4 days vs. 12.3 ± 5.2 days, p = 0.41).

### Heparin sodium [^113ywZeH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. If the count falls below 100,000/mm³ or if re-thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Heparin resistance**: Increased resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in cases of fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin deficiency. Consider measuring antithrombin levels if heparin resistance is suspected. Monitor coagulation tests frequently in such patients. It may be necessary to adjust the dose of heparin based on coagulation test monitoring, such as anti-Factor Xa levels and/or partial thromboplastin time.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions with chills, fever, and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, as well as asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, and anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations. Because heparin sodium in sodium chloride injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy to pork products.

### Unfractionated heparin compared with low-molecular-weight heparin as related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^115rBd9A]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a severe side effect of treatment with unfractionated heparin. The relation of low-molecular-weight heparin to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is less well understood. This review summarizes what is known about the similarities and differences between thrombocytopenia induced by low-molecular-weight heparin and that induced by unfractionated heparin.

- **Recent findings**: The pathophysiology of unfractionated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is caused by the development of antibodies to heparin/platelet factor 4 complexes and holds true for low-molecular-weight heparin because the molecules of the latter are of the same saccharidic structure as those of unfractionated heparin. Owing to their smaller size, however, low-molecular-weight heparin does not interact with platelet factor 4 and platelets as efficiently as does unfractionated heparin. This translates to a two- to threefold lower risk of immune sensitization (antibody generation and occurrence of clinical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Low-molecular-weight heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies are more often immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin M, in contrast to the immunoglobulin G antibodies generated with unfractionated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which tend to be more often associated with clinical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The clinical expression of low-molecular-weight heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is generally similar to that of unfractionated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia but can have a slower onset and more severe thrombocytopenia.

### Thrombocytopenia due to acute venous thromboembolism and its role in expanding the differential diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^112FxqEt]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is an uncommon but serious consequence of heparin administration. Occasionally, patients with massive acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) will develop thrombocytopenia. Since heparin or some thrombin inhibitor is strongly indicated in acute VTE, it is important to distinguish this event from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Four patients are presented who developed thrombocytopenia so early in their course of VTE and/or therapy with heparin that HIT was considered unlikely. The mean nadir platelet count for these four patients was 60,000/microliter, occurring at a mean time of 18 hours after the initiation of heparin therapy.

Because of strong indications to continue heparin for their acute VTE in the face of a very low likelihood that they had HIT, heparin was continued with excellent results and resolution of the thrombocytopenia. The literature on this subject is reviewed. Thrombocytopenia following VTE is actually rather common, but it is usually milder than in these four cases. In some cases, such as these four, the thrombocytopenia can be sudden and rather severe, causing diagnostic confusion with HIT.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a clinicopathologic syndrome most reliably diagnosed when a patient, with a clinical scenario consistent with heparin-induced immunization, is shown to have antiplatelet factor 4/heparin, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. A Bayesian diagnostic approach is discussed wherein the physician estimates the pretest probability of HIT, such as the timing and severity of thrombocytopenia in relation to heparin treatment and associated thrombosis, and determines the posttest probability using the results of HIT antibody testing. In this approach, the magnitude of a positive test result determines its likelihood ratio in influencing the posttest probability of HIT.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^112bxPYQ]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter on the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices.

- **Key recommendations**:
	- For patients receiving heparin in whom the clinician considers the risk of HIT to be greater than 1.0%, we recommend platelet count monitoring over no platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C).
	- For patients who are receiving heparin or have received heparin within the previous 2 weeks, we recommend investigating for a diagnosis of HIT if the platelet count falls by ≥ 50%, and/or a thrombotic event occurs, between days 5 and 14 (inclusive) following initiation of heparin, even if the patient is no longer receiving heparin therapy when thrombosis or thrombocytopenia has occurred (Grade 1C).
	- For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend the use of an alternative, nonheparin anticoagulant (danaparoid [Grade 1B], lepirudin [Grade 1C], argatroban [Grade 1C], fondaparinux [Grade 2C], or bivalirudin [Grade 2C]) over the further use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy or the initiation/continuation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) [Grade 1B].

### Current agents for the treatment of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^113oDmEw]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Several counterintuitive treatment paradoxes complicate the management of immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). For example, simple discontinuation of heparin often fails to prevent subsequent HIT-associated thrombosis. Thus, treatment guidelines recommend substituting heparin with a rapidly acting alternative anticoagulant (e.g. danaparoid, lepirudin, or argatroban) even when HIT is suspected on the basis of thrombocytopenia alone ("isolated HIT").

Another paradox involves coumarin (warfarin) anticoagulation, which can lead to venous limb gangrene in a patient with HIT-associated deep-vein thrombosis. Therefore, warfarin is not recommended during acute thrombocytopenia secondary to HIT. However, warfarin can be given as overlapping therapy with an alternative anticoagulant, provided that:

- **Initiation criteria**: Initiation of warfarin is delayed until substantial platelet count recovery has occurred (to at least above 100 × 10⁹/L).
- **Dosage criteria**: Low initial doses of warfarin are used.
- **Duration criteria**: At least 5 days of overlapping therapy are given.
- **Maintenance criteria**: The alternative agent is maintained until the platelet count has normalized.

It has recently been recognized that HIT antibodies are transient and usually do not recur upon subsequent re-exposure to heparin. This leads to a further paradox: patients with previous HIT can be considered for a brief re-exposure to heparin under exceptional circumstances, such as heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, if HIT antibodies are no longer detectable using sensitive assays. For patients with acute or recent HIT who require urgent heart surgery, other approaches…

Appropriate evaluation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is imperative because of the potentially life-threatening complications. However, overtesting and overdiagnosis of HIT are common. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) based on the HIT computerized-risk (HIT-CR) score, designed to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing. This retrospective observational study evaluated CDS that presented a platelet count versus time graph and 4Ts score calculator to clinicians who initiated a HIT immunoassay order in patients with predicted low risk (HIT-CR score 0–2). The primary outcome was the proportion of immunoassay orders initiated but cancelled after firing of the CDS advisory. Chart reviews were conducted to assess anticoagulation usage, 4Ts scores, and the proportion of patients who had HIT.

In a 20-week period, 319 CDS advisories were presented to users who initiated potentially unnecessary HIT diagnostic testing. The diagnostic test order was discontinued in 80 (25%) patients. Heparin products were continued in 139 (44%) patients, and alternative anticoagulation was not given to 264 (83%). The negative predictive value of the advisory was 98.8% (95% CI: 97.2–99.5). HIT-CR score-based CDS can reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing for HIT in patients with a low pretest probability of HIT.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^117EAKLe]. Blood Advances (2018). High credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2018 guidelines focus on screening and diagnosing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, particularly concerning indications for monitoring and recent heparin exposure. The guidelines recommend considering platelet count monitoring starting from day 0 (the day heparin is initiated) if the patient has received heparin in the previous 30 days.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^111Zwpj3]. Blood Advances (2018). High credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse drug reaction mediated by platelet-activating antibodies that target complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Patients are at markedly increased risk of thromboembolism.

These evidence-based guidelines by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about diagnosis and management of HIT. ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

The panel agreed on 33 recommendations. The recommendations address screening of asymptomatic patients for HIT, diagnosis and initial management of patients with suspected HIT, treatment of acute HIT, and special situations in patients with acute HIT or a history of HIT, including cardiovascular surgery, percutaneous cardiovascular intervention, renal replacement therapy, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Strong recommendations include the use of the 4Ts score rather than a gestalt approach for estimating the pretest probability of HIT.

### Diagnostic value of antibody-induced procoagulant platelets in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Platelet Immunology [^116sfJ5Y]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated prothrombotic disorder characterized by a drop in platelet count and an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Accurate diagnosis of HIT involves clinical assessment and laboratory testing with well-characterized functional tests. Recent research has shown the potential of investigating procoagulant platelet formation induced by HIT antibodies. To successfully implement these assays in clinical laboratories, careful consideration of technical and preanalytical factors is crucial. In this communication from the SSC Platelet Immunology, we provide a consensus from experts on the use of flow cytometry in HIT diagnosis, highlighting the importance of standardized protocols.

### Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^112sabCx]. Blood Advances (2020). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic adverse drug reaction occurring in less than 0.1% to 7% of patients receiving heparin products, depending on the patient population and type of heparin. Management of HIT is highly dependent on a sequence of tests for which clinicians may or may not have the results when care decisions need to be made.

We conducted systematic reviews of the effects of management strategies in persons with acute HIT, subacute HIT A or B, and remote HIT. We searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database through July 2019 for previously published systematic reviews and primary studies. Two investigators independently screened and extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

- **Study findings**: We found primarily noncomparative studies and case series assessing effects of treatments, which led to low to very low certainty evidence. There may be little to no difference in the effects between nonheparin parenteral anticoagulants and direct oral anticoagulants in acute HIT. The benefits of therapeutic-intensity may be greater than prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation.

- **Potential harms**: Using inferior vena cava filters or platelet transfusion may result in greater harm than not using these approaches. Evidence for management in special situations, such as for patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions or renal replacement therapy, was also low to very low certainty.

Additional research to evaluate nonheparin anticoagulants is urgently needed, and the development of novel treatments is essential.

### The timing of a positive test result for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia relative to the platelet count and anticoagulant therapy in 43 consecutive cases [^115yd2DC]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the timing of a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) test result relative to changes in platelet count and anticoagulant use. We obtained platelet counts in 100 consecutive HIT+ cases before, during, and after heparin therapy; 43 cases met study criteria and were included in study part 1. In part 2, platelet counts at the time of the HIT test in two groups (100 each HIT+ and HIT- cases) were compared.

- **Study part 1**: Cases could be divided into four groups based on the diagnosis of HIT relative to platelet counts:
	1. Within 1–2 days of a major drop in platelet count (11.6%).
	2. After more than two days of a major fall in platelet count (41.9%).
	3. In patients with already low platelet counts (27.9%).
	4. After platelet count was rising (18.6%).

- **Study part 2**: The mean platelet counts for the HIT+ and HIT- groups were almost identical. HIT should be suspected in any thrombotic patient who had a previous decline in platelet count, has a low platelet count, or has a rising platelet count following a previous decline in association with heparin exposure. In study part 2, one platelet count value at the time of the HIT test did not provide useful information.

### Recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Review and update [^1124xcuH]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is one of the most important life- and limb-threatening adverse drug events encountered by physicians. Serious sequelae associated with HIT can be avoided with early recognition and appropriate treatment. This review examines the recommendations published in 2004 by the American College of Chest Physicians on the recognition, treatment, and prevention of HIT, along with more recent data, especially regarding treatment with direct thrombin inhibitors.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: second edition [^11742UZh]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), particularly with the initiation of non-heparin anticoagulants, the BCSH 2012 guidelines recommend starting danaparoid at therapeutic doses, but not at prophylactic doses. Danaparoid is considered a suitable alternative anticoagulant for patients with HIT without thrombosis, as well as for patients being treated with direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors. It is advisable to obtain an anti-Xa assay with specific danaparoid calibrators to monitor the anticoagulant effect of danaparoid in patients who weigh over 90 kg or have a GFR of less than 30 mL/min.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114AmgmT]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

Anticipating that factors related to the study design of the primary studies might have affected the outcomes, we defined several potential sources of variability for sensitivity analyses.

- **Different strategies to diagnose HIT**: We addressed this by creating the following groups of studies: (1) clinically suspected HIT, (2) HIT diagnosed using heparin‐platelet‐factor‐4 antibody tests (H/PF4), and (3) HIT diagnosed by a washed platelet assay (serotonin release assay, SRA, or heparin‐induced platelet‐aggregation assay, HIPA).

- **Different study populations**: These were considered by grouping studies into (a) patients with HIT complicated by thrombosis at inclusion (HITT), (b) patients with isolated HIT without thrombosis (HIT), and (c) mixed patients.

- **Study design categorization**: This was categorized into (a) prospective observational studies (including single‐arm interventional studies), (b) retrospective observational studies, and (c) randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Article types classification**: These were classified as either (a) journal articles (published in a peer‐reviewed scientific journal), or (b) congress abstracts.

The following data were extracted by two investigators in parallel: first author, year of publication, type of publication, study design, number of participants, the population of participants, the diagnostic test used, age, drug, observation time, number of patients included in each treatment group, and the number of patients with (a) platelet recovery, (b) new or progressive TE, (c) major bleeding, and (d) death. Data were collected per treatment group.

### Measurement of procoagulant platelets provides mechanistic insight and diagnostic potential in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^111inN6R]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of HIT remains a challenge yet is crucial to improve outcomes. A novel flow cytometry procoagulant platelet (PP) assay accurately identifies patients with HIT. HIT antibodies induce heparin-dependent changes in PP profiles with PAR-1 stimulation. Thrombin co-stimulation with HIT plasma induces heparin-independent PP, irreversible with IV.3.

### Characterization of hospitalized cardiovascular patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^111vBhF6]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a pro-thrombotic, potentially life-threatening immune-mediated reaction to heparin exposure, in conservative and interventional cardiovascular medicine.

- **Hypothesis**: The 4T score, validated for prediction of HIT in surgical patients before, is also suitable for assessing HIT probability in cardiovascular patients with unclear thrombocytopenia.

- **Methods**: A total of 403 consecutive patients from our Department of Cardiology, Angiology and Pneumology in whom a HIT screening test was performed between 2009 and 2016 were identified. All 72 patients with a positive screening test were subjected to a functional confirmation test (heparin-induced platelet activation test, HIPA), resulting in 23 patients with serologically confirmed HIT (positive screening test, positive HIPA) and 49 patients with nonconfirmed HIT (positive screening test, negative HIPA).

- **Results**: The 4T score had a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 28.6% in our patients, suggesting that it might not sufficiently predict the clinical probability of HIT in cardiovascular patients. In both confirmed and nonconfirmed HIT, intrahospital mortality was high without a significant difference (30% in confirmed HIT vs. 43% in nonconfirmed HIT). Bacteremia was more often found in patients with nonconfirmed HIT, suggesting infection as a frequent differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in these patients (49% vs. 17%, P = 0.0185).

- **Conclusion**: HIT screening should be initiated in cardiovascular patients with unclear thrombocytopenia despite a low 4T.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114njnsk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is not only a common but also a potentially serious drug adverse effect. Unlike other drug-induced thrombocytopenias, HIT does not usually cause bleeding but instead causes thrombosis. Thrombosis in HIT can lead to limb gangrene — requiring leg amputation — or even death. HIT is mediated by an antibody that recognizes an epitope on the platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin complex. The antibody-PF4-heparin complex binds to Fc gamma RII receptors on the platelet surface and cross-links the receptors, inducing intense platelet activation and platelet aggregation, and simultaneously activates blood-coagulation pathways. These changes are probably the basis of the thrombotic events in HIT.

Diagnosis of HIT should be mainly on clinical criteria but should be confirmed whenever possible by laboratory tests, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions in whom the diagnosis of HIT cannot be made with certainty without testing. The tests for HIT antibodies are either immunoassays (e.g. ELISA) or functional tests (e.g. 14C-serotonin release assay). Once a clinical diagnosis of HIT is made, heparin should be ceased immediately, and treatment with an alternative anticoagulant, such as danaparoid, r-hirudin, or argatroban, should commence. This should continue for at least 5 days unless the diagnosis of HIT is subsequently proven to be incorrect. Warfarin should also be commenced when the patient is clinically stable and thrombosis is under control, with an overlap of a few days between warfarin and the alternative anticoagulant therapy.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113MRX9g]. Chest (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, particularly concerning the initiation of non-heparin anticoagulants and HIT with thrombosis, the ACCP 2012 guidelines recommend not initiating vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) until platelets have substantially recovered, usually to at least 150,000/mcL. VKAs should be started initially at low doses, with a maximum of 5 mg of warfarin or 6 mg of phenprocoumon, in patients with strongly suspected or confirmed HIT.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: Clinical manifestations and management strategies [^111jGtwr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a relatively frequent and usually benign clinical complication of heparin therapy. However, some patients receiving heparin and heparin-based products experience an immune-mediated reaction due to the development of heparin-induced antibodies. This reaction leads to a highly specific and paradoxical form of thrombocytopenia, known as type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Unlike other types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, HIT promotes thrombosis rather than bleeding; therefore, HIT should be suspected in patients who experience thrombotic events despite adequate anticoagulation therapy. Early identification and treatment of HIT can prevent more serious complications associated with this disorder, such as exacerbation of venous thromboembolism, limb gangrene, and skin necrosis.

Both arterial and venous thrombosis can arise from a single episode of HIT. Routine assessment of platelet counts is necessary with heparin therapy, as a decreased platelet level is usually the only indication of HIT. Although low-molecular-weight heparin therapy is less likely to result in HIT compared to unfractionated heparin, the use of these agents is contraindicated in HIT patients. Concomitant warfarin therapy is not contraindicated in such patients but must be carefully monitored. Treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor, such as lepirudin or argatroban, is an effective strategy in reversing the thrombocytopenia associated with HIT and reducing its complications. This article discusses the clinical syndrome of HIT, including pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria.

### Laboratory tests for identification or exclusion of heparin induced thrombocytopenia: HIT or miss [^116UfWMo]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially fatal condition that arises from the formation of antibodies against complexes containing heparin, usually platelet-factor 4-heparin ("anti-PF4-heparin"). Assessment for HIT involves both clinical evaluation and, if indicated, laboratory testing for confirmation or exclusion. This typically involves an initial immunological assay ("screening") and, only if positive, a secondary functional assay for confirmation.

Many different immunological and functional assays have been developed. The most common contemporary immunological assays comprise enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence, lateral flow, and particle gel techniques. The most common functional assays measure platelet aggregation or platelet activation events, such as the serotonin release assay, heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA), and flow cytometry.

All assays have some sensitivity and specificity for HIT antibodies, but they differ in terms of relative sensitivity and specificity for pathological HIT, as well as false negative and false positive error rates. This brief article provides an overview of the different available laboratory methods, as well as a suggested approach to the diagnosis or exclusion of HIT.
