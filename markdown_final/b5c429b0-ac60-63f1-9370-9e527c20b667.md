## Question

17. 14 people participate in a Japanese chess round-robin tournament, where each person plays against the other 13 people, and there are no draws in the matches. Find the maximum number of "triangles" (here, a "triangle" refers to a set of three people where each person has one win and one loss).

(2002, Japan Mathematical Olympiad (First Round))

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the maximum number of "triangles" in a round-robin tournament with 14 players, where a triangle is a set of three players such that each has one win and one loss among the three. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to model the tournament as a directed graph. Then, I should define what a triangle means in graph terms and how to count it. Next, I will consider upper bounds and whether a regular tournament could achieve them. After that, I need to check the parity constraint that arises from the total number of directed 3-cycles. Finally, I will construct an explicit example that achieves the maximum and verify the count.

> Let me first confirm the model. With 14 players and no draws, each match has a winner and a loser, so the results form a complete directed graph (a tournament) on 14 vertices, where each pair of vertices has exactly one directed edge between them. I should double-check that this correctly captures the setup before proceeding.

> Now, I need to define a "triangle" precisely. A triangle is a 3-set {A, B, C} such that each player has one win and one loss within the set; in graph terms, that means the induced subgraph on A, B, C is a directed 3-cycle (A→B→C→A or its reverse). Hold on, I should verify that this matches the problem statement, and yes, it does.

> Next, I should review how to count directed 3-cycles. The total number of 3-vertex subsets is C(14, 3) = 364. Each such subset is either transitive (a "source" beats two others who beat each other) or cyclic (a 3-cycle). So the number of triangles equals 364 minus the number of transitive triples. I need to ensure I'm not mixing up transitive and cyclic counts, and this framing is correct.

> I will now examine an upper bound. If the tournament were perfectly regular, each vertex would have out-degree 6.5, which is impossible because out-degrees must be integers. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: 13 matches per player, so average out-degree is 6.5, confirming that a regular tournament on 14 vertices cannot exist. Thus, the closest we can get is seven players with out-degree 6 and seven with out-degree 7. In a regular tournament, the number of transitive triples is minimized, so the number of cyclic triples is maximized. I should confirm the formula: in a tournament with out-degrees d_i, the number of transitive triples is Σ C(d_i, 2), and thus the number of cyclic triples is C(n, 3) − Σ C(d_i, 2). For n = 14 and d_i = 6.5, this would give 364 − 14 × C(6.5, 2) = 364 − 14 × 21.125 = 364 − 295.75 = 68.25. Since we can't have fractional cycles, the theoretical maximum is 68, but I need to check whether this is achievable with integer degrees.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the parity constraint. The total number of directed 3-cycles in any tournament has the same parity as C(n, 3) modulo 2. For n = 14, C(14, 3) = 364 ≡ 0 mod 2, so the total number of cyclic triples must be even. The fractional upper bound of 68.25 suggests a maximum of 68, but 68 is even, so parity does not immediately rule it out. I should double-check that the parity argument is sound, and yes, it is.

> Next, I should construct an explicit example that achieves 68. Let me partition the 14 players into two sets of 7, call them A and B. I will arrange that every player in A beats every player in B, and within each set I will make the subtournament as close to regular as possible. Within A, I can construct a regular tournament where each player has out-degree 3 (since 6 intra-A matches, and 3 wins is regular); similarly within B, each player has out-degree 3. I need to ensure the between-set edges are all A→B to keep the structure clean. Now, I should count cyclic triples: they can only occur within A or within B, because any triple with players from both sets will be transitive (the two A players beat the B player). Within A, the number of cyclic triples is C(7, 3) − 7 × C(3, 2) = 35 − 21 = 14; the same count holds within B. So total cyclic triples = 14 + 14 = 28. Wait, that's only 28, which is way below 68. I clearly made a mistake in the construction.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconsider the direction of the between-set edges. If I reverse all between-set edges so that every player in B beats every player in A, then cyclic triples can span both sets. Let me recalculate: cyclic triples can now be formed by choosing two players from one set and one from the other, with the single player beating the two and the two beating each other in a cycle. Specifically, choose 2 from A and 1 from B: C(7, 2) × 7 = 21 × 7 = 147 such triples; similarly, choose 2 from B and 1 from A: C(7, 2) × 7 = 147. But wait, I should verify which of these are actually cyclic. With B→A edges, a triple {A1, A2, B} is cyclic if B beats both A1 and A2, and A1 beats A2 while A2 beats A1 — no, that's contradictory. I need to correct this: for {A1, A2, B} to be a 3-cycle with B→A1 and B→A2, we would need A1→A2→B→A1 and A2→A1→B→A2, which is impossible because A1 and A2 cannot both beat each other. So my earlier assumption that all 147 × 2 are cyclic is wrong; in fact, none of those mixed triples can be cyclic because the between-set edges are unidirectional. I should confirm that the only cyclic triples remain within A and within B, totaling 28, which means my construction is still not achieving the bound.

> Let me try a different approach. Instead of forcing a bipartite structure, I should aim for degrees as close to 6.5 as possible and minimize transitive triples. With seven players at out-degree 6 and seven at out-degree 7, the number of transitive triples is 7 × C(6, 2) + 7 × C(7, 2) = 7 × 15 + 7 × 21 = 105 + 147 = 252. Therefore, the number of cyclic triples is 364 − 252 = 112. Wait, I should double-check the arithmetic: 364 − 252 is indeed 112, and 112 is even, so parity is satisfied. But hold on, I initially thought the fractional upper bound was 68; now I'm getting 112, which is larger than 68. I need to reconcile this discrepancy. The 68.25 came from assuming all degrees were 6.5, which minimizes Σ C(d_i, 2) and thus maximizes cyclic triples; however, with integer degrees, the minimum Σ C(d_i, 2) is 252, yielding 112 cyclic triples, which is the best possible with integer out-degrees. So the correct maximum is 112, not 68. I should confirm that no better integer-degree tournament can do better, and indeed, any deviation from seven 6's and seven 7's would increase Σ C(d_i, 2) and decrease cyclic triples, so 112 is optimal.

> I should now verify that such a tournament actually exists. A tournament with seven vertices of out-degree 6 and seven of out-degree 7 is feasible by Landau's theorem on score sequences, since the sum of out-degrees is C(14, 2) = 91 and the degree sequence satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions. Constructively, I can start from a regular tournament on 13 vertices (all out-degree 6) and add a 14th vertex that beats 7 players and loses to 6, adjusting the remaining edges to preserve degrees as needed; or I can use known constructions that balance degrees as evenly as possible. While I don't need to write out the full adjacency matrix, the existence is guaranteed, so the maximum of 112 is achievable.

> Final answer: The maximum number of triangles is 112. I should double-check the logic one more time: model as a tournament on 14 vertices, minimize transitive triples by making out-degrees as equal as possible (seven 6's and seven 7's), compute transitive triples as 7 × C(6, 2) + 7 × C(7, 2) = 252, and subtract from C(14, 3) = 364 to get 364 − 252 = 112 cyclic triples, which is the maximum possible and is even, satisfying the parity constraint.

The maximum number of "triangles" (sets of three players where each has one win and one loss) in a 14-player round-robin tournament with no draws is **112**. This is achieved when the tournament is as close to regular as possible, with seven players winning 7 games and seven players winning 6 games. The number of triangles is given by the formula (\\binom{n}{3} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\binom{d_i}{2}), where (d_i) is the number of wins for player (i). For (n = 14), this yields 364 − 252 = 112 triangles.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let (n = 14) be the number of players, and let (d_i) be the number of wins for player (i). The total number of games is (\\binom{14}{2} = 91), so (\\sum_{i = 1}^{14} d_i = 91). A triangle corresponds to a directed 3-cycle among three players; the number of such cycles is:

[
\\text{Number of triangles} = \\binom{14}{3} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{14} \\binom{d_i}{2}
]

This formula subtracts the number of transitive triples (those not forming a triangle) from the total number of triples.

---

## Maximizing the number of triangles

To maximize the number of triangles, we minimize (\\sum_{i = 1}^{14} \\binom{d_i}{2}), which is a convex function. By Jensen's inequality, the sum is minimized when the (d_i) are as equal as possible. The average number of wins is (91 / 14 = 6.5), so the closest integer distribution is seven players with 7 wins and seven players with 6 wins.

---

## Calculation

With seven players at 7 wins and seven at 6 wins:

[
\\sum_{i = 1}^{14} \\binom{d_i}{2} = 7 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2} + 7 \\cdot \\binom{6}{2} = 7 \\cdot 21 + 7 \\cdot 15 = 147 + 105 = 252
]

Thus, the maximum number of triangles is:

[
\\binom{14}{3} - 252 = 364–252 = 112
]

---

## Conclusion

The maximum number of triangles is **112**, achieved when the tournament is as balanced as possible with seven players winning 7 games and seven winning 6 games.

Methods

Study design and participants

This study used a prospective injury surveillance design during the 2024 UEFA EURO and CONMEBOL Copa America tournaments. We invited all 40 teams that qualified for UEFA EURO 2024 (n = 24) or CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 (n = 16), of which 39 agreed to participate in the study (table 1). We tracked the 1012 players throughout their participation in the tournaments.

Table 1
Participating teams and players, with exposure data for the three tournament phases

While environmental conditions, tactical approaches and travel distances may have influenced injury risk, these factors were not systematically recorded and are mentioned as potential contextual factors in the interpretation of the results.

UEFA EURO 2024 matches were held across 10 venues in Germany, while CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 was hosted in multiple US cities. All matches were played on natural turf. Both tournaments included a preparation phase followed by a group stage and a knockout stage (figure 1).

Figure 1
Timeline of the various phases of the tournaments.

Preparation phase: The period between teams' self-reported arrival at the tournament team base camp and their first tournament match. Teams generally use this period for training and friendly matches.
Group stage: The first part of the tournament, during which teams are divided into groups and play against each other. For UEFA EURO 2024, teams were divided across six groups. For CONMEBOL Copa America 2024, teams were divided across four groups. Each team played three matches during the group stage.
Knockout stage: The final stage of the tournament in which only the winners of each stage play in the next stage, until one competitor or team is the final winner. This was from a round of 16 to the final, a maximum of four matches for both tournaments.

Data collection commenced on the first day of training camps and concluded on the day of each team's final match in the tournament. Consequently, teams' participation varied depending on the duration of their preparation phase and progression through the competition. All participating teams sent us complete data.

### Injuries in the emerging sport of roundnet (spikeball): a cross-sectional study of 166 players [^9a3a9055]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Roundnet is a four-player ball sport where teams are composed of two players each positioned around a circular net. Similar to volleyball, once the ball is served to the opposing team, the two players on one team may touch the ball up to three times before having to hit the ball back onto the net, at which time it is conversely the other team's turn to return the ball to the net. The team that fails to return the ball back onto the net within three touches loses the point, and games are played until one team reaches 21 points. Roundnet has recently gained popularity with over 4 million competitive and recreational players worldwide. People often play the game casually; however, competitive tournaments started in the past decade, and many players train and compete across a 6-month competitive season currently known as the Spikeball Tour Series as well as other emerging leagues and tournaments. The first four levels of play (beginner, intermediate, advanced and contender) are open to any athlete, while the fifth level (premier) and sixth (professional) levels of competition are earned through tournament performance during the season. In 2022, the first roundnet world championship was held in Belgium, with over 30 countries competing in men's, women's and mixed (men+women) divisions.

Youth sports — scheduling and age-related risk — concerns include "year-round training in a single sport and simultaneous involvement in multiple teams in the same sport", and "Tournament scheduling, where several games are often played in a single day, extending over consecutive days, is also a potential factor". In elite soccer, "elite soccer players younger than age 14 sustained more acute and overuse injuries in training compared to older players", with "The frequency was highest early in the season for the younger players, compared to older players who suffered more game-related injuries". Across sports, "high workloads between bouts of activity are consistently associated with increased injury risk".

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^723cc338]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Adult tennis

On-court sweating rates and related sodium losses in adult tennis players are generally comparable to those in older adolescents (though they are often much greater for some adults) during intense practice and competitive play.

Hornery et al examined 14 male professional tennis players (21.4 (2.6) years) during international tournament competition on hard courts in the heat (32.0 (4.5)°C) and clay courts in somewhat less stressful environmental conditions (25.4 (3.8)°C). Postmatch body mass deficits were significantly greater during hard court competition (1.05 (0.49)%) compared to only 0.32 (0.56)% following the clay court matches. Tippet et al assessed seven professional women players during outdoor tournament play on hard courts in similar hot environmental conditions (30.36 (2.36)°C). Although the on-court sweating rate was extensive with 2.0 (0.5) L/h, postplay body weight deficits were only modest (1.2 (1.0)%).

Bergeron et al evaluated 20 (12 male and 8 female) tennis players from two Division I university tennis teams during three successive days of competitive round-robin play (ie, 2 singles tennis matches followed by 1 doubles match per day) in a hot environment (32.2 (1.5)°C and 53.9 (2.4)% relative humidity at 1200 h). During singles play, percentage changes in body weight were minimal and similar for all players (men: –1.3 (0.8)%, women: –0.7 (0.8)%), and estimated losses (mmol/day) of sweat sodium (men: 158.7; women: 86.5) were generally met by daily dietary intake. However, as with many older adolescent players, on-court and consequent daily accumulated body water and sodium losses and deficits can be much greater from extensive sweating and often need to be more deliberately replaced to adequately rehydrate and maintain more optimal body water retention and distribution, especially with successive days of training or tournament play.

### Impact of movie and video game elements on tic manifestation in children [^5c981e60]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

game

In ZenithX, inspired by the games Ladders and Snakes and War, the participant competes with three opponents. They move their tokens along a numbered grid, aiming to be the first to reach the end. Card battles and subsequent card retrieval are part of the gameplay. The strength of the bot opponents and the expectancy of the card regained from an animated chest are represented by the colors of the token and chest (Gold > Silver > Wood). The game is illustrated and explained in Figure 1 and Video S1. Participants were introduced to the game rules through a presentation by the research assistant, followed by a trial game. They played four consecutive rounds, with scores accumulated between rounds. They were told that the player with the highest total score at the end of the last round would win and receive 100 ILS. The task lasted approximately 60 min.

In Experiment 1, we scripted the course of the game, including the series of cards regained from the chests in each step. The only unexpected parameter was the participant's card selection during the battle, which we addressed by forcing repeating draws until the prescripted outcome was possible. We prescripted four alternative game rounds with the participant winning two rounds and the overall session. The cards retrieved from the chests were randomized based on the probabilities shown in Figure S1. In the replication study, participants played against bots only. We randomized the game parameters as described in Table 1.

Measures

User Engagement Scale

After playing four rounds of the game, participants were administered the short Hebrew version of the User Engagement Scale.

Tic annotation

To allow tic coding with high temporal resolution, we employed Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software. For more details on the coding procedure, see Data S1.

Two trained research assistants cocoded 20% of each subject's video data to assess interrater reliability. Later, one of the research assistants coded the complete video data, dedicating a separate session for each tic event to ensure detailed and accurate identification of each tic type. All coding was conducted by coders blinded to the condition. Data S1 provide further information on interrater reliability and missing data. In Experiment 2, a trained research assistant sat alongside the participant and recorded tics in real time by pressing a key whenever a tic was observed.

Analysis

Analysis methods are described per hypothesis in Data S1.

### Tennis injury data from the championships, wimbledon, from 2003 to 2012 [^5d2addd1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure

In the consensus statement on epidemiological studies of medical conditions in tennis it was argued that exposure should be calculated using the duration of play. Detailed exposure data may be collected within prospective study designs, albeit typically missing practising hours. For retrospective data, a surrogate for exposure may be used, such as match exposures or number of sets played. For this study we calculated the number of sets played per year for singles, doubles and mixed doubles (singles counted as 2 player exposures and doubles counted as 4 player exposures per set) and expressed the rate of injury as the number of injuries per 1000 sets played. The total number of sets played through the Championships main draw is reasonably consistent across the study period with a mean of 1221 (range 1141–1258). This represents a total of 33 790 'player sets' (see table 1) with an annual mean of 3379 (range 3070–3546). Each year, the men play an average of 2011 sets and the ladies 1368 sets.

Table 1
Numbers of sets played at The Championships, Wimbledon, 2003–2012

New presentations to the sports physicians were defined as being acute, recurrent or chronic. Acute injuries were further classified as being 'acute new' (occurring during The Championships) or 'acute prior' (occurring at some point before arriving at Wimbledon, eg, during a previous tournament). Those injuries occurring within 8 weeks of recovery from a similar injury to same site were classified as recurrent. Those injuries that were pre-existing and ongoing prior to the start of the tournament were classified as chronic.

Analysis

Owing to the retrospective nature of these data and injuries included that occurred prior to The Championships, formal analysis of injury incidence was considered inappropriate. The numerator data include all musculoskeletal presentations to the sports physicians during the 2-week period of The Championships Main Draw. The denominator is the number of sets of tennis played during this same period. As the numerator includes players presenting with injuries occurring both before and during The Championships, it should be stressed that these data do not represent the true incidence of injury occurrence during play through The Championships. They do, however, provide the reader with a realistic and practical insight into the burden of and trends in musculoskeletal presentations at a Grand Slam tennis tournament over a 10-year period.

### In-match physical demands on elite Japanese rugby union players using a global positioning system [^6e6a8801]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Design

Data were collected using GPS units with built-in accelerometers during official matches from one team belonging to the Japan Rugby top league. The team played 14 matches in 2013 (4 wins–10 losses record), 16 matches in 2014 (6 wins–10 losses) and 15 matches in 2015 (4 wins–10 losses–one draw), that is, a total of 45 matches (14 wins–30 losses–one draw) over three seasons. As the Japan Rugby top league is the pre-eminent rugby competition in Japan, the data collected for this study can be said to be that of elite rugby union. We analysed the raw data from players who played full matches over three seasons and calculated the physical demands in terms of distance travelled, accelerations and impacts. We then statistically analysed these calculations for the forward and back groups and for each individual position.

Participants

Data were obtained from one team belonging to the Japan Rugby top league. The participants were 15 starting members in each match (n = 675). However, we excluded those players who did not play the full 80 min duration (ie, those who underwent substitution for any reason). A total of 298 subjects (forwards: age 27.9 ± 3.0 years, height 183.1 ± 6.3 cm and body mass 100.3 ± 7.2 kg, backs: age 27.7 ± 2.7 years, height 173.9 ± 7.8 cm and body mass 84.2 ± 11.8 kg) were used in the sample analysis.

GPS unit data from the matches were collected from dedicated teams. The objectives and possible limitations of the study were explained to potential subjects. Written consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrolment. This research was done without patient involvement.

### Mass participation and tournament event management for the team physician: a consensus statement (2022 update) [^c58cc1ea]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Mass participation events include endurance events (e.g., marathon, triathlon) and/or competitive tournaments (e.g., baseball, tennis, football (soccer) tournaments). Event management requires medical administrative and participant care planning. Medical management provides safety advice and care at the event that accounts for large numbers of participants, anticipated injury and illness, variable environment, repeated games or matches, and mixed age groups of varying athletic ability. This document does not pertain to the care of the spectator.

### Injury incidence and patterns in men's UEFA EURO 2024 and CONMEBOL copa America 2024: descriptive findings from two simultaneously staged tournaments [^bda58869]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Pre-existing injuries

A finding in this study was the number of players selected for UEFA EURO and CONMEBOL Copa America despite having pre-existing injuries. A total of 14 players (12 in UEFA EURO and 2 in CONMEBOL Copa America) were included in their squads while already injured, with three never returning to play during the tournament. This highlights the complexity of player selection decisions, which may involve a mix of medical assessments, competitive strategy and team dynamics. While the inclusion of players recovering from injury is not unusual, it may influence squad depth and readiness in short-format tournaments. Furthermore, pressuring players to recover in time for major tournaments might increase the risk of reinjury or prolonged post-tournament recovery, affecting both club and national team performances in the following season.

Practical implications

Our findings highlight the necessity for improved injury prevention and management strategies at international tournaments. By pinpointing critical areas of concern, stakeholders — including team medical staff, coaches, tournament organisers and governing bodies — can adopt more effective measures to safeguard players and enhance performance.

Stronger pretournament injury management

The selection of injured players poses risks for individual players. With 17 players selected despite having pre-existing injuries and 3 never returning to play, stricter guidelines might be needed before final squad selection. Collaborative decision-making between club and national team medical staff can help ensure players are not rushed into competition prematurely, reducing reinjury risks and minimising long-term consequences.

Tournament-specific injury prevention strategies

Although we did not directly measure contextual factors, previous research suggests that environmental conditions, match location, travel fatigue and playing style can influence injury risk in elite football. Such contextual elements should be considered when designing future multicentre surveillance efforts or tailoring prevention strategies to specific tournaments or regions. Addressing contextual elements can help stakeholders take a proactive approach to injury prevention, ensuring that players perform at their peak and maintain long-term health and career longevity. The continued harmonisation of injury surveillance across international tournaments will further support the development of evidence-based, globally applicable injury prevention strategies.

### Deep reinforcement learning can promote sustainable human behaviour in a common-pool resource problem [^3d4d2b37]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Training virtual players (BC1)

Based on Train Set 1, we trained virtual human players via behaviour cloning, an imitation learning technique that involves training virtual players or "clones" to mimic human gameplay.

A virtual human player is a deep neural network that emulates the behaviour of a single player. This means that we use the observations of a single participant to predict their action at each timestep (since we have four players, we obtain four times as many reciprocation actions as rounds in an episode). To account for the inherent noise in human data, we employed a probabilistic neural network to model the behaviour of the player. Specifically, we model their action predictions as a categorical uniform distribution, which is explained in further detail below.

The neural network's inputs match the observations of the real human players. The network takes in: the offers made by the mechanism to each player in the current round,(represented by four real numbers), the contributions made by all players in the previous round(other four real numbers), and the current size of the pool(one real number), resulting in a 9-dimensional input. All inputs were normalised by being divided by 200, which denotes the maximum size of the common pool. The output of the network is a single number representing the prediction of the focal player's contribution for the next round. The virtual player network architecture comprises a memory core, namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), surrounded by several fully connected (FC) layers (see Table S1 for details). The first 2 fully connected layers encode the input into an initial neural representation, which is then passed to the memory layer. The fact that recurrent neural networks are part of the architecture of the virtual players means that they can potentially learn to keep track of the past and use the game history to make their predictions about what to contribute this round. The final 2 FC layers make a set of non-linear projections, followed by a final linear projection onto a N-dimensional space, representing N bins of a categorical distribution. These bins split the space of continuous numbers form 0 to the offerreceived by the focal player this round. A softmax function applied to these N logits to discreetly determine the most likely bin, call it max_bin = argmax(softmax(logits)). Then, we sample uniformly from the continuous interval [max_bin, max_bin+1) to determine the proportion of the offer received that the focal player would reciprocate this round. Please refer to Fig. S15, which illustrates a schematic representation of the architecture employed for modelling virtual players.

### Patients with basal ganglia damage show preserved learning in an economic game [^a47b5d17]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Procedure

Following task instructions and a comprehension quiz, participants were administered two blocks of strategic and non-strategic condition trials, each containing 80 rounds. All choices were conducted using hypothetical payoffs and no feedback, with order of the strategic and non-strategic blocks counterbalanced across participants within each cohort. We first conducted a behavioral session where 16 healthy subjects played the Patent Race for two sessions of 80 rounds each using a random matching protocol. We will refer to these subjects as "pool players". Players switched Strong and Weak roles at the end of the first 80 rounds.

In the strategic condition, lesion patients and healthy control subjects played against these pool players. Importantly, they played in the same sequence as pool players. For example, if the patient was on round 60, the opponent's choice would be drawn randomly from round 60 of one of the pool players. We used the random matching protocol in the strategic condition for two reasons. First, this protocol requires a reasonable number of subjects to ensure that the probability of repeated interaction is small. Otherwise, subjects may be able to develop hierarchical mental models in order to collude with or trick the paired opponents. Second, it helps to preserve the dynamics of the evolution of play in the experiment, and control for the inter-group variation that would arise if we used more than one group of pool subjects.

In the non-strategic condition, we replaced the human pool players with a matching computer algorithm. Participants were told to choose an investment that must exceed a randomly generated hurdle to succeed, and were not told how the computer generated the hurdle. In behavioral pilots, we generated randomness using two different methods. The first is a stationary distribution using the proportion of strategies chosen in the human population. The second method essentially replicates the human treatment, in that we sampled trial-by-trial from the empirical time series of the population play from the human pool players. We found that learning in both non-strategic treatments was driven by reinforcement rather than belief learning. Here we used the second method to precisely match the sequence of stimuli across social and non-social conditions.

### Medical reasons behind player departures from male and female professional tennis competitions [^c04601e9]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The number of retirements, withdrawals, and "lucky losers" (the replacement of a player who withdraws before the start of the tournament by a losing player from the qualifying round) from professional tennis tournaments has increased, but the reasons behind such departures have not yet been analyzed. An official consensus statement has been conducted to allow a general categorization of injuries in tennis.

Purpose

To determine the reasons for departure and injury rates in professional tennis.

Study Design

Descriptive epidemiology study.

Methods

All reasons for departures were collected from official Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) web pages. All tournaments apart from the 4 major competitions (the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) were included for the period 2001–2012 for men and women. Personal data, tournament information, surface, match setting, date, and reason were obtained for each departure scenario.

Results

Variations in departure and injury rates were seen throughout the season. Women left and were injured significantly more than men. Women mainly left because of thigh injuries, whereas men left mainly because of back injuries. Playing surface only had an influence on the risk of lower back injuries. Only women's departures were affected by the tournament round.

Conclusion

A high number of departures from tournaments have occurred during the past 10 years on the ATP and WTA circuits. Injuries were the main reasons of these departures, regardless of the type of departure and player sex. The back and thigh were the main locations of injuries for men and women, respectively.

### Social cognition and decision-making in people with methamphetamine use disorder [^35ac3c68]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Social decision‐making measures

Interpersonal trust: Trust game

Participants were instructed to collaborate with another player (the investor), which is — unbeknown to the participant — simulated by an adaptive algorithm that draws responses from a dataset of human players (see Supporting information for details). Across each of the 10 rounds, the investor was given $20 of digital currency and decided how much to keep and how much to invest. The amount invested was multiplied by three and given to the participant. The trustee (the participant) then decided at the end of each round how much of these returns they would give back to the investor. Participants were instructed that after the task, they could claim a reimbursement based on a scaled version of the total amount of money earned.

Aggression: CRTT

Across 25 CRTT trials, participants needed to outperform a simulated opponent by pressing a key quicker during interactions designed to assess provoked and non‐provoked punishment responses. Participants were instructed that the opponent player was a different person than who played the trust game. Before each trial, players set the punishment intensity their opponent would receive if they lost. The punishment was noise, delivered via headphones, ranging between eight intensity levels. The outcome (win/loss) of each trial depended on the participant's reaction time and the outcome of the previous trials, and the punishment settings of the opponent followed a pseudo‐randomised order.

Demographic and clinical measures

Socio‐demographic variables (e.g. age, gender and education) were collected via an ad hoc survey and verbal IQ was estimated using the National Adult Reading test. We used well‐validated tools to characterise methamphetamine use patterns [Timeline Followback (TLFB)] and severity [Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS)], early adverse experiences [Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACES)] and quality of life (World Health Organisation Brief Quality of Life scale). We additionally assessed co‐occurring depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale–Revised (CESD‐R)], anger expression (State–Trait Anger Expression Inventory) and psychotic experiences (Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences).

### Illness during the 2010 super 14 rugby union tournament-a prospective study involving 22 676 player days [^7190b883]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Illness accounts for a significant proportion of consultations with a team physician travelling with elite athletes.

Objective

To determine the incidence, type, cause and consequences of illness in Rugby Union players participating in a 16-week tournament.

Setting

8 teams participating in the 2010 Super 14 Rugby tournament Participants A cohort of 259 elite rugby players from eight teams was recruited.

Assessment

All players were followed daily over the 16-week competition period (22 676 player days). Each day, team physicians completed an illness log with 100% compliance. Information included the daily squad size and illness details including system affected, final diagnosis, type and onset of symptoms, training/match days lost and suspected cause.

Main Outcome Measurement

Incidence of illness (illness per 1000 player days).

Results

The incidence of illness in the cohort was 20.7/1000 player days (95% CI 18.5 to 23.1) with the highest incidence of illness in the respiratory system (6.4: 95% CI 5.5 to 7.3), gastrointestinal system (5.6: 95% CI 4.9 to 6.6) and the skin and subcutaneous tissue (4.6; 95% CI 4.0 to 5.4). Infections accounted for 54.5% of all illness and 26.1% of illness resulted in time loss of ≥ 1 day. In over 50% of illnesses, symptoms were present for ≥ 1 day before being reported to the team physician.

Conclusion

Infective illness involving the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract together with dermatological illness was common in elite rugby players participating in this international tournament. A delay in reporting of symptoms > 24 h could have important clinical implications in player medical care.

### Intranasal oxytocin interacts with testosterone reactivity to modulate parochial altruism [^a43c2a95]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedure

To control for diurnal rhythms in circulating oxytocin and testosterone levels, all experimental sessions were scheduled for 14:00, in keeping with the recommended guidelines for oxytocin administration studies. After signing a written consent form, participants were seated in front of computers in cubicles, the first saliva sample (Time-1) was collected, and participants completed the mood assessment measure. Then, participants self-administered either oxytocin or placebo. Twenty-five minutes after the administration (in which participants were sitting in the lab with their cell phones turned off, instructed not to speak, and provided with National Geographic magazines to read), a second saliva sample (Time-2) was collected, and participants completed an unrelated experiment. Approximately 52 m after hormone administration, the third saliva sample (Time-3) was collected, and participants were block-randomized (stratified by treatment) and assigned to two-player groups. Each group was composed of either two players who received oxytocin or two players who received placebo. Groups were composed of either two male participants, two female participants or one male and one female participant. Participants were not informed regarding the treatment and sex of their ingroup members and the outgroup members. Following the groups-assignment and the collection of the third saliva sample, approximately 55 m after hormone administration, participants completed 30 rounds of the intergroup chicken game against a competing group which received the opposite treatment. That is, a group that was composed of players who received oxytocin played against a group that was composed of players who received placebo (group-compositions remained constant throughout the experiment). Participants were not informed in advance the number of rounds to be played. Participants signaled their investment intentions by pressing (invest signaling) or releasing (non-invest signaling) the spacebar key. In each round, a brief reminder of the instructions was displayed at the center of the screen, as well as a countdown timer and four circles that represented the players' intention signaling (see Fig. 2).

### Hydration and thermal strain during tennis in the heat [^a678bb3d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The findings highlighted in this review could be interpreted as suggesting that there should not be much concern for tennis players training and competing in the heat, as these reported fluid deficits and thermal strain responses appear to be very manageable and non-threatening. This viewpoint is only reinforced by the intermittent, somewhat self-paced nature of tennis competition that additionally includes regular longer periods of inactivity and opportunities to rehydrate, cool down and recover on changeovers. However, the data featured here and other currently available reported findings are collectively limited in scope. There is a critical need to monitor players during longer, more intense 3-set and 5-set competitive matches played in the afternoon in more extreme (which can be, at times, near uncompensable) environments during later rounds of tournaments where potentially there would be greater body water deficits and increasingly greater thermal strain, as well as more prominent carry-over effects from previous rounds of play. Additional studies using non-tennis repeated-bout, intermittent exercise in the heat could provide important supplementary insight as well. Moreover, currently considered and proposed risk reduction protocols such as preplay and on-court cooling, enhanced hydration and effectiveness of between-set cooling and between-match recovery strategies for able-bodied players and those participating in wheelchair tennis also need to be better clarified and validated for effectiveness during actual competition. Addressing all of these and other research gaps are critical to providing sufficient information to develop and support more effective and practical evidence-based player preparation and management recommendations and guidelines for playing tennis in the heat.

### Applied sports science and sports medicine in women's rugby: systematic scoping review and Delphi study to establish future research priorities [^7e80b04a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Rugby union, rugby league and rugby sevens are all codes of rugby (rugby codes collectively referred to as 'rugby' hereafter). Men and women play rugby at junior, senior, amateur and elite levels. At the elite level, each team in rugby union, rugby league and rugby sevens matches consists of 15, 13 and 7 players, respectively, on the pitch, with 8, 4 and 5 players, respectively, on the bench as interchanges or substitutions. There are rule variations at lower performance levels (eg, in rugby union, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) has stipulated not more than five replacements and substitutions at levels 3 and 4, and not more than three replacements and substitutions at levels 5 and below). Players are broadly categorised into the positional playing groups of forwards or backs. Specialist positions within the broad positional categories exist for each rugby code. Match duration can vary by country. For example, women's rugby union and rugby league in England are played over two 40 min halves. In the Australian women's rugby league domestic competition, each half is 30 min in length, less than the Australian women's rugby union competition and the domestic women's rugby league competition in England, which is 40 min per half. Although rugby sevens is played under essentially the same rules as rugby union, it is played over 7 min halves. Rugby sevens is typically played in a tournament-style format, with five to six games played over 2–3 days. Another key difference between the rugby codes is that when the ball leaves the field of play, rugby union and rugby sevens restart with a line-out, whereas rugby league restarts with a scrum. Additionally, following a tackle, in rugby union and rugby sevens, players can contest the ball via ruck or maul, whereas rugby league requires a play-the-ball. In rugby union, a ruck involves one or more players from each team, close around the ball, which is on the ground, while a maul consists of a ball carrier and at least one player from each team, bound together and on their feet. In rugby league, a play-the-ball is the act of bringing the ball into play after a tackle.

### Injury surveillance in the world football tournaments 1998–2012 [^03645c64]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The injury rates in the various types of FIFA World Cups had different trends over the past 14 years. These changes might have been influenced by the playing style, refereeing, extent and intensity of match play. Strict application of the Laws of the Games is an important means of injury prevention. More detailed studies (eg, on injury mechanism, refereeing in injury situations or the number of matches played) are needed to make specific recommendations for injury prevention in top-level tournaments.

What are the new findings?

On average, the incidence of time-loss injuries was highest in the FIFA World Cups and lowest in the FIFA U17 Women's World Cups.
The incidence of time-loss injuries was similar in male and female players when the same types of tournaments were compared, except for the FIFA World Cup.
The incidence of injuries in male players decreased in the FIFA World Cups and in the football tournaments of the Olympic Games from 1998 to 2012. The opposite trend was observed for female players in the FIFA Women's World Cups 1999 to 2007, the football tournaments of the Olympic Games 2000 to 2008, and the FIFA U17 Women's World Cups 2008 to 2012.
Changes in the injury rates might have been influenced by the playing style and refereeing.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Strict application of the Laws of the Games and Fair Play are important aspects of injury prevention in top-level international football tournaments.
Referees should be educated on their influence on injury rates.
Decreasing the number of matches played, especially for the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup players, might contribute to a reduction in injury rates.
More research is needed on risk factors for non-contact injuries, especially in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup players.

### Returning persons with SARS-CoV-2 to the field of play in professional golf: a risk assessment and risk reduction approach [^eec6df33]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Results

During the study period, there were two professional golf events conducted in South Africa. There was a total of 378 player episodes and 378 caddie episodes during the study period.

Feasibility and practicality

Players, caddies and event staff were briefed on the protocols. Players and caddies were supportive of the protocols, with no players or caddies voicing any opposition to their implementation. COVID-19 team and medical officers did not report any increased burden of work beyond the initial briefings.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission

Three accredited persons tested positive while at events during the study period (0.4% of person episodes). The positive tests were returned from two players and one caddie, all of whom were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Positive antigen tests were confirmed with RT-PCR on-site. During these events, there were 15 players who declared non-defining symptoms, for example, headache or sore throat. All tested negative on rapid antigen testing. There was no transmission of COVID-19 during the first event, with all subjects testing negative on entry testing for subsequent events, and no playing partners developing symptoms. Three positive participants were provided with medical surveillance but did not require any treatment nor required hospital admission.

Contacts

One person was classified as a high-risk contact, while monitoring was conducted on the caddies and playing group of the positive participants (despite these persons being socially distanced). The individual defined as a high-risk contact had shared accommodation with a positive player immediately prior to the first event of the study. They were fully vaccinated, asymptomatic and tested negative on antigen testing daily for 7 consecutive days post-exposure. A summary of findings can be seen in figure 1.

Figure 1
Visual summary of the results of returning persons with SARS-CoV-2 to the field of play in professional golf.

Local COVID-19 rates

The number of players per event and local rates of COVID-19 at the time of the tournament can be seen in table 1. Local COVID-19 rates were reported on the date of the first day of the event. If this was not available, a weekly average was used. The number of daily cases per 100 000 of the population during the first and second event was 2 per 100 000 (table 1), although case ascertainment is thought to be < 20% in this phase of the pandemic in South Africa.

### Injury incidence and patterns in men's UEFA EURO 2024 and CONMEBOL copa America 2024: descriptive findings from two simultaneously staged tournaments [^a3a8ba08]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

Exposure

UEFA EURO had 622 players contributing 14 359 hours of exposure, with 12 075 hours (84%) during training and 2284 hours (16%) during matches, across 471 training sessions and 80 matches, including 29 friendly matches. Similarly, CONMEBOL Copa America involved 390 players providing 6968 hours of exposure, with 6003 hours (86%) during training and 965 hours (14%) during matches, over 202 training sessions and 29 matches, all of which were competitive. This resulted in 673 training sessions and 110 matches, for a total of 18 078 hours of training and 3249 match hours, respectively (table 1).

Pre-existing injuries

At the start of the tournament, 17 players with pre-existing injuries were selected. Of these, three did not return to play during the tournament, so we excluded them from further analyses (table 2).

Table 2
Injury numbers and injury rates (number of new injuries per 1000 hours of tournament exposure) for the different tournament phases

Injury rates

Across both tournaments, 85 new injuries were recorded: 32 during training and 53 during matches. This corresponds to an overall injury rate of 4.0 injuries per 1000 hours (95% CI: 3.1 to 4.8). As expected, the injury rate for training was significantly lower than that for match play: 1.8 injuries per 1000 hours (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.4) vs 16.3 injuries per 1000 hours (95% CI: 11.9 to 20.7) (table 2).

Overall injury rates were similar across both tournaments, with 3.9 injuries per 1000 hours (95% CI: 2.9 to 4.9) for UEFA EURO and 4.2 per 1000 hours (95% CI: 2.6 to 5.7) for CONMEBOL Copa America. Match injury rates appeared slightly higher in CONMEBOL Copa America (18.7 vs 15.3 per 1000 hours), although the wide and overlapping CIs suggest no meaningful difference.

### Retrospective study of the use of medication and supplements during the 2018 FIFA world cup russia [^c6031ec8]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

During the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the team doctors had to share details of all medications taken by the players 72 hours preceding the match, submitting this information for the first time with the help of an online reporting tool. The definition of substance groups remained the same as the one used previously, namely, NSAIDs, analgesics, injected glucocorticosteroids and local anaesthetics, muscle relaxants, respiratory drugs, medication for gastrointestinal and antimicrobial purposes, psychotropic substances, other medications and supplements. In line with previous studies conducted by FIFA, paracetamol and metamizole were counted as analgesics. All supplements taken by a player prior to a match were counted as one supplement regardless of the number of substances involved.

For the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 32 countries qualified, each with a squad of 23 players, which gave a total of 736 players participating at the tournament. Sixty-four matches were played, resulting in 2944 data sets of medication intake. The group stage featured 48 matches and the knockout stage 16. The minimum number of matches a team could play was three and the maximum was seven.

Data presentation and statistical analysis

The results were presented as follows: (1) average number of medications taken per player per match or during the tournament and (2) average percentage of players using at least one medication per match or during the tournament.

The statistical methods applied were frequencies and means, presented with SD, 95% CIs and unpaired t-tests. The significance level was p ≤ 0.05.

### Elite athletes travelling to international destinations > 5 time zone differences from their home country have a 2-3-fold increased risk of illness [^cbfb6aa1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Illness accounts for a significant proportion of consultations with a team physician travelling with elite athletes.

Objective

To determine if international travel increases the incidence of illness in rugby union players participating in a 16-week tournament.

Setting

2010 Super 14 Rugby Union tournament.

Participants

259 elite rugby players from eight teams were followed daily over the 16-week competition period (22 676 player-days).

Assessment

Team physicians completed a logbook detailing the daily squad size and illness in any player (system affected, final diagnosis, type and onset of symptoms, training/match days lost and suspected cause) with 100% compliance. Time periods during the tournament were divided as follows: located and playing in the home country before travelling (baseline), located and playing abroad in countries > 5 h time zone difference (travel) and located back in the home country following international travel (return).

Main Outcome Measurement

Incidence of illness (illness per 1000 player-days) during baseline, travel and return.

Results

The overall incidence of illness in the cohort was 20.7 (95% CI 18.5 to 23.1). For all teams, the incidence of illness according to location and travelling was significantly higher in the time period following international travel (32.6; 95% CI 19.6 to 53.5) compared with the baseline (15.4; 95% CI 8.7 to 27.0) or after returning to their home country (10.6; 95% CI 6.1 to 18.2).

Conclusions

There is a higher incidence of illness in athletes following international travel to a foreign country that is > 5 h time difference and this returns to baseline on return to the home country.

### Extortion subdues human players but is finally punished in the prisoner's dilemma [^f391bf66]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Results

Performance of ZD strategies against humans

Figure 1 shows the resulting average payoffs over all 60 rounds of the game, across the 4 treatments. These results confirm that the two extortionate ZD strategies indeed gain higher payoffs than their human co-players. For example, in the strong extortion treatment, the computer programme obtained an average payoff of π ES = [euro]0.192 per round, whereas the human subjects earned on average(Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, n ES = 16 human co-players, Z = 3.523, P < 0.001). Similarly, the mildly extortionate ZD strategy received a payoff of π EM = [euro]0.208, which clearly exceeds the mean payoff of the human opponents,(Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, n EM = 14, Z = 3.181, P = 0.001).

Conversely, in the two generosity treatments human subjects had the upper hand, as expected. In the mild generosity treatment, the ZD strategy earned π GM = [euro]0.235, as compared with the human subjects' mean payoff(Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, n GM = 14, Z = −2.527, P = 0.012). Lastly, the strong generosity treatment resulted in an average payoff of π GS = [euro]0.237 for the ZD strategy andfor the human co-players (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, n GS = 16, Z = −2.521, P = 0.012). Thus, extortionate strategies dominated their respective co-players, whereas generous strategies let their co-players succeed. These results are in line with the theory of ZD strategies, which in fact makes virtually no assumptions about human play. In addition, the relationship between the payoffs of the ZD strategist and the human co-player fits reasonably to the linear prediction, as illustrated by Fig. 2, despite the fact that the experimental game is only played for a finite number of rounds (see Methods).

tw Chinese Professional Baseball League Overview: The league, which began in 1990, is still recovering from the September 1997 conviction of 21 players, a coach and 12 others of various charges related to fixing games. In July 2005, a second game-fixing scandal unfolded, and is still playing out. Today, six teams play a roughly 100-game regular season from early-March to mid-October, with the campaign decidedly "two seasons". The playoff format dictates the winner of the first half play the winner of the second half in a seven-game "Taiwan Series" that fall. If the two half-season leaders are claimed by the same club, the team with the second highest winning percentage is the Taiwan Series challenger. CPBL teams usually play three to four games per week and therefore carry just three starting pitchers. Most games are played in the evenings because it's hot as holy hell during daylight.

### Industry-supported healthcare programme for concussion management in junior community Australian football [^b228c5ce]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Outcomes and analysis

In 2023, 9852 players (7523 boys and 2329 girls) were registered to play in the league, and the season consisted of 14 in-season rounds with a 3-round finals series for qualifying teams for age groups ≥ u11s. The study commenced in round 4 of the 2023 season, with missing data for the first three rounds not imputed; thus, recruitment and data collection occurred over 11 in-season rounds and finals.

To address the study's aim, the following feasibility outcomes were collected and assessed as per Bowen et al

Demand: Evaluated via the rate of participant recruitment into the study, tracked as a weekly overall count and defined as a rate based on 11 in-season rounds and 3 rounds of finals.
Implementation: Evaluated as the percentage of players who attend all recommended medical appointments, as directed by the physician, and reported descriptively as counts and percentages.
Acceptability: Parent/carer(s) acceptability of the industry-supported healthcare programme was assessed via adapted post-intervention questions from the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire, consistent with previous healthcare feasibility trials. The specific acceptability questions asked are outlined in online supplemental appendix B. In brief, parent/carer(s) were asked for their confidence in recommending the healthcare programme to a friend or family member with SRC (scored on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) as well as their feelings towards the industry-supported healthcare programme and its outcome (measured on a five-point Likert scale). Data on acceptability were reported descriptively as medians and IQRs as well as counts and percentages.
Adherence: Adherence was defined based on the following recommendations outlined in the 2021 AFL guidelines: Returning to schooling prior to returning to play. Returning to play no earlier than 12 days, with RTP defined as the player resuming game participation in the junior community football league. The fastest a player can progress through the graded programme, according to the 2021 AFL guidelines, was 12 days; therefore, based on the fixture resulting in one game per round, players with SRC miss at least one game by default. Receiving a formal medical clearance to RTP (ie, a medical certificate outlining clearance to RTP provided to the player (parent/carer(s)) by the physician).

### Injury incidence and patterns in men's UEFA EURO 2024 and CONMEBOL copa America 2024: descriptive findings from two simultaneously staged tournaments [^a97f1e53]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Injury severity and burden

Most injuries (32 out of 85, or 38%) were severe, with time-loss beyond 28 days, followed by minimal injuries (24 out of 85, or 28%) (figure 2). Of the 20 players injured during the preparation phase, 11 were unavailable for their team's first tournament match, of which 2 did not return during the tournament. The total number of days lost, together with median days lost and quartiles, is presented in table 3.

Figure 2
The severity of injuries during the different phases of the tournament.

Table 3
Time loss and injury burden, split by tournament impact (tournament days lost) and overall impact (total days injured)

We considered that some players recovered beyond the tournaments' duration. Figure 3 provides a breakdown of injury onset and return to play across the tournament phase and beyond. Of the 65 players injured during the tournament phases, 34 did not return to play before the end of their tournament, and 8 sustained an injury in their last tournament match. All but two players returned to play for their respective clubs at the start of the 24/25 season.

Figure 3
Overview of when injuries were sustained and when players returned to play.

The overall injury burden was 25.7 tournament days lost per 1000 hours of tournament exposure (table 3). This was significantly higher for UEFA EURO than for CONMEBOL Copa America, with respectively 30.0 tournament days lost (95% CI: 26.5 to 33.4) and 17.6 days lost (95% CI: 14.1 to 21.0) per 1000 hours of tournament exposure. Considering this time loss beyond the tournaments, the overall injury burden was 141.6 injury days per 1000 hours of tournament exposure; with respectively 167.0 injury days (95% CI: 158.9 to 175.1) UEFA EURO and 98.0 injury days (95% CI: 89.9 to 106.1) per 1000 hours of tournament exposure for CONMEBOL Copa America.

### More than 50% of players sustained a time-loss injury (> 1 day of lost training or playing time) during the 2012 super rugby union tournament: a prospective cohort study of 17, 340 player-hours [^731fa73c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Professional Rugby Union is a contact sport with a high risk of injury.

Objective

To document the incidence and nature of time-loss injuries during the 2012 Super Rugby tournament.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

2012 Super Rugby tournament (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa).

Participants

152 players from 5 South African teams.

Methods

Team physicians collected daily injury data through a secure, web-based electronic platform. Data included size of the squad, type of day, main player position, training or match injury, hours of play (training and matches), time of the match injury, mechanism of injury, main anatomical location of the injury, specific anatomical structure of the injury, the type of injury, the severity of the injury (days lost).

Results

The proportion (%) of players sustaining a time-loss injury during the tournament was 55%, and 25% of all players sustained > 1 injury. The overall incidence rate (IR/1000 player-hours) of injuries was 9.2. The IR for matches (83.3) was significantly higher than for training (2.1) and the IR was similar for forwards and backs. Muscle/tendon (50%) and joint/ligament (32.7%) injuries accounted for > 80% of injuries. Most injuries occurred in the lower (48.1%) and upper limb (25.6%). 42% of all injuries were moderate (27.5%) or severe (14.8%), and tackling (26.3%) and being tackled (23.1%) were the most common mechanisms of injury. The IR of injuries was unrelated to playing at home compared with away (locations ≥ 6h time difference).

Conclusions

55% of all players were injured during the 4-month Super Rugby tournament (1.67 injuries/match). Most injuries occurred in the lower (knee, thigh) or upper limb (shoulder, clavicle). 42% of injuries were severe enough for players to not play for > 1week.

### Social decision-making in the brain: input-state-output modelling reveals patterns of effective connectivity underlying reciprocal choices [^a07f09ab]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedure

On the day of the experiment, the Proposer and Responder of a given pair met for first time and exchanged names before being sent to one of two scanners located in adjacent rooms. Player roles were assigned randomly at the start of scanning but remained fixed throughout the experiment, one participant playing the role of Proposer and the other playing Responder on all rounds. Fixing the roles in this way allowed players to learn about and adapt to (reciprocate) their partner's behaviour over a relatively short period. Prior to the experiment, players were told explicitly that throughout the scanning procedure they would play with the same individual to whom they had just been introduced, and that their respective roles would remain fixed. Functional scanning was conducted in a single session, comprising 60 rounds (events) of the iUG and 30 rounds of a control condition (CTRL; see below) performed in an event‐related fashion. Each UG round began with the Proposer being given 4 s to choose between two divisions of the pie (the 'choice set'; see below) between themselves and the Responder (Choice). Only after this 4 s period was the Proposer's offer highlighted for a further 4 s (Offer), during which the Responder chose to accept or reject the proposal. Again, only after this period was the Responder's decision presented for a final 4 s (Decision). The same procedure was followed on CTRL rounds, but the choice set comprised two alternative divisions of colour. An example UG and CTRL round is illustrated in Figure 1. Importantly, the stimuli comprising each round were presented simultaneously to both players who observed the exact same stimulus sequence — Responders saw the choice set from which Proposers selected their offer, and Proposers saw the Responder's decision to accept/reject the proposal. Players gave their choices via two‐button response boxes. All rounds ended with a jittered inter‐trial interval, with a fixation cross presented for 2–4 s (mean = 3). The same pseudo‐randomised inter‐mixed sequence of UG and CTRL choice sets was used for all pairs, which was defined by a genetic algorithm for design optimisation set to maximise contrast detection between conditions (Wager & Nichols, 2003). Participants received the monetary outcome of six UG rounds selected randomly [mean reward = 240 CZK (approx. €9)]. Players were never informed about the choice sets they would encounter, nor the number of remaining rounds during the experiment (see Supporting Information for participant instructions).

### 2016 rio olympics: an epidemiological study of the men's and women's rugby-7s tournaments [^d4e9fc6b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence, severity and nature of injuries sustained during the men's and women's 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 Sevens World Series (SWS) and 2016 Olympic Games Rugby Sevens tournaments.

Design

A prospective cohort study.

Participants

All players from the core teams competing in the men's and women's 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 SWS (men: 15 teams; women: 11 teams) and all players from the men's (12 teams) and women's (12 teams) 2016 Rio Olympics tournaments.

Results

The gold, silver and bronze medal-winning women's teams contained bigger players (body mass and stature) than other teams but the men's medal winning teams came from across the size spectrum of men's teams competing at Rio 2016. The incidences of injury in the men's tournaments (2014/2015 SWS: 107.7 injuries/1000 player-match-hours (95%CI 90.9 to 127.4); 2015/2016 SWS: 109.7 (95%CI 93.7 to 128.6); Rio 2016: 124.5 (95%CI 73.7 to 210.2)) were higher but not statistically significant than those in the equivalent women's tournaments (2014/2015 SWS: 88.5 (95%CI 68.4 to 114.5), p = 0.250; 2015/2016 SWS: 109.4 (95%CI 84.2 to 142.2), p = 0.984; Rio 2016: 71.1 (95%CI 35.6 to 142.2), p = 0.208). There were no statistically significant differences between the incidences of injury at the men's and women's 2016 Rio Olympics and the equivalent 2014/2015 (men: p = 0.603; women: p = 0.562) and 2015/2016 (men: p = 0.652; women: p = 0.254) SWS.

Conclusions

The incidence, severity and nature of the injuries sustained during the men's and women's Rio 2016 Rugby-7s tournaments fell within the normal range of values for international Rugby-7s tournaments.

### Analysis and optimization of quantum adaptive measurement protocols with the framework of preparation games [^f2218b8e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The main drawback of this algorithm is that it is very sensitive to the initial choice of POVMs, so it generally requires several random initializations to achieve a reasonably good value of the objective function. It is therefore suitable for optimizations of n ≈ 50 round measurement schemes. Optimizations over, say, n = 1000 round games risk getting stuck in a bad local minimum.

To address this issue, we provide two additional methods for the design of large- n quantum preparation games below.

Devising large-round preparation games by composition

The simplest way to construct preparation games with arbitrary round number consists in playing several preparation games, one after another. Consider thus a game where, in each round and depending on the current game configuration, the referee chooses a preparation game. Depending on the outcome, the referee changes the game configuration and plays a different preparation game with the player in the next round. We call such a game a meta-preparation game. Similarly, one can define meta-meta preparation games, where, in each round, the referee and the player engage in a meta-preparation game. This recursive construction can be repeated indefinitely.

In the Methods we show that the maximum average score of a (meta) j -game, which refers to a game at level j of the above recursive construction, can be computed inductively, through a formula akin to Eq. (2). Moreover, in the particular case that the preparation games that make up the (meta) j -game have {0, 1} scores, one only needs to know their minimum and maximum scores to compute the (meta) j -game's maximum average score.

For simple meta-games such as play m times the {0, 1}-scored preparation game G, count the number of wins and output 1 (0) if it is greater than or equal to (smaller than) a threshold v, which we denote, we find that the optimal meta-strategy for the player is to always play G optimally, thus recoveringwhere, from. p (G, v, m) can be interpreted as a p -value for-constrained strategies, as it measures the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the observed data v under the hypothesis that the player's strategies are constrained to belong to.

### A similar injury profile observed in franchise men's and women's cricket in england and wales: injury surveillance analysis from the first three' the hundred' competitions [^9a65339f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Injury prevalence

On any given day of 'The Hundred', 2.9% of men and 3.6% of women were unavailable to train or play. This prevalence rate is lower than observed in domestic men's cricket, between 7.5% and 12.5%, and similar to domestic women's cricket in England and Wales at 4.1%. Interestingly, injury prevalence has been reported between 4.6% and 5.1% in other cricket tournaments, closer to the observed rate in this study. The lower prevalence rate in tournament cricket could be related to the higher NTL incidence, which does not contribute to injury prevalence rates. The financial incentive to play in 'The Hundred' may have contributed to the lower injury prevalence recorded, encouraging players to return from injury sooner. Furthermore, players injured before 'The Hundred' with an expected return date close to the end of the tournament are likely to withdraw from the competition, whereas, in domestic cricket, these players will remain with the club influencing the prevalence rates. This is especially relevant for lumbar spine stress fractures, which typically require four to six months recovery. The full prevalence would not be captured in 'The Hundred' injury surveillance but would be in year-round injury surveillance. Bowlers' workload is also limited to 20 deliveries per game (3.2 overs) in 'The Hundred' which is less than all other formats. This reduces exposure for bowlers, who have been reported as the players with the highest injury prevalence.

### Injury surveillance during a 2-day national female youth football tournament in Kenya [^4415fa33]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyse the incidence, characteristics and circumstances of injuries during a female youth amateur football tournament in Kenya.

Design

14 injury recorders prospectively registered and classified all injuries during all matches. Four physiotherapists and two doctors supported the injury recorders.

Setting

A 2-day Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA) inter-provincial football tournament for female players in Nairobi, Kenya. The tournament is organised by a non-governmental organisation (NGO).

Participants

938 females divided into three age groups (under 13 years (U13), under 16 years (U16) and over 16 years (O16)).

Main Outcome Measurements

Overall injury incidence.

Results

123 injuries occurred in 106 matches. The incidence of all injuries was 93.3 injuries/1000 h. Players in the U13 (relative risk (RR) = 2.16, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.5; p = 0.002) and U16 (RR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.5; p = 0.002) age groups had an increased risk of injury compared to the O16 group. Most injuries allowed the players to continue to play (n = 98 of 121; 81%). For 15 (12%) of the injuries the player did not continue to play but was expected to fully participate in the following match, and eight of the injuries (6.1 injuries/1000 h) were expected to result in the player's absence from play for 1–7 days. The injuries most commonly affected the lower limb (n = 100; 82%); contusions to the ankle (n = 15; 12%) and foot/toe (n = 15; 12%) were the most common specific injury types. Most acute injuries (89 of 113, 79%) were caused by player contact.

Conclusions

The incidence of injuries among female youth football players in a national tournament in Kenya was high, but time-loss injuries were rare. Playing football in a tournament organised by an NGO at the inter-provincial level was safe.

### The use of medication and nutritional supplements during FIFA world cups 2002 and 2006 [^2b9aa10b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

METHODS

Data collection

In connection with the doping controls carried out in the FIFA World Cup tournaments 2002 and 2006, all team physicians were asked to enter in English in legible handwriting "any medication taken by the players or administered to them in the 72 hours preceding the match… The team doctor shall also note down any non-prescription medicines or food supplements taken by the players".

Classification

Based on the information provided by the team physicians, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of each reported substance was identified, and the substance was classified as one of the following:

Painkilling and anti-inflammatory drugs
NSAIDs. Analgesics. Injected corticosteroids and local anaesthetics.
Muscle relaxants.
Respiratory agents – anti-asthmatic, antihistaminic, sympathomimetic medication, and others.
Medication for intestinal purposes – proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids, and others.
Antimicrobial medication.
Others – psychotropic substances, topical corticosteroids and others.
Supplements – macronutrients and micronutrients, herbal supplements(derivatives from plant sources), and others.

Participating players

Thirty-two countries (23 players each) qualified for each of the FIFA World Cup tournaments. A total of 64 matches took place from the qualification round up to the World Cup final, with three being the lowest number of matches played by any team for one tournament, and seven being the highest number. Each World Cup included 2944 player matches.

Data presentation

The incidence of substance intake was calculated as follows:

substance/player/match(mean intake per player)
number of individual players reported to be using a substance
substance/player/tournament

Data analysis

The statistical methods applied were frequencies, cross-tabulations and Pearson's correlation.

We used χ 2 tests for comparison of substance categories. 95% confidence intervals were calculated according the following formula: 95% CI = incidence ± 1.96× (incidence/square root (number of incidents)). Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05 in all cases.

### Retrospective study of the use of medication and supplements during the 2018 FIFA world cup russia [^455fa181]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Results

A total of 2123 medications and 1311 supplements were reported to be taken by players in the 2018 FIFA World Cup (see table 1). NSAIDs were the medication most taken (38.6%, n = 820), and diclofenac was the most frequently prescribed NSAID (49.1%, n = 403), followed by etoricoxib (14.1%, n = 116) and celecoxib (14%, n = 115). The other pain-related medication groups were 'other analgesics' (13.8%, n = 292), with paracetamol being the analgesic most often taken (88.4%, n = 258), and 'muscle relaxants' (6.7%, n = 143). Other medications prescribed were injections (1.3%, n = 27), whereas glucose injections counted for 74% of all injections (n = 20), β-2 agonists (0.9%; n = 20), medications for insomnia and anxiety (13%, n = 277), respiratory medications without antihistamines and β-2 agonists (7.1%, n = 150), and antimicrobial agents (2.4%, n = 51). Five players used a β-2 agonist, all of them inhaling salbutamol (n = 20).

Table 1
Use of medication in the 2018 FIFA World Cup

On average, 54% of the players took at least one type of medication during the tournament, and 39% did so before each match regardless of whether they participated in the match (see table 1). The average number of medications declared was 0.72 per player per match and 1.32 per player during the tournament. Considerable differences were found between teams. In two of them, each player took medication during the tournament, with an average of 2.96 different medications per player for one team and 4.65 for the other. The maximum average number of prescribed medications found in all teams was 4.65 medications per player, while there were a minimum of 0.13 medications per player in a team during the tournament. Two players were reported to have taken a total of 12 different medications during the entire tournament. For the team with the lowest medication intake, only one player consumed medication during the entire tournament (4%, n = 1 player).

### Retrospective study of the use of medication and supplements during the 2018 FIFA world cup russia [^3c0e2540]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Objective

Examine the intake of medication and supplements used by top-level players during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia.

Participants

736 top-level players

Setting

The team doctors uploaded a list of the medications used by each player to the online reporting tool within 72 hours of each match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia.

Outcome measures

Average number of medications used per player per match and during the tournament; average number and percentage of players using at least one medication per match and during the tournament.

Results

54% of the players took at least one medication during the tournament and 39% took at least one medication before each match. The most used medications were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (38.6%), followed by other analgesics (13.8%) and medications for insomnia and anxiety (13%). On average, 0.72 medications were taken per player per match and 1.32 per player during the tournament. The mean number of medication intake per player per match was higher during the knockout stage compared with the group stage (0.88 ± 1.36 vs 0.65 ± 1.08, p < 0.001). Players from South America and North and Central America took more medications per match compared with the players from Africa (0.9 ± 1.14 and 0.98 ± 1.1 vs 0.48 ± 0.83, p < 0.001 in both cases).

Conclusion

The intake of NSAIDs decreased during the 2018 FIFA World Cup compared with previous FIFA World Cups, but stayed at a high level. The high number of medications taken is a cause for concern, and therefore, players, medical staff and coaches should be made more aware of the possible side effects of a high medication intake.

### Abuse of medication during international football competition in 2010-lesson not learned [^69051ae0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of medication in professional football has previously been shown to defy clinical guidelines.

Materials and Methods

Physicians of the teams who participated at the 2010 FIFA World Cup provided the list of medications used by each player within the 72 h preceding every match.

Results

During the tournament 71.7% of all players took medication, and 60.3% (444 of 736 players) took painkilling agents at least once. Over a third of players (39.0%) took a painkilling agent before every game. More medications were used during the finals than during the qualifying round of matches (pool games) (0.87 ± 0.09 vs 0.77 ± 0.03, p < 0.01). Players from North and South America took almost twice the number of medications than did players from other continents (1.18 ± 0.08 vs 0.64 ± 0.03; p < 0.01).

Conclusion

The use of medication reported by the team physicians in international football competition is increasing. Systematic use - medication for every match - appeared to be the norm in certain teams. This has implications for player health. These data encourage efforts to better understand, and to address, this potential disastrous practice in professional sports.

### The effect of changes in the score on injury incidence during three FIFA world cups [^c00db4ea]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effect of changes in the score and of different playing positions, as well as the effect of recovery time on injury incidence during Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cups.

Design

Prospective injury surveillance at three international championships in 2002, 2006 and 2010. Official match statistics were obtained for all the games played in the three championships.

Setting

2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.

Participants

National team players as well as the team doctors reporting all the injuries at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups.

Main Outcome Measures

Injury incidence and incidence rate ratios.

Results

There were statistically significant differences in injury incidence related to changes in the score (p = 0.026) and to the teams' current drawing/losing/winning status (p = 0.008). Injury incidence was lowest (54.8/1000 match-hours (mh), 95% CI 46.4 to 64.3) during the initial 0–0 score and highest (81.2/1000 mh, 60.5 to 106.8) when the score was even but goals had been scored. Winning teams had a tendency towards a higher injury incidence (81.0/1000 mh, 67.5 to 96.4) than losing or drawing teams (55.5/1000 mh, 44.4 to 68.4 and 59.7/1000 mh, 51.8 to 68.6, respectively). There were also statistically significant differences in injury incidence between the playing positions (p < 0.001), with forwards having the highest injury incidence (85.7/1000 mh, 69.8 to 104.2). There was a linear relationship (p = 0.043) between an increasing number of recovery days between matches and a higher injury incidence.

Conclusions

There is a considerable variation in injury incidence during a match in international men's football related to changes in the score. Players in a winning team run a higher risk of suffering an injury than players in a drawing or losing team. Identifying time periods with a high injury incidence may be of major importance to players and team personnel, as it may enable them to take precautions.

### Tennis injury data from the championships, wimbledon, from 2003 to 2012 [^374ce2e5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary aims of this retrospective study were to describe the burden of injury presenting to the medical team and the changes in injury profile over 10years (2003–2012) at The Championships, Wimbledon. Secondary aims included description of gender difference in rates, distribution and pathology of injuries.

Design

Retrospective observational cohort of player injury presentations over 10years (2003–2012) at The Championships, Wimbledon.

Results

The overall rate of presentation of injury for all players over the 10-year period was 20.7 per 1000 sets played. Injury rates were lower for male players (17.7 injuries per 1000 sets played) than female players (23.4 injuries per 1000 sets played). There was variability in the numbers of injuries reported by men and women players over the 10-year period.

Conclusions

The rates of presentation of injury at this Grand Slam tennis tournament varied between male and female players, and between years. More robust systems of data collection are required in professional tennis to enable more sophisticated injury data analysis between sexes, years and different playing surfaces.

### Extortion subdues human players but is finally punished in the prisoner's dilemma [^382d78f4]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

These results suggest that humans were somewhat reluctant to cooperate against extortioners. In fact, in the extortion treatments < 14% of the human co-players were fully cooperative during the last ten rounds of the game, as compared with > 63% in the generosity treatments (see Supplementary Fig. 1). On the other extreme, a third of the human subjects refused to cooperate against an extortionate co-player during the last ten rounds of the game, whereas only 1 out of 30 subjects did so in the generosity treatments. Thus, although the different treatments provided similar monetary incentives for cooperation, subjects were more hesitant to cooperate against an extortionate co-player. Withholding cooperation against these ZD strategies can be considered as a form of costly punishment (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). For example, reducing one's cooperation rate by 10% against strong extortioners decreased the opponent's mean payoff per round by [euro] 0.029, but it also diminished the own payoff by [euro] 0.011. The resulting fine-to-cost ratio for punishment, 0.029/0.011≈2.6, is close to typical values used in experiments on costly punishment. Being less cooperative thus led to a strong reduction in the co-player's payoff, but it also turned out to be costly for the punishing individual itself.

### Development of a core outcome set for clinical trials targeting interventions aiming to improve adherence to appropriate polypharmacy in older people-an international consensus study [^bfe0edb6]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication non-adherence is prevalent in older people taking polypharmacy. Several interventions have been employed to improve adherence in this population. However, inconsistencies in outcomes have impeded comparisons of findings. Accordingly, this work aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for use in trials aiming to improve adherence to appropriate polypharmacy in older people.

Methods

A group of stakeholders, including academics, journal editors, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and public participants, evaluated 13 outcomes compiled from the literature in a Delphi study using a nine-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 9, where higher scores (7–9) indicated critical importance and lower scores (1–3) unimportance. The resultant Delphi consensus list was discussed and voted on (yes: critical and no: unimportant) in two online nominal group technique (NGT) meetings. The NGT followed a five-stage approach: introduction, silent generation, round-robin, clarification and voting. An outcome was included if ≥ 80% of participants scored it critical and ≤ 15% scored it as unimportant.

Results

Of the 13 outcomes originally presented to participants, consensus was achieved to include six outcomes in the COS after the Delphi study (Round 1, n = 57; Round 2, n = 53; Round 3, n = 50, where 'n' represents participant numbers) and the NGT meetings (n = 10) comprising medication adherence across multiple medications, treatment burden, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare utilisation (HCU), adverse events and side effects (AEs and SEs) and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

This COS should be used in intervention studies focusing on improving adherence to appropriate polypharmacy in older people. Future work should identify outcome measurement instruments to be used alongside the COS.

### The influence of game scheduling on medical encounters at the USA cup soccer tournament [^9e768b24]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVEL To investigate the influence of playing multiple games on multiple days on youth soccer medical encounter rates.

Design

Prospective cohort survey study.

Setting

Medical facility at the 2008 Schwan's USA Cup soccer tournament.

Participants

Players presenting to the medical facility for game-related medical evaluation.

Assessment Of Risk Factors

Date, game and half of game for each medical encounter.

Main Outcome Measures

Game play-related medical encounters per 1000 match hours (MH).

Results

211 players surveyed with 195 eligible and completed questionnaires. There were 4.06, 5.14 and 3.92 medical encounters/1000 MH on 11, 12 and 13 July, respectively, with no significant difference in injury incidence. There was no difference in medical encounter rates of second games compared with first games of the day (p = 0.126). Daily medical encounter rates were 5.65, 8.95, 7.83, 6.94 and 4.62/1000 MH on 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 July, respectively, with statistically significant differences on 16 July (p < 0.001) and 17 July (p = 0.022) compared with 15 July. Encounter rates of second games compared with first games of the day showed no difference (p = 0.385). A linear test for trend from 15 to 19 July was not significant (p = 0.092).

Conclusions

The USA Cup format did not show either increased medical encounter rates from the cumulative total of games played or a consistently increased rate in the second game of the day compared with the first. Players, coaches, parents and administrators can feel confident that this tournament format does not pose an additional risk of injury.

### A game for all shapes and sizes? Changes in anthropometric and performance measures of elite professional rugby union players 1999–2018 [^8b9cd3bc]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The flow of the game

The adoption of video technology to assist refereeing decisions at the highest levels of the game has led to prolonged delays during the match where foul-play and the validity of scores are checked to ensure fairness. Some games now last > 2 hours with slow movement from set-piece to set-piece. These well-intentioned interventions may have become unintentional enablers of the physical 'arms race' by allowing heavier players, who fatigue faster, greater opportunity to recover and continue playing at a higher intensity with less need to conserve energy. Likewise, there are frequent delays for discussion among players before scrums and line-out, with water carriers, medical staff and others coming onto the pitch. To support a faster game, referees might stop play only for gross law infringements, limiting interventions for minor offences and playing longer advantage periods, as well as penalising delays to a line-out or scrum.

Laws of the game

We have previously stated that failing to adhere to set-piece laws may have driven changes in players' physical characteristics. Allowing the scrum feed to be crooked has enabled larger hookers in the front row and the call for a straight put-in at the scrum, along with refereeing the ruck as set down in the laws of the game. Similarly, allowing players to lift one another in the line-out has coincided with a significant gain in the body mass of second-row forwards. If they were to have to jump for the ball themselves, this may mean that lighter players, able to project themselves higher, would be more successful, stalling increases in body mass.

The 'physical arms race'

The development of greater forces applied by players coincides with enormous concern about player welfare in the form of injuries, recognised at the time and identified at later time points. As far as we are aware, it is not feasible to limit a player's speed or body mass. However, one route to lower the peak momentum regularly achieved would be to enforce a team 'weight limit' so that the combined body mass of the 15 players on the pitch did not exceed a predetermined total. This would allow teams to field some heavy players but may create an environment where lighter players with different physical attributes and skillsets are prioritised.

### Progressing rehabilitation after injury: consider the 'control-chaos continuum' [^b45e33cf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

High chaos

Aims: Return the player to relative weekly training demands (figure 2) and include drills designed to test worst-case scenarios (high speed/high chaos).

Technical considerations: passing/crossing and shooting; graded in intensity from short/mid/long range while jumping/heading and tackling; graded in intensity as static/movement/in-context. The volume of technical actions should be progressively increased and be player and injury specific.

In the final phase, we emphasise position-specific conditioning and reflect game intensity with volumes relative to weekly preinjury training outputs. Positional specific speed/speed-endurance drills (online supplementary videos 9 and 10) prepare players for game activity — where the speed/direction of the pass dictates how fast the player moves. Technical considerations specific to the injury in question (eg, ball striking activity for a groin injury) form part of our final criteria for return to training, alongside strength and power diagnostics (table 1).

### Effect of implementation of safety measures in tae kwon do competition [^f7e4f72b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reviews of tae kwon do (TKD) tournaments have documented injury rates of 25/1000 to 12.7/100 athlete exposures. Most injuries have been reported to be to the head and the neck and are occasionally very serious. Many of these studies involved high level TKD competitions with minimal safety precautions. Recently, safety measures have been implemented in many TKD competitions.

Objective

To evaluate retrospectively the incidence of injuries in TKD competitions involving a wide range of participants and featuring extensive safety precautions.

Methods

A total of 2498 participants ranged in age from 18 to 66, included both men and women, and ranged in rank from yellow to black belt. Traumas, defined as any event requiring interaction with medical staff, were documented with respect to mechanism, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up recommendations. An injury was defined as a trauma that prevented a contestant from resuming competition on the day that the trauma occurred, according to National Collegiate Athletic Association criteria.

Results

The injury rate was 0.4/1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than reported in previous studies of TKD tournaments and in many other sports.

Conclusion

TKD tournaments that emphasise limited contact, protective equipment, and medical supervision are relatively safe and compare favourably with other sports.

### High prevalence of medication use in professional football tournaments including the world cups between 2002 and 2014: a narrative review with a focus on NSAIDs [^d1f26b85]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

FIFA Women's World Cup and the Under-17 and Under-18 FIFA World Championships

The reported use of medication during the 2003 and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup was significantly higher than in the Men's World Cups (0.85 vs 0.77, p ≤ 0.001) and than in adolescent football players participating in Under-17 (U-17) and U-20 tournaments (0.51, p ≤ 0.001; see table 1). Contraceptive agents were not included in the analysis. Whereas the incidence of the use of NSAIDs was similar between adult male and female players, significantly fewer NSAIDs were administered to adolescent players, suggesting increased consumption with age (see table 2).

In 14.9% of female players, oral contraceptive use was reported. This is less than what was reported by Alaranta et al for other team sport events (24%), and especially in speed, power and endurance events (40%).

NSAIDs and other analgesics

The NSAIDs category was the one that was most reported in every tournament (see figure 1). In total 54.5% of male players and 50.9% of female players participating in the FIFA World Cup used an NSAID at least once during the tournament; 43.3% adolescent players did so too. Hence, on average, more than seven male and female players per national team were using NSAIDs prior to every match, as were 4.5 players in U-17 and U-20 tournaments (see table 2). Ten per cent of the male and female players were using more than one type of NSAIDs at one time, thus increasing the risk of side effects.

There was no difference in use of medication and NSAIDs, in particular between players participating in the match and substitutes who did not play at all; nor was there a correlation between injuries reported and reported use of medication. The most frequently prescribed application form was the oral route (93%). In only 7%, NSAIDs were administered topically, although percutaneous application of NSAIDs might be as efficient as oral preparation in the treatment of soft-tissue injuries.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastrointestinal stromal tumors - NCCN, more specifically with respect to mutation testing, NCCN 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that specific mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha show some correlation with tumor phenotype, but mutations are not strongly correlated with the biologic potential of individual tumors. Recognize that accumulated data show KIT mutations are not preferentially present in high-grade tumors and can also be found in small incidental tumors as well as tumors with an indolent course. Similarly, recognize that mutational analysis of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha cannot be used to predict the behavior of individual tumors.

### Professional assessment of potential concussions in elite football tournaments [^07a1ae5d]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Players with a greater number of concussion signs were professionally assessed more frequently (p < 10–5). Of the four players who exhibited four or more signs of concussion, all (100%) were assessed by medical personnel, resulting in one (25%) player being removed from the game. The rate of assessment dropped when the player exhibited less than four signs. Of the 53 players exhibiting three signs of concussion, 36 (67.9%) were professionally assessed and 3 (5.6%) players were removed from the game. While 153 players who showed two signs of concussion, 38 (24.8%) were professionally assessed and 1 (0.7%) was removed from play. Of the 22 PCEs with one sign of concussion, only 1 was professionally assessed. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentages (mean = 33.40%, 95% CI 20.66% to 46.14%) of players with PCE who received a medical assessment at each of the three tournaments (p = 0.42) and no evidence of a linear trend between tournaments over the 4 years (p = 0.86).

Time stopped for assessment across all three tournaments ranged from 15 to 280 s. The average professional assessment time for all three tournaments was 59.9 s. As expected, a player displaying more signs of concussions on average had monotonically increasing time (p = 0.027) stopped for professional assessment. Across all three tournaments, the mean time stopped for assessment for zero, one, two, three and four or more signs of concussions was 19.3, 49.7, 53.3, 79.8 and 100.3 s, respectively (table 2).

### Short-term effects of light and heavy load interventions on service velocity and precision in elite young tennis players [^4dcdfa14]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to investigate the acute effects of a complex throwing intervention set-up, with light or heavy loads, on the service velocity of elite junior tennis players.

Methods

On 3 separate test days, 13 elite juniors (mean (SD) 12.3 (0.8) years, 149 (9) cm, 37.5 (5.5) kg) performed four sets of six serves with different between-set conditions. In a cross-over design, the players performed respectively 6, 4 and 2 maximum effort throws with a 200 g ball (LI, light intervention), 6, 4 and 2 maximum effort throws with a 600 g ball (HI, heavy intervention) and no throws (NI, no intervention) during the 2 min in between-set period. Participants were instructed to serve, with maximum speed, to a target near the midline of the deuce court service box. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to determine the effects of intervention type and set number on "service velocity", "service precision" (eg, percentage of serves in) and "service touch" (11 point rating scale).

Results

Mean (SD) service velocity decreased significantly in HI (124.3 (7.8) km/h) as compared to NI (126.6 (9.3) km/h, p < 0.05, effect size d = 0.26), yet no such differences were found between LI (125.2 (7.9) km/h) and NI. Service velocity also remained constant between sets (p = 0.406). Service precision and service touch were unaffected by the interventions.

Conclusions

Under the conditions of our study, a heavy throwing intervention during service training has no beneficial effect on service velocity in young elite tennis players (under 14).

### Injury surveillance in the world football tournaments 1998–2012 [^14545cae]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 1681 matches were played in the 53 tournaments, equivalent to 55 473 player-hours. The team physicians completed and returned 3091 injury report forms, covering 51 001.5 player-hours, to the FIFA Medical Officers. The average response rate was 92% (table 2).

A total of 3944 injuries were reported from 1546 matches, which is equivalent to an incidence of 77.3 injuries per 1000 player-hours (95% CI 74.9 to 79.7) or 2.6 injuries per match (95% CI 2.5 to 2.7). The injury rate varied between 1.9 (FIFA Women's World Cups) and 3 (FIFA U20 World Cups) injuries per match in the different types of tournaments. The incidence was lower in tournaments for female players compared with the respective tournaments for male players, except for the Olympic Games.

Most injuries affected the lower extremity (n = 2706, 70%), followed by injuries to the head and neck (n = 577, 15%), trunk (n = 302, 8%) and upper extremity (n = 269, 7%). In almost all types of tournaments, the ankle (n = 718, 19%), lower leg (n = 615, 16%) and head/neck were the predominantly injured body parts. Head/neck injuries were significantly more frequent in female than in male players (17% vs 14% of injuries; χ 2 = 9.3, p < 0.002).

Most injuries were diagnosed as contusions (n = 2090, 55%), sprains (n = 580, 15%) and strains/muscle fibre ruptures (n = 379, 10%). In total, 81 injuries were diagnosed as concussion, 59 as ligament rupture and 63 as fracture (table 3). Female players incurred significantly more concussions than their male counterparts (χ 2 = 6.9, p < 0.009). In Club World Cups, the percentage of contusions was lower and the percentages of fractures, ligament ruptures and strains were higher than in other tournaments for male players. This corresponds to the observation that more injuries in Club World Cups resulted in (a longer) absence from football (see below).

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

### How viswanathan anand won his five world chess… [^e7392b0d]. ESPN (2024). Medium credibility.

Anand's five world titles are the story of a pathbreaker, not just in Indian chess but in world chess. It is the story of a non-Soviet, non-Westerner who dared to take on the established seat of authority in the sport, and succeeded in toppling it. Here's how he won each of those five titles, with stories and anecdotes taken from his book, Mind Master: Winning Lessons from a Champion's Life. In 2000, among a field of 100 players, Anand was seeded first, and hence had gotten a bye in the first round. It was smooth sailing for him until the quarterfinals against Alexander Khalifman. The matches were all two-game affairs followed by tie-breaks at faster time controls. Anand writes that he had "slithered out of tricky positions" in the first two tie-break games. Eventually, he won the fifth game in the tie-break after four successive draws.

Veselin Topalov, one of the other contenders for that title, had remarked from the audience that "Vishy should be called the snake of Madras. ", due to his ability to wriggle his way out of tough situations, as he had during that quarterfinal against Khalifman. After all the rounds were held in New Delhi, the final was held in Tehran, where Anand faced Alexei Shirov amid a bout of upset stomachs for both him and his team. Anand went into the final against Shirov with the knowledge that it wouldn't be easy, particularly as the Spaniard had beaten him at both the Linares and the Ambert tournaments earlier that year. However, in the final, Shirov's performances didn't match those that had set him out in Anand's mind as a difficult opponent. Anand writes that his Delhi belly ended up being the fullest extent of troubles he had to face during the final, as he picked up three straight wins after a draw in the first match to take the title.

2007: Unified World Champion Unlike the 100-strong field in 2000, the 2007 World Championship was to be a double round-robin featuring just eight players, akin to the Candidates tournaments of today. Anand was in a field that included Vladimir Kramnik, Peter Svidler, Alexander Morozevich, Peter Leko, Boris Gelfand, Levon Aronian and Alexander Grischuk. Anand had four wins in 14 matches
- one each against Aronian, Svidler, Grischuk and Morozevich, in rounds 2, 5, 7, and 11 respectively. He ended up not losing a single match, drawing each of the other 10, giving him a total of 9 points, and making him a clear winner, over Kramnik who finished second with eight points. It was another example of how not losing is as important, if not more, than winning matches during the World Championships. Kramnik's only loss at the tournament came in round 9 to Morozevich.

This was a sweet win for Anand, as for the first time, he could be called the undisputed world champion, as his win in 2000 came when both FIDE and the PCA had their own world championships running in the same year. 2008: Anand gets the better of Kramnik In 2008, the world champion Anand had to play against Kramnik, who was given the right to regain the title that he had won in 2006, following the complications in reunifying the world title in 2006. Anand won with
6. 5 points in 11 games, winning three of the first six games. In his book, Anand credits this win to one big change he had made after his win in 2007, that he would switch from the 1. e4 opening. He had revolved all his preperation around Kramnik's own signature 1. d4 opening. Anand writes that Kramnik would have anticipated that he would play 1.

### Alternative splicing in prostate cancer [^6e44d576]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen receptor (AR) splice variants (AR-Vs) have been implicated in the development and progression of metastatic prostate cancer. AR-Vs are truncated isoforms of the AR, a subset of which lack a ligand-binding domain and remain constitutively active in the absence of circulating androgens, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation. Consequently, AR-Vs have been proposed to contribute not only to resistance to anti-androgen therapies but also to resistance to radiotherapy in patients receiving combination therapy by promoting DNA repair. AR-Vs, such as AR-V7, have been associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes in patients; however, attempts to specifically inhibit or prevent the formation of AR-Vs have, to date, been unsuccessful. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to address the oncogenic effects of AR-Vs, which can drive lethal forms of prostate cancer. Disruption of alternative splicing through modulation of the spliceosome is one such potential therapeutic avenue; however, our understanding of the biology of the spliceosome and how it contributes to prostate cancer remains incomplete, as reflected in the dearth of spliceosome-targeted therapeutic agents. In this Review, the authors outline the current understanding of the role of the spliceosome in the progression of prostate cancer and explore the therapeutic utility of manipulating alternative splicing to improve patient care.

Clinical application of the Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Damage Index

A total of 52 patients underwent long-term follow-up, and 66.7% (18/27) of the patients in the high-burden of organ damage (SCTC-DI ≥ 6) group experienced progression of organ damage (Δ SCTC-DI ≥ 1). In contrast, among patients with SCTC-DI < 6 at baseline, and 16.0% (4/25) of the patients experienced organ damage progression. This finding indicated that a higher baseline SCTC-DI score was associated with a greater progression of organ damage (Δ SCTC-DI ≥ 1) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, a non-significant, higher rate of organ damage progression was identified for the dcSSc compared to the lcSSc subtype in their jSSc cohort (P = 0.08) (Fig. 2).

### The history of risk: a review [^87549dda]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Examples of probability calculations for coin tosses, based on Pascal's triangle

Impressively, even today, Blaise Pascal's simple triangle can accurately predict probabilities for the Baseball World Series. The World Series is played between two teams as "best out of 7" games. If the opposing team won the first game, there are six games remaining. Row 6 in the triangle depicts 64 (2 6) possible outcomes (1-6-15-20-15-6-1). The home team will have to win at least four games to secure the title, whereas the opposing team requires only three more victories. There are 22 (1 + 6 + 15) possibilities for the home team to clinch the title (22/64 or 34.4%), compared to 42 (20-15-6-1) options for the opposing team to win three or more games (42/64 or 65.6%). Thus, by carrying a copy of Pascal's antiquated triangle from 1653 in the pocket, a modern person of the twenty-first century can place a safe bet at the sports bar.

An illustrative example based on coin tosses in the classic "heads or tails" bet may help more easily understand the utility of Pascal's triangle for probability calculation:
✓ What is the probability of rolling two heads with two coin tosses? Row 2 is representative of 2 coin tosses with 4 (2 2) possible outcomes (1-2-1). There is only one option for throwing two heads, with a probability of 1/4 or 25% (Table 1).
✓ What is the probability of tossing at least two heads with four coin tosses? Row 4 is representative of four coin tosses with 16 (2 4) possible outcomes (1-4-6-4-1). There are 1 + 4 + 6 options for tossing at least two heads, i.e. 11/16 or 68.75%. Based on the same example in row 4, the probability of throwing four heads with four coin tosses is 1/16 or 6.25% (Table 1).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia - NCCN, more specifically with respect to workup (general diagnostic studies), NCCN 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain confirmatory FISH (peripheral blood or bone marrow) if chromosome analysis reveals the following breakpoints: 4q12 (PDGFRA); 5q31~33 (PDGFRB); 8p11~12 (FGFR1); 9p24 (JAK2); 9q34 (ABL1); and 13q12 (FLT3)

- recognize that the overwhelming majority of PDGFRA fusions are represented by FIP1L1::PDGFRA, which is cytogenetically occult and requires FISH for the detection of CHIC2 deletion for initial screening

- recognize that in rare cases, cryptic PDGFRB rearrangements have been found, and FISH may be used to uncover, not only confirm PDGFRB rearrangements

- consider using reverse transcriptase PCR over next-generation sequencing for FLT3.
