## Question

How many days do you prescribe potassium for a level of 3.1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the duration of potassium chloride supplementation for a serum potassium of 3.1 mEq/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the severity of hypokalemia and whether oral therapy is appropriate. Then, I should verify the recommended oral dosing range and administration details. Next, I will review how to monitor and titrate therapy, including when to stop. After that, I need to consider special populations and comorbidities that could change the plan. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized duration estimate and safety caveats, making sure I double-check any assumptions against the labels and guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the severity and route decision. A potassium of 3.1 mEq/L is moderate hypokalemia; oral replacement is appropriate if the patient is asymptomatic, has no ECG changes, and can tolerate oral intake, whereas IV potassium is reserved for severe hypokalemia (generally ≤ 2.5 mEq/L), symptomatic patients, or those with ECG abnormalities or inability to take oral therapy [^115h7Ejq] [^116c8DvS] [^1133WKat].

> I need to check the labeled oral dosing for treatment. Multiple FDA sources converge on 40–100 mEq/day in divided doses, not exceeding 40 mEq per single dose, with a maximum of 200 mEq/day; typical maintenance after repletion is about 20 mEq/day, individualized to serum potassium and ongoing losses [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC] [^115rjaaf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration; I should verify the monitoring cadence that dictates when to stop. The FDA labeling instructs to monitor serum potassium daily or more often depending on severity until normalization, then space to periodic checks for maintenance; practically, that means reassessing every 1–3 days initially and adjusting the dose to a 0.5–1.0 mEq/L rise per interval, with discontinuation or taper once potassium is ≥ 3.5–4.0 mEq/L and the cause has been addressed [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC].

> Let me consider the clinical context that modifies duration. If hypokalemia is due to ongoing diuretic therapy, GI losses, or hyperaldosteronism, replacement may be needed for 1–2 weeks or longer until the precipitant is optimized; conversely, if this was a transient insult (e.g., a single vomiting/diarrhea episode) corrected quickly, 3–7 days may suffice. I should confirm that the underlying cause is being treated in parallel to avoid premature discontinuation or unnecessary prolongation [^notfound].

> I should double-check special populations. In CKD, start low and go slow due to hyperkalemia risk, with frequent potassium checks; in heart failure or on RAAS inhibitors/MRAs, monitor closely and coordinate with guideline-directed therapy adjustments. In peritoneal dialysis, protocolized oral potassium to a target of 4–5 mEq/L reduced peritonitis over 52 weeks, illustrating that longer-term, monitored supplementation can be appropriate in select populations, though that RCT context differs from typical outpatient hypokalemia [^112d5T7d] [^115EgLFb] [^111SbW8q].

> Let me synthesize a practical, individualized duration estimate. For an otherwise healthy adult with moderate hypokalemia at 3.1 mEq/L, starting 40–60 mEq/day in divided doses and reassessing every 2–3 days, I would anticipate 5–10 days to reach ≥ 3.5–4.0 mEq/L if the cause is addressed, followed by taper to maintenance or discontinuation; if ongoing losses persist, 10–14 days or longer may be needed, with step-down to 20 mEq/day once stable. I need to ensure potassium is rechecked within 2–3 days of any dose change and that we do not abruptly stop until stable normokalemia is achieved [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC].

> Wait, let me verify administration details to minimize GI upset and maximize adherence, since that affects whether the planned duration is realistic. Oral potassium chloride should be taken with meals and adequate fluid; if using a solution, dilute in at least 4 ounces of water; if using tablets, swallow whole without crushing or chewing to avoid mucosal injury. These steps reduce gastric irritation and improve tolerability during multi-day courses [^1133WKat] [^115rjaaf] [^116UhpET].

> I should confirm safety thresholds and when to escalate. If potassium fails to rise as expected, I need to check for concurrent hypomagnesemia and correct it, as magnesium deficiency can perpetuate refractory hypokalemia; if the patient becomes symptomatic, develops ECG changes, or cannot tolerate oral therapy, I should switch to IV potassium with appropriate monitoring and local protocols [^115h7Ejq] [^116c8DvS].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an MRA or ACEi/ARB and we are aggressively replacing potassium? I need to ensure potassium and renal function are checked within 3–7 days of initiating or changing RAAS-modulating therapy and then at least monthly early on, because hyperkalemia risk is nontrivial; this affects both the upper bound of replacement and the frequency of labs during the repletion window [^115EgLFb] [^114QtKxR].

> Final check and bottom line: there is no fixed "days" prescription for 3.1 mEq/L; duration is titrated to response and cause control. A reasonable, evidence-aligned approach is 5–10 days of oral potassium at 40–60 mEq/day in divided doses with reassessment every 2–3 days, extending to 10–14 days or more if losses persist, then tapering to 20 mEq/day or stopping once potassium is stable in the 3.5–4.5 mEq/L range and the precipitant has been managed, with all plans individualized to comorbidities and concomitant medications [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC].

---

For a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, **oral potassium chloride 40–60 mEq/day** [^1133WKat] in divided doses for 3–5 days is appropriate, with **daily monitoring** [^112AewMC] until potassium is ≥ 3.5 mEq/L. If oral therapy is not tolerated or potassium falls below 2.5 mEq/L, use **IV potassium** [^116c8DvS] with close monitoring. Duration is individualized based on response, ongoing losses, and comorbidities; once stable, taper to maintenance (typically 20 mEq/day) [^115rjaaf] and reassess weekly until stable.

---

## Clinical significance of potassium level 3.1 mEq/L

Potassium level 3.1 mEq/L represents **moderate hypokalemia** [^notfound], which can cause arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and fatigue; **prompt correction** is essential to prevent complications.

---

## Recommended duration of potassium supplementation

The duration of potassium supplementation depends on the **severity of hypokalemia**, the **underlying cause**, and the **patient's response** to therapy. For a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, the following general guidelines apply:

- **Initial supplementation**: Oral potassium chloride 40–60 mEq/day [^1133WKat] in divided doses (maximum 40 mEq per dose) for 3–5 days [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Serum potassium should be monitored daily [^112AewMC] during the initial supplementation period until it returns to normal (≥ 3.5 mEq/L).

- **Maintenance therapy**: Once potassium levels stabilize within the normal range, maintenance therapy may be continued at a lower dose (typically 20 mEq/day) [^115rjaaf] with periodic monitoring.

---

## Factors influencing duration of supplementation

Several factors influence the **duration** of potassium supplementation:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Severity of hypokalemia | More severe cases may require longer supplementation |
| Underlying cause | Persistent causes (e.g. diuretic use, chronic diarrhea) may necessitate ongoing supplementation |
| Patient's response | Rapid responders may require shorter supplementation |
| Comorbidities | Renal impairment, cardiac disease, or diabetes may prolong supplementation |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** based on patient-specific factors. The American Family Physician (AAFP) recommends oral potassium supplementation for mild to moderate hypokalemia, with close monitoring of serum potassium levels and adjustment of therapy based on patient response [^115h7Ejq]. The FDA provides specific dosing recommendations for potassium chloride supplementation, including initial treatment doses and maintenance therapy [^1133WKat].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of prolonged potassium supplementation

Prolonged potassium supplementation carries potential risks, including:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Excessive potassium intake can lead to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those taking potassium-sparing medications [^112d5T7d].

- **Gastrointestinal irritation**: Oral potassium supplements may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, or diarrhea [^116UhpET].

- **Drug interactions**: Potassium supplements may interact with medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics, increasing the risk of hyperkalemia [^116uiJqX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **serum potassium levels** is essential during supplementation. Initial monitoring should be daily until potassium levels stabilize, followed by weekly checks once stable. Ongoing monitoring should continue monthly to biannually for maintenance therapy or prophylaxis [^112AewMC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial supplementation**: 40–60 mEq/day orally in divided doses for 3–5 days [^1133WKat].

- **Monitoring**: Daily serum potassium checks until normalization (≥ 3.5 mEq/L) [^112AewMC].

- **Maintenance therapy**: 20 mEq/day once stable, with periodic monitoring [^115rjaaf].

- **Individualization**: Adjust duration based on severity, cause, response, and comorbidities [^115h7Ejq].

---

The recommended duration of potassium supplementation for a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L is **typically 3–5 days** [^1133WKat] of oral potassium chloride supplementation, with daily monitoring until potassium levels normalize. The duration may be extended based on patient-specific factors, including the severity of hypokalemia, underlying causes, and response to therapy.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Efficacy of potassium supplementation in hypokalemic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^111SbW8q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been associated with increased risks of peritonitis and death. Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult (aged ≥ 18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value < 3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤ 100 or > 100 mL/day).

Interventions

Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4–5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is < 3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis.

Results

A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315–417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53–0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147–247] vs 133 [IQR, 41–197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group.

Limitations

Not double-masked.

Conclusions

Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4–5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Lifestyle and psychosocial approaches — potassium-based strategies: In adults with or without hypertension, "potassium-based salt substitutes can be useful to prevent or treat elevated BP and hypertension… except in the presence of CKD or use of drugs that reduce potassium excretion where monitoring of serum potassium levels is indicated". In adults with elevated BP or hypertension, "moderate potassium supplementation, ideally from dietary sources, is recommended… except in the presence of CKD or use of drugs that reduce potassium excretion where monitoring of serum potassium levels is indicated". Moderate supplementation is defined as " ≤ 60 mmol/d (≈60 mEq/d)". Typical potassium-based salt substitutes "contain 25% to 30% potassium chloride, 65% to 75% sodium chloride, and 0% to 10% flavoring agents", and "Drugs that reduce potassium excretion include: potassium-sparing diuretics… mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists… angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors… angiotensin receptor blockers… and others; some immunosuppressive agents (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus)".

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114qmY6k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this is the first meta‐analysis to investigate the effects of potassium supplementation on BP levels and with a specific focus on the dose‐response relationship. We found evidence for a nonlinear association, and for effect modification in those with hypertension, taking antihypertensive medication, or having a high sodium intake. Our findings for the effects of potassium intake on BP may explain, at least in part, the recently observed U‐shaped associations between serum potassium levels and risk of adverse outcomes in observational studies. They also support current European and US dietary recommendations for potassium intake and underscore the need to carefully address and manage potassium intake within comprehensive efforts to prevent CVD in both the general population and high‐risk subgroups.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine potassium replacement to achieve goal serum potassium ≥ 4.0 mmol / L in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^112zgMXp]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Internists routinely replete potassium to a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Recent literature demonstrates that a potassium goal of > 3.5mmol/L likely coincides with the lowest risk of mortality. Based on these data, internists should individualize potassium goals rather than routinely aiming for a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L.

### Potassium intake: the cinderella electrolyte [^113dEA5T]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Dietary guidelines recommend intake targets for some essential minerals, based on observational and experimental evidence relating mineral intake levels to health outcomes. For prevention of cardiovascular disease, reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake are the principal tools. While reducing sodium intake has received greatest public health priority, emerging evidence suggests that increasing potassium intake may be a more important target for cardiovascular prevention. Increased potassium intake reduces blood pressure and mitigates the hypertensive effects of excess sodium intake, and the recent large Phase III SSaSS trial reported that increasing potassium intake (and reducing sodium intake) in populations with low potassium intake and high sodium intake, through salt substitution (25% KCl, 75%NaCl), reduces the risk of stroke in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. As key sources of potassium intake include fruit, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, higher potassium intake may be associated with healthy dietary patterns. The current review makes the case that increasing potassium intake might represent a more advantageous dietary strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Future research should focus on addressing the independent effect of potassium supplementation in populations with low or moderate potassium intake, and determine effective strategies to increase potassium intake from diet.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Potassium intake and supplementation — Higher dietary intake of potassium-rich foods and a lower urinary sodium to potassium ratio are associated with lower BP and lower stroke and mortality rates; trials show moderate potassium supplementation lowers BP by 6/4 mm Hg on average, with greater effects among participants with hypertension and those with higher urinary sodium excretion at baseline, especially ≥ 4000 mg/day, and a U-shaped response with maximal lowering at approximately 30 mmol/day and increases above 80 mmol/day, with the BP increase at > 80 mmol/day most evident in those taking antihypertensive therapy.

Aldosterone antagonists — initiation and monitoring: Spironolactone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, or occasionally on alternate days, and eplerenone was used at 25 mg per day, increasing to 50 mg daily. Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Maintenance of serum potassium levels ≥ 3.6 mEq / L versus ≥ 4.5 mEq / L after isolated elective coronary artery bypass grafting and the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation: pilot and feasibility study results [^1144yFD4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Serum potassium levels frequently are maintained at high levels (≥ 4.5 mEq/L) to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery (AFACS), with limited evidence. Before undertaking a noninferiority randomized controlled trial to investigate the noninferiority of maintaining levels ≥ 3.6 mEq/L compared with this strategy, the authors wanted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of recruiting for such a trial.

Design

Pilot and feasibility study of full trial protocol.

Setting

Two university tertiary-care hospitals.

Participants

A total of 160 individuals undergoing first-time elective isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.

Interventions

Randomization (1:1) to protocols aiming to maintain serum potassium at either ≥ 3.6 mEq/L or ≥ 4.5 mEq/L after arrival in the postoperative care facility and for 120 hours or until discharge from the hospital or AFACS occurred, whichever happened first.

Measurements and Main Results

Primary outcomes: (1) whether it was possible to recruit and randomize 160 patients for six months (estimated 20% of those eligible); (2) maintaining supplementation protocol violation rate ≤ 10% (defined as potassium supplementation being inappropriately administered or withheld according to treatment allocation after a serum potassium measurement); and (3) retaining 28-day follow-up rates ≥ 90% after surgery. Between August 2017 and April 2018, 723 patients were screened and 160 (22%) were recruited. Potassium protocol violation rate = 9.8%. Follow-up rate at 28 days = 94.3%. Data on planned outcomes for the full trial also were collected.

Conclusions

It is feasible to recruit and randomize patients to a study assessing the impact of maintaining serum potassium concentrations at either ≥ 3.6 mEq/L or ≥ 4.5 mEq/L on the incidence of AFACS.

### Association between potassium supplementation and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with hypokalemia administered liposomal amphotericin B: a nationwide observational study [^115UbiuU]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of any stage of AKI was not associated with potassium supplementation in patients with hypokalemia administered L-AMB, which was confirmed after adjusting for potential confounding variables. As L-AMB treatment decreases serum potassium levels, in a portion of the study subjects supplemented with potassium, insufficient correction or maintenance failure of serum potassium levels might lead to renal dysfunction. Considering that potassium supplementation prior to deterioration of hypokalemia effectively corrected serum potassium levels in patients treated with L-AMB, early potassium supplementation might be effective for preventing AKI. For patients treated with L-AMB, appropriate timing for potassium supplementation after hypokalemia onset, proper dosing or duration of potassium supplementation, as well as the potential effects on renal dysfunction must be further elucidated.

Before applying the criteria of patient selection for AKI evaluation, we observed that 43% (122/282) of the patients developed hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L serum potassium) after L-AMB initiation, which agreed with the value reported in another study. In patients who developed hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation, the time from hypokalemia onset to AKI onset tended to be longer in patients supplemented with potassium than in those who did not receive potassium supplementation (supplementation: 11.0 ± 10.6 days, non-supplementation: 6.3 ± 3.7 days, P = 0.073). The time from L-AMB initiation to hypokalemia onset was similar between both populations (supplementation: 4.1 ± 2.4 days, non-supplementation: 4.6 ± 4.2 days, P = 0.724). Potassium supplementation was promptly performed within 1.5 ± 1.3 days after hypokalemia onset. Thus, potassium supplementation might be effective at delaying AKI development in patients who develop hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation.

DIETARY POTASSIUM INTAKE

Rather than binding potassium after dietary intake, a more direct strategy against hyperkalaemia could be to prescribe a low potassium diet (Figure 1). In patients with a tendency to develop hyperkalaemia, a dietary potassium intake of < 3 g/day (< 77 mmol/day) is recommended. Of note, the general population and patients with CKD already consume a relatively low potassium diet. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of lower and higher dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD (including patients treated with dialysis) on serum potassium and mortality. This review found that a potassium-restricted diet (1295 mg/day) lowered serum potassium by 0.22 mmol/L compared with an unrestricted — but still low potassium — diet (1570 mg/day). Furthermore, a low potassium diet (1670 mg/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard compared with higher dietary potassium intake (4414 mg/day). However, the evidence to support these effects was classified as very low-quality evidence. A small randomized controlled trial analysed the effect of dietary potassium restriction for 2 years on nerve function in patients with CKD Stage G3 or G4. The intervention caused modest but significant reductions in dietary potassium intake (3272 versus 3874 g/day) and serum potassium (4.6 versus 4.8 mmol/L), which was sufficient to improve the total neuropathy score (the primary outcome). This study illustrates that dietary potassium restriction may have benefits beyond lowering serum potassium, although the study had several limitations. At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that higher dietary potassium intake may be beneficial, even for patients with CKD. To date, 11 cohort studies analysed the association between urinary potassium excretion (as a proxy for dietary intake) and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD. Although the majority of these studies showed that a higher urinary potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes or mortality, this was not a consistent finding. To address the possibility of a causal link between dietary potassium depletion and kidney outcomes, we are currently conducting a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial with potassium supplementation in patients with CKD. Higher dietary potassium intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of stroke in subjects without CKD and prevents kidney damage in experimental models of CKD. Because a high potassium diet usually consists of fruits and vegetables, potassium-independent factors such as low animal protein, high-fiber content and an alkaline diet may also play a role. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial showed that both alkali treatment and fruits and vegetables can reduce kidney injury in patients with CKD. To take advantage of these effects, the need for clinical trials comparing a potassium-restricted diet with the combination of a potassium-liberalized diet and potassium binders in patients treated with haemodialysis has recently been emphasized.

### Association between potassium supplementation and the occurrence of acute kidney injury in patients with hypokalemia administered liposomal amphotericin B: a nationwide observational study [^115YqMbF]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sex and age were obtained on the first day of the month of L-AMB initiation. Comorbidities and fungal infections were identified using the corresponding ICD-10 codes which were registered on the month of L-AMB initiation. L-AMB treatment duration was defined as the time from treatment initiation to discontinuation (interval ≥ 8 days). The treatment department was defined as that which initiated L-AMB treatment.

Variables associated with serum potassium levels and potassium supplementation were assessed at different periods between patients with hypokalemia before and after L-AMB initiation. The duration of hypokalemia was defined as the consecutive duration of having a serum potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L between 7 days before and the day of L-AMB initiation for patients with hypokalemia before L-AMB initiation, while that was also defined as the consecutive duration of having a serum potassium level < 3.5 mEq/L between the day after L-AMB initiation and the day before AKI or 7 days after L-AMB termination for patients with hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation. For patients with hypokalemia before L-AMB initiation, the minimum level of serum potassium was evaluated between 7 days before and the day of L-AMB initiation for patients who were or were not supplemented with potassium or between 7 days before L-AMB initiation and the day before supplementation initiation for patients who were adequately or inadequately supplemented with potassium. For patients with hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation, the minimum serum potassium level was also evaluated between the day after L-AMB initiation and the day before AKI or 7 days after L-AMB termination for patients who were or were not supplemented with potassium or between the day after L-AMB initiation and the day before potassium supplementation initiation for patients who were adequately or inadequately supplemented with potassium. The average serum potassium levels and the duration of potassium supplementation following hypokalemia onset, defined as the time from supplementation initiation to discontinuation (interval ≥ 2 days), were evaluated between 7 days before and the day of L-AMB initiation for patients with hypokalemia before L-AMB initiation, or between the day after L-AMB initiation and the day before AKI or 7 days after L-AMB termination for patients with hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation. Daily and cumulative potassium dosing during potassium supplementation duration were also calculated.

Items include Restore circulatory volume, Check electrolyte levels with Electrolyte replacement to correct deficiencies and Monitor fluid balance, and Check potassium, magnesium, phosphorus. Guidance includes Do not discontinue feeding if electrolyte levels fall and When serum potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus levels are significantly low, feeding should not be advanced further until supplementation has occurred. Calculations should Consider all sources of calories and fluids in your calculations (including dextrose), and clinicians should Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) and replace any low levels promptly. Fluid management notes Unless hemodynamically unstable, keep sodium-containing IV fluids to < 2 L/d initially in severely malnourished patients, such as those with anorexia nervosa, who may have a component of cardiomyopathy. Patients at high risk for RS should receive electrolytes substitution of lower than normal/in low normal range, and Prophylactic supplementation of electrolytes.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. (2.1)
If serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. (2.1)
Take with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking. (2.1)
Treatment of hypokalemia: Doses range from 40–100 mEq/day in divided doses. Limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. (2.2)
Prevention of hypokalemia: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. (2.2)

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Take potassium chloride extended-release tablets with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take potassium chloride extended-release tablets on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].

Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking.

2.2 Dosing

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose.

Treatment of Hypokalemia: Typical dose range is 40–100 mEq per day.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis: Typical dose range is 20 mEq per day.

We retrieved 236 unique study articles, 144 of which were excluded on the basis of the article's title or abstract. Main reasons for exclusion were: nonexperimental design (including case reports), experimental studies where the intervention did not include potassium supplementation or where potassium was included in a mixed intervention with other active components, secondary hypertension, and animal and in vitro studies. Following full‐text review, we excluded 60 of the remaining 92 articles because they were review articles, were reports based on a potassium supplementation phase < 4 weeks, did not report on urinary excretion of potassium or sodium, did not provide BP levels, were not based on a potassium supplementation trial, and were duplicate reports or detailed studies confined to children.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114u8tnJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The public health implications of our findings of a U‐shaped relationship between potassium excretion and BP levels appears to be considerably more important for a potassium intake that is too "low" rather than too "high", also recognizing that the situation is different in clinical practice, where risk associated with hyperkaliemia has a different pattern 11, 24 and therapy. 83 In fact, potassium intake even in "acculturated" populations with an adequate diet tends to be lower, and sometimes much lower, than the adequate intake identified and recommended by risk assessment agencies, public health authorities, and professional societies. 13, 20, 84 Therefore, dietary advice to increase potassium intake is likely to have beneficial effects and result in decreased BP levels in most populations. On the other hand, some populations and some selected subgroups and particularly some individuals (namely, those with hypertension treated with antihypertensive medication), if having a high baseline potassium intake, should be advised not to exceed the potassium intake levels found to be optimal in this meta‐analysis. This may also be true for individuals with low‐to‐intermediate sodium intake, because our analysis also suggests that those with a high sodium intake, as is typical in Western populations, 85, 86, 87 benefit disproportionately from potassium supplementation and may also be more resistant to the BP increase following administration of a high potassium intake, suggesting an interaction between the 2 minerals. In addition, the number of studies was not enough to allow us to perform more detailed stratified subgroup analyses based on presence or absence of hypertension status and category of sodium intake, thus preventing us from verifying the presence of a possible interaction between hypertension status and sodium intake. Our BP estimates for the BP effect of a high potassium intake had wide CIs, making them less certain than BP effects at lower intakes of potassium, because of the small number of studies with relevant information at higher intakes of potassium and the resulting statistical imprecision of the effect estimate. In addition, the results based on achieved potassium excretion yielded little evidence of an increase in BP following a high potassium intake, further calling for caution about the effects of high intake of potassium on BP.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: systematic review and meta-analyses [^114KLrCh]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

We defined the following subgroups during the protocol development with input from the WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group to test specific objectives: achieved potassium intake in intervention or comparison group (< 90 mmol/day v 90–120 mmol/day v 120–155 mmol/day v > 155 mmol/day) (note: original studies reported urinary potassium excretion; using a conversion factor of 1.3),70 mmol/day urinary potassium equals approximately 90 mmol/day potassium intake, 90 mmol/day urinary potassium equals 120 mmol/day intake, and 120 mmol/day urinary potassium equals 155 mmol/day intake); achieved difference in potassium intake between intervention or comparison and control (< 30 mmol/day v 30–60 mmol/day v > 60 mmol/day); average potassium intake at baseline (< 50 mmol/day v 50–80 mmol/day v > 80 mmol/day); average sodium intake at baseline (< 2 g/day v 2–4 g/day v > 4 g/day); hypertensive status of participants at baseline (with hypertension v without hypertension v undetermined or mixed); and sex (male v female v mixed). Additional subgroups in randomised controlled trials only were: type of intervention (diet or feeding v supplementation v advice); type of device used to measure blood pressure (automatic v manual); method of measurement of blood pressure (supine office v seated office v standing office v unspecified); study design (parallel v crossover); and duration of intervention (< 2 months v 2–4 months v > 4 months). We also planned to use these subgroups to examine reasons for heterogeneity.

We did a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of removing studies at high risk of bias from the analysis. For randomised controlled trials, we considered a study to be at high risk of bias if it was graded as inadequate in both the randomisation and concealment of allocation and in either blinding or loss to follow-up. For cohort studies, we considered a study to be at high risk of bias if the measurement method for estimating potassium intake was a single 24 hour dietary recall or if the study had high risk of confounding for both measurement method and a second reason.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^114QtKxR]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-10: Laboratory monitoring in new mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy — performance measure definition and rationale — defines the measure as the percentage of adults with heart failure started on MRA who had potassium and renal function checked within 1 wk of the patient initiation of the MRA prescription; the numerator is patients who had potassium and renal function checked within 1 wk of the patient initiation of the MRA prescription; the denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 y with a diagnosis of heart failure who filled a new prescription for MRA therapy, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions of none; the measurement period is 12 mo, sources of data include EHR data, administrative data/claims (inpatient or outpatient claims), administrative data/claims expanded (multiple sources), and paper medical record, attribution includes individual practitioner and facility, and the care setting includes outpatient and inpatient. The rationale notes hyperkalemia risk with aldosterone receptor antagonists ranging from 2% to 5% in trials to 24% to 36% in population-based registries; potassium levels > 5.5 mEq/L (approximately 12% in EMPHASIS-HF) should trigger discontinuation or dose reduction; potassium and renal function are most typically checked in 3 d and at 1 wk after initiating therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 mo; despite this risk, measurement of potassium within 2 wk of initiation is low; although the clinical guideline suggests checking in 3 d, this is not a formal recommendation and the writing committee chose a more conservative 7-d time period to allow flexibility and address weekend/holiday laboratory challenges.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112fKdMJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Modification of dietary factors may affect the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 1, 2, 3 A primary mechanism of action is through lowering blood pressure (BP), the most important major modifiable risk factor for CVD. 4, 5, 6 Both a lower sodium and a higher potassium intake have been associated with lowering of BP and a reduction in CVD. 7, 8, 9, 10 The role of these elements in BP control has been studied extensively in laboratory and epidemiological studies. 5, 11, 12, 13 In particular, experimental human studies (ie, randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) suggest that potassium supplementation may decrease BP, 14, 15, 16, 17 particularly in adults with hypertension. 12 However, an accurate assessment of the potassium‐BP dose‐response relationship has not been possible because of a lack of biostatistical models to conduct flexible, curvilinear modeling of RCTs with only 2 levels of exposure (placebo and potassium supplementation). 12, 18, 19 This has also hampered the use of evidence on the BP effects of potassium in recent risk assessments of adequate potassium intake performed by the European Food Safety Authority and the US National Academy of Medicine. 13, 19, 20 These assessments have therefore focused on outcomes, such as stroke 21 and other CVD events, 14, 19 although this evidence is limited by availability of only a relatively small number of studies that have used an observational design. In contrast, many RCTs have been conducted for estimation of the effect of potassium on BP. Some evidence has accrued from observational studies suggesting that a high potassium intake may increase the risk of hypertension, 22 stroke, 21 and CVD mortality. 23, 24 This has resulted in some concern about the potential for long‐term adverse effects of a high potassium intake in the general population. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

In this review, we aimed to assess the dose‐response relationship between potassium intake and BP on the basis of use of a new biostatistical method, 30 which allowed us to use experimental studies based on comparisons of 2 levels of potassium exposure, as is typical in most RCTs. In addition, we sought to compare the results of our dose‐response meta‐analysis with corresponding assessments generated using conventional meta‐analysis analytic techniques based on the assumption of a linear association between potassium intake and BP.

By using a new "1‐stage" model that allows for inclusion of trials with only 2 levels of exposure, as is the case for most RCTs, we detected a dose‐response curve for the BP effects of potassium that was curvilinear across a wide range of treatment differences and absolute values of potassium exposure. This may have major implications in the risk assessment of potassium supplementation. Our finding of a U‐shaped relationship between potassium intake and BP was somewhat unexpected on the basis of previous clinical trial meta‐analyses and assessments. Although it confirms previous reports that a minimum dose of potassium is necessary for a BP‐lowering effect of potassium supplementation, it also suggests that high doses of potassium may result in a higher level of BP. The BP‐increasing effect of high potassium exposure was observed in both our overall results and the subgroup analyses of participants with hypertension or a normal level of BP, although being stronger in the former group. The optimal levels of "supplemental" (net difference between the 2 arms) and overall (achieved) potassium excretion appeared to be 30 and 90 to 130 mmol/d (1200 and 3500–5100 mg/d), respectively. The corresponding intakes would be higher (ie, by using the generally adopted conversion factor of 1.3, 20, 21, 72, 73, 74, 75 ≈1500 mg/d of supplemental potassium and an overall intake of 4500–6500 mg/d). However, these estimates are based on a heterogeneous population mainly composed by adults with hypertension, and therefore not necessarily representing the general population. In addition, the estimates are based on experience in trials that disproportionally represent short‐term interventions. Estimates for those with a normal level of BP are lower than the aforementioned ones (ie, ≈800 mg/d of supplemental potassium and 4500 mg/d of total potassium intake), and these figures are consistent with those yielded by the trials of longer duration.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^112ykatP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Subjects and Methods

Study design

We analyzed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that assessed the effects of both potassium and sodium supplementation on blood pressure and vascular function in untreated prehypertensive individuals (i.e. individuals with a morning office systolic blood pressure [SBP] between 130 and 159 mm Hg after an overnight fasting) who did not use antihypertensive medication. The study protocol has been extensively described before. In brief, the participants were provided with a controlled diet, which contained on average 2.4 g (104 mmol) of sodium, based on the recommended maximum sodium intake of 2.0 to 2.4 g per day (which equals 87–104 mmol sodium or 5–6 g salt per day), and 2.3 g (59 mmol) of potassium per day for a 2500-kcal intake. The research facility supplied 90% of the daily energy needs, the remaining 10% were chosen by the participants from a list of products that were low in sodium and potassium. The average composition of the diet was calculated for which nutrient values were obtained from the Dutch food composition table, these values were described in a previously published work. For this study, we calculated the average phosphorus intake of the diet which was 2004 mg/d and standardized to 2500 kcal this would be 1806 mg/d. After a run-in period of 1 week on the controlled diet ("baseline"), individuals were randomized to take 8 sodium chloride capsules (i.e. 3.0 g = 130 mmol sodium), 8 potassium chloride capsules (i.e. 2.8 g = 72 mmol potassium), or 8 placebo capsules (cellulose) daily, for 4 weeks each. Individuals were weighed twice a week and, if needed, their energy intake was adjusted to keep body weight constant.

### Effects of short-term potassium chloride supplementation in patients with CKD [^1175f6ED]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies suggest that adequate dietary potassium intake (90–120 mmol/day) may be renoprotective, but the effects of increasing dietary potassium and the risk of hyperkalemia are unknown.

Methods

This is a prespecified analysis of the run-in phase of a clinical trial in which 191 patients (age 68 ± 11 years, 74% males, 86% European ancestry, eGFR 31 ± 9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, 83% renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, 38% diabetes) were treated with 40 mmol potassium chloride (KCl) per day for 2 weeks.

Results

KCl supplementation significantly increased urinary potassium excretion (72 ± 24 to 107 ± 29 mmol/day), plasma potassium (4.3 ± 0.5 to 4.7 ± 0.6 mmol/L), and plasma aldosterone (281 [198–431] to 351 [241–494] ng/L), but had no significant effect on urinary sodium excretion, plasma renin, BP, eGFR, or albuminuria. Furthermore, KCl supplementation increased plasma chloride (104 ± 3 to 105 ± 4 mmol/L) and reduced plasma bicarbonate (24.5 ± 3.4 to 23.7 ± 3.5 mmol/L) and urine pH (all P < 0.001), but did not change urinary ammonium excretion. In total, 21 participants (11%) developed hyperkalemia (plasma potassium 5.9 ± 0.4 mmol/L). They were older and had higher baseline plasma potassium.

Conclusions

In patients with CKD stage G3b-4, increasing dietary potassium intake to recommended levels with potassium chloride supplementation raises plasma potassium by 0.4 mmol/L. This may result in hyperkalemia in older patients or those with higher baseline plasma potassium. Longer-term studies should address whether cardiorenal protection outweighs the risk of hyperkalemia. Clinical trial number: NCT03253172.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^112FCAPU]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Higher levels of dietary sodium intake and lower levels of dietary potassium intake are both associated with raised blood pressure (BP) and increased risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death. – There is a strong evidence base indicating that both reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake will reduce these risks through their BP-lowering effects. As a consequence, multiple authoritative bodies acknowledge these risks, and have made recommendations related to sodium and potassium intake. The World Health Organization (WHO), for example, has guidelines that make strong population-wide recommendations to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake. For sodium, the WHO has also explicitly proposed that all member states reduce mean population intake by 30% by 2025, with a target maximum intake of 2.0-g/day sodium (5.0-g/day salt), in support of global efforts to reduce the noncommunicable disease burden by one quarter.

Mean global sodium intake was recently estimated to be 4.3 g/day, which equates to about 10.8 g/day of table salt. The most recent corresponding estimated value for mean global potassium intake is about 2.3 g/day. These current intake values are substantially different from norms during hominid evolution when the estimated intake of sodium was about 0.5 g/day and the estimated potassium intake was about 10 g/day. Current sodium consumption varies substantially between populations with the estimated intake highest in the WHO Western Pacific region (6.2-g/day sodium and 15.6-g/day salt) driven by high consumption levels in China and lowest in Africa (2.7-g/day sodium and 6.7-g/day salt; Figure).

### Potassium chloride (K-tab) [^113U8bLU]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40–100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.

K-TAB tablets provide 10 mEq and 20 mEq of potassium chloride.

K-TAB tablets should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation (see WARNINGS).

NOTE: K-TAB tablets are to be swallowed whole without crushing, chewing or sucking the tablets.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117TGNts]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Dose‐response meta‐analysis of changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure levels (as mm Hg), according to achieved potassium excretion levels between arms (potassium supplemented and control group) at the end of the trials.

All studies included (N = 32). Spline curve (solid line) with 95% confidence limits (long dashed lines).

When we excluded the studies deemed to have a high RoB, the dose‐response analysis yielded similar results of that generated using the entire data set (Figures S3 and S4). We repeated the main analysis after systematically excluding each study in turn from the meta‐analysis, and no appreciable variation to the overall mean change in BP was noted (Figures S5 and S6). Similarly, a sensitivity analysis showing variation of the shape across studies identified study‐specific trends that were generally similar to the overall dose‐response meta‐analysis (Figures S7 and S8).

As reported in Figure 4, dose‐response analysis according to hypertension status, after removing trials performed in "mixed" samples with normal and high BP, showed a small decrease in mean BP levels associated with an increased potassium excretion up to 20 to 30 mmol/d in both normotensive and hypertensive trials, although in the latter the hypotensive effect of potassium was larger and occurred within a larger range of higher potassium excretion in supplemented participants (up to 90 mmol/d, versus a threshold of 60 mmol/d in those with no hypertension). For the increased BP levels following high amounts of potassium supplementation in participants with hypertension (Figure 5), it was considerably more evident in those receiving pharmacological treatment (starting at ≈60 mmol/d of difference in potassium excretion for the supplemented participants) compared with their counterparts not taking medications, for whom the BP increase started to occur at ≈110 mmol/d of excess potassium excretion. Further investigations to explore the effect of different antihypertensive treatment could not be performed because the original data did not report such stratified analyses by type of medication.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Potassium intake and supplementation — associations, magnitudes, and dose–response: Observational studies have consistently shown that higher dietary intake of potassium-rich foods and/or a lower urinary sodium to potassium ratio are associated with lower BP levels and lower stroke and mortality rates. Moderate potassium supplementation, on average, lowers BP by 6/4 mm Hg, with greater BP-lowering effects among participants with hypertension and those with higher urinary sodium excretion at baseline, especially ≥ 4000 mg/day. There appears to be a U-shaped relationship with maximal BP lowering at approximately 30 mmol/day supplementation and an increase in BP above 80 mmol/day, with the BP increase at higher doses (> 80 mmol/day) most evident in those taking antihypertensive therapy.

### Effects of potassium supplements on glucose metabolism in African Americans with prediabetes: a pilot trial [^112yHsYX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Low potassium has been identified both as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and as a mediator of the racial disparity in diabetes risk. Low potassium could be a potentially modifiable risk factor, particularly for African Americans. Objective: We sought to determine the effects of potassium chloride (KCl) supplements, at a commonly prescribed dose, on measures of potassium and glucose metabolism. Design: Among African-American adults with prediabetes, we conducted a double-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of 40 mEq K/d as KCl supplements with a matching placebo, taken for 3 mo, on measures of potassium and glucose metabolism, with measures collected from frequently sampled oral-glucose-tolerance tests (OGTTs). Results: Twenty-seven of 29 recruited participants completed the trial. Participants had high adherence to the study medication (92% by pill count). Participants in both groups gained weight, with an overall mean ± SD weight gain of 1.24 ± 2.03 kg. In comparison with participants who received placebo, urine potassium but not serum potassium increased significantly among participants randomly assigned to receive KCl (P = 0.005 and 0.258, respectively). At the end of the study, participants taking KCl had stable or improved fasting glucose, with a mean ± SD change in fasting glucose of -1.1 ± 8.4 mg/dL compared with an increase of 6.1 ± 7.6 mg/dL in those who received placebo (P = 0.03 for comparison between arms). There were no significant differences in glucose or insulin measures during the OGTT between the 2 groups, but there was a trend for improved insulin sensitivity in potassium-treated participants. Conclusions: In this pilot trial, KCl at a dose of 40 mEq/d did not increase serum potassium significantly. However, despite weight gain, KCl prevented worsening of fasting glucose. Further studies in larger sample sizes, as well as with interventions to increase serum potassium more than was achieved with our intervention, are indicated to definitively test this potentially safe and inexpensive approach to reducing diabetes risk. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02236598.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xsjtZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^115m9UAn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The regulation of potassium homoeostasis changes dramatically in patients with kidney failure who are treated by haemodialysis. With the kidney largely out of the equation, haemodialysis patients rely on potassium removal during each dialysis session to prevent hyperkalaemia. In addition, the gut becomes an important accessory organ for potassium excretion. Despite these adaptations, hyperkalaemia (defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) remains a common electrolyte disorder occurring in approximately 14% of haemodialysis patients. Although seemingly counterintuitive, a minority of haemodialysis patients is hypokalaemic (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L), and this is usually related to poor dietary intake. The target serum potassium in haemodialysis is unknown, but one study suggests that a serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mmol/L is associated with the greatest survival. Of note, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this optimal serum potassium range seems to be lower (4.0–4.5 mmol/L). Furthermore, when analysing serum potassium in haemodialysis patients, it is important to factor in when it was measured (after the long or short interdialytic interval, time of day and seasonality), and to analyse serial measurements to exclude transient hyperkalemia. Nephrologists can manage potassium balance in haemodialysis patients in three ways, including (i) by modifying the dialysate potassium concentration, (ii) by prescribing potassium binders and (iii) by modifying dietary potassium intake (Figure 1). The reason to implement such interventions is usually driven by recurring predialysis hyperkalaemia and the related risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Although the prevention of acute complications is important, another relevant question is how these interventions affect long-term outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials in this area. Therefore, instead, we need to rely on registries, which often provide useful insights into how real-world management influences long-term outcomes. A good example of such a registry is the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). In this issue, Mercadal et al. use this registry to analyse the effect of prescription patterns of dialysate potassium and potassium binders on survival in over 25 000 patients who started haemodialysis in 2010–13 and were followed until the end of 2014. Using Cox proportional hazard models, the investigators show that dialysis centres that used two or three dialysate potassium concentrations had a lower mortality risk than centres that only used one formula. In addition, patients who used the potassium binder sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate in a dose of 4–8 or ≥ 8 g/day had a lower mortality risk than patients who did not use potassium binders. Conversely, patients who used potassium binders in a dose < 4 g/day had a higher mortality risk. Oral potassium supplements, which were used in 6% of patients, were not associated with a survival benefit. What does this study teach us on potassium management in haemodialysis patients and what are the implications for clinical practice?

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### The contribution of sodium reduction and potassium increase to the blood pressure lowering observed in the salt substitute and stroke study [^114q9Jpq]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Data sources for estimating the dose-response relationship between sodium, potassium and systolic blood pressure

We used four different data sources to quantify the dose-response relationships between changes in sodium, potassium and systolic blood pressure.
Data source 1: Randomized trials of sodium reduction – we extracted data from our previously published systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the dose-response relationship between sodium reduction and blood pressure. We used data from the 55/133 studies with a follow-up duration of four weeks or longer (Supplementary Appendix 1). Seventy-eight studies of shorter than 4 weeks duration were not included because prior investigation indicates that the acute effects of sodium reduction on blood pressure may be different to the effects achieved in the longer term.
Data source 2: Meta-analysis of randomized trials of potassium supplementation - we extracted published results from a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the relationship between potassium supplementation and blood pressure. In this meta-analysis, only studies that were at least 4 weeks long were included, and other study inclusion criteria were broadly similar to the inclusion criteria for the sodium reduction trials included in data source 1. The potassium supplementation meta-analysis identified an overall non-linear relationship between potassium supplementation and blood pressure fall. The maximum systolic blood pressure fall of 3.3 mmHg (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.9) was achieved with potassium supplementation of about 30 mmol/day. Up to this level of supplementation and at the mean level of suppplementation achieved in SSaSS (i.e. 20.64 mmol/day), there was a linear association between potassium supplementation and blood pressure fall.
Data source 3: Randomized trials of salt substitution - we extracted data from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the effects of salt substitution on blood pressure. We used data from the 9/21 studies of at least four weeks duration that reported data on 24-h sodium, 24-h potassium and systolic blood pressure (Supplementary Appendix 2). Eleven trials did not report the required data and therefore were not included. Also data from the SSaSS study were not included.
Data source 4: Within-trial measures of sodium, potassium and blood pressure - we used data from the subset of 449 SSaSS participants who had both baseline and follow-up measurements of 24-h urinary sodium, 24-h urinary potassium and systolic blood pressure (Supplementary Appendix 3).

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1–5.4)

Guideline 5.1 -Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Guideline 5.2 - Selection of dialysate buffer

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in the range 18.0–26.0mmo/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to exposure to air) when interpreting levels. [1C]

We suggest the term 'dialysate buffer' rather than 'dialysate bicarbonate' to avoid confusion arising from differences in manufacturers' terminology. [2C]

We suggest choosing dialysate buffer below or equal to 37.0mEq/L for the majority of patients, using a standardised or individualised approach. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

Guideline 5.3 - Supplementation of dialysate with phosphate

We suggest considering supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate in patients on augmented dialysis schedules. [2D]

Guideline 5.4 - Paediatric dialysate considerations

We recommend individualisation of dialysate electrolyte concentrations, including potassium, buffer and calcium. [1C]

We suggest an individualised dialysate temperature, between core temperature and 0.5°C below, with monitoring of intradialytic core temperature for neonates and smaller children. [2D]

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^116p4Esf]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Excess dietary sodium intake and insufficient dietary potassium intake are both well-established risk factors for hypertension. Despite some successful initiatives, efforts to control hypertension by improving dietary intake have largely failed because the changes required are mostly too hard to implement. Consistent recent data from randomized controlled trials show that potassium-enriched, sodium-reduced salt substitutes are an effective option for improving consumption levels and reducing blood pressure and the rates of cardiovascular events and deaths. Yet, salt substitutes are inconsistently recommended and rarely used. We sought to define the extent to which evidence about the likely benefits and harms of potassium-enriched salt substitutes has been incorporated into clinical management by systematically searching guidelines for the management of hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We found incomplete and inconsistent recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes in the 32 hypertension and 14 kidney guidelines that we reviewed. Discussion among the authors identified the possibility of updating clinical guidelines to provide consistent advice about the use of potassium-enriched salt for hypertension control. Draft wording was chosen to commence debate and progress consensus building: strong recommendation for patients with hypertension — potassium-enriched salt with a composition of 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride should be recommended to all patients with hypertension, unless they have advanced kidney disease, are using a potassium supplement, are using a potassium-sparing diuretic, or have another contraindication. We strongly encourage clinical guideline bodies to review their recommendations about the use of potassium-enriched salt substitutes at the earliest opportunity.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults [^1126NGiN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence on the effects of potassium on blood pressure is inconsistent.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of potassium supplementation on health outcomes and blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral potassium supplements with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg); 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where: participants were pregnant; received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study; or potassium supplementation was combined with other interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

Six RCT's (n = 483), with eight to 16 weeks follow-up, met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of five trials (n = 425) with adequate data indicated that potassium supplementation compared to control resulted in a large but statistically non-significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -11.2, 95% CI: -25.2 to 2.7) and DBP (mean difference: -5.0, 95% CI: -12.5 to 2.4). The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by potassium dose, quality of trials or baseline blood pressure. Excluding one trial in an African population with very high baseline blood pressure resulted in smaller overall reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.9, 95% CI: -8.6 to 0.8; DBP mean difference: -1.5, 95% CI: -6.2 to 3.1). Further sensitivity analysis restricted to two high quality trials (n = 138) also found non-significant reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -7.1, 95% CI: -19.9 to 5.7; DBP mean difference: -5.5, 95% CI: -14.5 to 3.5).

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review found no statistically significant effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure. Because of the small number of participants in the two high quality trials, the short duration of follow-up, and the unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the evidence about the effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure is not conclusive. Further high quality RCTs of longer duration are required to clarify whether potassium supplementation can reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes.

### Examining the "Repletion reflex": the association between serum potassium and outcomes in hospitalized patients with heart failure [^113TKPvm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) exacerbations, physicians routinely supplement potassium to maintain levels ≥ 4.0 mEq/L. The evidence basis for this practice is relatively weak. We aimed to evaluate the association between serum potassium levels and outcomes in patients hospitalized with HF.

Methods

We identified patients admitted with acute HF exacerbations to hospitals that contributed to an electronic health record-derived dataset. In a subset of patients with normal admission serum potassium (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), we averaged serum potassium values during a 72-hour exposure window and categorized as follows: < 4.0 mEq/L (low normal), 4.0–4.5 mEq/L (medium normal), and > 4.5 mEq/L (high normal). We created multivariable models examining associations between these categories and outcomes.

Results

We included 4,995 patients: 2,080 (41.6%), 2,326 (46.6%), and 589 (11.8%) in the < 4.0, 4.0–4.5, and > 4.5 mEq/L cohorts, respectively. After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and presenting severity, we observed no difference in outcomes between the low and medium normal groups. Compared to patients with levels < 4.0 mEq/L, patients with a potassium level of > 4.5 mEq/L had a longer length of stay (median of 0.6 days; 95% CI = 0.1 to 1.0) but did not have statistically significant increases in mortality (OR [odds ratio] = 1.51; 95% CI = 0.97 to 2.36) or transfers to the intensive care unit (OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 0.98 to 3.26).

Conclusions

Inpatients with heart failure who had mean serum potassium levels of < 4.0 showed similar outcomes to those with mean serum potassium values of 4.0–4.5. Compared with mean serum potassium level of < 4.0, mean serum levels of > 4.5 may be associated with increased risk of poor outcomes.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1139ZFX3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results also provide support for the population goals for potassium intake recently set by international authorities, such as the 90 mmol/d (3500 mg/d) adequate intake adopted by the European Food Safety Authority 20 and the 87/66 mmol/d (3400–2600 mg/d) in men/women, recommended by the US National Academy of Medicine, 13 based on the outcome of observational studies on potassium intake and several health end points, such as the risk of stroke for the adequate intake set by the European Food Safety Authority.

There is strong biological plausibility for a decrease in BP with a low intake of potassium, and some evidence to support an increase in BP at high levels of intake. Several experimental studies in laboratory settings and in animals have identified several mechanisms that may explain the BP‐lowering effect of potassium supplementation. 88, 89, 90 Conversely, a high potassium intake could favor sodium excretion and an increase in renin activity and aldosterone levels, also dependent on preexisting electrolyte balance. 11, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95

Limitations of our meta‐analysis and of the underlying studies include the fact that most of the trials included were of relatively short duration, including both the period of supplementation and follow‐up (median, 4 weeks). Despite exclusion of trials with < 4 weeks of potassium supplementation and follow‐up, which may not reflect the long‐term effects of habitual potassium intake also attributable to the physiological adaptations that occur over time as a general response to dietary habits, extrapolation of our overall results to long‐term effects of potassium intake should still be made with caution. However, our analysis, restricted to the studies with the longest duration, yielded similar results and provides some reassurance that our findings may be extrapolated to longer periods of intake and therefore be more readily applicable to the general population. Also, our results, particularly in stratified analyses, were affected by statistical imprecision, particularly for the highest intakes of potassium and the longest duration of follow‐up, because of limited availability of studies in these settings.

### Potassium food additives and dietary management of serum potassium: proposed best-practice recommendations [^11512hWd]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The contribution of potassium food additives to total dietary potassium intake is unknown. This poses challenges for individuals living with kidney disease who may need to monitor their potassium intake. Additionally, different countries have varying regulations regarding the reporting of dietary potassium content in foods. This article examines the potential of published food databases to assist clinicians in helping individuals with kidney disease manage their serum potassium levels. It uses the United States Department of Agriculture's Branded Food Products Database as an example. Evidence for potassium additive content in database entries, along with their bioavailability, is discussed, and best-practice recommendations are made based on current evidence. Clinical practice and future research priorities are suggested.

### Role of dietary potassium and salt substitution in the prevention and management of hypertension [^113z9W9E]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to be the leading cause of deaths and disability worldwide and the major contributor is hypertension. Despite all the improvements in detecting hypertension together with technological advances and affordable, efficacious and relatively free of adverse effects anti-hypertensive agents, we continue to struggle to prevent the onset of hypertension and to control blood pressure (BP) to acceptable targets. The poor control of hypertension is commonly due to non-adherence to medications. Another reason is the failure to adopt diet and lifestyle changes. Reduction of dietary salt intake is important for lowering BP but the role of potassium intake is also important. Globally the intake of sodium is double that of the recommended 2gm per day (equivalent to 5gm of sodium chloride/salt) and half that of the daily recommended intake of potassium of 3500mg/day, giving a sodium-to-potassium ratio of > 1, when ideally it should be < 1. Many studies have shown that a higher potassium intake is associated with lower BPs, particularly when coupled concurrently with a lower sodium intake giving a lower sodium to potassium ratio. Most hypertension guidelines, while recommending reduction of salt intake to a set target, do not specifically recommend a target for potassium intake nor potassium supplementation. Here we review the role of potassium and salt substitution with potassium in the management of hypertension. Hence, the focus of dietary changes to lower BP and improve BP control should not be on reduction of salt intake alone but more importantly should include an increase in potassium intake.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114bUYDs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We performed a meta‐analysis of SBP and DBP weighted mean differences before and after potassium supplementation for each study and for the relevant subgroups using a "1‐stage" natural cubic spline regression model on the basis of a random effects model, 32 assessing heterogeneity with the I 2 statistic. 33 The 1‐stage method, consisting of a weighted mixed effects model, was recently developed 30 and used in dose‐response meta‐analysis, 34, 35 and it allowed us to make inferences about the average dose‐response relationship between changes in potassium excretion attributable to supplementation or overall potassium excretion at the end of the trial and changes in SBP and DBP levels. The 1‐stage approach allowed us to include trials based on 2 levels of exposure, as was the case for most of the trials included in our study. Having no specific parametric assumptions about the shape of the association, we used restricted cubic splines of potassium with 3 knots at fixed percentiles (10%, 50%, and 90%). 36 For comparison, we also used a linear function to model potassium intake in relationship to level of BP. Estimates of the parameters were obtained using restricted maximum likelihood. 30, 36

We defined the mean difference in potassium excretion between the arms of each RCT as the difference between the values of potassium excretion at the end of the trial and the ones at baseline in each arm. Likewise, we defined the mean difference in BP following the intervention as the difference for SBP and DBP at the end of the trial minus the corresponding baseline value.

In addition to the main analysis, we conducted stratified analyses based on study design (parallel versus crossover), hypertension status, use of antihypertensive medication (excluding normotensives), baseline potassium excretion (< 75 and ≥ 75 mmol/d), position during BP measurement (supine, seated, standing, or other), type of BP measurement device (automatic or manual), baseline sodium excretion (< 3, 3–4, or ≥ 4 g/d), and length of follow‐up (≥ 12 weeks). In sensitivity analyses, we excluded trials at high risk for bias. We also reran the main analysis repeatedly, each time without one of the studies, to assess the missing study's influence on overall mean BP change, and we assessed the study‐specific dose‐response trends in comparison with the corresponding dose‐response meta‐analysis for all trials.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We conducted an independent assessment of study quality using the risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool (2.0). The following 6 RoB domains were considered: (1) randomization process errors; (2) deviations from the intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) systematic errors in measurement of the outcome; (5) bias in selection of the reported result. In addition, we included an evaluation of the (6) RoB related to use of a crossover study design, assessing the use of a washout period and whether the trial duration was at least 4 weeks. Each domain could be characterized as having a low RoB, some concerns, or a high RoB. A study was assigned an overall higher RoB if it was judged to be at higher risk for at least 1 domain, and an intermediate RoB when some concern existed for at least 1 of domains 1, 2, and 6, or for ≥ 2 domains 3 to 5.

Data Extraction

For each eligible study, the following data were extracted independently by 2 of the authors (M. I.K. T.F.) and confirmed by a third author (D.T.): first author name, publication year, country, duration of potassium intervention phase, number of participants and their characteristics (sex, age, hypertensive status, use of antihypertensive medication), study design, presence and duration of a washout period, modality of BP measurement, type and quantity of the potassium supplements, baseline and achieved potassium excretion level, sodium excretion at baseline and after the intervention, modification of sodium intake, and summary statistics of SBP and DBP levels (mean level in each group, active and control, for crossover studies or mean difference for parallel studies along with SD/SE).

Summary — guidance for kidney care professionals emphasizes that potassium and phosphorus additive considerations are timely given the rapid expansion of processed foods and recommendations to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes to reduce sodium intake; potassium additives may be beneficial in patients at low risk for hyperkalemia, and when restriction of potassium-based additives is needed, interventions could range from basic to advanced depending on the level of hyperkalemia risk; phosphorus additives entail nonhealth benefits, and limiting their intake is recommended in all patients with CKD using a similar tiered approach.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116zEYjo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Epidemiologic studies, including trials, suggest an association between potassium intake and blood pressure (BP). However, the strength and shape of this relationship is uncertain. Methods and Results We performed a meta-analysis to explore the dose-response relationship between potassium supplementation and BP in randomized-controlled trials with a duration ≥ 4 weeks using the recently developed 1-stage cubic spline regression model. This model allows use of trials with at least 2 exposure categories. We identified 32 eligible trials. Most were conducted in adults with hypertension using a crossover design and potassium supplementation doses that ranged from 30 to 140 mmol/d. We observed a U-shaped relationship between 24-hour active and control arm differences in potassium excretion and BP levels, with weakening of the BP reduction effect above differences of 30 mmol/d and a BP increase above differences ≈80 mmol/d. Achieved potassium excretion analysis also identified a U-shaped relationship. The BP-lowering effects of potassium supplementation were stronger in participants with hypertension and at higher levels of sodium intake. The BP increase with high potassium excretion was noted in participants with antihypertensive drug-treated hypertension but not in their untreated counterparts. Conclusions We identified a nonlinear relationship between potassium intake and both systolic and diastolic BP, although estimates for BP effects of high potassium intakes should be interpreted with caution because of limited availability of trials. Our findings indicate an adequate intake of potassium is desirable to achieve a lower BP level but suggest excessive potassium supplementation should be avoided, particularly in specific subgroups.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: systematic review and meta-analyses [^113UUt58]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Optimum potassium intake

This review is the first to attempt to determine an optimum level of potassium intake for affecting health outcomes. Moderate and high quality evidence showed that a higher potassium intake of 90–120 mmol/day reduced blood pressure and was associated with a lower risk of incident stroke. Intake above 120 mmol/day did not seem to have any additional benefit. However, the evidence from the randomised controlled trials and cohort studies in adults was limited in that it did not identify a precise optimal level of potassium intake for maximum health benefits. However, if a person consumes 90 mmol/day or more potassium and the WHO recommended sodium intake of less than 2 g/day, his or her intake would have a molar ratio of sodium to potassium of approximately one to one, a ratio considered beneficial for health. A subgroup analysis of the randomised controlled trials to explore whether different levels of sodium intake influenced the effect of potassium on blood pressure showed no statistically significant difference in the effect estimates among subgroups based on sodium intake. However, the results suggest that potassium may be more effective in reducing blood pressure at higher levels of sodium consumption, consistent with previous findings. The largest benefit was detected when sodium intake was more than 4 g/day, which is the intake of most populations globally, so increased potassium intake should benefit most people in most countries. However, we also found a statistically significant decrease in blood pressure with increased potassium when sodium intake was 2–4 g/day. Therefore, increased potassium can continue to be beneficial in terms of blood pressure even as individuals and populations decrease their sodium intake. Studies examining both nutrients simultaneously support this concept, showing an increased benefit with simultaneous reduction in sodium and increase in potassium compared with changes in one nutrient individually.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^116qvuJs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Effects of potassium supplementation on bone and mineral parameters

Potassium supplementation led to an increase in 24 hours urinary potassium excretion (from 55 ± 17 to 118 ± 32 mmol/24 hours), and also to a small increase in plasma potassium (from 4.29 ± 0.32 to 4.41 ± 0.30 mmol/L). FGF23 levels decreased during potassium supplementation compared with placebo (geometric mean: from 114.3 RU/mL [95% CI, 96.2–135.8, P = 0.01] to 108.5 RU/mL [95% CI, 93.0–126.6]) (Table 2 and Fig. 1D). The effect of potassium supplementation on FGF23 remained after adjustment for plasma phosphate (treatment effect: –0.06 [–0.11 to –0.02]), and showed similar trends in participants with plasma 25(OH)-vitamin D 3 levels < 50 nmol/L (N = 11, FGF23 from 103.4 [81.6–131.0] to 98.7 [78.2–124.6] RU/mL) vs participants with plasma 25(OH)-vitamin D 3 levels > 50 nmol/L (N = 24, FGF23 from 121.8 [97.6–152.1] to 114.9 [94.6–139.5] RU/mL). Compared with placebo, plasma phosphate concentration increased from 1.10 ± 0.19 to 1.15 ± 0.19 mmol/L (P = 0.004) (Table 2). The increase in plasma phosphate coincided with a decrease in fractional excretion of phosphate (from 15.8 ± 5.8 to 13.3 ± 4.2%, P < 0.001) and an increase in the maximal phosphate tubular reabsorption, as reflected by the TmP/GFR (from 0.93 ± 0.21 to 1.01 ± 0.20, P < 0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 1A, C). Furthermore, the change in TmP/GFR was correlated with the change in plasma phosphate (Fig. 2, r s = 0.91, P < 0.001). The 24-hour urinary phosphate excretion did not change (Table 2 and Fig. 1B). Levels of 25(OH)-vitamin D 3 and PTH also did not change after 4 weeks of potassium supplementation (Table 2 and Fig. 1E, F). Potassium supplementation did lead to a decrease in fractional calcium excretion (from 1.25 ± 0.50 to 1.11 ± 0.46%, P = 0.03), and a nonsignificant lower trend in 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (from 4.28 ± 1.91 to 4.05 ± 2.15 mmol/24 hours, P = 0.3) (Table 2). The effect of potassium on fractional calcium excretion was relatively large, as reflected by a mean percentage change of –10.6% (Table 3). The change in FGF23 in response to potassium supplementation correlated with the change in urinary calcium excretion (r s = 0.34, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Potassium supplementation did not, however, influence plasma calcium. As reported previously, 24-hour SBP and DBP decreased during potassium supplementation (24-hours SBP from 129 ± 14 to 126 ± 13 mm Hg, 24-hours DBP from 77 ± 8 to 75 ± 8 mm Hg). Changes in FGF23 were not correlated with changes in blood pressure (Fig. 2). Potassium supplementation did not have an effect on eGFR compared with placebo (from 79.2 ± 11.6 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 to 78.5 ± 11.7 mL/min per 1.73 m 2).

### Dialysate potassium, serum potassium, mortality, and arrhythmia events in hemodialysis: results from the dialysis outcomes and practice patterns study (DOPPS) [^115cEoHM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden death is a leading cause of death in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy. During hemodialysis sessions, the gradient between serum and dialysate levels results in rapid electrolyte shifts, which may contribute to arrhythmias and sudden death. Controversies exist about the optimal electrolyte concentration in the dialysate; specifically, it is unclear whether patient outcomes differ among those treated with a dialysate potassium concentration of 3 mEq/L compared to 2 mEq/L.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

55,183 patients from 20 countries in the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) phases 1 to 5 (1996–2015).

Predictor

Dialysate potassium concentration at study entry.

Outcomes

Cox regression was used to estimate the association between dialysate potassium concentration and both all-cause mortality and an arrhythmia composite outcome (arrhythmia-related hospitalization or sudden death), adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

During a median follow-up of 16.5 months, 24% of patients died and 7% had an arrhythmia composite outcome. No meaningful difference in clinical outcomes was observed for patients treated with a dialysate potassium concentration of 3 versus 2 mEq/L (adjusted HRs were 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91–1.01] for mortality and 0.98 [95% CI, 0.88–1.08] for arrhythmia composite). Results were similar across predialysis serum potassium levels. As in prior studies, higher serum potassium level was associated with adverse outcomes. However, dialysate potassium concentration had only minimal impact on serum potassium level measured predialysis (+0.09 [95% CI, 0.05–0.14] mEq/L serum potassium per 1 mEq/L greater dialysate potassium concentration).

Limitations

Data were not available for delivered (vs prescribed) dialysate potassium concentration and postdialysis serum potassium level; possible unmeasured confounding.

Conclusions

In combination, these results suggest that approaches other than altering dialysate potassium concentration (eg, education on dietary potassium sources and prescription of potassium-binding medications) may merit further attention to reduce risks associated with high serum potassium levels.

### Potassium chloride extended-release (Potassium chloride) [^115j72ug]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances or cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.

If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, eg, where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high-potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels.

In rare circumstances (eg, patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.

### Impact of plasma potassium normalization on short-term mortality in patients with hypertension and hyperkalemia [^112RDEXp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure Variable

Normal plasma potassium interval varies within populations. Therefore, different reference intervals are used worldwide. 9, 10, 11 The Nordic Reference Interval Project defines hypokalemia as plasma potassium concentrations < 3.5 mmol/L and hyperkalemia and potassium levels > 4.6 mmol/L. 10

As potassium does not have a linear relationship with mortality, the second potassium measurement was divided into 8 intervals: 2.2 to 2.9 mmol/L, 3.0 to 3.4 mmol/L, 3.5 to 3.7 mmol/L, 3.8 to 4.0 mmol/L, 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L, 4.7 to 5.0 mmol/L, 5.1 to 5.5 mmol/L, and 5.6 to 7.8 mmol/L. Plasma potassium interval 4.1 to 4.6 mmol/L was used as the reference for statistical analyses. We chose this interval as the reference group on the basis of the study of Krogager et al 3 and the lowest mortality risk observed in a restricted cubic spline curve (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Restricted cubic spline curve showing the adjusted hazard ratios for all‐cause mortality as a function of second plasma potassium measurement.

Knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of plasma potassium. The model is adjusted for age, sex, plasma sodium, renal insufficiency, malignancy, heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, antihypertensive therapy, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, xanthines, laxatives, digoxin, and potassium supplements.

Outcome

The primary outcome of the study was all‐cause mortality within 90 days of the second plasma potassium measurement occurring 6 to 100 days after the first plasma potassium measurement indicating hyperkalemia. The secondary outcome was cardiovascular death within 90 days of the second potassium measurement.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1136PaYq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the management of hyperkalemia in these patient populations may include reduction or discontinuation of RAASi, this may have a negative impact on outcomes. Adverse cardiorenal outcomes have been observed to increase with RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, particularly in cohorts with CKD and HF. 50 Therefore, optimizing the therapeutic dosage of RAASi is encouraged, despite any difficulties in managing hyperkalemia. Due to the high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with HF, there is a risk that target doses of the disease‐modifying drugs cannot be achieved, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy.

Although the problem of hyperkalemia in these patients appears significant, one if its clear causes are the lack of sufficient control of potassium levels in primary care, which leads to the hyperkalemia rates described above, together with their complications. Nilsson et al. examined patients starting MRA therapy between 2007 and 2010 in Sweden and found that only 24% were adequately monitored at the recommended intervals. 51 The prompt recognition of hyperkalemia usually leads to its treatment, improving the rates of optimum treatment in HF patients.

In general, HF patients with renal dysfunction, high potassium levels (> 5.0 mEq/L) or bilateral renal stenosis might need a rechecking of potassium levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of RAASi and then every 3 to 5 months, while treatment may be stopped or the dose reduced when potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Regarding MRAs in these patients, potassium is checked after 1 week, then 4, and then every 3 months; again, treatment is stopped or tapered when the potassium level reaches > 5.5 mEq/L.

In every case, we should try to restart treatment. HF treatment guidelines do not encourage MRAs use in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In addition, it is important to instigate dietary counseling regarding potassium and reappraise concomitant medications (eg, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.) in those patients.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^1155z1gP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus criteria — adult refeeding syndrome (RS) risk identification specifies two tiers: Moderate Risk requires "2 Risk Criteria" while Significant Risk requires "1 Risk Criteria". Body mass index (BMI) thresholds are "16–18.5 kg/m^2" for Moderate Risk and " < 16 kg/m^2" for Significant Risk. Weight loss thresholds are "5% in 1 month" for Moderate Risk and "7.5% in 3 months or > 10% in 6 months" for Significant Risk. Caloric intake thresholds for Moderate Risk include "None or negligible oral intake for 5–6 days OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 7 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 75% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month", whereas Significant Risk includes "None or negligible oral intake for > 7 days OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 5 days during an acute illness or injury OR < 50% of estimated energy requirement for > 1 month". Abnormal prefeeding electrolytes (potassium, phosphorus, or magnesium) are "Minimally low levels or normal current levels and recent low levels necessitating minimal or single-dose supplementation" for Moderate Risk versus "Moderately/significantly low levels or minimally low or normal levels and recent low levels necessitating significant or multiple-dose supplementation" for Significant Risk. Loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle mass require "Evidence of moderate loss" or "Evidence of mild or moderate loss" for Moderate Risk compared with "Evidence of severe loss" for Significant Risk, and higher-risk comorbidities are "Moderate disease" versus "Severe disease". A footnote cautions that "electrolytes may be normal despite total-body deficiency, which is believed to increase risk of refeeding syndrome".

Study design

As described by Takazono et al. we identified 507 subjects administered L-AMB during hospitalization. Thereafter, two study populations were independently selected. First, patients who developed hypokalemia before L-AMB treatment initiation were identified as subjects with serum potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L between 7 and 2 days before L-AMB initiation. Among these, subjects supplemented with potassium were defined as patients treated with potassium L-aspartate, potassium gluconate, or potassium chloride between the day after hypokalemia onset and the day before the most recent date of potassium measurement until L-AMB initiation. Subjects supplemented with potassium were divided into those with adequate supplementation defined as a correction of the serum potassium levels to ≥ 3.5 mEq/L on the most recent date of potassium measurement until L-AMB initiation and those with inadequate supplementation defined as incomplete serum potassium correction (i.e. < 3.5 mEq/L). Second, patients who developed hypokalemia after L-AMB initiation were identified as subjects who met the following criteria: 1) serum potassium levels ≥ 3.5 mEq/L on the most recent date of potassium measurement until L-AMB initiation, and 2) serum potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L between the day after L-AMB initiation and 2 days before the onset of AKI or the day before L-AMB termination. Among these, subjects supplemented with potassium were defined as patients treated with potassium between the day after hypokalemia onset and the day before AKI onset or the day of L-AMB termination. Further, to evaluate AKI, we selected patients who had either serum creatinine levels measured or underwent dialysis between the day after potassium supplementation initiation (supplementation group) or 2 days after hypokalemia onset (non-supplementation group) and 7 days after L-AMB termination. To assess the association between the adequacy of potassium supplementation and AKI, we selected patients who had received potassium supplementation and had their serum potassium levels measured between the day after supplementation termination and the day before AKI onset or 6 days after L-AMB termination. Adequate potassium supplementation was defined as the correction of serum potassium levels to ≥ 3.5 mEq/L on the day of serum potassium measurement immediately after the day of potassium supplementation termination, while inadequate potassium supplementation was defined as incomplete serum potassium correction (< 3.5 mEq/L). Further, to evaluate AKI, we assessed patients who had either serum creatinine levels measured or underwent dialysis between the day after the day of adequacy judgement was made (i.e. adequate or inadequate supplementation with potassium) and 7 days after L-AMB termination.

Guideline 4: Nutritional supplementation — intraperitoneal amino acid (IPAA) supplementation in malnourished peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients decreased phosphate and bicarbonate levels, with unclear effects on potassium; one RCT showed decreases in serum potassium and phosphate at 3 months (P < 0.05), and a nonrandomized crossover trial found lower mean phosphate (P = 0.018) and bicarbonate (P = 0.002) over time with IPAA. Secondary analyses reported mean differences versus dextrose dialysate of −0.50 (95% CI, −0.87 to −0.13) mEq/L for potassium and −1.10 (95% CI, −1.43 to −0.77) mmol/L for bicarbonate, and pooled analysis showed a mean difference of −0.5 (95% CI, −0.70 to −0.41) mg/dL for phosphate.

Clinical outcomes according to potassium level

There was a U‐shaped relationship between baseline potassium level and the clinical outcomes of interest. Patients in the lowest baseline potassium category (≤ 3.5 mmol/L) had higher event rates in comparison with patients with potassium in the normal range (4.1–4.9 mmol/L), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables (Table 2). This was also true for those in the highest potassium category (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in relation to the mortality outcomes, although the magnitude of the elevation in risk was smaller than that seen in the lowest potassium category (Table 2).

Table 2
Events, event rates and hazard ratios for baseline and time‐updated potassium levels for the various outcomes

This overall pattern was generally more pronounced in the time‐updated models. For the primary outcome, the HR for a potassium level of 3.6–4.0 mmol/L was 1.25 (95% CI 1.06–1.47) and the HR for a potassium concentration of ≤ 3.5 mmol/L was 1.91 (95% CI 1.41–2.61), compared with the reference category (potassium 4.1–4.9 mmol/L). The HR for a potassium level of 5.0–5.4 mmol/L was 1.08 (95% CI 0.92–1.27) and for a potassium level of ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was 1.38 (95% CI 1.06–1.78).

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^115GDr43]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

Table 1
Characteristics of the 32 Trials Studied

RoB assessment results are presented in Table S2, with reference to both single‐item evaluation and overall RoB. Overall, we judged only 2 of the trials as having a high RoB. 43, 56

In the dose‐response meta‐analysis assessing effects of changes in potassium excretion between the control and supplemented groups on BP changes within each trial (Figure 2), we found that mean SBP and DBP levels decreased in the supplemented group with increasing differences in potassium excretion, up to a value of ≈30 mmol/d. At higher levels of supplementation, the decrease in BP was reduced, up to approximately a net difference in urinary potassium of 80 mmol/d. More substantial net differences in urinary potassium between the supplemented and unsupplemented participants resulted in an increase in both SBP and DBP. Increases of 30, 60, 90, and 120 mmol/d in net urinary potassium excretion differences between the supplemented and unsupplemented participants resulted in SBP changes of −3.3 (95% CI, −4.9 to −1.6), −2.0 (95% CI, −3.4 to −0.5), 1.1 (95% CI, −2.9 to 4.7), and 4.2 (95% CI, −2.3 to 10.6) mm Hg, respectively. For DBP, the corresponding changes were −2.3 (95% CI, −3.8 to −0.7), −1.3 (95% CI, −2.8 to 0.1), 0.86 (95% CI, −2.9 to 4.6), and 3.1 (95% CI, −3.5 to 9.7) mm Hg, respectively.

It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Potassium chloride extended-release (Potassium chloride) [^116UhpET]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

General

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for Patients

Physicians should consider reminding the patient of the following:

To take each dose with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid.

To take each dose without crushing, chewing, or sucking the tablets. If those patients are having difficulty swallowing whole tablets, they may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:

Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.
Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:
Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1 /2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).
Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.
Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.
Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw.
Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.
Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.

Aqueous suspension of potassium chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded. The use of other liquids for suspending potassium chloride tablets is not recommended.

To take this medicine following the frequency and amount prescribed by the physician. This is especially important if the patient is also taking diuretics and/or digitalis preparations.

To check with the physician at once if tarry stools or other evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding is noticed.

Laboratory Tests

When blood is drawn for analysis of plasma potassium it is important to recognize that artifactual elevations can occur after improper venipuncture technique or as a result of in vitro hemolysis of the sample.

Drug Interactions

Potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (see WARNINGS).

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^111Fi758]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — initiation of calories for avoidance and treatment of refeeding syndrome (RS) in at-risk adults — states to "Initiate with 100–150 g of dextrose or 10–20 kcal/kg for the first 24 hours; advance by 33% of goal every 1 to 2 days. This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose". In patients "with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered", and "Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected". It adds that "Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS", and if a patient has had "significant amounts of dextrose for several days" with stable electrolytes, "calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above".

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^1118kpFz]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Data to directly support the use of potassium-enriched salt outside the clinical hypertension setting are more limited though the totality of the available evidence suggests that the use of potassium-enriched salt would also reduce BP among the general population. The chief concern about the population-wide use of potassium-enriched salt relates to the possibility that individuals with undiagnosed advanced kidney disease might use potassium-enriched salt and develop hyperkalemia as a consequence. While trials that test this question directly have not been done, high-quality modeling studies suggest a large net benefit from population-wide use of potassium-enriched salt, even under worst-case assumptions about harm from hyperkalemia. The benefit-risk balance is defined primarily by the high global prevalence of hypertension (about 32% of adults), the low prevalence of chronic kidney disease (about 10%with only 2% at late-stage end-stage kidney disease), and the potential for patients with chronic kidney disease to benefit from BP lowering, not just be harmed by hyperkalemia. Other data also suggest that concerns about hyperkalemia from dietary potassium consumption may be overestimated. A 2023 study of 367 patients with stage 1 to 4 chronic kidney disease reported no association between dietary potassium consumption and blood potassium levels. This is a finding directly comparable to that observed in 212 patients with dialysis- and nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease reported a few years earlier.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^111cJLeC]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD potassium-related implementation considerations — Potassium is widely distributed in foods but the main sources are fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and efforts should be made to avoid restricting dietary potassium because reduced fiber can lead to constipation which could lower potassium excretion; if hyperkalemia cannot be reversed, the next step is to identify the most important dietary sources of potassium by interviewing the patient and dietary recalls, and clinicians preferably assisted by a renal dietitian should educate patients with hyperkalemia about fruits, vegetables, and other foods with low potassium content that ideally still contain higher levels of fiber and other micronutrients; in addition, potassium content in vegetables can be lowered by boiling and reductions in food taste and palatability associated with this strategy can be partially improved with the use of aromatic herbs; there are no obvious costs to adjusting dietary potassium intake; there is a scarcity of studies on this topic and we found no data on how modifying diet can influence serum potassium in patients with CKD, and factors other than dietary intake that influence serum potassium levels include medications, kidney function, hydration status, acid-base status, glycemic control, adrenal function, a catabolic state, or gastrointestinal problems like vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and bleeding, which should all be considered when formulating a strategy to keep the serum potassium within the normal range.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

High blood pressure in adults — dietary potassium and supplementation: Higher intake of potassium-rich foods and/or a lower urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio is associated with lower blood pressure (BP) and lower stroke and mortality rates; moderate potassium supplementation lowers BP by 6/4 mm Hg on average, with greater effects in hypertension and with higher baseline sodium excretion, especially ≥ 4000 mg/day. A U-shaped response is described, with maximal BP lowering at approximately 30 mmol/day and increases in BP above 80 mmol/day; BP increases with > 80 mmol/day are most evident in those taking antihypertensive therapy.

### New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice… [^114tYe6C]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Thus, the authors recommended increased potassium intake for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. 21 Based on the strength of the available data, the Joint National Committee for Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure included increased potassium intake as a core recommendation for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.
22. The arrhythmogenic potential of digoxin is enhanced by hypokalemia in patients with heart failure. When using digoxin in combination with a loop diuretic and an ACE inhibitor, the decision of whether to administer potassium supplements can be complex. Leier et al26 recommend maintaining serum potassium levels in the range between 4. 5 and
5. 0 mmol/L. They suggest that "effective potassium management with properly targeted serum potassium concentrations. probably represents the most effective and safe antiarrhythmic intervention" in heart failure.

Magnesium may also be administered to facilitate the reversal of refractory hypokalemia. The authors recommended using thiazide diuretics at a low dose only, and adding a potassium-sparing diuretic drug when higher diuretic doses are needed. 28 They estimated that the protective effect of antihypertensive treatment on mortality might be halved by the induction of sudden death following potassium loss. Increasing potassium intake should be considered when serum potassium levels are between 3. 5 and
4. 0 mmol. Although treatment of asymptomatic patients with borderline or "low normal" concentrations is controversial, very low levels are universally regarded as undesirable. Efforts to increase potassium intake are appropriate in certain populations who are vulnerable to cardiac arrhythmias. When the serum potassium level is below 3.

5 mmol, potassium supplementation may be warranted even in asymptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
32. Low serum potassium concentration is perhaps the most common electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice. Strategies aimed at achieving and maintaining normokalemia must take into account such factors as baseline potassium values, the presence of underlying medical conditions, the use of medications that alter potassium levels or that lead to arrhythmias in the presence of hypokalemia, patient variables such as diet and salt intake, and the ability to adhere to a therapeutic regimen.

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: I commend Dr. Kim and colleagues for addressing such a broad and important topic. 1 Deep tendon reflexes may be affected by extremes of potassium levels and are an important part of the physical examination. Calcium chloride must be administered through a central line, whereas 20 to 40 mEq per L of potassium per hour may be initially administered via two proximally placed, large-bore peripheral lines, if tolerated. However, the traditionally taught formula that 10 mEq per L of intravenous potassium replacement increases serum potassium by 0. 1 mEq per L is a great memory tool, it is not valid for extreme hypokalemia, as demonstrated by the Segal equation. Although not currently in the guidelines, more recent data support the following: All hospitalized patients should maintain a potassium level between 3. 5 and 5 mEq per L instead of 4 to 5 mEq per L based on large cohort studies showing no difference in all-cause in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit transfers, ventricular fibrillation, cardiovascular death, or cardiac arrest. 2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia. For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. 1 The literature does suggest differing recommendations for targeted goal serum potassium of
3. 5 vs.

4 to 5 mEq per L. We chose to highlight the recommendation for patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure because this is the area with the strongest available evidence; however, its limitations are reflected in the Strength of Recommendation evidence rating of B. The references used in your letter examined potassium levels in patients with myocardial infarction. One reference only included patients with acute heart failure exacerbation.
