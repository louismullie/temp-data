## Question

Can metal cause artifact on mri

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metal can cause artifacts on MRI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physical mechanism by which metal perturbs MRI. Then, I should verify which types of metals and implant factors amplify artifacts. Next, I will examine the characteristic artifact appearances and their clinical consequences. After that, I need to review how field strength, sequence selection, and parameters modulate artifact severity. Finally, I will consider practical mitigation strategies and synthesize a clear conclusion with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Metal distorts MRI because of magnetic susceptibility mismatch, which creates local field inhomogeneities that disrupt spatial encoding and signal formation, leading to susceptibility artifacts with signal loss, geometric distortion, and frequency misregistration. This is well established in physics and clinical reviews of metal artifact reduction strategies [^2ace888c] [^b14665a7] [^340f1cfe].

> I need to check which metals behave worst. Ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and stainless steel generate large susceptibility gradients and pronounced artifacts, whereas paramagnetic titanium and titanium alloys produce smaller artifacts, and diamagnetic materials like gold or platinum alloys can approach tissue susceptibility and cause minimal artifact. This hierarchy is consistently described in materials science and clinical MRI literature [^45a25ba7] [^3115a343] [^a2313d77].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about implant geometry and orientation. Larger implants, spherical shapes, and orientations aligned with the frequency-encoding direction tend to worsen artifacts, while aligning the long axis of an implant parallel to the main magnetic field and using high bandwidth can reduce them. These effects are documented in both phantom and clinical studies and are reflected in practice parameters [^3dcbedd5] [^9f99b202] [^00983876].

> Next, I should review what these artifacts look like clinically. Typical appearances include a dark signal void with a bright rim, geometric distortion of adjacent structures, failure of fat suppression near the implant, and through-plane slice warping. These patterns can obscure bone–implant interfaces, soft tissues, and neurovascular structures, limiting diagnostic confidence and sometimes mimicking disease [^2ace888c] [^4d83bf9f] [^c50b6abb].

> I will now examine how field strength and sequences modify severity. Higher field strengths (3 T and above) amplify susceptibility effects, while lower fields (1.5 T or below, especially 0.55 T) reduce artifact size. Fast spin-echo sequences with short echo spacing and high receiver bandwidth outperform gradient-echo sequences, and STIR fat suppression is preferred over frequency-selective fat suppression near metal. These principles are supported by comparative studies and consensus practice parameters [^b14665a7] [^9f99b202] [^00983876] [^b3ed3fe1].

> Wait, let me verify a common misconception about echo train length. I initially thought longer echo trains always reduce metal artifact, but a quantitative cadaveric study showed that longer echo train length actually increased total implant-related artifact area, whereas increasing receiver bandwidth consistently reduced artifact. So I should correct that and emphasize bandwidth as the dominant controllable parameter for artifact reduction [^60c4a88b].

> Next, I should review advanced mitigation techniques. Multi-spectral methods such as SEMAC and MAVRIC/MAVRIC-SL encode and correct through-plane and in-plane distortions, enabling clinically useful visualization around large implants, albeit with trade-offs in scan time and SNR. These are particularly valuable for postoperative joints and spine, and their feasibility and diagnostic yield are documented in clinical series and reviews [^8505db7f] [^5aaf49e5] [^4d83bf9f].

> Let me consider practical protocol choices. For routine imaging near metal, use 1.5 T when possible, select fast spin-echo with high bandwidth, thin slices, and a generous matrix, orient frequency encoding to move artifacts away from the region of interest, and prefer STIR for fat suppression. Reserve advanced MARS sequences for problem cases or when the diagnostic question hinges on near-metal anatomy. These strategies are consistently recommended in ACR practice parameters and contemporary reviews [^9f99b202] [^00983876] [^b14665a7].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is infection or tumor near hardware. I should confirm that MRI remains valuable despite artifacts, with noncontrast MRI performing well for peripheral bone infection and MARS-MRI helping detect adverse local tissue reactions around arthroplasties. Clinicians should anticipate artifacts, correlate with clinical findings, and, when needed, supplement with CT or ultrasound for problem-solving [^812859c9] [^d48523eb] [^8ce71453].

> In summary, yes — metal causes artifacts on MRI due to susceptibility-induced field distortions, with severity driven by the metal's magnetic properties, implant size and shape, orientation relative to B0, field strength, and sequence parameters. With careful planning and appropriate techniques, these artifacts can often be mitigated enough to preserve diagnostic utility, though they are rarely eliminated entirely [^2ace888c] [^b14665a7] [^340f1cfe].

Metal causes **MRI artifacts** due to magnetic susceptibility, producing signal loss, geometric distortion, and bright pile-up artifacts that can obscure anatomy and degrade diagnostic quality [^2ace888c]. The severity depends on the metal's composition, size, shape, and orientation, as well as MRI parameters such as field strength, sequence type, and bandwidth [^b14665a7] [^5e2b71be]. Titanium causes **less artifact** than ferromagnetic materials like stainless steel or cobalt-chrome, and artifacts are smaller at lower field strengths (1.5 T vs 3 T) [^c50b6abb] [^b3ed3fe1]. Using fast spin-echo sequences, high bandwidth, small voxels, STIR fat suppression, and advanced techniques (SEMAC, MAVRIC) can significantly reduce artifacts and improve diagnostic utility [^9f99b202] [^4d83bf9f].

## Mechanisms of metal artifacts in MRI

Metal artifacts arise from **magnetic susceptibility** differences between implanted metal and surrounding tissue, causing local magnetic field inhomogeneities that distort spatial encoding and signal [^2ace888c]. The main mechanisms include:

- **Signal loss**: Local field inhomogeneity causes rapid dephasing, creating dark signal voids around the metal [^c50b6abb].

- **Geometric distortion**: Field gradients displace and distort the apparent position of structures near the implant [^a2cc8b60].

- **Bright pile-up artifacts**: Signal accumulation appears as hyperintense bands or rings adjacent to the metal [^2ace888c].

---

## Factors influencing the severity of metal artifacts

Several factors determine the **severity and extent** of metal artifacts:

| **Factor** | **Effect on artifacts** |
|-|-|
| Metal composition | Ferromagnetic materials (e.g. stainless steel, cobalt-chrome) cause severe artifacts; titanium (paramagnetic) causes less artifact [^45a25ba7] [^c50b6abb] |
| Implant size and shape | Larger and spherical implants cause more pronounced artifacts [^b597d744] |
| Implant orientation | Orientation relative to B0 affects artifact size; alignment with B0 reduces artifacts [^3dcbedd5] |
| Magnetic field strength | Higher fields (3 T) increase artifacts; lower fields (1.5 T) reduce them [^b14665a7] [^b3ed3fe1] |
| MRI sequence type | Gradient-echo sequences worsen artifacts; fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences reduce them [^9f99b202] [^00983876] |
| Sequence parameters | High bandwidth, small voxels, short echo spacing, and STIR fat suppression reduce artifacts [^9f99b202] [^2cec28f7] |

---

## Clinical implications of metal artifacts

Metal artifacts can **significantly impair diagnostic quality** by obscuring soft tissues, bone interfaces, and complications such as infection, loosening, or tumor recurrence [^8ce71453]. This can delay diagnosis, alter management, and necessitate alternative imaging (e.g. CT) or repeat MRI with artifact-reduction techniques [^71af257e].

---

## Strategies to minimize metal artifacts

Effective strategies to **reduce metal artifacts** include:

- **Sequence selection**: Use FSE or turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences; avoid gradient-echo sequences [^9f99b202] [^00983876].

- **Parameter optimization**: Increase receiver bandwidth, use small voxels, thin slices, short echo spacing, and STIR for fat suppression [^9f99b202] [^2cec28f7].

- **Advanced techniques**: SEMAC, MAVRIC, and MAVRIC-SL significantly reduce artifacts around large implants [^8505db7f] [^5aaf49e5].

- **Lower field strength**: Prefer 1.5 T over 3 T when feasible to reduce susceptibility effects [^b14665a7] [^b3ed3fe1].

---

## Examples of metal artifacts in clinical practice

- **Orthopedic implants**: Hip and knee arthroplasties often cause large artifacts obscuring periprosthetic soft tissues and bone interfaces [^c50b6abb] [^d1413157].

- **Spinal hardware**: Pedicle screws and rods create artifacts that can obscure the spinal canal and neural foramina, limiting assessment of stenosis or nerve compression [^a503e257] [^b3ed3fe1].

- **Dental implants**: Metal crowns and fillings cause local signal loss and distortion, degrading brain and maxillofacial imaging [^5d4e4a15].

---

## Recent advances in metal artifact reduction

Recent advances include **multispectral imaging** (SEMAC, MAVRIC) that corrects through-plane and in-plane distortions, and **low-field MRI** (≤ 1.5 T) that inherently reduces susceptibility artifacts [^8505db7f] [^5aaf49e5] [^b3ed3fe1]. These approaches improve diagnostic confidence and expand MRI utility around implants [^b14665a7].

---

Metal causes **MRI artifacts** via susceptibility effects, but their impact can be mitigated by material choice, field strength, sequence selection, and advanced techniques, enabling clinically useful imaging around implants [^b14665a7].

### Metal-induced artifacts in MRI [^2ace888c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review some of the basic principles of imaging and how metal-induced susceptibility artifacts originate in MR images. We will describe common ways to reduce or modify artifacts using readily available imaging techniques, and we will discuss some advanced methods to correct readout-direction and slice-direction artifacts.

Conclusion

The presence of metallic implants in MRI can cause substantial image artifacts, including signal loss, failure of fat suppression, geometric distortion, and bright pile-up artifacts. These cause large resonant frequency changes and failure of many MRI mechanisms. Careful parameter and pulse sequence selections can avoid or reduce artifacts, although more advanced imaging methods offer further imaging improvements.

### Metal artifact reduction sequence MRI abnormalities occur in metal-on-polyethylene hips [^c147b30b]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the importance of MRI abnormalities in metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings, it is important to understand the baseline features of this diagnostic tool in conventional metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearings.

Questions/Purposes

What are the frequency, size, and types of MRI-documented adverse local tissue reactions in asymptomatic patients with MoP bearings?

Methods

We recruited 50 patients 5 years after a MoP total hip arthroplasty from a pool of patients in our joint registry who had a Harris hip score of > 90. To be included, patients had to be without pain and have adequate radiographs. Our data set included 50 asymptomatic patients with MoP bearings who underwent a metal artifact reduction sequence MRI.

Results

MRI abnormalities were seen in 14 of 50 (28%) asymptomatic patients who were studied. Thirteen of the 14 abnormalities were cystic thin-walled lesions with a mean of 18 cm3 (range, 1–79 cm3).

Conclusions

MRI abnormalities were noted in nearly one-third of asymptomatic patients with MoP bearings. Decisions concerning revision of MoM bearings should not be based on isolated MRI findings because MRI abnormalities are commonly seen regardless of bearing type. A number of factors should determine the need for intervention including pain, mechanical symptoms, abductor weakness, component type, component position, and ion levels as well as MRI findings.

### Magnetic resonance imaging around metal at 1.5 tesla: techniques from basic to advanced and clinical impact [^b14665a7]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

During the last decade, metal artifact reduction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been an area of intensive research and substantial improvement. The demand for an excellent diagnostic MRI scan quality of tissues around metal implants is closely linked to the steadily increasing number of joint arthroplasty (especially knee and hip arthroplasties) and spinal stabilization procedures. Its unmatched soft tissue contrast and cross-sectional nature make MRI a valuable tool in early detection of frequently encountered postoperative complications, such as periprosthetic infection, material wear-induced synovitis, osteolysis, or damage of the soft tissues. However, metal-induced artifacts remain a constant challenge. Successful artifact reduction plays an important role in the diagnostic workup of patients with painful/dysfunctional arthroplasties and helps to improve patient outcome. The artifact severity depends both on the implant and the acquisition technique. The implant's material, in particular its magnetic susceptibility and electrical conductivity, its size, geometry, and orientation in the MRI magnet are critical. On the acquisition side, the magnetic field strength, the employed imaging pulse sequence, and several acquisition parameters can be optimized. As a rule of thumb, the choice of a 1.5-T over a 3.0-T magnet, a fast spin-echo sequence over a spin-echo or gradient-echo sequence, a high receive bandwidth, a small voxel size, and short tau inversion recovery-based fat suppression can mitigate the impact of metal artifacts on diagnostic image quality. However, successful imaging of large orthopedic implants (eg, arthroplasties) often requires further optimized artifact reduction methods, such as slice encoding for metal artifact correction or multiacquisition variable-resonance image combination. With these tools, MRI at 1.5 T is now widely considered the modality of choice for the clinical evaluation of patients with metal implants.

An increasing number of joint replacements are being performed in the United States. Patients undergoing these procedures can have various complications. Imaging is one of the primary means of diagnosing these complications. Cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and MR imaging, are more sensitive than radiographs for evaluating complications. The use of CT and MR imaging in patients with metallic implants is limited by the presence of artifacts. This review discusses the causes of metal artifacts on MR imaging and CT, contributing factors, and conventional and novel methods to reduce the effects of these artifacts on scans.

Postoperative MR imaging of joints is now commonly requested, yet artifacts caused by metallic orthopedic implants remain a significant challenge during image interpretation. Effective artifact reduction is essential to identify postsurgical complications, such as prosthesis loosening, infection, adverse local tissue reaction, and periarticular soft tissue injuries. This article reviews basic and advanced metal artifact reduction MR imaging techniques applied to various clinical protocols for successful postoperative MR imaging of small and large joints.

### Improving MR image quality in patients with metallic implants [^340f1cfe]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

The number of implanted devices such as orthopedic hardware and cardiac implantable devices continues to increase with an increase in the age of the patient population, as well as an increase in the number of indications for specific devices. Many patients with these devices have or will develop clinical conditions that are best depicted at MRI. However, implanted devices containing paramagnetic or ferromagnetic substances can cause significant artifact, which could limit the diagnostic capability of this modality. Performing imaging with MRI when an implant is present may be challenging, and there are numerous techniques the radiologist and technologist can use to help minimize artifacts related to implants. First, knowledge of the presence of an implant before patient arrival is critical to ensure safety of the patient when the device is subjected to a strong magnetic field. Once safety is ensured, the examination should be performed with the MRI system that is expected to provide the best image quality. The selection of the MRI system includes multiple considerations such as the effects of field strength and availability of specific sequences, which can reduce metal artifact. Appropriate patient positioning, attention to MRI parameters (including bandwidth, voxel size, and echo), and appropriate selection of sequences (those with less metal artifact and advanced metal reduction sequences) are critical to improve image quality. Patients with implants can be successfully imaged with MRI with appropriate planning and understanding of how to minimize artifacts. This improves image quality and the diagnostic confidence of the radiologist. © RSNA, 2021.

### Metallic artefacts in MR imaging: effects of main field orientation and strength [^3dcbedd5]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the effect of metallic implant positioning on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging artefacts, and to determine the optimal imaging parameters for minimization of metallic artefacts.

Materials and Methods

In a phantom and in three joints with non-ferromagnetic metallic implants imaged at 1.5 and/or at 0.2 T, we examined the influence of the static magnetic field (B(0)) strength and orientation, frequency-encoding direction, and type of imaging sequence on metallic artefacts.

Results

The impact of artefacts caused by metallic objects depends mainly on the relationship between the anatomy of interest and the orientation of the object relative to the direction of B(0). The main field strength plays a less important role, but its orientation depends on the type of MR imager.

Conclusion

MR artefacts can be easily minimized by optimally positioning patients with metallic implants in the magnet. Knowledge of how this influences MR imaging is helpful in patient selection and guiding limb positioning.

### Metal suppression magnetic resonance imaging techniques in orthopaedic and spine surgery [^f9710766]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Implantation of metallic instrumentation is the mainstay of a variety of orthopaedic and spine surgeries. Postoperatively, imaging of the soft tissues around these implants is commonly required to assess for persistent, recurrent, and/or new pathology (ie, instrumentation loosening, particle disease, infection, neural compression); visualization of these pathologies often requires the superior soft-tissue contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As susceptibility artifacts from ferromagnetic implants can result in unacceptable image quality, unique MRI approaches are often necessary to provide accurate imaging. In this text, a comprehensive review is provided on common artifacts encountered in orthopaedic MRI, including comparisons of artifacts from different metallic alloys and common nonpropriety/propriety MR metallic artifact reduction methods. The newest metal-artifact suppression imaging technology and future directions (ie, deep learning/artificial intelligence) in this important field will be considered.

### Imaging the knee in the setting of metal hardware [^9c235b4c]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an established modality for the evaluation of musculoskeletal structures, including the knee. Metallic implants are increasingly used and techniques to minimize artifacts are continuously improving. This article reviews the general principles behind the effects of metal on MR imaging, various MR imaging techniques that are available or have been recently described in the literature, and abnormalities that can be encountered during MR imaging of patients related to knee arthroplasty, hardware after internal fixation, or hardware used for soft tissue fixation.

### Metal-related artifacts in instrumented spine. techniques for reducing artifacts in CT and MRI: state of the art [^b9337a86]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The projectional nature of radiogram limits its amount of information about the instrumented spine. MRI and CT imaging can be more helpful, using cross-sectional view. However, the presence of metal-related artifacts at both conventional CT and MRI imaging can obscure relevant anatomy and disease. We reviewed the literature about overcoming artifacts from metallic orthopaedic implants at high-field strength MRI imaging and multi-detector CT. The evolution of multichannel CT has made available new techniques that can help minimizing the severe beam-hardening artifacts. The presence of artifacts at CT from metal hardware is related to image reconstruction algorithm (filter), tube current (in mA), X-ray kilovolt peak, pitch, hardware composition, geometry (shape), and location. MRI imaging has been used safely in patients with orthopaedic metallic implants because most of these implants do not have ferromagnetic properties and have been fixed into position. However, on MRI imaging metallic implants may produce geometric distortion, the so-called susceptibility artifact. In conclusion, although 140 kV and high milliamperage second exposures are recommended for imaging patients with hardware, caution should always be exercised, particularly in children, young adults, and patients undergoing multiple examinations. MRI artifacts can be minimized by positioning optimally and correctly the examined anatomy part with metallic implants in the magnet and by choosing fast spin-echo sequences, and in some cases also STIR sequences, with an anterior to posterior frequency-encoding direction and the smallest voxel size.

### A low-cost and shielding-free ultra-low-field brain MRI scanner [^0b7177ab]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Metal implants or fragments cause undesired image artifacts and often constitute a major safety concern during MRI examination. This presents a challenge to clinical MRI, because many patients with implanted devices are often those that require frequent imaging evaluation and monitoring. Moreover, the prevalence of cerebrovascular, cardiac and/or orthopedic metal implants will continue to rise in an increasingly aging society, posing another barrier to future MRI accessibility. In using ULF (< 0.1 T) and low-field (< 0.5T), metal implants not only exhibit fewer artifacts, but also experience significantly less mechanical forces and RF-induced heating. We and others showed that the presence of paramagnetic (i.e. titanium and titanium alloys) and ferromagnetic (i.e. cobalt, nickel and associated alloys) materials in aneurysm clips and cerebrovascular stents did not induce gross artifacts in the 0.05 Tand 0.055 T images (Fig. 8). We expect that ULF will enable MRI scanning of patients with medical metal implants or accident related metal fragments, who would otherwise not be candidates for conventional high-field MRI.

### Magnetism of materials: theory and practice in magnetic resonance imaging [^45a25ba7]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Metallic artifact reduction sequences (MARS)

With the definition of metallic artifact reduction sequences (MARS) are generally indicated all the MRI techniques which aim to reduce the size and the intensity of artifacts due to magnetic field distortion. Iron, nickel, stainless steel and cobalt — all metals commonly used for prostheses — are ferromagnetic and generate severe artifacts on MRI, which are characterized by shape distortion of the metallic object and loss of MRI signal (black artifacts). In addition, rims of high signal intensity (white artifacts) appear around the metallic object. By adopting some expedients based on MRI physics, it is possible to create performing MARS. The increase in the value of turbo factor linearly reduces artifacts, but at the cost of a decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the reduction in TE makes it possible to obtain both a reduction of artifacts and an increase in SNR with the only drawback of a slight reduction of the weighting in T2, which does not generally alter image quality. Eventually, reducing slice thickness and increasing matrix size allows a further decrease in artifacts at the cost of a linear reduction of SNR, which can be corrected with more acquisitions of the MR signal. A balanced use of these changes allows to significantly reduce artifacts, without an increase in the acquisition time

In this context, the usage of spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) or spectral attenuated inversion recovery (SPAIR) sequences, in order to obtain a selective T2-w. or PD-w. fat-suppression, is not recommended, because the susceptibility due to prostheses impairs this type of fat-suppression. On the other hand, fast-STIR images can provide fat-suppressed images with a good image quality in patients with metal prostheses (Fig. 11).

### What is the clinical presentation of adverse local tissue reaction in metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty? An MRI study [^ceab4828]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adverse local tissue reaction (ALTR) is not only a prominent cause of metal-on-metal (MoM) implant revision, but may also compromise the result of revision surgery. Patients treated with MoM arthroplasty and subsequently revised as a result of ALTR have been shown to experience worse patient-reported outcomes, inferior survivorship, and more complications when compared with patients receiving MoM implants who were revised for reasons other than ALTR. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the presence of symptoms is associated with ALTR in patients with MoM implants. Blood metal ions are associated with ALTR, but a consensus on appropriate thresholds associated with ALTR risk is lacking.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Was the presence of symptoms as measured by patient-reported outcome measures associated with ALTR presence and severity as noted on metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS)-MRI in patients treated with one design of MoM THA or hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA)? (2) Could reliable thresholds for blood metal ion levels be determined that were associated with ALTR presence on MARS-MRI?

Methods

This retrospective study presents a secondary analysis of data drawn from a prospective, international, multicenter study of the recalled Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip system. This larger study aims to identify risk factors for revision and provide followup guidelines for the many unrevised ASR patients. A total of 1721 patients were enrolled from 16 centers in six countries after the device was recalled and are followed annually for 5 years. In the present analysis, data from the enrollment visit (mean time from index surgery, 7.5 years; SD 3.5 years) were considered. Only patients from two centers conducting MARS-MRI on all patients regardless of clinical presentation as a standard of care were included to avoid selection bias. A total of 327 unilateral patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria (90% of those eligible). The level of symptoms was systematically determined using the Harris hip score and a visual analog scale for pain, and whole blood metal ion levels were collected from all patients. MARS-MRIs were analyzed by a single reader for ALTR presence (Anderson classification), diameter, and synovial thickness. A validation series of 35 MARS-MRIs indicated excellent intrareader reproducibility of the evaluations (intraclass correlation = 0.82) and substantial agreement (κ coefficient = 0.64) was achieved between the MARS-MRI reader and a musculoskeletal radiologist with > 10 years of experience with MARS-MRI. Binary logistic regression was used to determine variables independently associated with ALTR. Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine sensitive and specific cut points for cobalt and chromium.

Results

After controlling for confounding variables, presence of symptoms was determined to be a risk factor for ALTR (odds ratio, 2.9; p = 0.007) in patients treated with ASR MoM THA. Moreover, among patients undergoing ASR MoM THA with ALTR, synovial thickness correlated with symptomaticity (p = 0.030). For patients undergoing ASR MoM HRA, we found no association between symptoms and ALTR prevalence or severity. A cobalt cutoff of 3.2 parts per billion (ppb) was associated with increased risk of ALTR (p < 0.001; sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 71%) in ASR MoM THA. In patients with ASR MoM HRA, a cobalt threshold of 2.9 ppb was indicative of ALTR (p < 0.001; sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 69%).

Conclusions

The risk factors identified in the current study may be used to stratify patients receiving MoM implants in terms of ALTR risk. We found that symptoms are associated with an increased likelihood of ALTR presence in ASR MoM THA and that cobalt ion level is associated with ALTR in ASR MoM THA as well as ASR MoM HRA. Importantly, MoM HRA followup protocols that exempt asymptomatic patients from annual followup are not justified because asymptomatic patients are no less likely to have ALTR than symptomatic patients. Blood metal ion levels may reliably be used to screen patients undergoing MoM HRA. For patients undergoing MoM THA, a combination of symptom state and blood metal ion levels may be used to determine ALTR risk.

### Metal artifact reduction in musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging [^f502f80f]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Many strategies can be employed to reduce the size and scale of metal susceptibility artifacts in the vicinity of orthopedic hardware; factors include selection of metal hardware material, patient positioning, and MRI sequence adjustments and techniques. The adjustments to sequence parameters include high spatial resolution fast spin echo sequences with minimal interecho spacing and increased receiver bandwidth. Frequency and phase encoding gradients can be orientated so misregistration artifacts arising from the metal are directed away from areas of anticipated clinical diagnostic interest. Complications arising in the vicinity of metallic hardware, including loosening, can be assessed after implication of these metal artifact reduction techniques.

### Open-source simulator of imaging near metal at arbitrary magnetic field strengths [^2c755193]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The increasing prevalence of orthopedic metallic implants necessitates optimization of MRI methods to monitor surrounding tissues and identify complications. The emergence of contemporary mid- and low-field systems as promising platforms for imaging around metal requires development of new protocols optimized for these field strengths. Motivated by these, we develop a simulation framework that predicts MRI performance near metallic implants, considering B0 field strength and multi-spectral imaging (MSI) parameters.

Methods

A simulation framework for imaging near metal incorporating 3D implant and 3D human anatomical models, and imaging and sequence parameters is developed. MSI acquisitions are simulated based on susceptibility-induced field shifts. Validation is performed using phantom and in vivo experiments at 0.55 and 3T, comparing simulated and experimental images for artifact shape and SNR. Performance is demonstrated by evaluating impacts of field strength, spectral bins, RF and readout bandwidths, and implant materials.

Results

Simulations accurately reproduced experimental imaging performance, with extent and patterns of metal artifacts closely matching experimental observations at both 0.55 and 3T, while correctly predicting increased SNR and artifact size with increasing field strength. The framework demonstrated the impact of field strength, spectral bins, RF and readout bandwidths, and implant material on metal artifacts and image quality.

Conclusion

This open-source simulation framework effectively predicts MRI performance near metallic implants. This can facilitate protocol optimization and exploration of imaging parameters without extensive/costly in vivo experiments. This tool can enable researchers to predict imaging performance for various implants across different field strengths, potentially accelerating development of optimized protocols for clinical use.

### SEMAC: slice encoding for metal artifact correction in MRI [^8505db7f]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) near metallic implants remains an unmet need because of severe artifacts, which mainly stem from large metal-induced field inhomogeneities. This work addresses MRI near metallic implants with an innovative imaging technique called "Slice Encoding for Metal Artifact Correction" (SEMAC). The SEMAC technique corrects metal artifacts via robust encoding of each excited slice against metal-induced field inhomogeneities. The robust slice encoding is achieved by extending a view-angle-tilting (VAT) spin-echo sequence with additional z-phase encoding. Although the VAT compensation gradient suppresses most in-plane distortions, the z-phase encoding fully resolves distorted excitation profiles that cause through-plane distortions. By positioning all spins in a region-of-interest to their actual spatial locations, the through-plane distortions can be corrected by summing up the resolved spins in each voxel. The SEMAC technique does not require additional hardware and can be deployed to the large installed base of whole-body MRI systems. The efficacy of the SEMAC technique in eliminating metal-induced distortions with feasible scan times is validated in phantom and in vivo spine and knee studies.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^7c94b98d]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images is often used to plan radiotherapy (RT), adding the superior MRI soft-tissue contrast used to outline target volumes (TV) and organs at risk (OAR) to the CT-based electronic density. Orthopaedic implants, relatively common in an ageing population, are often used in oncology patients to provide mechanical stability to the site of bone lesions or metastasis. Many commonly used metallic orthopaedic implants are MRI-safe but cause local artifacts in MR images due to susceptibility-related magnetic field inhomogeneity and to currents induced in the implant by radiofrequency fields and the imaging gradient fields. Standard CT images of metallic implants are also degraded by streaks due to beam hardening and photon starvation artifacts, although advanced reconstruction techniques can minimise this problem. The presence of metallic implants can be a serious challenge for obtaining high-quality anatomical images, a requirement for high precision conformal techniques such as Intensity Modulated RT (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). In addition, metallic implants also pose a challenge for RT, as the metal is very attenuating, limiting the range of beam angles available for RT delivery.

The susceptibility-related magnetic field inhomogeneity associated with orthopaedic implants is known to disrupt the spatial encoding of MR signals, leading to displacement of the spatial origin of signals along the readout gradient direction and to distortion of the selected slice (or slab). The in-plane distortion is characterised by bright areas (described as signal "pile up") and dark areas of signal loss. Several strategies can be used to reduce distortion in conventional MRI techniques: spin-echoes are preferred over gradient-echoes, with short echo-times (TE) and high receiver and excitation bandwidth. However, the field inhomogeneity associated with common orthopaedic implants has been shown to be orders of magnitude higher than the naturally occurring field inhomogeneity associated with distributions of magnetic susceptibility values in biological material, and as a result conventional MRI techniques cannot eliminate artifacts completely.

### Metallic artifact in MRI after removal of orthopedic implants [^da2322ec]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the metallic artifacts in MRI of the orthopedic patients after removal of metallic implants.

Subjects and Methods

From March to August 2009, 40 orthopedic patients operated for removal of orthopedic metallic implants were studied by post-operative MRI from the site of removal of implants. A grading scale of 0–3 was assigned for artifact in MR images whereby 0 was considered no artifact; and I-III were considered mild, moderate, and severe metallic artifacts, respectively. These grading records were correlated with other variables including the type, size, number, and composition of metallic devices; and the site and duration of orthopedic devices stay in the body.

Results

Metallic susceptibly artifacts were detected in MRI of 18 of 40 cases (45%). Screws and pins in removed hardware were the most important factors for causing artifacts in MRI. The artifacts were found more frequently in the patients who had more screws and pins in the removed implants. Gender, age, site of implantation of the device, length of the hardware, composition of the metallic implants (stainless steel versus titanium), and duration of implantation of the hardware exerted no effect in producing metallic artifacts after removal of implants. Short TE sequences of MRI (such as T1 weighted) showed fewer artifacts.

Conclusion

Susceptibility of metallic artifacts is a frequent phenomenon in MRI of patients upon removal of metallic orthopedic implants.

### MRI of total hip arthroplasty: technical aspects and imaging findings [^c50b6abb]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Artifacts and metal-suppression sequences

The problematic artifacts caused by metal components of THA are in-plane distortions, which result from local field inhomogeneities determined by THA implants. T2✱ dephasing mediates the cloud of signal loss near metal components. Further, the disruption of local field homogeneity due to implant ferromagnetic characteristics results in a lack of or incomplete fat suppression. Metals in a voxel push the pixels to extend across a wider area, thereby distorting the image. Nevertheless, MRI is now a feasible and accurate modality for imaging THA due to the introduction of new hardware and pulse sequences. Specifically, it is possible to optimize conventional pulse sequences to obtain metal artifact reduction sequences (MARS). Olsen et al introduced the MARS sequence, the first comprehensive method for a metal-suppression sequence. The original sequence design included higher bandwidth, thin section selection (between 3 and 4 mm), longer echo trains, closer echo spacing, and a larger image matrix (Fig. 1). Furthermore, increased gradient strength inversely affects susceptibility artifacts, leading to its reduction. Indeed, employing a broader receiver bandwidth and reducing voxel size, thereby minimizing intra-voxel variation and dephasing, enhances the strength of frequency-encoding and slice-select gradients, consequently reducing distortion and enhancing spatial resolution. Then, modifying the orientation of the frequency-encoding gradient to align with the THA axis will further mitigate susceptibility artifacts. Moreover, for THA imaging, it is advisable to utilize the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence for fat suppression. This is because inversion recovery fat suppression is less affected by magnetic field nonuniformity compared to frequency-selective fat suppression techniques. STIR allows obtaining a superior fat suppression than Dixon, but the latter may be used for obtaining fat suppression facilitating useful post-contrast images. Another way to obtain contrast-enhanced MRI in THA patients is by subtracting post-contrast T1-weighted to pre-contrast T1-weighted images. In addition, opting for imaging at 1.5 T instead of 3 T is advised due to the correlation between susceptibility artifacts and the intensity of the magnetic field utilized. However, even the MARS technique may result in substantial artifacts that can strongly affect image quality (Fig. 2). As a matter of fact, THA material, dimensions, morphology, and position (less artifacts when the long axis of THA is parallel to the magnetic field) impact artifact generation on MRI images. Regarding the material composition of prostheses, it is crucial to note that cobalt exhibits ferromagnetic properties, while chrome and molybdenum do not. Additionally, titanium and ceramic implants are non-ferromagnetic. Indeed, cobalt-chrome prostheses have been shown to generate the most significant artifacts on MRI.

### Fast fourier-based simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI applied to metal object localization [^6bd5035b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Simulation of MRI has proven successful in characterizing off‐resonance artifacts caused by disturbances of the main magnetic field B 0 1, 2, 3. These artifacts include geometric distortion, signal loss, signal pile‐up, and phase dispersion 4. In clinical practice, off‐resonance artifacts are increasingly caused by the presence of metal objects, such as implants, surgical screws, or interventional devices 5. The ability to predict artifacts around metal is an important investigative tool for the development of methods aiming at either imaging around metal objects 6, 7, 8 or localization of metal objects 9, 10, 11.

The most general method for simulating off‐resonance artifacts is Bloch simulation, which uses the discrete time solutions of the Bloch equations to simulate the entire pulse sequence for a lattice of isochromats 12, 13. However, the generality of Bloch simulation comes at the cost of a high computational burden, which increases linearly with the product of the number of simulated isochromats and the number of simulated k‐space coefficients. In simulating a 3D scan, both the number of isochromats and the number of k‐space coefficients increase cubically with increasing scan resolution and/or field of view. Both parallel computation 14 and GPU acceleration 15 have been used to accelerate Bloch simulation. However, these types of acceleration only reduce the simulation time by a constant factor, which means that simulating large 3D scans remains impractical.

In this study we propose a fast alternative to Bloch simulation for simulating off‐resonance artifacts in steady‐state pulse sequences. By assuming the signal is in a steady state, it is possible to simulate the MRI signal with a computational complexity that is lower than that of Bloch simulation, while maintaining some of its generality and without requiring analytical descriptions of the phenomena involved. We validated the speed and accuracy of the fast simulation method by comparing it with Bloch simulations and gradient echo scans of a titanium cylinder in vitro. Furthermore, to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the fast simulation method, we employed it for a metal object localization method, inspired by the work of Wachowicz et al. 10, and tested this method on scans of a titanium cylinder, an oxidized zirconium knee implant, and gold fiducials.

Image interpretation, quantification, and reporting

Artifacts in PET/MRI and their correction

The complexity of integrated PET/MRI hybrid imaging bears high potential for the occurrence of either PET, MRI, or PET/MRI-related artifacts. Beyond the mere visual affection of hybrid images, artifacts in PET/MRI may also have a significant effect on quantification of PET data. Since attenuation correction in PET/MRI is mostly based on MRI sequences, all artifacts in the MR-AC images will ultimately translate into inaccurate values in PET quantification following MR-AC.

Typical artifacts in PET/MRI hybrid imaging are the following: motion artifacts and local misalignments between PET and MRI data due to patient and organ motion; faulty tissue segmentation with assignment of wrong LAC in MR-based AC; signal truncations along the patient's arms where the patient anatomy often exceeds the spatial constraints of the MRI field-of-view; and dental and metal implants that are found in a large and increasing group of patients. Apart from the safety aspects of metal implants that have to be clarified before any MRI and PET/MRI examination (see section on MRI safety above), all metal implants might cause signal voids or local distortions in diagnostic MRI images and in MRI-based AC that exceed the physical implant volume.

Recent studies now report about new developments to correct for artifacts. To reduce the quantitative impact of metal artifacts in MRI based AC on PET quantification, a method has been suggested to complete signal voids in the MR-AC caused by implants by deriving the shape and AC values of metal implants from PET emission data. Truncation artifacts can be corrected by estimating the patient body contours from PET data using the MLAA algorithm. A second method for correction of truncation artifacts is fully MR-imaging based and applies B0-HUGE to effectively increase the lateral field-of-view in MR-based AC. In the context of metal artifact reduction in PET/MRI, it has been shown that TOF PET detection with fast PET detectors allows for a significant visual reduction of artifacts in the µ-map, albeit PET quantification may still be biased.

### Preparation of an Au-Pt alloy free from artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging [^a2313d77]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

When magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed on patients carrying metallic implants, artifacts can disturb the images around the implants, often making it difficult to interpret them appropriately. However, metallic materials are and will be indispensable as raw materials for medical devices because of their electric conductivity, visibility under X-ray fluoroscopy, and other favorable features. What is now desired is to develop a metallic material which causes no artifacts during MRI.

Materials and Methods

In the present study, we prepared a single-phase and homogeneous Au-Pt alloys (Au; diamagnetic metal, and Pt; paramagnetic metal) by the processing of thermal treatment. Volume magnetic susceptibility was measured with a SQUID Flux Meter and MRI artifact was evaluated using a 1.5-T scanner.

Results

After final thermal treatment, an entirely recrystallized homogeneous organization was noted. The Au-35Pt alloy was shown to have a volume magnetic susceptibility of -8.8ppm, causing almost free from artifacts during MRI.

Conclusions

We thus prepared an Au-35Pt alloy which had a magnetic susceptibility very close to that of living tissue and caused much fewer artifacts during MRI. It is promising as a material for spinal cages, intracranial electrodes, cerebral aneurysm embolization coils, markers for MRI and so on.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^62009696]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

In the last few years, specialist techniques have been developed to minimise metal artifacts in 2D and 3D MRI, employing high receiver and excitation bandwidth and encoding the field inhomogeneity. The resulting images do minimise susceptibility-related signal loss, but often at a cost of increasing the total acquisition time, noise levels and sometimes introducing blurring. Slice Encoding for Metal Artifact Correction (SEMAC) is a multi-slice technique which resolves the susceptibility-related distortions both in-plane (readout direction) and through-plane (slice selection direction). In this work, we applied the SEMAC approach to the protocols we use for planning spine IMRT/VMAT and prostate RT. We tested these protocols in a test object designed for this purpose, and compared them to standard protocols on test objects and clinical examinations of patients with orthopaedic implants. Our objective was to determine whether the SEMAC approach can extend the use of MR to RT planning in the vicinity of metallic implants.

### MRI of total hip arthroplasty: technical aspects and imaging findings [^c9386137]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the best surgical approach for treating advanced hip degeneration, providing pain relief, and improved function in most cases. In the past, MR imaging quality has been highly compromised by in-plane distortions, inadequate fat saturation, and other artifacts due to metal components of THA. Technological advancements have made pathologic conditions, which were previously hidden by periprosthetic artifacts, outstanding features due to the optimization of several sequences. To date, several short and long-term complications involving bony and soft-tissue structures may be detected through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of MRI with adapted sequences and protocols may drastically reduce artifacts thereby providing essential pre-operative elements for planning revision surgery of failed THA. This review has the purpose of conveying new insights to musculoskeletal radiologists about the techniques to suppress metal-related artifacts and the hallmark MRI findings of painful THA.

Critical relevance statement

Advancements in metal-suppression have given radiologists the opportunity to play an emerging role in THA management. This article provides technical and imaging insights into challenges that can be encountered in cases of THA, which may present complications and characteristic imaging findings.

Key Points

Imaging total hip arthroplasty requires adapted MRI protocol and awareness of the common complications.
We have reported the available metal-suppression sequences for evaluating total hip arthroplasty.
Many structures and conditions should be considered when dealing with painful aseptic or septic arthroplasty.

Cross-sectional imaging — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography for suspected orthopaedic surgical site infection: There is a lack of data overall; two moderate quality MRI studies in suspected knee prosthesis infection showed moderate-strong "rule in" agreement but poor-moderate "rule out" agreement. Metallic implants can cause significant artifacts that limit detection of adjacent bone and soft tissue infection on MRI as well as on CT, and cross-sectional imaging can potentially be useful to identify soft-tissue fluid collections or to guide aspiration/biopsy, with the value of a given exam considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Experimental and computational analyses of the effects of slice distortion from a metallic sphere in an MRI phantom [^16f90cde]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Susceptibility artifacts due to metallic prostheses are a major problem in clinical magnetic resonance imaging. We theoretically and experimentally analyze slice distortion arising from susceptibility differences in a phantom consisting of a stainless steel ball bearing embedded in agarose gel. To relate the observed image artifacts to slice distortion, we simulate images produced by 2D and 3D spin-echo (SE) and a view angle tilting (VAT) sequence. Two-dimensional SE sequences suffer from extreme slice distortion when a metal prosthesis is present, unlike 3D SE sequences for which — since slices are phase-encoded — distortion of the slice profile is minimized, provided the selected slab is larger than the region of interest. In a VAT sequence, artifacts are reduced by the application of a gradient along the slice direction during readout. However, VAT does not correct for the excitation slice profile, which results in the excitation of spins outside the desired slice location and can lead to incorrect anatomical information in MR images. We propose that the best sequences for imaging in the presence of a metal prosthesis utilize 3D acquisition, with phase encoding replacing slice selection to minimize slice distortion, combined with excitation and readout gradient strengths at their maximum values.

Paramagnetic metals

It is important to know that several metals which are widely used in surgery, like titanium and aluminum, are paramagnetic. If more than one different metallic device is present in a scan, the magnitude of the susceptibility-related artifact can help characterize the metal as paramagnetic, superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic, thus diagnosing the different nature (Fig. 8).

The devices cause magnetic susceptibility-related artifacts on in-phase (b) and opposed-phase (b′) gradient echo (GE) T1-w. images in the stomach (arrow) and hepatic hilum (arrowhead), respectively; the signal intensity loss is higher on in-phase image (b). It is worthy of note that the magnetic device in the stomach (a ferromagnetic steel clip) causes a much more prominent artifact than the device in hepatic hilum (a paramagnetic titanium clip by previous cholecystectomy)

Motion correction in PET/MRI — time-resolved MRI data can be used as a prior to correct motion in PET data, and best results are obtained when the AC map is also generated using motion correction; it is recommended to always use the latest available software version and AC protocols, users are advised to strictly follow manufacturers' recommendations, and to carefully inspect non-AC PET data and MR-based AC maps along with AC PET data because unadjusted artifacts (e.g., around metallic implants) may cause faulty segmentation and local bias or visible artifacts; where available, TOF-PET detection should be used to mitigate the quantitative impact of artifacts caused by metallic implants.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in painful metal-on-metal hips: a prospective study [^19cdbde7]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging findings are reported in a prospective series of 31 patients with unexplained painful metal-on-metal (MOM) hips. The abnormalities identified were fluid collection (20 patients), solid mass (2 patients), moderate to severe muscle atrophy (23 patients), and muscle edema (8 patients). In conclusion, soft tissue lesions and muscle atrophy appear to be prevalent in unexplained painful MOM hips. Metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to diagnose and monitor at-risk hips but requires validation in well-functioning MOM hips before it can guide clinical decision making.

### Fast fourier-based simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI applied to metal object localization [^ac867812]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we have presented a theory for fast Fourier–based simulation of off‐resonance artifacts in steady‐state gradient echo MRI. Based on this theory, we implemented the FORECAST simulation method and applied it to the simulation of artifacts induced by metal objects in 3D gradient echo scans. The simulated artifacts were found to be accurate with respect to actual scans of metal objects of varying size and shape. To demonstrate the practical applicability of FORECAST, we applied it in a method for localization of known metal objects in MRI.

Fast Simulation

Our fast simulation methodology allowed the computation of high‐resolution 3D simulations of off‐resonance artifacts within several minutes on regular computer hardware. FORECAST has a computational complexity that is lower than the complexity of Bloch simulation by a factor of the number of phase‐encoding lines. This lower complexity makes our approach especially useful for simulations of scans with large matrix sizes, such as high‐resolution or 3D scans. In our experiments, we were able to perform 3D FORECAST simulations in 1045 s on a single CPU core, which was faster than a 2D Bloch simulation with the same in‐plane matrix size, which required 2572 s. Because computing discrete Fourier transforms and FFTs is the primary computational load of the FORECAST method, the method can be easily accelerated using parallel computing or GPU acceleration.

In general, the off‐resonance artifacts simulated by FORECAST were similar to the artifacts observed in actual MRI scans, in both the magnitude and the phase of the images. Differences between the simulations and scans can be partly attributed to factors that were not included in the simulation, such as accurate simulation of RF excitation and spoiling mechanisms. These effects can be included in the fast simulation with a hybrid simulation approach, in which Bloch simulation is used to numerically establish the steady state of a sequence, which can subsequently be used as an input to the FORECAST simulation. Additionally, there may have been small imperfections in the simulation models with respect to the real objects, since the size and susceptibility values were based on idealized models. The limited resolution of the models may have also caused imperfect intravoxel dephasing and partial volume effects. Given the favorable computational complexity of our method, the resolution of the simulation model can still be increased to reduce these imperfections while maintaining acceptable simulation times.

### Spine stereotactic body radiation therapy for a patient with a metallic implant in low-field magnetic resonance-guided linear accelerator: a case report [^8b20f6cb]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metal artifacts in CT image from the titanium alloy implants can cause errors in contour delineation and dose calculation. In MRI, the metal artifacts (ie, susceptibility artifacts) can occur and distort images, and these artifacts increase with the strength of the magnetic field.

Our institution clinically introduced MRIdian (Viewray) — a radiation treatment machine with an integrated low-field MRI system (0.35 T) and a treatment system with a linear accelerator (LINAC) generating nominal beam energy of 6 MV flattening filter free radiographs (hereinafter, MRIdian-LINAC).MRIdian-LINAC offers fixed gantry step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy.

As mentioned before, susceptibility artifacts increase with a strong magnetic field. Therefore, susceptibility artifacts are minimized in MRIdian-LINAC because of its low-magnetic field, making spinal cord and target delineation easier for patients with titanium alloy implants. Moreover, this machine uses its own MR image as the primary image for treatment planning, eliminating CT-MR registration issues.

This report discusses the effectiveness and advantages of using the low-field MR-guided radiation therapy (the low-field MRgRT) for postoperative spine SBRT in a patient with a metal implant.

Image interpretation and artifacts in PET/MRI — The complexity of integrated PET/MRI hybrid imaging bears high potential for PET, MRI, or PET/MRI-related artifacts, which may significantly affect quantification of PET data. Because attenuation correction in PET/MRI is mostly based on MRI sequences, artifacts in the MR-AC images will ultimately translate into inaccurate values in PET quantification following MR-AC. Typical artifacts include motion artifacts and local misalignments between PET and MRI data due to patient and organ motion, faulty tissue segmentation with assignment of wrong LAC in MR-based AC, signal truncations along the patient's arms where anatomy exceeds the MRI field-of-view, and issues related to head and metal implants that are found in a large and increasing group of patients.

### Clinical outcomes of 3T magnetic resonance imaging-guided lumbar and sacral foraminal injections [^f4d090dd]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the future, the development of metal artifact reduction (MAR) sequences holds potential for further enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of MRI-guided nerve root infiltrations. By mitigating the impact of metallic artifacts resulting from implanted devices, MAR sequences enable improved visualization and precise needle placement. However, it is important to note that these sequences require substantial time for completion. This improvement may contribute to better patient outcomes and expand the applicability of MRI-guided procedures in the field of neuroradiology.

Another area for future development could be to compare the immediate to mid-term effects (resulting from local anesthesia, injected last) with the mid- to long-term effects (resulting from steroids, injected first). Infiltrations are often requested for patients who are highly likely to eventually undergo surgery. Exploring the possibility that a positive immediate effect may serve as a predictor for a favorable mid- to long-term outcome would be intriguing and valuable. Further research is warranted to explore these possibilities and optimize chronic back pain management.

### ACR-SPR-SSR practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip and pelvis for musculoskeletal disorders [^9f99b202]. SPR/ACR/SSR (2021). High credibility.

ACR–SPR–SSR hip and pelvis MRI — artifact reduction and metal implant strategies: When the field of view excludes pelvic regions within coil sensitivity, aliasing artifacts can be reduced by phase oversampling or by orienting the phase-encoding direction along the anteroposterior axis, and ensuring patient comfort with gentle immobilization when necessary best controls involuntary motion. Presaturation pulses and/or gradient moment nulling will reduce ghosting artifacts caused by flowing blood. For imaging near metallic implants, orienting the long axis of the implant along the frequency-encoding gradient, avoiding gradient-recalled sequences, substituting STIR for chemical fat suppression, and using FSE sequences with short interecho spacing, multiple refocusing pulses, and tailored RF pulses will further minimize metallic artifacts. Metal artifact is further reduced by using a wide readout bandwidth and small pixel dimensions with adequate signals averaged and is better performed on MR systems with wider available receiver bandwidths; artifacts from metal implants are less prominent on low-field systems compared with high-field systems. Progress in metal artifact reduction techniques minimize metal-related artifacts while improving depiction of synovium and bone-implant interfaces, and such techniques provide a diagnostically meaningful reduction of metal artifact around implants and can be used as an adjunct to optimized 2-D FSE sequences.

### MR imaging with metal-suppression sequences for evaluation of total joint arthroplasty [^4d83bf9f]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Metallic artifact at orthopedic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging continues to be an important problem, particularly in the realm of total joint arthroplasty. Complications often follow total joint arthroplasty and can be expected for a small percentage of all implanted devices. Postoperative complications involve not only osseous structures but also adjacent soft tissues-a highly problematic area at MR imaging because of artifacts from metallic prostheses. Without special considerations, susceptibility artifacts from ferromagnetic implants can unacceptably degrade image quality. Common artifacts include in-plane distortions (signal loss and signal pileup), poor or absent fat suppression, geometric distortion, and through-section distortion. Basic methods to reduce metallic artifacts include use of spin-echo or fast spin-echo sequences with long echo train lengths, short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences for fat suppression, a high bandwidth, thin section selection, and an increased matrix. With care and attention to the alloy type (eg, titanium, cobalt-chromium, stainless steel), orientation of the implant, and magnetic field strength, as well as use of proprietary and nonproprietary metal-suppression techniques, previously nondiagnostic studies can yield key diagnostic information. Specifically, sequences such as the metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS), WARP (Siemens Healthcare, Munich, Germany), slice encoding for metal artifact correction (SEMAC), and multiacquisition with variable-resonance image combination (MAVRIC) can be optimized to reveal pathologic conditions previously hidden by periprosthetic artifacts. Complications of total joint arthroplasty that can be evaluated by using MR imaging with metal-suppression sequences include pseudotumoral conditions such as metallosis and particle disease, infection, aseptic prosthesis loosening, tendon injury, and muscle injury.

### Deep learning-based metal artefact reduction in PET / CT imaging [^068aef70]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to diagnostic imaging applications with contrast enhancement of CT in radiology, this imaging modality is also employed in quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the framework of CT-based attenuation correction (AC) of the PET data. Any issues or image artefacts affecting CT images would be reflected in the attenuation-corrected PET images, potentially leading to misdiagnosis and/or quantitative errors. Moreover, CT images commonly serve as standard of reference for the evaluation of MRI-guided attenuation correction and MRI-only treatment planning in radiation oncology.

The presence of metallic objects in PET imaging itself does not cause any signal loss/distortion; however, the incorrect CT values (due to metal artefacts) could lead to inaccurate PET attenuation and scatter corrections. Noticeable over/underestimation of the activity concentration would be observed in the vicinity of metallic objects. Moreover, strong streak artefacts in CT images may distort genuine PET signal and may also cause factitious signals in the PET image (e.g. false abnormalities). When metallic objects in CT-based PET attenuation map cause inaccurate scatter correction, its impact will not be confounded to the site of the metal artefact and would affect the entire PET volume. Metal artefacts are easily detectable through visual inspection of CT images; however, radiotracer uptake bias in PET images affected by incorrect AC maps owing to metal artefacts is not easily recognized without reviewing the attenuation map. Hence, metal artefact correction in PET imaging is as important as in CT imaging.

### Comparison of the artifacts caused by metallic implants in breast MRI using dual-echo dixon versus conventional fat-suppression techniques [^f0059e68]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to evaluate and compare the artifacts caused by metal implants in breast MR images acquired with dual-echo Dixon and two conventional fat-suppression techniques.

Subjects and Methods

Two types of biopsy markers were embedded into a uniform fat-water emulsion. T1-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired on a clinical 3-T MRI scanner with three different fat-suppression techniques-conventional or quick fat saturation, spectrally selective adiabatic inversion recovery (SPAIR), and dual-echo Dixon-and the 3D volumes of artifacts were measured. Among the subjects of a clinical breast MRI study using the same scanner, five patients were found to have one or more metal implants. The artifacts in Dixon and SPAIR fat-suppressed images were evaluated by three radiologists, and the results were compared with those of the phantom study.

Results

In the phantom study, the artifacts appeared as interleaved bright and dark rings on SPAIR and quick-fat-saturation images, whereas they appeared as dark regions with a thin bright rim on Dixon images. The artifacts imaged with the Dixon technique had the smallest total volume. However, the reviewers found larger artifact diameters on patient images using the Dixon sequence because only the central region was recognized as an artifact on the SPAIR images.

Conclusion

Metal implants introduce artifacts of different types and sizes, according to the different fat-suppression techniques used. The dual-echo Dixon technique produces a larger central void, allowing the implant to be easily identified, but presents a smaller overall artifact volume by obscuring less area in the image, according to a quantitative phantom study.

The presence of metallic compounds in facial cosmetics and permanent tattoos may affect the quality of magnetic resonance imaging. We report a case study describing a signal artifact due to the use of a leave-on powdered hair dye. On reviewing the ingredients of the product, it was found to contain several metallic compounds. In lieu of this observation, we suggest that MRI centers include the use of metal- or mineral-based facial cosmetics or hair products in their screening protocols.

### Cardiac MRI for metal on metal hip resurfacing… [^9890f8c8]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Study Overview There has been some recent concern regarding possible systemic health effects resulting from elevated blood cobalt concentrations in patients with cobalt containing hip implants. To date there are no blood cobalt criteria to help guide physicians when evaluating an individual hip implant patient's risk of developing systemic health effects because historically there was little or no concern about systemic cobalt toxicity in implant patients. Included within this is heart function, for which investigators see a need to use this novel software to analyze heart function relative to Hip status and Metal Ion levels. Patients with metal on metal hip prosthesis are subject to local and systemic release of cobalt and chromium ions which may increase the potential for locally aggressive ion-induced local tissue reactions such as pseudotumours, a type of Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris.

Although there have been reports of local toxicity as well as cases of cobaltism leading to cardiac and ototoxicity, it is unclear if chronic exposure to these ions can lead to impaired cardiac function in a well-functioning prosthesis. Extensive evaluations of these 'cobalt beer drinkers' have found that poor nutrition and underlying disease states caused by severe alcoholism were likely significant contributing factors to heart disease in this particular population. However, there remains a significant concern that cardiac function could be affected in the long term. This is especially relevant as the majority of these implants are put in patients less than 50 years age. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method to assess cardiac function in patients at risk of cardiotoxicity.

In addition to assessing cardiac function, CMR enables imaging of inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart which may provide more specific information about the mechanism of injury in these patients. The purpose of this study is to look at cardiac function in patients with a metal on metal hip prostheses. All patients will have extra images collected during their MRI and these images will be analyzed to determine any relationship between heart function and the possible metal ion levels from the hip implant. As part of the scan analysis they will be required to also have a 5 millilitres vial of blood collected. Ultrasound values will be retrospectively collected, for analysis of soft tissue reaction, from a previous clinically ordered ultrasound of the affected joint.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or soft tissue infection (excluding spine and diabetic foot): 2022 update [^71af257e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal infections involve bones, joints, and soft tissues. These infections are a common clinical scenario in both outpatient and emergent settings. Although radiography provides baseline findings, a multimodality approach is often implemented to provide more detailed information on the extent of infection involvement and complications. MRI with intravenous contrast is excellent for the evaluation of musculoskeletal infections and is the most sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis. MRI, CT, and ultrasound can be useful for joint and soft tissue infections. When MRI or CT is contraindicated, bone scans and the appropriate utilization of other nuclear medicine scans can be implemented for aiding in the diagnostic imaging of infection, especially with metal hardware and arthroplasty artifacts on MRI and CT. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Before an examination with a given MRI scanner, it must be ensured that any metallic implants in the patient are MR conditional, i.e. pose no known hazards in a specified MRI environment with specified conditions of use. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has defined standard methods for evaluation of passive implants to determine whether they are MR conditional and safe. During MRI, radiofrequencies (RF) are emitted with high energy, which can lead to induced heating of, and/or in the vicinity of, a passive medical implant (ASTM F2182). This heating can lead to injuries and is one of the most common MRI incidents. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of MRI can be reduced by susceptibility artifacts. These artifacts are characterized by distorted object geometry and artificial signal variations in the MR image caused by large susceptibility gradients between an implant and neighboring tissues (ASTM F2119). Additionally, even in the homogeneous area of the static magnetic field (B 0), strong magnetically induced torques may act on implanted ferromagnetic medical devices (ASTM F2213). These forces are liable to restrict the function of the device, damage it, and/or cause severe, sometimes life-threatening, incidents. However, most serious injuries are caused by the magnetically induced displacement force, because the spatial gradient of B 0 can greatly accelerate ferromagnetic objects or metallic implants (ASTM F2052).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the MRI safety and MR conditional status of a metallic pedicle-screw-rod system of different lengths (130 to 430 mm), configurations, and materials at field strengths of 1.5 T and 3 T adapted to a full-spine sawbone profile based on standardized testing methods of the ASTM.

### What is the natural history of "Asymptomatic" pseudotumours in metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty? Minimum 4-year metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging longitudinal study [^9dbccf92]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Metal Artifact Reduction Sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MARS-MRI) is an important cross-sectional imaging modality in detection of metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasty (HA) pseudotumours. Potential evolution of pseudotumours detected by MARS-MRI in "asymptomatic" patients with MoMHA arthroplasty beyond 2 years remains largely unknown. The aims of this longitudinal study were to (1) determine the natural history of pseudotumours in "asymptomatic" MoMHA patients under MARS-MRI surveillance and (2) characterize MRI feature(s) associated with progressive pseudotumours.

Methods

A total of 37 MoMHA (32 patients, mean 56 years old) with pseudotumours on MARS-MRI were evaluated longitudinally using a standardized MARS-MRI protocol. Serum cobalt and chromium levels, pseudotumour size, thickness of the cyst wall, and MRI signal intensity of the abnormality were recorded and analyzed.

Results

At minimum of 4-year follow-up (range 49–54 months), 4 Type II pseudotumours (11%) demonstrated MRI evidence of progression. Five Type I pseudotumours (14%) were found to have "regressed". No measurable MRI progression was detected in remaining patients (75%). MRI features associated with progressive pseudotumours included the presence of increased cystic wall thickness and "atypical" mixed fluid signal. MRI pseudotumour progression was not associated with metal ion levels.

Conclusion

The natural history of type I cystic pseudotumours continues to be nonprogressive in most "asymptomatic" MoMHA patients at minimum 4 years, suggesting the importance of patient symptoms and MRI characteristic features in the clinical decision-making process. Routine follow-up MARS-MRI evaluation of "asymptomatic" patients with low-grade cystic pseudotumours in the absence of interval clinical changes may not be indicated.

### Gradient field switching as a source for artifacts in MR imaging of metallic stents [^3c9f86af]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Metallic implants, such as stents, have long been a concern in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to safety issues, they are commonly associated with image artifacts. The mechanisms of radiofrequency- (RF) and susceptibility-induced artifacts have been thoroughly investigated. However, gradient-switching-induced artifacts have not been analyzed. In this study it was demonstrated that gradient switching may be a source of artifacts in metallic stent MR imaging. These artifacts differ from those caused by the RF pulse. A theoretical explanation is provided as well.

### Advanced MRI techniques for the ankle [^846dd419]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this article are to present a state-of-the-art routine protocol for MRI of the ankle, to provide problem-solving tools based on specific clinical indications, and to introduce principles for the implementation of ultrashort echo time MRI of the ankle, including morphologic and quantitative assessment.

Conclusion

Ankle injury is common among both athletes and the general population, and MRI is the established noninvasive means of evaluation. The design of an ankle protocol depends on various factors. Higher magnetic field improves signal-to-noise ratio but increases metal artifact. Specialized imaging planes are useful but prolong acquisition times. MR neurography is useful, but metal reduction techniques are needed whenever a metal prosthesis is present. An ultrashort echo time sequence is a valuable tool for both structural and quantitative evaluation.

### Overcoming artifacts from metallic orthopedic implants at high-field-strength MR imaging and multi-detector CT [^5e2b71be]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and multidetector computed tomography (CT), artifacts arising from metallic orthopedic hardware are an obstacle to obtaining optimal images. Although various techniques for reducing such artifacts have been developed and corroborated by previous researchers, a new era of more powerful MR imaging and multidetector CT modalities has renewed the importance of a systematic consideration of methods for artifact reduction. Knowledge of the factors that contribute to artifacts, of related theories, and of artifact reduction techniques has become mandatory for radiologists. Factors that affect artifacts on MR images include the composition of the metallic hardware, the orientation of the hardware in relation to the direction of the main magnetic field, the strength of the magnetic field, the pulse sequence type, and other MR imaging parameters (mainly voxel size, which is determined by the field of view, image matrix, section thickness, and echo train length). At multidetector CT, the factors that affect artifacts include the composition of the hardware, orientation of the hardware, acquisition parameters (peak voltage, tube charge, collimation, and acquired section thickness), and reconstruction parameters (reconstructed section thickness, reconstruction algorithm used, and whether an extended CT scale was used). A comparison of images obtained with different hardware and different acquisition and reconstruction parameters facilitates an understanding of methods for reducing or overcoming artifacts related to metallic implants.

### ACR-ASNR-SABI-SSR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the adult spine [^2cec28f7]. ACR/ASNR/SABI/SSR (2023). High credibility.

Adult spine MRI — artifact minimization and imaging around metal indicates that imaging sequences should minimize artifacts as much as possible, and techniques to mitigate artifacts include changing phase and frequency directions to move pulsation artifact, increasing resolution to reduce frequency mis-registration, applying saturation bands or flow sensitization preparation pulses for CSF or blood, gating techniques, and modifying patient/coil positions to improve comfort and reduce respiration and other motion artifact. When imaging around metal, such as fixation devices, STIR for fat suppression, short time to echo (20–30 ms), decreased slice thickness/small voxel size, high-receiver bandwidth, fat-water separation, low echo spacing (high echo train lengths), and special metal artifact reduction sequences may be helpful to reduce artifacts, and examination at 1.5T rather than with higher strength 3T magnets may be preferred in patients with spine hardware to reduce susceptibility artifacts.

### 7 T musculoskeletal MRI: fundamentals and clinical implementation [^eff35e80]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Not every patient referred to knee MRI will need to undergo ultra-high-field MRI, but 7 T MRI will enhance our insight into anatomy and pathology in a subset of patients. Several ultra-high-resolution knee MRI studies are currently ongoing in our institutions, and in the next couple of years, we will have additional data regarding the differentiation of clinical use cases where 7 T MRI can offer a significant benefit and those where MRI at lower field strengths is sufficient.

Apart from the knee joint, possible use cases for musculoskeletal 7 T MRI will also emerge for other anatomical areas, such as ultra-high-resolution nerve imaging, the detection of cartilage delamination of the hip joint, or the improved depiction of osteochondral lesions of the ankle.

Recent advances in metal-artifact reduction at ultra-high-field strength have also made it possible to reduce peri-implant signal voids and geometric distortions in the presence of metal with a combination of increased receive bandwidth, view-angle tilting, as well as slice-encoding for metal artifact correction. The extent of metal artifacts is directly proportional to the field strength. Therefore, metal artifact techniques at 7 T MRI will help obtain a homogeneous signal intensity in patients undergoing 7 T MRI, for example, after ACL or tendon reconstructions. Typically, advanced acceleration techniques are required to attain clinically feasible scan times, for example, compressed sensing.

### Integral method for numerical simulation of MRI artifacts induced by metallic implants [^cc9c10f1]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Numerical simulation is a valuable tool for the study of magnetic susceptibility artifacts from metallic implants. A major difficulty in the simulation lies in the computation of the magnetic field induced by the metallic implant. A new method has been designed and implemented to compute the magnetic field induced by metallic objects of arbitrary shape. The magnetic field is expressed pointwise in terms of a surface integral. Efficient quadrature schemes are proposed to evaluate this integral. Finally, the method is linked to an artifact reconstruction model to simulate the images. Magn Reson Med 45:724–727, 2001.

### Metal artifact reduction magnetic resonance imaging around arthroplasty implants: the negative effect of long echo trains on the implant-related artifact [^60c4a88b]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Long echo train length (ETL) is an often recommended but unproven technique to decrease metal artifacts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therefore, we quantitatively and qualitatively assessed the effects of ETL on metal artifact on MRI scans using a cobalt-chromium-containing arthroplasty implant system.

Materials and Methods

Using a total ankle arthroplasty system implanted into a human cadaver ankle and a clinical 1.5 T MRI system, turbo spin echo (TSE) pulse sequences were acquired with ETL ranging from 3 to 23 and receiver bandwidth (BW) from 100 to 750 Hz/pixel, whereas effective echo time and spatial resolution were controlled. A compressed sensing slice encoding for metal artifact correction TSE prototype pulse sequence was used as reference standard. End points included the total implant-related artifact area and implant-related signal void areas. Two raters evaluated the overall image quality and preference across varying BW and ETL. Two-factor analysis of variance, Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Pearson correlation were used. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

The total implant-related artifact area ranged from 0.119 for compressed sensing slice encoding for metal artifact correction (BW, 600 Hz/pixel; ETL, 3) to 0.265 for TSE (BW, 100 Hz/pixel; ETL, 23). Longer ETL significantly increases the total implant-related artifact area (P = 0.0004), whereas it decreased with increasing BW (P < 0.0001). Implant-related signal void areas were not significantly affected by larger echo train length, but reduced with higher BW (P < 0.0001). Readers had a significant preference for images with high BW and short ETL (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

High receiver BW is the most effective parameter for reduction of arthroplasty implant-induced metal artifact on MRI scans, whereas in contradiction to prevalent notions, long echo trains fail to reduce implant-related metal artifacts, but in fact cause degradation of image quality around the implant with resultant larger appearing total metal artifacts.

### Comparing metal artifact severity and ability to assess near-metal anatomy between 0.55 T and 1.5 T MRI in patients with metallic spinal implants – A scanner comparison study [^b3ed3fe1]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To compare image quality and metal artifact severity at 0.55 T and 1.5 T MRI in patients with spinal implants following posterior fusion surgery.

Materials and Methods

50 consecutive patients (mean age: 69 ± 12 years) who underwent 0.55 T and 1.5 T MRI following posterior fusion surgery of the lumbar or thoracolumbar spine were included. Examinations used metal artifact reduction protocols from clinical routine. Images were rated by two fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists for image quality, ability to assess the spinal canal and the neural foramina, and artifact severity on 5-point Likert scales. Additionally, differences in artifact severity and visibility of near-metal anatomy among implant sizes (1-level vs. 2-level vs. > 2-levels) were evaluated.

Results

Signal/contrast (mean: 4.0 ± 0.3 [0.55 T] vs. 4.4 ± 0.6 [1.5 T]; p < .001) and resolution (3.8 ± 0.5 vs. 4.2 ± 0.7; p < .001) were rated lower at 0.55 T. The ability to assess the spinal canal (4.4 ± 0.5 vs. 4.2 ± 0.9; p = .69) and the neural foramina (3.8 ± 0.5 vs. 3.8 ± 0.9; p = .19) were however rated equally good with excellent interrater agreement (range: 0.84–0.94). Susceptibility artifacts were rated milder at 0.55 T (1.8 ± 0.5 vs. 3.0 ± 0.6; p < .001). For implant size-based subgroups, the visibility of near-metal anatomy decreased with implant length at 1.5 T, but remained unchanged at 0.55 T. In consequence, the spinal canal and neural foramina could be better assessed at 0.55 T in patients with multi-level implants (4.4 ± 0.5 vs. 3.6 ± 1.1; p < .001).

Conclusion

Metal artifacts of spinal implants are substantially less pronounced at 0.55 T MRI. When examining patients with multi-level posterior fusion, this translates into a superior ability to assess near-metal anatomy, where 1.5 T MRI reaches diagnostic limitations.

### Imaging near titanium total hip arthroplasty at 0.55 T compared with 3 T [^fe64f151]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Contemporary low‐field MRI systems (< 1 T), show promise based on reduced artifact. Recent work with hip implant phantoms at 0.55 T has demonstrated that metal artifacts are significantly reduced with fewer spectral encodings required for effective artifact mitigation. Residual artifacts depend on the material composition, with titanium alloys producing the smallest artifacts compared to cobalt‐chromium and stainless steel. Titanium hip implants may be imaged using optimized turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences at 0.55 T. A recent study showed that 0.55 T MRI can help diagnose periprosthetic hip joint infection (PJI) in symptomatic THA patients. Furthermore, a recent study comparing metal artifacts caused by spinal hardware at 0.55 T to higher fields (1.5 T/3 T) showed that 0.55 T could be used in clinical practice without compromising image quality or diagnostic efficacy. Another study comparing images of patients with spinal fusion at 0.55 and 1.5 T demonstrated that metal artifacts are substantially reduced, and 0.55 T provides better imaging near the multi‐level posterior fusion hardware.

In this study, we imaged patients with THA implants at both 0.55 T and 3 T field strengths using similar protocols. Reader scores were used to evaluate diagnostic confidence, the severity of metal artifacts, perceived image sharpness, and perceived SNR at both field strengths. We specifically focused on patients with titanium THA because of the predominance of titanium implants used at our institution in recent years. Additionally, we assessed the necessity for MSI at 0.55 T to achieve diagnostic imaging for patients with titanium THA.

### MRI following scoliosis surgery? An analysis of implant heating, displacement, torque, and susceptibility artifacts [^e4d672e6]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of metallic implants such as pedicle screws and rods is currently standard in spinal surgery to treat deformity, degeneration, destruction, and trauma. Especially in patients with deformity, the implants may be long and the constructs may have a high density of screws. The compatibility of various orthopedic implants with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been studied, but the modern metallic pedicle-screw-rod systems have not been sufficiently investigated in this regard. A previously published study on a pedicle-screw-rod system focused mainly on shorter implant constructs and used a field strength of 7 T. However, the pedicle screw density used here was lower and the 7-T magnetic field strength was higher than in routine clinical care because usually the patients are examined at 1.5 T and 3 T. Furthermore, not all aspects of MRI compatibility were examined; no attention was paid, for example, to magnetically induced torque or susceptibility artifacts. Patients with long metallic pedicle-screw-rod constructs who need a tomographic examination, e.g. in the presence of postoperative complications or in scoliosis secondary to tumors such as neurofibromas, often undergo computed tomography (CT) despite the exposure to ionizing radiation. Particularly due to the youth of many scoliosis patients, MRI would be preferable.

### ACR-SPR-SSR practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee [^00983876]. SPR/ACR/SSR (2025). High credibility.

Knee MRI — metallic implant artifact mitigation — in knees containing large metallic implants, a combination of longer echo trains, increased receiver bandwidth, decreased FOV, decreased slice thickness, increased matrix size in the frequency-encoding direction, and control of the phase and frequency encoding directions will reduce, but typically not completely eliminate, metal artifacts. Vendor specific pulse sequences have been developed which can further reduce metal artifacts, and the term "metal artifact reduction sequences" has been applied to such strategies. Lower magnet strength (1.5T rather than 3T) and use of nonfat-suppressed pulse sequences is preferred. In the presence of metal hardware, STIR imaging is often preferred over spectral fat suppression techniques, and gradient echo techniques should be avoided.

Attenuation correction

Attenuation correction can be based on either a CT (low or high dose), MRI (attenuation correction sequence) or a 511 keV-transmission scan. When using a 511 keV-transmission scan, it's crucial to acquire the transmission images before administering the tracer. CT parameters should always be selected to minimize patient radiation exposure while serving the intended purpose. For PET/MR, it is important to utilize a 3D data acquisition mode.

Several points related to attenuation correction in PET/MRI should be taken into consideration:

Since attenuation correction relies on MRI data, the MRI must be accurate and free from artifacts to ensure precise PET quantification.
Users should employ the most up-to-date MRI attenuation correction software, including ultrashort echo time (UTE), zero TE (ZTE) sequences, or bone models for bone detection in brain PET/MRI when available.
It is essential to be aware that MRI attenuation correction software may vary among different vendors and is regularly updated, often with performance changes that may not be well-documented.
Different attenuation correction strategies for PET/MRI have been developed, and some may introduce systematic differences in the distribution of activity and calculated semi-quantitative metrics. These differences should be carefully considered during PET image interpretation.
MRI attenuation correction images should be routinely examined for artifacts, consistency, and plausibility during PET/MRI interpretation. Artifacts in MRI attenuation correction directly affect PET quantification in brain PET/MRI. Common artifacts include mis-segmentation of brain, fat, and bone tissue, as well as metal artifacts caused by dental prostheses and metallic implants such as coils, stents, surgical clips, and titanium calvarial implants/mesh. These artifacts may manifest as signal voids that extend beyond the actual dimensions of metal inclusions, indicating regions of potentially inaccurate PET quantification.
When applicable, consider using time-of-flight (TOF) PET detection to reduce the impact of metal artifacts in brain PET/MRI examinations.
Ensure that radiofrequency head coils used are specifically labelled for combined PET/MRI. Using standard radiofrequency head coils designated for MRI only use will not be accounted for in PET/MRI attenuation correction and may result in inaccurate PET quantification and artifacts in PET images.

### MRI following scoliosis surgery? An analysis of implant heating, displacement, torque, and susceptibility artifacts [^6e0533c6]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

ASTM F2119: susceptibility artifact

Susceptibility artifact can strongly reduce the diagnostic value of MRI, especially if the region of interest is close to the implant. This is the case, for example, for patients in whom postoperative hematoma or recurrent spinal tumor is suspected. Therefore, it is important to know which parameters influence the artifacts, in order to minimize it. In general, the size of susceptibility artifacts depends on the chemical elements present in the construct (implant material composition), the geometry and volume of the implant, the magnetic field strength, the orientation of the implant in relation to B 0, the MRI sequence used, and the sequence parameters. Comparison of the different rods in this study indicated that ferromagnetic cobalt is particularly likely to increase the susceptibility artifact. Avoiding the use of cobalt alloys might therefore reduce artifact size in cases where regular evaluation of the region adjacent to the implant is necessary.

### MRI of hip prostheses using single-point methods: in vitro studies towards the artifact-free imaging of individuals with metal implants [^ea86aeb9]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

Use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in individuals with orthopedic implants is limited because of the large distortions caused by metallic components. As a possible solution for this problem, we suggest the use of single-point imaging (SPI) methods, which are immune to the susceptibility artifacts observed with conventional MRI methods. A further advantage of SPI, based on the fact that signal encoding is achieved in ultra-short times (as short as tens of microseconds), is that they enable the direct visualization of the polymeric elements of the implants, allowing the detection of possible implant failures. We present in vitro SPI images of polymeric sockets of two hip prostheses together with artifact-free images of gelatin phantoms containing their respective metallic stems. These data underscore the great potential of the SPI technique for obtaining artifact-free images of individuals with large metal implants.

### Imaging near metal: the impact of extreme static local field gradients on frequency encoding processes [^51435e6c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging capabilities in the direct vicinity of metallic devices have substantially improved with the recent development of three-dimensional multispectral imaging (3D-MSI) methods. When imaging near metallic hardware, the bulk image distortions in 3D-MSI techniques are reduced to the single-pixel level. However, commonly utilized MSI techniques are ultimately limited by frequency-encoding processes and reveal a class of residual intensity-based susceptibility artifacts that have yet to be formally analyzed.

Methods

Empirical measurements and simulation techniques are utilized to study the static local magnetic field gradients induced by metal implants and their general impact on frequency-encoding processes. The specific consequences of these gradients on 3D-MSI approaches are also analyzed using empirical and simulated approaches.

Results

Close agreements between empirical and simulated measurements clearly demonstrate the effects of strong local gradients on frequency-encoded imaging capabilities near metallic implants.

Conclusions

3D-MSI techniques can enable substantially enhanced magnetic resonance imaging capabilities near metallic implants. However, strong local static field gradients generate residual artifacts whose direct mitigation are ultimately limited by frequency encoding processes. Applications of 3D encoding strategies or additional post processing may be required to further reduce residual artifacts in multispectral images near metal implants.

### Fast fourier-based simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI applied to metal object localization [^07b585de]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To accelerate simulation of off‐resonance artifacts in steady‐state gradient echo MRI by using fast Fourier transforms and demonstrate its applicability to metal object localization.

Theory and Methods

By exploiting the repetitive nature of steady‐state pulse sequences it is possible to use fast Fourier transforms to calculate the MR signal. Based on this principle, a method for fast simulation of off‐resonance artifacts was designed. The method was validated against Bloch simulations and MRI scans. Its clinical relevance was demonstrated by employing it for template matching‐based metal object localization, as applied to a titanium cylinder, an oxidized zirconium knee implant, and gold fiducials.

Results

The fast simulations were accurate compared with actual MRI scans of the objects. The differences between the fast simulations and Bloch simulations were minor, while the acceleration scaled linearly with the number of phase‐encoding lines. The object localization method accurately localized the various metal objects.

Conclusion

The proposed simulation methodology provided accurate 3D simulations of off‐resonance artifacts with a lower computational complexity than Bloch simulations. The speed of the simulations opens up possibilities in image reconstructions involving off‐resonance phenomena that were previously infeasible due to computational limitations, as demonstrated for metal object localization.

### Multispectral diffusion-weighted imaging near metal implants [^14d065cf]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The need for diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) near metallic implants is becoming increasingly relevant for a variety of clinical diagnostic applications. Conventional DWI methods are significantly hindered by metal-induced image artifacts. A novel approach relying on multispectral susceptibility artifact reduction techniques is presented to address this unmet need.

Methods

DWI near metal implants is achieved through a combination of several advanced MRI acquisition technologies. Previously described approaches to Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin-echo train DWI sequences using the periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction are combined with multispectral-imaging metal artifact reduction principles to provide DWI with substantially reduced artifact levels. The presented methods are applied to limited sets of slices over areas of sarcoma risk near six implanted devices.

Results

Using the presented methods, DWI assessment without bulk image distortions is demonstrated in the immediate vicinity of metallic interfaces. In one subject, the apparent diffusion coefficient was reduced in a region of suspected sarcoma directly adjacent to fixation hardware.

Conclusions

An initial demonstration of minimal-artifact multispectral DWI in the near vicinity of metallic hardware is described and successfully demonstrated on clinical subjects. Magn Reson Med 79:987–993, 2018. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

### MRI following scoliosis surgery? An analysis of implant heating, displacement, torque, and susceptibility artifacts [^ff3c1319]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this study was to evaluate the MRI safety and MR conditional status of a metallic pedicle-screw-rod system with different lengths (130 to 430 mm), configurations, and materials at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T and 3 T based on standardized test methods of the ASTM. We found that even long implant constructs are MR conditional and safe in the standard clinical setting for MRI in patients with such implants with regard to RF-induced heating as well as magnetically induced torque and displacement force. However, we encountered clinically relevant susceptibility artifacts near the posterior spinal implants which were dependent on the field strength.

ASTM F2182: RF-induced heating

In the present study, we examined metallic spinal implants ranging from 3 to 14 spinal segments (130–430 mm) in length, of the type usually employed for correction of scoliosis. Despite the considerable construct length and the large amount of metal, the maximum RF-induced temperature increase of the spinal implants in the worst case conditions (SAR 2 W/kg, 15 min MR acquisition) was only 1.3 K. The RF-induced heating was even less when two cross-links were used, although electrically closed loops (coils) can favor heating of the surroundings. These results are in agreement with the findings of Tsukimura et al for a 200-mm implant at 7 T. A review demonstrated that low heating (up to 43 °C) for several hours causes no damage and that heating to 44 °C for 200 min leads only to transient erythema. Therefore, it can be assumed that adverse biological effects due to RF-induced heating of the investigated pedicle-screw-rod system in scoliosis patients, examined with a 1.5 to 3 T MRI in a supine position, become unlikely. In vitro studies on RF-induced heating of metallic orthopedic implants showed temperature increases of up to 9 or 14 K after MRI duration of only 15 min.

### Advanced MRI techniques for the hip joint: focus on the postoperative hip [^1048976a]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Imaging the hip joint with optimized MRI protocol parameters provides the radiologist with the ability to reliably diagnose complex hip abnormalities. The institution of appropriate metal artifact reduction techniques and dedicated sequences can enhance visualization of the periprosthetic bone and soft tissues and allow improved detection of the more frequently encountered total hip arthroplasty-related conditions, such as mechanical loosening, polyethylene wear, and adverse local tissue reactions.

Conclusion

Finally, through the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, abnormal femoral head perfusion, one of the most common complications associated with femoral neck fracture internal fixation, can be detected before the development of femoral head osteonecrosis, subchondral collapse, and secondary osteoarthritis. Thus, through the institution of the techniques described in this review article, the challenges associated with MRI of hip arthroplasty and instrumentation can be overcome, allowing for the diagnosis of common associated complications.

### International EANM-SNMMI-ISMRM consensus recommendation for PET / MRI in oncology [^b508ed7d]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

PET/MRI — PET image reconstruction emphasizes quantitative fidelity: PET image reconstruction should be performed according to the manufacturers recommended standard reconstruction parameters, resolution modeling (point-spread-function (PSF) modeling) or other methods may be applied depending on scanner capabilities, and time-of-flight (TOF) PET information should be used during reconstruction, when available; because these parameters may have potential impact on PET quantification, in repeated PET/MRI studies identical acquisition protocols and reconstruction parameters should be used. As in PET/CT, it is good clinical practice to perform reconstructions with and without attenuation correction so both attenuation-corrected (AC-PET) and non-attenuation-corrected (NAC-PET) images are available for interpretation, and lesions on AC-PET may need to be checked on NAC-PET, particularly when adjacent to metal implants or other artifact causing structures in the MR-based AC maps.

### ACR-SPR-SSR practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee [^90f322de]. SPR/ACR/SSR (2025). High credibility.

Knee MRI — artifact reduction strategies without metal — wraparound artifact, including that originating from signal received from the contralateral knee, can be reduced by phase oversampling, by swapping the phase and frequency orientations, or by using radiofrequency shielding between the knees. Truncation (Gibbs) artifacts may obscure or mimic meniscal tears; changing the phase-encoding direction or increasing the imaging matrix will reduce this artifact. Ensuring patient comfort combined with gentle immobilization when necessary may reduce involuntary patient motion, and presaturation pulses or the use of gradient moment nulling will reduce ghosting artifacts from flowing blood. Chemical shift artifact is more severe at higher field strengths and may necessitate an increase in the receiver bandwidth. Susceptibility artifacts are also more severe at higher field strengths and when using gradient-recalled pulse sequences, and avoiding gradient-echo imaging plus reducing the voxel size by increasing the imaging matrix and/or decreasing the slice thickness and FOV will help reduce the magnitude of susceptibility artifacts.

### Off-resonance artifact correction for MRI: a review [^6e2af4c6]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), inhomogeneity in the main magnetic field used for imaging, referred to as off-resonance, can lead to image artifacts ranging from mild to severe depending on the application. Off-resonance artifacts, such as signal loss, geometric distortions, and blurring, can compromise the clinical and scientific utility of MR images. In this review, we describe sources of off-resonance in MRI, how off-resonance affects images, and strategies to prevent and correct for off-resonance. Given recent advances and the great potential of low-field and/or portable MRI, we also highlight the advantages and challenges of imaging at low field with respect to off-resonance.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^9314e47c]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Considering that the signal loss around metallic implants is unlikely to be completely eliminated with our practical SEMAC protocols, the most pertinent question is whether the introduction of SEMAC improves our ability to co-register MR and CT datasets. The metallic implant as the only feature of the test object – the surrounding gel is otherwise unstructured. The MR-CT automated co-registration is very poor for the conventional FSE MR, but approximately correct after the introduction of SEMAC, demonstrating that when the metal artifacts were significantly reduced a better registration ensued. This can only be clearly demonstrated on a test object, as the implant is the only feature contributing towards CT-MR registration. The test object is in this sense the worst case scenario for CT-MR co-registration, which is excessively affected by CT and MR artifacts.

### Joint EANM / EANO / RANO / SNMMI practice guideline / procedure standard for PET imaging of brain metastases: version 1.0 [^2d7e85b8]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Attenuation correction for brain PET/MRI — methods and artifact mitigation include that attenuation correction can be based on CT, MRI attenuation correction sequence, or a 511 keV‑transmission scan, and when using a 511 keV‑transmission scan the transmission images should be acquired before tracer administration; for PET/MR, it is important to utilize a 3D data acquisition mode. Since attenuation correction relies on MRI data, the MRI must be accurate and free from artifacts; MRI attenuation correction software may vary among different vendors and is regularly updated; different strategies may introduce systematic differences in activity distribution and semi‑quantitative metrics, which should be carefully considered during PET image interpretation; MRI attenuation correction images should be routinely examined for artifacts, with common issues including mis‑segmentation of brain, fat, and bone tissue and metal artifacts from dental prostheses and metallic implants such as coils, stents, surgical clips, and titanium calvarial implants/mesh; these artifacts may manifest as signal voids indicating regions of potentially inaccurate PET quantification; when applicable, consider using time‑of‑flight (TOF) PET detection to reduce the impact of metal artifacts; ensure that radiofrequency head coils are specifically labelled for combined PET/MRI, as MRI‑only head coils will not be accounted for in PET/MRI attenuation correction and may result in inaccurate PET quantification and artifacts in PET images.

### Artificial intelligence-driven single-shot PET image artifact detection and disentanglement: toward routine clinical image quality assurance [^2b12564e]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The presence of metallic objects and prostheses, pacemakers, and oral/IV contrast agents, catheters, coiling, spine rods, and calcified lymph nodes result in photon starvation, beam hardening, and streak artifacts (because of high photon absorption) in CT and void signals in MRI. – The aforementioned high-density materials do not disturb or decrease genuine PET image signals. – However, they deteriorate CT image quality in dense regions and adjacent organs that propagate to PET images. Metal artifacts result in CT signal skewing, which overestimates or underestimates corresponding tissue Hounsfield units (HUs), which in turns tends to overcorrect/undercorrect PET data. – In PET/CT scanners, the presence of the aforementioned highly dense objects could mimic intense radiotracer uptake overestimating the SUV by up to 20%, which can potentially be interpreted as an abnormality or malignant lesion, thus increasing the false-positive rate. Metallic objects and their corresponding artifacts could be easily detected on CT images. However, their effect on PET image quantification is less easily detectable. Joint attenuation and activity reconstruction and specific MR sequences were proposed to cope with metallic artifacts. Nonetheless, such artifacts continue to challenge PET/CT because of the wide variety of material compositions, locations, and sizes of metallic objects. – Conventional metal artifact correction often exhibits suboptimal performance (significantly over/underestimating CT HUs) and might introduce new artifacts. –

### Imaging of shoulder arthroplasties and their complications: a pictorial review [^a13c9e3a]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging

Until recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been considered uninterpretable in the exploration of articular metal prostheses, mainly because of artifacts generated by the high magnetic susceptibility of metallic prostheses. This susceptibility is responsible for proton spatial coding anomalies around the prosthesis. Nowadays, optimization of conventional sequences and development of dedicated sequences (VAT (view angle tilting), SEMAC (slice-encoding metal artifact correction), and MAVRIC (multiacquisition variable-resonance image combination)) make it possible to limit artifacts and encourage the use of MRI. In conventional MRI, the use of 1.5-T machines and spin echo sequences will be preferred, with small slice thickness, and high matrix and bandwidth. For fat suppression, a short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence should be performed, because it is less sensitive to local field inhomogeneities in the presence of metallic hardware than chemical shift selective fat suppression technique. It should be noted that there is no absolute contraindication to MRI for these patients with shoulder prostheses (even with older prostheses).

In daily practice, it is preferable to use T1-weighted sequences coupled with dedicated sequences (e.g. MAVRIC-T1) to obtain an "anatomical" view of the shoulder, and STIR sequences (also preferably coupled with dedicated sequences) to obtain an equivalent of T2-weighted sequences. MRI can detect several shoulder arthroplasty postoperative complications, such as infections, neuropathy, component loosening, tendon and muscle abnormalities, or glenoid wear in case of partial joint replacement. Thus, intra-articular effusion, periarticular collections, tendon ruptures, denervation muscle edema, and periprosthetic lines on STIR sequences (hyperintensities) will be sought; on T1-weighted sequences, periprosthetic fractures and muscular fat involution (indirect sign of rotator cuff tear or deltoid dysfunction) will be identified.

### Cochlear implants and MRI safety… [^4d29e0ac]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

MRIs and Implants Containing Metal or Magnets Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a medical imaging procedure for making images of the internal structures of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to make images. The strong magnetic field of an MRI scanner can affect medical implants that contain metal or magnets. When this happens, the implant may move or twist inside of the patient's body, causing discomfort, pain, or injury. Patients with metal-containing implants such as cochlear implants need to be aware of this risk and ensure that health care providers and MR technologists are aware of their implant so that they can take proper precautions when receiving an MRI exam. In addition, the radio waves of an MRI scanner may cause heating of the implant. Cochlear Implants and MRI Safety Cochlear implants have different types of ratings for MRI safety.

MR Unsafemeans that a patient with that type of implant should not receive an MRI exam while they have the implant. MR Conditionalmeans the patient can have an MRI exam under certain specific conditions. For example, some newer cochlear implants that are MR Conditional are designed to allow the implant magnet to turn and reorient in place. The reorienting of the magnet within the cochlear implant reduces the twisting forces on the implant and surrounding tissue when exposed to the magnetic field of the MRI scanner. Some MR Conditional cochlear implants may require the magnet to be surgically removed before an MRI can take place. The magnet will need to be surgically replaced following the MRI procedure. For other MR Conditional cochlear implants, splint/bandaging kits may be available from the manufacturer for use during MRI. If these kits are used, it is important to use the kit designed for the cochlear implant and to follow manufacturer instructions.

Recommendations for Health Care Providers and MR Technologists
- Follow the MRI instructions provided by the manufacturer of the patient's cochlear implant. Ensure that the static magnetic field strength of the scanner is compatible with the implant. Some cochlear implants require the surgical removal of the magnet before the scan, and magnet replacement after the scan. Other cochlear implants may not require magnet removal, but have specific MRI instructions that should be followed. Instructions may be included in device labeling, posted on the manufacturer's website, or both.

### Imaging features of the postoperative spine: a guide to basic understanding of spine surgical procedures [^a503e257]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

MRI

MRI is the most reliable choice to assess postoperative complications due to its excellent soft-tissue resolution. It allows the evaluation of the vertebral canal, nerve roots, bone marrow, and paravertebral soft tissues.

Although there are no major concerns regarding spinal fusion-hardware for the safety of the patient undergoing an MR procedure, they can still significantly impair the evaluation of MRI images due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts. Some alternatives to reduce these artifacts include increasing the bandwidth, higher matrix size and/or the turbo factor, lower magnetic field, acquisition in fast spin echo and short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and techniques for fat suppression. New techniques are currently available to reduce artifacts (Fig. 2) and significantly improve image quality, including multi-acquisition variable resonance image combination selective (MAVRIC-SL, GE HealthCare ®), WARP (Siemens Healthineers ®), and slice encoding metal artifact correction (SEMAC, Siemens Healthineers ®).

### Fast fourier-based simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI applied to metal object localization [^eb5b6324]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Object Localization

As a demonstration of the proposed fast simulation method, we implemented a method that localizes metal objects in MRI scans. The localization results on a cylinder, knee implant, and gold fiducials were mostly accurate to within the limits that could be expected from the angular resolution of the template library and the spatial resolution of the images. Generally, this shows that the simulations were sufficiently accurate for this type of application. Automatically locating known metal objects has a variety of potential applications. First, we have shown the possibility of locating gold fiducials. The same procedure can be applied to other types of metal markers and small metal objects such as brachytherapy seeds and sources 22, 23. Second, locating large implants could be used to evaluate arthroplasty procedures and to improve diagnosis of pathology such as implant loosening. Third, the method could be used to locate interventional devices during interventional procedures, although modifications may be necessary to apply the procedure in real time. Finally, gaining exact knowledge about the position and orientation of any metal object could potentially be used to improve imaging and postprocessing in the vicinity of that object.

In conclusion, FORECAST is a fast alternative to Bloch simulation for 3D simulation of off‐resonance artifacts in gradient echo MRI. The clinical applicability of FORECAST was shown in a metal object localization method, which was able to accurately localize a variety of objects. The low computational complexity of FORECAST makes it ideal as an investigative tool and opens up possibilities in image reconstruction involving off‐resonance phenomena that were previously infeasible due to computational limitations.

### Susceptibility artifacts from metallic markers and cardiac catheterization devices on a high-performance 0.55 T MRI system [^ab8a5ef1]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Visualization of passive devices during MRI-guided catheterizations often relies on a susceptibility artifact from the device itself or added susceptibility markers that impart a unique imaging signature. High-performance low field MRI systems offer reduced RF-induced heating of metallic devices during MRI-guided invasive procedures, but susceptibility artifacts are expected to diminish with field strength, reducing device visualization. In this study, field strength and orientation dependence of artifacts from susceptibility markers and metallic guidewires were evaluated using a prototype high-performance 0.55 T MRI system.

Materials and Methods

Artifact volume from nitinol and stainless steel passive susceptibility markers was quantified using histogram analysis of pixel intensities from three-dimensional gradient echo images at 0.55 T, 1.5 T and 3 T. In addition, visibility of commercially available clinical catheterization devices was compared between 0.55 T and 1.5 T using real-time bSSFP in phantoms and in vivo.

Results

A low-tensile strength stainless-steel marker produced field strength- and orientation-dependent artifact size (1.7 cm 3, 1.95 cm 3, 2.21 cm 3 at 0.55 T, 1.5 T, 3 T, respectively). Whereas, a high-tensile strength steel marker, of the same alloy, produced field strength- and orientation-independent artifact size (3.35 cm 3, 3.41 cm 3, 3.42 cm 3 at 0.55 T, 1.5 T, 3 T, respectively). Visibility of commercially available nitinol guidewires was reduced at 0.55 T, but imaging signature could be maintained using high-susceptibility stainless steel markers.

Discussion and Conclusion

High-susceptibility stainless-steel markers generate field-independent artifacts between 0.55 T, 1.5 T and 3 T, indicating magnetic saturation at fields < 0.55 T. Thus, artifact size can be tailored such that interventional devices produce identical imaging signatures across field strengths.

### A (sub) field guide to quality control in hippocampal subfield segmentation on high-resolution T-weighted MRI [^5d4e4a15]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.1.1 Description of the problem

MR images are prone to artifacts during acquisition due to a variety of factors, including participant movement, metal implants, magnetic field inhomogeneities related to head geometry and tissue compartments, and mechanical faults in the gradient coils. These result in suboptimal image quality and the ensuing "artifacts." These artifacts affect the quality of the data, which in turn reduces the quality of the segmentation. Although images do not need to be perfect to have valid measurements of brain structures, there is a minimum standard of data quality that often leads investigators to exclude scans as a first step in QC.

Among surveyed investigators, motion artifacts (e.g. ghosting) and susceptibility artifacts (e.g. image distortion due to metallic dental work) (Figures 2 and S1) were the most common examples of imaging artifacts flagged in QC of T 2 ‐weighted images. Motion artifacts can degrade the clarity of the image due to blurring of boundaries between tissue compartments and loss of image contrast (Reuter et al.). Of note, the majority of respondents identified problems related to motion as the most common cause of exclusion (70%).

FIGURE 2
Examples of the quality of T 2 ‐weighted images according to rating categories of "Pass" (left panel), "Check" (middle panel), and "Fail" (right panel). In this example, image quality rated as "Pass" and "Check" are considered passable. However, those in the "Check" category may be at higher risk of subsequent segmentation errors. The types of imaging artifacts present in the example images are noted.

Ghosting artifacts, like rings or streaks from motion, and reconstruction errors, manifesting as alternating bright and dark lines near high contrast boundaries, are common in MR images (Bellon et al.). Moreover, susceptibility artifacts, caused by local magnetic field inhomogeneities, distort tissue appearance. For instance, metallic implants like dental work can lead to pronounced inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field (B 0), affecting image reconstruction (Bellon et al.). Motion and susceptibility artifacts are exacerbated at higher field strengths (Dietrich et al.) and lead to insufficient image contrast that could severely distort hippocampal subfield segmentation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of microstructure transition in stainless steel [^3e69bfc6]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance images are prone to artifacts caused by metallic objects. Such artifacts may not only hamper image interpretation, but also have been shown to provide information about the magnetic properties of the substances involved. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of MRI to detect, localize and characterize changes in magnetic properties that may occur when certain alloys have been exposed to a thermomechanical stress. For this purpose, stainless steel 304 L wires were drawn to induce a change from paramagnetic austenitic into ferromagnetic martensitic microstructure. The changes in magnetic behavior were quantified by analyzing the geometric distortion in spin echo and the geometric distortion and intravoxel dephasing in gradient echo images at 0.5, 1.5 and 3 T. The results of both imaging strategies were in agreement and in accordance with independent measurements with a vibrating sample magnetometer. Drawing wire to 2% of its cross-sectional area was found to increase the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic martensite from 0.3% to 80% and to enhance the magnetization up to two or three orders of magnitude. The results demonstrate the potential of MRI to locate and quantify stress-induced changes in the magnetic properties of alloys in a completely noninvasive and nondestructive way.

### Consensus document for the diagnosis of peripheral bone infection in adults: a joint paper by the EANM, EBJIS, and ESR (with ESCMID endorsement) [^812859c9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

10 Non-contrast MRI has high diagnostic performance in detecting peripheral bone infection.

Level of evidence: 2

MRI has several advantages in the evaluation of peripheral bone infection. Not only it is able to evaluate infection of the bony component with high diagnostic performance, but it can also detect the presence and evaluate the extent of associated soft tissues abnormalities, such as muscular involvement or abscess formation. Non-contrast MRI has a sensitivity between 88 and 98%, a specificity between 70 and 96%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 81–86% in the diagnosis of peripheral osteomyelitis. Apart from detecting bone infection, MRI can also optimally differentiate other conditions which clinically mimic infection including primary benign and malignant bone tumors, with the exception of cortical bone lesions (e.g. osteoid osteoma).
11 Intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents does not increase the diagnostic performance of MRI in peripheral bone infection

Level of evidence: 2

Intravenous gadolinium-based contrast administration may help to better define the presence and extent of soft tissue abscesses in acute peripheral bone infection but it does not improve diagnostic performance. It may also help avoid overstaging by better differentiating osteomyelitis from surrounding edema.

12 The presence of a metallic implant/fixation device is not a contraindication to perform MRI in patients with suspected peripheral bone infection.

Level of evidence: 5

The presence of a metallic implant or metallic fixation device does not represent a contraindication to MRI. Traditionally, metallic implants were considered as potentially limiting the outcome of a MRI examination due to the high amount of susceptibility artifacts that could be generated by the metal itself. More recently, the advent of implants made with less ferromagnetic alloys and technical advancements of MR sequences (metal artifact reduction sequences [MARS], slice encoding for metal artifact correction [SEMAC], and multi-acquisition with variable-resonance image combination [MAVRIC]) made MRI fully feasible in patients with joint implants, with artifacts mostly limited to the area of the implant itself. However, some limitations to prosthesis geometry persist, affecting the assessment of the joint–prosthesis interface, and no papers are available on the topic; but this statement is made based on evidence published for joint prosthesis, a field with comparable issues.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^8fe30b0e]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and purpose

Magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images are degraded in the presence of metallic implants. We investigate whether SEMAC (Slice Encoding for Metal Artifact Correction) MR is advantageous for radiotherapy (RT) planning.

Methods

Conventional and SEMAC MR protocols were compared (1.5 T). A spine fixation device suspended in gelatine, two patients with spine fixation devices and six patients with bilateral hip replacements were scanned with both conventional and SEMAC protocols. In spine patients the visibility of the spinal canal and spinal cord was assessed; in prostate patients, the visibility of the prostate, pelvic structures and the pelvic girdle.

Results

The signal loss volume surrounding the spine fixation device was reduced by approximately 20% when the SEMAC protocol was employed, and registration errors were reduced. For spine patients, the spinal canal was completely visible only using the SEMAC protocol. In hip replacement patients, metal artifacts were local; the signal loss extended to the internal surface of the acetabulum in eight implants with conventional protocols, but only in four using SEMAC.

Conclusions

SEMAC MR contributes towards correct co-registration of MR and CT images for RT planning, and is particularly relevant when the TV or OARs are close to implants.

### Imaging near titanium total hip arthroplasty at 0.55 T compared with 3 T [^ae42dac2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Orthopedic metallic implants improve quality of life and increase mobility and possibly longevity. They are commonly used to treat damage or deformity to joints, bones, or cartilage. Total joint arthroplasty (knee and hip) and spinal fusion are among the most common procedures. In the United States (US) alone, from 2012 to 2021, there were approximately 2.5 million joint replacement surgeries. However, minor and major complications can occur after surgery, with reported rates varying from 2.7% to 4.2% for total hip arthroplasty (THA),5.6% for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and 4.6% for spinal implants. Accurate non‐invasive imaging with sufficient soft‐tissue contrast is an essential tool for the evaluation of the cause of complications and in surgical decision‐making and planning.

MRI offers an essential non‐invasive imaging tool to provide soft tissue contrast to evaluate the tissues near these metallic implants. However, artifacts occur because of off‐resonance, which is caused by magnetic susceptibility differences between tissues and implants and is proportional to the field strength and magnetic susceptibility of the metal composition. These are significant at conventional MRI field strengths of 1.5 and 3 T. Multi‐spectral imaging (MSI) techniques such as slice encoding for metal artifact correction (SEMAC), multi‐acquisition variable resonance image combination (MAVRIC), and multi‐acquisition with variable resonance image combination selective (MAVRIC‐SL)are commonly used to reduce the artifacts. These MSI techniques correct artifacts by resolving the location of off‐resonance spins with extra encoding dimension and knowledge of the spectral and spatial excitation profile. A larger number of extra encoding steps are required for larger off‐resonance, which also increases scan time.

### FDA identifies no harmful effects to date with brain… [^1453c73f]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Safety Announcement 5-22-2017] A U. S. Food and Drug Administration review to date has not identified adverse health effects from gadolinium retained in the brain after the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. All GBCAs may be associated with some gadolinium retention in the brain and other body tissues. Our recommendations for health care professionals and patients remain unchanged from July 2015 when we informed the public that we were investigating this potential risk with GBCAs. As is appropriate when considering the use of any medical imaging agent. health care professionals should limit GBCA use to circumstances in which additional information provided by the contrast agent is necessary, and assess the necessity of repetitive MRIs with GBCAs. Patients, parents, and caregivers should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about the use of GBCAs with MRIs.

Retention of gadolinium affects only GBCAs, and does not apply to other types of scanning agents used for other imaging procedures, such as those that are iodine-based or radioisotopes. GBCAs contain gadolinium, a type of heavy metal, that is linked to a carrier molecule. MRIs are a way to scan the body for problems such as cancer, infections, or bleeding. GBCAs are injected into a vein to enhance the quality of the MRI images of internal organs, blood vessels, and tissues, which helps health care professionals diagnose medical conditions. There are two types of GBCAs based on their chemical structures.

### Artifacts in spine magnetic resonance imaging due to different intervertebral test spacers: an in vitro evaluation of magnesium versus titanium and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers as biomaterials [^aea64c1e]. Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intervertebral spacers are made of different materials, which can affect the postfusion magnetic imaging (MRI) scans. Susceptibility artifacts especially for metallic implants can decrease the image quality. This study aimed to determine whether magnesium as a lightweight and biocompatible metal is suitable as a biomaterial for spinal implants based on its MRI artifacting behavior.

Materials and Methods

To compare artifacting behaviors, we implanted into one porcine cadaveric spine different test spacers made of magnesium, titanium, and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP). All test spacers were scanned using two T1-TSE MRI sequences. The artifact dimensions were traced on all scans and statistically analyzed.

Results

The total artifact volume and median artifact area of the titanium spacers were statistically significantly larger than magnesium spacers (p < 0.001), while magnesium and CFRP spacers produced almost identical artifacting behaviors (p > 0.05).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that spinal implants made with magnesium alloys will behave more like CFRP devices in MRI scans. Given its osseoconductive potential as a metal, implant alloys made with magnesium would combine the advantages to the two principal spacer materials currently used but without their limitations, at least in terms of MRI artifacting.

### Metal artifact reduction in cardiovascular MRI for accurate myocardial scar assessment in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices [^39a09009]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. An important application of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI is accurate assessment of myocardial scar before ablation. However, this is often limited in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) because of metal device-induced artifacts. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a modified wideband inversion recovery (IR) LGE MRI technique decreases artifact volume to allow the assessment of myocardial scar. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty patients (17 women and 33 men; mean age ± SD, 61 ± 12 years; mean ejection fraction ± SD, 35.9% ± 13.3%) with CIEDs underwent cardiac MRI using conventional and modified wideband IR LGE techniques before ablation. The volume of device-induced artifact was quantified and stratified by tertiles on mild, moderate, and severe. Ordinal logistic regression analysis assessed the association between artifact volume on conventional and wideband images adjusted for patients' demographics. RESULTS. Conventional LGE MRI resulted in device-induced hyperintense artifacts that obscured ventricular segments in 32 of 50 (64%) cases. Wideband LGE MRI significantly reduced severe artifact volume (p < 0.0001) and completely resolved all mild and most moderate artifacts. Overall, wideband techniques resulted in a 56% reduction in total artifact volume for the cohort (p < 0.0001). The wideband LGE MRI sequence minimized artifacts in the most commonly obscured segments on the conventional LGE MRI sequence, with persistent artifacts in seven, eight, and four of 32 cases at the basal anterior, midventricular anterior, and midventricular anteroseptal segments, respectively. CONCLUSION. The modified wideband IR technique completely resolves mild and moderate device-induced hyperintense artifacts and significantly reduces the volume of severe artifact to allow accurate identification of myocardial scar in patients with CIEDs before ablation.

### Hexagonal undersampling for faster MRI near metallic implants [^30888ae6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Slice encoding for metal artifact correction acquires a three-dimensional image of each excited slice with view-angle tilting to reduce slice and readout direction artifacts respectively, but requires additional imaging time. The purpose of this study was to provide a technique for faster imaging around metallic implants by undersampling k-space.

Methods

Assuming that areas of slice distortion are localized, hexagonal sampling can reduce imaging time by 50% compared with conventional scans. This work demonstrates this technique by comparisons of fully sampled images with undersampled images, either from simulations from fully acquired data or from data actually undersampled during acquisition, in patients and phantoms. Hexagonal sampling is also shown to be compatible with parallel imaging and partial Fourier acquisitions. Image quality was evaluated using a structural similarity (SSIM) index.

Results

Images acquired with hexagonal undersampling had no visible difference in artifact suppression from fully sampled images. The SSIM index indicated high similarity to fully sampled images in all cases.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates the ability to reduce scan time by undersampling without compromising image quality.

### Optimization of metal artefact reduction (MAR) sequences for MRI of total hip prostheses [^890448df]. Clinical Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the relative contribution of matrix size and bandwidth to artefact reduction in order to define optimal sequence parameters for metal artefact reduction (MAR) sequences for MRI of total hip prostheses.

Methods and Materials

A phantom was created using a Charnley total hip replacement. Mid-coronal T1-weighted (echo time 12ms, repetition time 400ms) images through the prosthesis were acquired with increasing bandwidths (150, 300, 454, 592, and 781Hz/pixel) and increasing matrixes of 128, 256, 384, 512, 640, and 768 pixels square. Signal loss from the prosthesis and susceptibility artefact was segmented using an automated tool.

Results

Over 90% of the achievable reduction in artefacts was obtained with matrixes of 256x256 or greater and a receiver bandwidth of approximately 400Hz/pixel or greater. Thereafter increasing the receiver bandwidth or matrix had little impact on reducing susceptibility artefacts. Increasing the bandwidth produced a relative fall in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of between 49 and 56% for a given matrix, but, in practice, the image quality was still satisfactory even with the highest bandwidth and largest matrix sizes. The acquisition time increased linearly with increasing matrix parameters.

Conclusion

Over 90% of the achievable metal artefact reduction can be realized with mid-range matrices and receiver bandwidths on a clinical 1.5T system. The loss of SNR from increasing receiver bandwidth, is preferable to long acquisition times, and therefore, should be the main tool for reducing metal artefact.

### Magnetic particle imaging: artifact-free metallic stent lumen imaging in a phantom study [^f8092d5e]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To illustrate the potential of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) for stent lumen imaging in comparison with clinical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Materials and Methods

Imaging of eight tracer-filled, stented vessel phantoms and a tracer-filled, non-stented reference phantom for each diameter was performed on a preclinical MPI scanner: eight commercially available coronary stents of different dimensions (diameter: 3–4 mm; length: 11–38 mm) and materials (stainless steel, platinum-chromium) were implanted into silicone vessel phantoms. For comparison, all vessel phantoms were also visualized by MRI and CT. Two radiologists assessed the images regarding stent-induced artifacts using a 5-point grading scale.

Results

The visualization of all stented vessel phantoms was achieved without stent-induced artifacts with MPI. In contrast, MRI and CT images revealed multiform stent-induced artifacts.

Conclusion

Given its clinical introduction, MPI has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of MRI and CT concerning the visualization of the stent lumen.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^860a66f5]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This work presents significant evidence of distortion in conventional FSE MRI around spine fixation devices and hip replacements; signal loss and signal pile up were present in all FSE examinations (test object and clinical). Signal loss, signal pile up and distortion were reduced when the SEMAC FSE protocols were introduced, but not completely eliminated. Our work is in agreement with previous reports: Månsson et al. employed SEMAC factors up to 18 in fairly long data acquisitions (up to 18 min) and some metal artifacts still remain, while Sutter et al. employed SEMAC factor 12and Reichter et al. SEMAC factor up to 15to similar results. In contrast, our work investigated practical FSE SEMAC protocols, suited to RT planning examinations: the data acquisition was limited to 6 min, with SEMAC factor 6, and the protocol was designed not to introduce additional blurring, as the ability to visualise OAR and TV in MR images could not be compromised. All other approaches to metal artifact reduction also involve some compromise between many competing requirements. At a basic level, imaging with higher gradients (i.e. increasing the readout and excitation bandwidth) will make susceptibility-related field inhomogeneity less relevant and will lead to some reduction on metal-induced artifacts, but at the price of a lower SNR and higher power deposition. View-angle tilting (VAT) on its own may reduce in-plane distortions but introduces some blurring, which can be reduced in longer acquisitions with multiple readouts. Reports on metal artifact reduction techniques which attempt to encode and resolve through-plane displacement in 2Dand 3D, present superior results, but the gradual reduction in signal loss and artifacts is associated with longer acquisitions, with some residual effects. Therefore the trade-off between longer data acquisitions and the presence of metal-induced artefacts justifies our approach of considering practical SEMAC protocols which could be used clinically, in acquisitions of up to 6 min.

### ACR-SPR-SSR practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee [^a5a6e087]. SPR/ACR/SSR (2025). High credibility.

Knee MRI indications and clinical scenarios — MRI of the knee may be indicated to further clarify and stage conditions diagnosed clinically and/or suggested by other imaging modalities, including arthritides (inflammatory, infectious, neuropathic, degenerative, crystal-induced, posttraumatic), primary and secondary bone and soft-tissue tumors, and fractures and dislocations. MRI of the knee may be useful to evaluate specific clinical scenarios, including prolonged, refractory, or unexplained knee pain; acute knee trauma; mechanical knee symptoms (catching, differentiating a stiff versus a locked knee with fixed extension block, painful range of motion, snapping, crepitus); patellofemoral instability with malalignment or maltracking; tibiofemoral instability or malalignment; swelling, palpable enlargement, mass, or atrophy; patients for whom diagnostic or therapeutic arthroscopy is planned; and patients with recurrent, residual, or new symptoms following knee surgery. Additional listed uses include evaluation of the knee following arthroscopy (meniscal repair, partial meniscectomy, ligament reconstruction/repair) and selected complications following knee arthroplasty using appropriate metal artifact reduction strategies. Conditions in which intravenous (IV) contrast may be useful and conditions in which intra-articular contrast (performed by direct intra-articular injection or indirect joint opacification following IV administration) may be useful are specified.

### Fast fourier-based simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI applied to metal object localization [^6dad09bd]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Fast Simulation

We implemented the FFT‐based fast simulation as described in the Theory section, referred to as FORECAST (Fourier‐based off‐resonance artifact simulation in the steady state) 16. We published the MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) source code for FORECAST on the MATLAB File Exchange.

To validate the fast simulation methodology, we created a phantom of a titanium cylinder (length, 86 mm; diameter, 24 mm; magnetic susceptibility, χ = 181 ppm) placed in agar gel. The phantom was scanned with a fast 3D spoiled gradient echo scan with non–slice‐selective excitation using the following parameters: matrix = 256 × 256 × 96; isotropic resolution = 1 mm; echo time/pulse repetition time (TE/TR) = 3.2/6.9 ms; flip angle = 30°; feet–head readout direction; readout bandwidth = ∼57 kHz; excitation bandwidth = ∼6.8 KHz; scan time = 2 min, 13 s) at a field strength of 1.5T (Philips Achieva, Best, Netherlands). To test the accuracy of the simulated artifacts under varying conditions, we rotated the phantom in the coronal plane with angles of approximately 0°, 45°, and 90° relative to. Furthermore, we varied scan parameters that directly influence artifact size and shape: 1) the echo time was doubled to 6.4 ms (TR = 11.2 ms); 2) the readout bandwidth was doubled to ∼114 kHz (TE/TR = 2.1/4.7 ms); and 3) the readout direction was changed to the left‐right axis.

### Pediatric central nervous system cancers, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^5d5cf968]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) of the brain — MRI scans are used more often than CT scans for brain and spine imaging because they are more detailed and do not use radiation, but CT offers higher sensitivity to dystrophic calcification in neoplasms, provides greater detail of bone structures, has a shorter acquisition time, and sedation is generally not needed; limitations include limited soft tissue contrast, limited evaluation of metastatic disease, and metal-caused streak artifacts. CT of the brain (without contrast or with and without contrast) is ideal for rapid assessment in the acute or immediate postoperative setting and for the evaluation of acute intracranial hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, and shunt-related issues. CT is recommended when MRI is not available or in patients in whom an MRI is contraindicated because of unsafe implants or foreign bodies; however, CT is not recommended for staging and response evaluation for high-grade glioma unless in the very rare cases where MRI is not feasible. On CT, pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas typically present as heterogeneous lesions with mass effect, poorly defined margins, and variable areas of hyperattenuation, which may reflect hemorrhage, necrosis, or surrounding edema.

### Postoperative MRI of the ankle and foot [^77657973]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Many surgical procedures and operations are used to treat ankle and foot disorders. Radiography is the first-line imaging for postoperative surveillance and evaluation of pain and dysfunction. Computed tomography scans and MR imaging are used for further evaluation. MR imaging is the most accurate test for soft tissues assessments. MR imaging protocol adjustments include basic and advanced metal artifact reduction. We chose a surgical approach to select the common types of procedures and discuss the normal and abnormal postoperative MR imaging appearances, highlighting potential complications. This article reviews commonly used surgical techniques and their normal and abnormal MR imaging appearances.

### Metal artifact reduction sequence MRI abnormalities in asymptomatic patients with a ceramic-on-polyethylene total hip replacement [^234e1ace]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly utilized screening modality in patients with a metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip replacement. The prevalence of clinically important fluid collections may be overestimated since these collections have been reported to occur in asymptomatic patients with MoM and other bearing surfaces. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and types of MRI-documented adverse local tissue reactions in asymptomatic patients with a ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) total hip replacement.

Methods

Forty-four patients (50 hips) with a minimum 2-year follow-up after total hip arthroplasty with CoP implants and a Harris hip score of > 90 were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria were the absence of hip pain and the availability of appropriate follow-up radiographs. All patients underwent a metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) MRI scan to determine the presence of fluid collections in asymptomatic patients with a CoP bearing surface.

Results

Fluid collections were observed in 9 (18%) of 50 asymptomatic hips in this cohort. There were 5 hips with intracapsular synovitis, and 2 of these hips had a thickened synovium. Extra-articular fluid collections with direct intracapsular communication were identified in 4 additional hips. Two of these hips had a thickened synovium. No signs of osteolysis or evidence of adverse local tissue reactions were noted on radiographs at the most recent follow-up.

Conclusions

This study revealed that fluid collections are not uncommon after total hip arthroplasty with CoP implants. Synovial thickening may be present and is more prevalent than has been reported in previous studies involving metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearing surfaces. The clinical importance and natural history of these findings remain unknown.

### Positive contrast visualization of iron oxide-labeled stem cells using inversion-recovery with ON-resonant water suppression (IRON) [^276b7e18]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metallic substances lead to magnetic field distortions that often result in signal voids in the adjacent anatomic structures. Thus, metallic objects and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled cells appear as hypointense artifacts that obscure the underlying anatomy. The ability to illuminate these structures with positive contrast would enhance noninvasive MR tracking of cellular therapeutics. Therefore, an MRI methodology that selectively highlights areas of metallic objects has been developed. Inversion-recovery with ON-resonant water suppression (IRON) employs inversion of the magnetization in conjunction with a spectrally-selective on-resonant saturation prepulse. If imaging is performed after these prepulses, positive signal is obtained from off-resonant protons in close proximity to the metallic objects. The first successful use of IRON to produce positive contrast in areas of metallic spheres and SPIO-labeled stem cells in vitro and in vivo is presented.

### Slice encoding for metal artefact correction in magnetic resonance imaging examinations for radiotherapy planning [^4679b94a]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, the discussion on the effect of the FSE SEMAC on the registration of clinical images takes place without a registration gold standard. Although we believe the SEMAC FSE protocol makes the MR-CT registration more reliable by improving the visualisation of relevant anatomical structures, other factors also affect the outcome. In particular the level of experience of RT personnel and their familiarity with MR metal artifacts is likely to play a role. RT physicists who participated in this project and scrutinised conventional FSE and SEMAC FSE images side by side gained an awareness of the nature of the distortion expected: (i) the signal loss is not symmetric in relation to the implant, (ii) the displacement of signals occurs in the readout direction, and (iii) the selected slice may be warped in the vicinity of the implant. Better understanding is certainly a contributing factor towards a more accurate registration, and the process of comparing images acquired with and without metal artifact reduction techniques side by side highlights the distortions, their origin and their location. In general we found that inexperienced personnel tended to line up CT and MR artifacts, and therefore introduced error to the registration process. Only a much larger study can address issues related to levels of experience required to perform a complex task such as the registration of distorted MR images with CT, also taking into account the CT artifacts. Metal artifacts were present in all conventional MRI examinations, and were still visible in many SEMAC FSE examinations. For this reason automated registration must be treated with caution.

In conclusion, this work shows improvement in geometrical accuracy and reduction of signal loss around common metallic implants using practical SEMAC FSE sequences. This contributes towards more accurate co-registration and fusion of MR and CT images for RT planning, and is particularly relevant when the TV or OARs are very close to metallic implants. For the latter, SEMAC FSE allows more accurate delineation of TVs and OARs.

### Imaging of lumbar spinal surgery complications [^b597d744]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

MR may demonstrate metallic artefacts even when no hardware is placed, arising from tiny metallic drill bit fragments in postoperative beds. Susceptibility artefacts may result in a loss of signal in phase direction by intravoxel dephasing and spatial misregistration in the frequency encoding and slice selection gradient. Specific MR artefacts are related to hardware composition, orientation and shape, MR magnet field strength, and imaging sequence type and parameters. Since artefacts are significantly fewer when the hardware is perpendicular to the magnet, there are fewer artefacts caused by pedicle screws at the L1–L3 levels compared to L4–S1. Spherical implants result in greater artefacts than cylindrical ones. Fast spin echo sequences have fewer artefacts than conventional spin echo or gradient echo sequences. Fat suppression with short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) has fewer artefacts than frequency-selective fat saturation. Artefacts are proportional to the magnet strength, so imaging should be preferentially performed on 1.5-T scanners. However, higher gradient strengths and broader receiver bandwidths with newer coils can offset the greater artefact effect at 3.0 T. For any sequence, artefacts can be minimised by using a small field of view, high-resolution matrix, and thin sections (Fig. 1). Advanced artefact reduction techniques include view angle tilting, slice encoding for metal artefact correction, multi-acquisition variable-resonance image combination, single-point imaging, prepolarised imaging, and dual reversed-gradient acquisitions. View angle tilting corrects for intra-slice (in-plane) distortion and is used in combination with slice encoding for metal artefact correction, which corrects for adjacent slice (through-plane) distortions.

### Improving spatial accuracy of MRI in the presence of metal-induced geometric distortions [^a2cc8b60]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify sequences and protocols for minimal metal-induced geometric distortion (MD) for improved spatial accuracy in MRI.

Materials and Methods

A 3D lattice phantom containing a stainless-steel bracket or a crown-supported titanium implant was scanned using 6 MRI sequences (TSE, SEMAC, CS-SEMAC, SPACE, VIBE, and research sequence MSVAT-SPACE) in a 3T system. MD was assessed at 9360 crossing points as Euclidean distance using a standardized algorithm. MD was analyzed by total MD, affected volume (AV) at various thresholds, and directional dependency. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA.

Results

For the stainless-steel bracket, TSE showed the highest total MD among all sequences (2187 ± 297 mm, P < 0.01) and maximum displacement (> 4 mm), with 467 mL AV at MD > 0.5 mm. CS-SEMAC and SEMAC yielded the lowest MD among all sequences (469 ± 75 mm and 502 ± 154 mm, P < 0.01) and the smallest AV (55 mL and 45 mL) at MD > 0.5 mm. 3D sequences exhibited intermediate performance with no significant difference (MSVAT-SPACE/VIBE/SPACE: 1569 ± 204 mm/1137 ± 71 mm/1513 ± 143 mm; P > 0.08). For the crown-supported titanium implant, all sequences showed reduced MD (< 440 mm) and AV (< 71 mL at MD > 0.5 mm), while VIBE yielded a comparable AV (65 mL) but the highest MD (615 mm). MD was direction-dependent, particularly for the stainless-steel bracket, being highest along frequency-encoding direction (P < 0.002); TSE also showed significantly higher MD in slice direction (P = 0.0071), while distortions in phase direction were consistently lower.

Conclusions

Susceptibility artifact reduction sequences, particularly SEMAC and CS-SEMAC, effectively reduce total-MD by 79% and AV by 90%. Distortion varies by encoding direction and is most severe along the frequency-encoding axis, highlighting the importance of sequence and parameter selection for accurate MRI near metal implants.

### ACR-ASNR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pediatric spine [^2efe4560]. SPR/ASNR/ACR (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric spine MRI — artifact reduction and sequence planning — MRI protocols should be designed to depict structures of clinical interest as clearly as possible, ideally tailored to the specific clinical concern, and imaging sequences should minimize artifacts as much as possible. Techniques to move or reduce artifacts include changing phase and frequency encoding directions to move pulsation artifact, increasing resolution to reduce frequency misregistration, applying saturation bands, flow sensitization for CSF or blood, respiratory compensation, and altering patient/coil position; spatial saturation zones can suppress signal outside the field of view, and when imaging around metal, STIR for fat suppression, high-receiver bandwidth, fat-water separation, or multispectral methods may be helpful, with specialized metal reduction sequences now available. Unsedated pediatric examinations should have their sequence order prioritized to maximize diagnostic information because scan time may be limited by patient cooperativeness.

### Information about soft tissue imaging and metal ion testing… [^d48523eb]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Soft Tissue Imaging
- For some patients, cross-sectional imaging is required to assess and diagnose potential changes in the soft tissues surrounding an implant.
- The benefits and risks of using different types of diagnostic imaging procedures should be considered when determining the most appropriate imaging modality for each patient.
- MoM hip implants can create metal artifacts in some imaging modalities.
- The most utilized methods of imaging soft tissue surrounding MoM hip implants include:

- Magnetic Resonance Imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences
- **Strengths**: MRI uses non-ionizing radiation and offers the best visualization of soft tissues surrounding a MoM hip implant and detection of potential ALTR.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences
- If it is determined that MRI imaging of a MoM hip implant patient is appropriate, the FDA recommends that the orthopaedic surgeon:

- Consult with the radiologist to evaluate the benefits and risks of utilizing MRI with metal artifact reduction;
- Use the available device-specific labeling to help determine appropriate scan sequences; and
- Inform the MRI site that the patient has a MoM hip implant. Metal Ion Testing As described in "Concerns about Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants, " some patients with a metal-on-metal hip implant may have elevated metal ion levels in their bloodstream. These elevated metal ions are predominately cobalt and, chromium, but can also include other metals such as molybdenum and titanium. Depending on the clinical scenario, orthopaedic surgeons may recommend measuring metal ion levels. Who Should Be Tested.

As part of their overall clinical evaluation, orthopaedic surgeons should consider measurements of metal ion levels in symptomatic patients with MoM hip implants. Serial measurements of metal levels in conjunction with clinical dynamics can help optimizing individual patient management.
- The orthopaedic surgeon should consider testing patients with MoM hip implants who develop any symptoms that may indicate that their device may not be functioning properly.
- At the current time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend metal ion testing in patients with MoM hip implants that have none of the signs or symptoms described above and the orthopaedic surgeon feels the hip is functioning properly and has normal radiographs.

### Metal artefact suppression at 3 T MRI: comparison of MAVRIC-SL with conventional fast spin echo sequences in patients with hip joint arthroplasty [^5aaf49e5]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and diagnostic value of a new MRI metal artefact reduction pulse sequence called MAVRIC-SL in a 3 T MRI environment.

Subjects and Methods

Two MAVRIC-SL sequences obtained in 61 patients with symptomatic total hip replacement were compared with standard FSE-STIR sequences optimized for imaging around metal. Artefact size was measured on the slice of greatest extent. Image quality, fat saturation, image distortion, visibility of anatomical structures, and detectability of joint abnormalities were visually assessed and graded on qualitative scales. Differences between MAVRIC-SL and FSE sequences were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Results

MAVRIC-SL sequences at 3 T showed significantly smaller metal artefacts compared to FSE-STIR sequences (p < 0.0001). The general image quality of MAVRIC-SL sequences was reduced with regard to spatial resolution, noise and contrast (p = 0.001), and fat saturation (p < 0.0001). The reduction of artefact size and image distortion significantly improved visualization of joint anatomy (p < 0.0001) and diagnostic confidence regarding implant-associated abnormalities (p = 0.0075 to < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Although the image quality of MAVRIC-SL sequences is limited at 3 T, its clinical application is feasible and provides important additional diagnostic information for the workup of patients with symptomatic hip replacement through substantially reduced metal artefacts.

Key Points

- Metal artefacts compromise imaging of total hip replacement with MRI.
- Metal artefacts are aggravated with 3 Tesla MRI.
- MAVRIC-SL is a technique to suppress metal artefacts.
- MAVRIC-SL effectively reduces metal artefacts at 3 Tesla and improves diagnostic quality.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of total knee arthroplasty [^d1413157]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

Evaluation of painful total knee arthroplasty can be clinically difficult, and traditional imaging techniques such as conventional radiographs, arthrography, and bone scintigraphy are limited by poor contrast resolution and specificity. Traditional magnetic resonance imaging techniques often are nondiagnostic because of significant metal artifact. Forty-one patients (46 knees) had magnetic resonance imaging, tailored to reduce metallic susceptibility artifact, after total knee arthroplasty, and the findings and clinical and surgical followup were reviewed. All studies consistently showed the integrity of the periprosthetic soft tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging findings led to surgical or other therapeutic interventional procedures in 20 patients, and influenced clinical treatment in all patients. Optimized magnetic resonance imaging, in which the metallic artifact is diminished, is a clinically useful adjunct to traditional imaging techniques in evaluation of patients with painful total knee arthroplasty.
