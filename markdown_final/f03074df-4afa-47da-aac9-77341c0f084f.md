## Question

Would you support having me take a fish oil supplement for my Blood Pressure? I'm hoping this may help me wean down to lower dose of Atenelol eventually? And do you have a well sourced brand I can get through Mayo? My wife takes De3 Omega Benefits from PRN. Or do you have a Mayo recommended source.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether taking a fish oil supplement could help lower their blood pressure and potentially allow them to reduce their dose of atenolol, as well as seeking recommendations for reputable brands or sources, particularly those associated with Mayo Clinic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence that omega-3 fatty acids lower blood pressure and whether that effect is clinically meaningful. Then, I should verify whether adding omega-3 can safely replace or reduce a beta-blocker like atenolol and what guidelines say about this. Next, I will check dosing, safety, and drug–nutrient interactions, and finally, I will consider practical brand/source considerations and how to monitor if this is attempted with a clinician's supervision.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude and quality of blood pressure effects from omega-3s. Multiple dose–response meta-analyses of randomized trials show that 2–3 g/day of combined EPA+DHA lowers systolic/diastolic blood pressure by about 2–3/1–2 mm Hg, with a J-shaped curve and a peak around 3 g/day; higher doses generally do not add benefit in most subgroups, though hypertensive and hyperlipidemic patients may show somewhat larger responses, and this is echoed by contemporary guideline statements acknowledging modest BP-lowering from omega-3 intake [^114pu92z] [^116dKFcN] [^112xkYm6] [^114WXm3g].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing atenolol with fish oil. I should confirm what regulators and guidelines say about atenolol's role. The FDA labeling for atenolol and fixed-dose atenolol combinations repeatedly emphasizes that antihypertensive pharmacotherapy reduces stroke and MI events and that many patients require more than one agent; there is no regulatory guidance to substitute omega-3s for atenolol, and no guideline endorses fish oil as a replacement therapy for antihypertensive medication withdrawal [^115GxDkq] [^113f4KhQ] [^1135RfsM] [^113WfUdP]. I should double-check contemporary guidance: lifestyle measures are recommended for all with elevated BP, but when medications are indicated, evidence-based drug therapy should be optimized and titrated to BP targets rather than substituted with supplements [^111EgxZp] [^113mFGxE] [^115H9weL].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic rationale for not substituting. Atenolol lowers BP via beta-1 blockade, reducing heart rate and contractility, and its clinical benefit stems from proven cardiovascular risk reduction with BP lowering. Omega-3s, in contrast, confer only modest BP effects via anti-inflammatory, endothelial, and vasodilatory pathways that overlap with standard therapies, so they are better framed as adjuncts rather than substitutes for antihypertensive drugs, particularly in treated patients where the incremental BP effect is smaller than in untreated populations [^115GxDkq] [^1139HsBM] [^115i2Muh].

> I need to ensure dosing and safety are addressed clearly. The optimal supplemental dose appears to be about 2–3 g/day of combined EPA+DHA; higher doses do not reliably improve BP and may increase adverse effects or bleeding risk in some contexts, and because omega-3s can augment antiplatelet effects, coordination with the prescribing clinician is prudent, especially if aspirin or anticoagulants are used [^114pu92z] [^116dKFcN] [^116fKLEq] [^1141QMgM]. Common gastrointestinal effects are mild; at higher doses, rare atrial fibrillation has been reported in some cardiovascular trials, so monitoring and shared decision-making are important [^11191fRN] [^115FbsgX].

> Next, I should review how to monitor if, despite this, a cautious trial is pursued. If a patient and clinician agree to add omega-3s as an adjunct and consider a beta-blocker taper, it should proceed only with close home BP monitoring and explicit criteria to avoid withdrawal-induced rebound or ischemia; hold on, I should verify beta-blocker taper guidance: the VA/DoD guideline advises tapering over about one week to mitigate rebound, which reinforces that any dose reduction should be clinician-supervised and not driven by supplement use alone [^113WfUdP]. Given that the expected BP reduction from 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA is roughly 2–3 mm Hg, a medication change of that magnitude would be insufficient to justify atenolol dose reduction on its own in most patients [^114pu92z] [^112xkYm6].

> Let me consider source and quality next. I should confirm that Mayo Clinic does not sell or endorse specific omega-3 supplement brands; their approach is typically to recommend diet-first strategies emphasizing fatty fish intake and, when supplements are used, to prefer products with USP verification or equivalent third-party testing for potency and contaminant control, noting that prescription omega-3s are held to higher manufacturing standards than OTC products and may be preferable at therapeutic doses [^1141QMgM] [^11191fRN]. I will now examine practical options: reputable OTC brands often carry USP or NSF certification, and prescription EPA/DHA products exist for hypertriglyceridemia that are manufactured under FDA drug standards; your wife's PRN product is an established brand, but verifying its current third-party certification and EPA/DHA content per capsule remains essential before relying on it for BP goals [^116fKLEq] [^11191fRN].

> But wait, what if the real clinical lever is not replacing atenolol but optimizing overall therapy and lifestyle. I should confirm that guidelines prioritize structured lifestyle measures — DASH or Mediterranean-style patterns, sodium reduction, weight loss, and physical activity — which yield larger and more reliable BP reductions than omega-3 supplements, and that antihypertensive regimens should be tailored to comorbidities and tolerance, with consideration of alternatives if atenolol is not ideal for reasons unrelated to fish oil, such as asthma or diabetes, in collaboration with the treating clinician [^113W72S4] [^115H9weL] [^113mFGxE] [^113WfUdP].

> Bottom line, I should conclude clearly. No, fish oil should not be used to wean or replace atenolol; the evidence shows modest BP-lowering of about 2–3/1–2 mm Hg with 2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA, insufficient to substitute for a beta-blocker, and there is no guideline or regulatory support for such a strategy. If used, omega-3s may be added as an adjunct with attention to dosing, safety, and interactions, while any medication taper should be clinician-directed with careful BP monitoring; choose quality-tested products and prioritize guideline-based lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy to achieve durable BP control [^114pu92z] [^115GxDkq] [^113W72S4] [^1141QMgM].

Fish oil can modestly lower blood pressure, with the best evidence at **2–3 g/day of EPA+DHA** [^114XMvG6], yielding about a 2–3 mm Hg reduction in systolic pressure [^114pu92z] and 1–2 mm Hg in diastolic pressure [^116jnFgX]. This effect is **not sufficient to replace atenolol** or enable dose reduction without risking loss of control [^notfound]. If you use fish oil, choose a high-quality, third-party–tested product with ~1,000–1,200 mg EPA+DHA per softgel, take 2–3 softgels daily with food, and monitor your blood pressure closely. Do not stop or reduce atenolol without your clinician's supervision, as **omega-3s are adjunctive only**.

---

## Evidence for fish oil in blood pressure management

Multiple meta-analyses and RCTs show that omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) can lower blood pressure, but **the effect is modest** and varies by dose, baseline blood pressure, and population [^114XMvG6] [^115dhfjC].

- **Dose–response**: The optimal dose for blood pressure lowering is 2–3 g/day of combined EPA+DHA, with a J-shaped curve; higher doses (> 3 g/day) do not add benefit and may be less effective [^114XMvG6] [^112UrA2W].

- **Magnitude of effect**: At 2–3 g/day, typical reductions are ~2–3 mm Hg systolic and ~1–2 mm Hg diastolic in the general population, with larger effects (~4–5 mm Hg systolic) in hypertensive individuals not on medication [^114XMvG6] [^115dhfjC].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Omega-3s may enhance antihypertensive effects when combined with medications, but they do not replace them [^1139HsBM].

---

## Comparison with atenolol

Atenolol, a beta-blocker, lowers blood pressure by reducing heart rate and cardiac output, with **robust evidence** for cardiovascular risk reduction [^113f4KhQ]. In contrast, omega-3s have a **modest effect** and are not substitutes for atenolol.

| **Parameter** | **Atenolol** | **Fish oil (omega-3)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Beta-blocker; reduces heart rate and cardiac output | Anti-inflammatory; vasodilation; modest BP reduction |
| BP reduction | 10–20 mm Hg systolic | 2–3 mm Hg systolic |
| Cardiovascular benefit | Proven reduction in stroke and MI risk | Modest benefit; not primary antihypertensive |
| Clinical guideline status | First-line therapy for hypertension | Adjunctive; not first-line |

---

## Safety considerations and interactions

Fish oil is **generally safe**, but consider the following:

- **Bleeding risk**: Omega-3s can increase bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, aspirin) [^113PhmqR].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Mild GI upset, nausea, or diarrhea may occur [^115FbsgX].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: High-dose EPA (> 4 g/day) may increase atrial fibrillation risk [^113PhmqR].

- **Drug interactions**: Omega-3s do not have significant interactions with atenolol, but monitor for additive antihypertensive effects.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) recommend omega-3s as adjunctive therapy for hypertension, not as **first-line or replacement therapy**. The AHA supports omega-3s for cardiovascular risk reduction, especially in patients with elevated triglycerides or high cardiovascular risk, but not as a substitute for antihypertensive medications [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations for fish oil supplementation

If you decide to use fish oil alongside atenolol, follow these practical recommendations:

- **Dose**: 2–3 g/day of combined EPA+DHA, typically 2–3 softgels daily with meals [^114XMvG6].

- **Formulation**: Choose high-quality, third-party–tested products (e.g. USP, IFOS) to ensure purity and potency [^1141QMgM].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor blood pressure and adjust atenolol only under medical supervision [^notfound].

- **Diet**: Incorporate fatty fish (e.g. salmon, mackerel) 2–3 times weekly as part of a heart-healthy diet [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical advice

Fish oil can modestly lower blood pressure and may be used as adjunctive therapy, but **it is not a substitute for atenolol**. Do not stop or reduce atenolol without consulting your clinician, as omega-3s alone cannot maintain adequate blood pressure control. If you use fish oil, choose a high-quality product, adhere to the recommended dose, and monitor your blood pressure closely.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114okxnz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

We are not the first to propose a nonlinear model for the dose‐response of fish oil intake on the BP effect. The J‐shaped dose‐response effects have been tentatively proposed in prospective cohort studies and clinical trial meta‐analyses. For example, summarized data of 6 selected independent prospective cohort studies indicated that there was also a J‐shaped association between the increment of ω3 PUFA intake and risk of hypertension within the low dose range of 0 g/d to 2 g/d. A nonlinear negative and L‐shaped association between ω3 PUFA intake and the risk of hypertension was later proposed, with a dose at ≈3.4 g/d reaching the maximal BP risk‐lowering effect in a cross‐sectional study. In these 2 reports, an apparent J‐shaped relationship between ω3 PUFA intake and hypertension risk was indicated with restricted cubic splines, a finding that is supported in our dose‐response analysis examining changes in BP.

Our findings of a curvilinear relationship between BP effects and fish oil intake may have considerable implications in the cardioprotection of ω3 PUFAs. Given the moderate dose at 3 g/d, as shown in our dose‐response relationship, both a fish oil diet or supplementation resulted in a decrease in BP ≈2 mm Hg to 3 mm Hg in overall and most stratified effects. In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority recommended that an intake of EPA and DHA of ≈3 g/d was required to bring out the claimed hypotensive effects. Our findings seem to support this suggested daily dosage. Moreover, we found associations among both hypertensive and nonhypertensive groups, suggesting that ω3 PUFAs intake could be beneficial for controlling BP even before the onset of hypertension. This means that the intake of ω3 PUFAs could have implications on a person's future risk of stroke, ischemic heart disease, and all‐cause mortality.

Discussion

Using a new 1‐stage strategy, we examined the strength and shape of the dose‐response association between DHA+EPA intake and BP with up‐to‐date literature and multiple subgroup analyses. We found evidence of a J‐shaped dose‐response curve, where the greatest reductions of SBP and DBP occurred at moderate DHA+EPA doses between 2 g/d and 3 g/d. These findings were slightly stronger in studies where the average participant age was ≥ 45 years for SBP. We also found evidence of a stronger, approximately linear dose‐response relationship among hyperlipidemic and hypertensive populations, suggesting that this is a population that could be more responsive to the beneficial impacts of ω3 PUFA intake on reductions in BP. Moreover, our data also demonstrated that ω3 PUFA intake above the recommended intake of 3 g/d was not associated with additional benefits, particularly in normotensive subgroups.

Our findings are different from other meta‐analyses that examined the relationship between ω3 PUFA intake and changes in BP among RCT studies. Previous meta‐analyses assumed a linear function. These studies found that BP reductions were not associated with DHA+EPA intake within a dose range of 0.2 g/d to 15 g/d. Morris et alattempted to test a dose‐response effect with a meta‐regression model with varying doses from 2 g/d to 6 g/d. They proposed a linear dose‐response effect among the hypertensive studies, but the absence of doses between 7 g/d and 15 g/d seemed to put disproportionately more weight on the trial that used a dosage of 15 g/d. Similar to our study, Campbell et allater demonstrated that the BP‐lowering effect was diminished with the increasing dose between 1 g/d and 6 g/d. Another effort was made a decade later by categorizing the ω3 PUFA intake. The stratum of 3 g/d to 4 g/d exerted the strongest effect of −3.85 mm Hg on SBP and −1.86 mm Hg on DBP, respectively, suggesting the existence of a dose threshold. Overall, although they have been unable to smoothly shape the relationship between fish oil intake and BP over the entire range of exposure, these studies suggested a nonlinear association and sparked further investigations. Our study builds on past evidence by examining the relationship using up‐to‐date literature, and novel methods that allow for the estimation of a nonlinear trend that accounts for the correlation between studies.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114XMvG6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current evidence might support the use of omega‐3 fatty acids (preferably docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) for lowering blood pressure (BP), but the strength and shape of the dose‐response relationship remains unclear.

Methods and Results

This study included randomized controlled trials published before May 7, 2021, that involved participants aged ≥ 18 years, and examined an association between omega‐3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, or both) and BP. A random‐effects 1‐stage cubic spline regression model was used to predict the average dose‐response association between daily omega‐3 fatty acid intake and changes in BP. We also conducted stratified analyses to examine differences by prespecified subgroups. Seventy‐one trials were included, involving 4973 individuals with a combined docosahexaenoic acid+eicosapentaenoic acid dose of 2.8 g/d (interquartile range, 1.3 g/d to 3.6 g/d). A nonlinear association was found overall or in most subgroups, depicted as J‐shaped dose‐response curves. The optimal intake in both systolic BP and diastolic BP reductions (mm Hg) were obtained by moderate doses between 2 g/d (systolic BP, −2.61 [95% CI, −3.57 to −1.65]; diastolic BP, −1.64 [95% CI, −2.29 to −0.99]) and 3 g/d (systolic BP, −2.61 [95% CI, −3.52 to −1.69]; diastolic BP, −1.80 [95% CI, −2.38 to −1.23]). Subgroup studies revealed stronger and approximately linear dose‐response relations among hypertensive, hyperlipidemic, and older populations.

Conclusions

This dose‐response meta‐analysis demonstrates that the optimal combined intake of omega‐3 fatty acids for BP lowering is likely between 2 g/d and 3 g/d. Doses of omega‐3 fatty acid intake above the recommended 3 g/d may be associated with additional benefits in lowering BP among groups at high risk for cardiovascular diseases.

The benefits of marine omega-3s on blood pressure

Fish oil supplementation has been found to reduce blood pressure and normalise the hypercoagulable state in patients who are obese, hypertensive and dyslipidaemic. Fish oil leads to a similar reduction in blood pressure in both patients without diabetics (−12.7 mm Hg/−7.9 mm Hg; baseline blood pressure 158.7/80.8 mm Hg down to 146/72.9 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and patients with diabetic hypertension (–15.7/−7.6 mm Hg; baseline blood pressure 157.6/83.2 mm Hg going down to 141.9/75.6 mm Hg, p < 0.001). Thus, fish oil can reduce blood pressure by 12/7 mm Hg or more, making marine omega-3 supplementation an extremely potent antihypertensive especially in certain patient populations. Moreover, fish oil reduces platelet aggregation in non-diabetics (4.2% vs 12.1%, p < 0.001). Patients with diabetes may need larger dose of omega-3s compared with patients without diabetics in order to improve their hypercoagulable state. The same may apply to patients with metabolic syndrome.

In one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, fish oil (containing 2 g of omega-3s) significantly improved endothelial function in normoglycemic offspring of type 2 diabetics. Fish oil also reduced markers of inflammation (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, high sensitivity-C-reactive protein, vascular cell adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule and E-selectin) and tended to improve adiponectin levels. Since the offspring of type 2 diabetics generally have endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation, this patient population may particularly benefit from supplementing with the EPA and DHA. Considering that endothelial dysfunction is thought to be one of the initial steps in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, marine omega-3s may also be useful for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. In summary, the endothelium becomes healthier when the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes supplement with fish oil. This may be due to a reduction in inflammation.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: are these the missing link to explain the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease? [^116jnFgX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

ω3AND

The hypotensive effect of ω3 PUFAs has been well characterized across multiple trials and previous meta‐analyses. However, the findings on the dose–response relationship and linearity of dose and BP‐lowering effect have been conflicting. Zhang and colleagues, in this new meta‐analysis (including 71 studies involving 4973 individuals), have addressed previous shortcomings by applying a random‐effects 1‐stage cubic spline regression model to delineate the dose–response relationship between DHA/EPA and BP‐lowering, and have identified an optimal dose of 2 to 3 g/d. More importantly, they have demonstrated a significantly stronger and increased BP‐lowering effect in higher cardiovascular risk groups, such as those with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. They report an impressive BP reduction in normotensive individuals of −2.61 systolic BP (SBP)/−1.8 mm Hg diastolic BP with a dose of 3 g/d.

The clinical significance of this 2.6‐mm Hg reduction on a population level is likely to be significant. A 2‐mm Hg reduction in SBP is estimated to reduce stroke mortality by 10% and deaths from ischemic heart disease by 7%. Expressed another way, an analysis in the US population using 2010 data estimates that a population‐wide reduction in SBP of 2 mm Hg in those aged 45 to 64 years would translate to 30 045 fewer cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure).

Interestingly, in this new analysis, the effect on BP lowering was more marked in participants with a baseline diagnosis of untreated hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg). In this subpopulation, the reduction in SBP was also maximal at 3 g/d and greater than that seen in normotensive individuals at −4.54 mm Hg SBP. Although this effect is substantially lower than that achieved with standard pharmacological monotherapies for hypertension, these are clinically relevant reductions.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116d4v5e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

Although a large body of literature has been devoted to examining the relationship between eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA+DHA) and blood pressure, past systematic reviews have been hampered by narrow inclusion criteria and a limited scope of analytical subgroups. In addition, no meta-analysis to date has captured the substantial volume of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the past 2 years. The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of EPA+DHA, without upper dose limits and including food sources, on blood pressure in RCTs.

METHODS

Random-effects meta-analyses were used to generate weighted group mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between the EPA+DHA group and the placebo group. Analyses were conducted for subgroups defined by key subject or study characteristics.

RESULTS

Seventy RCTs were included. Compared with placebo, EPA+DHA provision reduced systolic blood pressure (−1.52mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (CI) = −2.25 to −0.79) and diastolic blood pressure (0.99mm Hg; 95% CI = 1.54 to0.44) in the meta-analyses of all studies combined. The strongest effects of EPA+DHA were observed among untreated hypertensive subjects (systolic blood pressure = 4.51mm Hg, 95% CI = 6.12 to2.83; diastolic blood pressure = 3.05mm Hg, 95% CI = 4.35 to1.74), although blood pressure also was lowered among normotensive subjects (systolic blood pressure = 1.25mm Hg, 95% CI = 2.05 to0.46; diastolic blood pressure = 0.62mm Hg, 95% CI = 1.22 to0.02).

CONCLUSIONS

Overall, available evidence from RCTs indicates that provision of EPA+DHA reduces systolic blood pressure, while provision of ≥ 2 grams reduces diastolic blood pressure.

Key action statement 20 — at the time of diagnosis of elevated BP or HTN in a child or adolescent, clinicians should provide advice on the DASH diet and recommend moderate to vigorous physical activity at least 3 to 5 days per week (30–60 minutes per session) to help reduce BP (grade C, weak recommendation).

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone (Tenoretic) [^1153GcYH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TENORETIC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol and chlorthalidone.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination drug is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed dose combination represents the dose appropriate to the individual patient's needs, it may be more convenient than the separate components.

Summary of dietary supplements in children — evidence overview: Evidence on the health effects of dietary supplements in children is limited. Short-term replacement of dietary fat with plant stanol ester in healthy children ages 2–6 years was safe and was associated with significantly decreased TC and LDL–C levels. In children ages 3–5 years, supplemental calcium did not reduce gain in fat mass when baseline intake of calcium was adequate in one study. Maternal fish oil supplementation during lactation in healthy infants was not associated with any differences in children's BP at age 2.5 years in one study.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111ME6dQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for the conduct of meta‐analysis of randomized trials and a checklist was attached (Table S1). The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. This meta‐analysis was performed with the previously published trials. Therefore, ethical review or institutional review board approval was not applicable.

Literature Review

A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published before May 7, 2021, using PubMed and Embase databases (Table S2). Manual searches were undertaken to screen the reference lists of relevant studies, reviews, and meta‐analyses for additional studies. Two reviewers (X.Z. and X.L.) screened each study independently and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The prespecified eligibility criteria were parallel or crossover RCTs that examined the association between intake of DHA/EPA (combined or individual) and systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) in adults (aged ≥ 18 years). Studies were eligible if they examined intake of DHA/EPA through diet or fatty oil supplementation. We excluded trials in which: (1) concurrent inactive placebo controls were lacking; (2) intervention duration was < 4 weeks; (3) a washout period of < 4 weeks was applied between treatments in crossover trials; (4) patients with hypertension received concurrent BP‐lowering medications; and (5) studies were conducted in pregnant and nursing women, or individuals with preexisting cardiovascular events (eg, those with myocardial infarction or heart failure), renal diseases, or secondary hypertension. Assessment of the methodological quality was performed independently using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool 2.

Data Extraction

For each eligible study, information was extracted independently by 2 of the authors (N.Z. and X.Z.) and confirmed by a third author (X.L.) using a standardized form. The effects of each dose of exposure were extracted individually in our study. In experiments with multiple follow‐up time points, only changes in SBP and DBP levels at the end of the treatment versus pretreatment were extracted, avoiding multiple measurements from the same trial. If an SD was not provided directly, we calculated it from the SE, interquartile range, or CI.

### Pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and hypertension [^115Dso8x]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia (raised blood pressure and proteinuria) complicates 2–8% of pregnancies, and raises morbidity and mortality in the mother and child. Pre-eclampsia is more common in women with multiple pregnancy and in those who have conditions associates with microvascular disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of preventive interventions in women at risk of pre-eclampsia? What are the effects of interventions in women who develop mild-moderate hypertension during pregnancy? What are the effects of interventions in women who develop severe pre-eclampsia or very high blood pressure during pregnancy? What is the best choice of anticonvulsant for women with eclampsia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 53 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anticonvulsants, antihypertensive drugs, antioxidants, antiplatelet drugs, atenolol, bed rest, hospital admission or day care, calcium supplementation, choice of analgesia during labour, early delivery (interventionist care), evening primrose oil, fish oil, glyceryl trinitrate, magnesium supplementation, plasma volume expansion, and salt restriction.

Reported biological actions of EPA and DHA extend well beyond TG lowering and include effects expected to be cardioprotective. 48, 54, 55, 56, 57 As summarized by Mozaffarian and Rimm, 46 and shown in Figure 1, fish oil omega‐3 PUFAs have been linked with reduced blood pressure and heart rate, as well as decreased platelet aggregation. 40, 58, 59, 60, 61 They have also been linked with anti‐inflammatory actions and stabilization of coronary plaque. 62, 63, 64, 65 Anti‐dysrhythmic actions have been observed in animal or cell models, but their significance in humans is controversial. 40 As shown in Figure 1, some of the observed cardioprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs require comparatively high doses of EPA/DHA; for example, lowering of diastolic blood pressure seems to require doses of ≥ 2 g per day, 59 and antithrombotic effects appear to require even higher doses. 66 It is plausible that other biological effects of omega‐3 PUFAs — such as contributions to the mediation of inflammation 67, 68 — may contribute to improvements in CV endpoints, although those relationships need extensive additional testing.

### Atenolol (Tenormin) [^113f4KhQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Hypertension

TENORMIN is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116WoxVW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

We recognize that there are some potential limitations to the conclusion that can be drawn from the current studies. The intrinsically significant variations among original trials, such as the device of BP measurement (automatic versus manual), the year of study (conducted 1987–2020), and the type of intervention (diet versus supplementation) are likely to bring some uncertainty to our results and potentially weaken the conclusion. Although we attempted to examine the influence of these factors on our overall findings in subgroup analyses, we acknowledge it is not possible to account for this heterogeneity directly in our analyses. Future research could benefit from examining a more biologically relevant exposure, such as the use of the absorbed DHA/EPA amount as the active exposure levels, use of standardized BP methods to ensure strict quality control, and further examination of how intervention type may influence the relationship. There are several other limitations. First, the absence of doses between 7 g/d and 15 g/d increases the uncertainty in the effect estimates at higher doses. However, the removal of these extreme data points did not strongly change our trends in overall and stratified effects. Second, we did not perform analyses based on the binary outcomes to predict the risk ratio because of the limited studies retrieved. Third, the mechanism of these J‐shaped relationships is not clear. The appearance of the response plateau might reflect a saturating status of fatty acid incorporation into the cell membrane. The change point towards possibly increasing BP may indicate the enhanced α‐adrenergic vasoconstrictionor disrupted ion exchanges. Nevertheless, attention should be focused on the selection of optimal fish oil intake in the management of hypertension. Finally, because of the few available studies, we could not assess the impact of DHA+EPA on changes in BP by sex, DHA‐ or EPA‐only, or diet‐only effects. Future studies should further investigate these issues.

### Nonpharmacologic management of hypertension: what works? [^114eXbjQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most common conditions encountered in primary care. Nonpharmacologic strategies have been shown to help lower blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications are recommended for all patients with hypertension. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle management guideline recommends a diet emphasizing vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; limiting sodium intake to less than 2,400 mg per day; and exercising three or four times per week for an average of 40 minutes per session. Other nonpharmacologic strategies include weight loss, tobacco cessation, decreased alcohol consumption, biofeedback, and self-measured blood pressure monitoring. For patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the use of continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to improve blood pressure. Dietary supplements such as garlic, cocoa, vitamin C, coenzyme Q10, omega-3 fatty acids, and magnesium have been suggested for lowering blood pressure, but evidence is lacking.

Methods

This systematic review has been carried out following the methodology of Cochrane systematic reviews and addressed the requirements stated in preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocols guidelines. Details methodology including the development of search strategy, dual-screening process, dual-data extraction, dual appraisal of included articles for quality assessment, narrative synthesis, and meta-analysis has been described in the published protocol. A comprehensive search strategy was developed using the key words such as Exercise, "Physical activity", "Weight loss", "Sodium restriction", "Dietary potassium", "Calcium supplementation", "Fish oil supplementation", Lifestyle, Hypertension, "Blood pressure" to search different electronic bibliographic database including Embase, MEDLINE through Pubmed, Web of Science, Clinical Trials. gov. the Cochrane Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus etc. The search period covered from 1990 to 2016. Randomized control trials providing nonpharmacological intervention on normotensive adult population in LMICs were included. Both the screening of "title and abstract" and "full text" of the retrieved articles were conducted independently by two reviewers and any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. Reference management software was used to keep track of the screening process. Each of the studies was appraised critically for assessment of risk of bias (ROB). A narrative synthesis of the characteristics of study participants and types of intervention with specific outcome was demonstrated. Mean and standard deviation of both systolic and diastolic BP were recorded from baseline and endline information. For meta-analysis, a random effect model was chosen with 95% confidence interval and both the chi squared and I 2 statistic were measured. The systematic review is registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Registration number is CRD42017055423.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164pd4x]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although a large body of literature has been devoted to examining the relationship between eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA+DHA) and blood pressure, past systematic reviews have been hampered by narrow inclusion criteria and a limited scope of analytical subgroups. In addition, no meta-analysis to date has captured the substantial volume of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the past 2 years. The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of EPA+DHA, without upper dose limits and including food sources, on blood pressure in RCTs.

Methods

Random-effects meta-analyses were used to generate weighted group mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between the EPA+DHA group and the placebo group. Analyses were conducted for subgroups defined by key subject or study characteristics.

Results

Seventy RCTs were included. Compared with placebo, EPA+DHA provision reduced systolic blood pressure (-1.52 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.25 to -0.79) and diastolic blood pressure (-0.99 mm Hg; 95% CI = -1.54 to -0.44) in the meta-analyses of all studies combined. The strongest effects of EPA+DHA were observed among untreated hypertensive subjects (systolic blood pressure = -4.51 mm Hg, 95% CI = -6.12 to -2.83; diastolic blood pressure = -3.05 mm Hg, 95% CI = -4.35 to - 1.74), although blood pressure also was lowered among normotensive subjects (systolic blood pressure = -1.25 mm Hg, 95% CI = -2.05 to -0.46; diastolic blood pressure = -0.62 mm Hg, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.02).

Conclusions

Overall, available evidence from RCTs indicates that provision of EPA+DHA reduces systolic blood pressure, while provision of ≥ 2 grams reduces diastolic blood pressure.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and blood pressure [^116Kf2ZX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

High dose fish oil supplementation reduces blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients. The current study examines how modest variations in omega-3 fatty acid intake may affect BP in a healthy community sample.

Methods

Study participants included 265 Pittsburgh-area adults 30–54 years of age (11% black, 51% female) not taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements or antihypertensive medications. Standardized assessments of clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP, and pulse rate were obtained. Docosahexanenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in fasting serum phospholipids were measured by capillary gas chromatography. Regression analyses controlled for age, gender, race, body mass index (BMI), self-reported sodium intake, and physical activity.

Results

Participants included 181(68%) normotensives, 66 (25%) prehypertensives, and 18 (7%) persons with untreated hypertension. DHA was inversely associated with clinic diastolic (β = -0.121, P = 0.03), awake ambulatory diastolic BP (β = -0.164, P = 0.004), and 24-h diastolic BP (β = -0.135, P = 0.02). A two standard deviation greater DHA was associated with 2.1 mm Hg lower clinic and 2.3 mm Hg lower awake ambulatory diastolic BP. In addition, DHA was inversely associated with pulse rate measured at rest in the clinic. EPA was related to clinic pulse rate but not clinic or ambulatory BP.

Conclusion

In this sample of American adults not on antihypertensive medications, a modest, inverse association was found between DHA exposure and both clinic and ambulatory diastolic BP. Therefore, increasing DHA consumption through diet modification rather than large dose supplementation represents a candidate strategy for future studies of hypertension prevention.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114SH2Uo]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Thirty-one percent of Americans are hypertensive, 30% are prehypertensive, and approximately 20% are hypertensive yet unaware of their status. Only 47% of those with hypertension are adequately controlled. Prior research shows that diet and lifestyle modifications, including physical activity, sodium reduction, and fish oil supplementation, can reduce blood pressure (BP), enhance antihypertensive drug efficacy, and decrease cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

The active ingredients in fish oil considered responsible for its antihypertensive effect are the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3). Although previous meta-analyses of fish oil supplementation and BP have been published, none have been designed with inclusion criteria sufficient to examine the extensive scope of literature available in this active area of investigation. For example, the most recently published meta-analysis excluded trials that examined food sources of EPA and DHA (herein referred to as EPA+DHA) and those that were less than 8 weeks in duration. Therefore, our main objective was to update the state of the science by conducting the most comprehensive meta-analysis of its kind of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined EPA+DHA in relation to BP.

Overall Dose‐Response Analysis

The Table summarizes the impact of combined doses of DHA+EPA at 1 g/d, 2 g/d, 3 g/d, 4 g/d, and 5 g/d on average changes in BP, compared with the placebo or control group (combined dose = 0 g/d). We found a significant nonlinear dose‐response relationship for both SBP and DBP models (Figure 2) (= 3.87 [P = 0.0001] and z = 2.68 [P = 0.0073], respectively). The J‐shaped curves suggest that dosages of DHA+EPA at 2 g/d to 3 g/d are associated with the strongest changes in both SBP and DBP relative to the reference dose (0 g/d). The estimated average dose‐response curves and corresponding CIs also indicate that the dose region of apparent improvement for SBP and DBP is from 0 g/d to 5 g/d. When compared with the reference (0 g/d), the average mean changes in SBP were −2.61 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.57 to −1.65) for 2 g/d of DHA+EPA, and −2.61 mm Hg (95% CI, −3.52 to −1.69) for 3 g/d of DHA+EPA. The average mean changes in DBP were −1.64 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.29 to −0.99) for 2 g/d of DHA+EPA, and −1.80 mm Hg (95% CI, −2.38 to −1.23) for 3 g/d of DHA+EPA (Table). In both SBP and DBP models, combined doses > 3 g/d were associated with weaker or null changes in BP (Table). The width of the CIs was wider at exposure levels > 6 g/d for both SBP and DBP. Only 2 trials, examined a dose > 7 g/d (specifically, at 15 g/d). Removal of these 2 trials did not change the shape of the dose‐response curve, despite the narrower CIs (Figure S2).

METHODS

Literature review

A comprehensive literature search was conducted by the University of Colorado Denver Health Science Library using Ovid/Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A PubMed search was performed in February 2013 to identify any publications not yet indexed by Ovid/Medline. Literature searches covered studies published from 1946 through February 2013 and published in all languages. Level 1 screening included review of all titles and/or abstracts. Full-text publications of any studies not eliminated at level 1 were retrieved for complete review at level 2 screening. Supplementary literature searches included examining the reference lists of all relevant studies, pertinent review articles, and meta-analyses.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Included studies were RCTs that examined the effect of EPA+DHA on BP in nonhospitalized adults (aged ≥ 18 years). Eligible outcomes were systolic and diastolic BP values (SBP and DBP, respectively). The exclusion criteria in this review were as follows:

Hypertensive subjects treated with BP-lowering medications;
Less than 3-week treatment duration;
Crossover RCTs with less than a 4-week washout period between treatments;
Studies that did not specify the amount of EPA+DHA provided or without required data to be used meta-analytically (all authors of otherwise eligible studies were contacted for missing data); and
Studies conducted in populations not representative of the general adult population, including pregnant and nursing women and individuals with preexisting CVD or significant disease process (e.g. renal disease or cancer) or secondary hypertension.

Data extraction and quality assessment

The following qualitative and quantitative information was extracted from all RCTs: publication year, population demographic characteristics, geographic location, baseline hypertensive status, other relevant baseline health characteristics, medication use, sample size, the specific dose of EPA+DHA, the type of food or supplement, outcome assessment method, and means and SDs for BP outcomes.

### Atenolol [^115GxDkq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension

Atenolol tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Atenolol tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: are these the missing link to explain the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease? [^1139HsBM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

However, in this meta‐analysis, Zhang et al excluded clinical trials in which patients were receiving concurrent BP‐lowering medications. This is important for understanding these apparently greater reductions, because previous reports suggest that the BP reduction may be attenuated if they also included participants who were on treatment. For example, Campbell et alincluded 8 studies of patients with hypertension receiving ω3 PUFA supplements (n = 475), and found that BP was significantly lower in the treatment group, but the reported BP‐lowering extent was only −2.56 mm Hg SBP/1.47 mm Hg diastolic BP, which is much lower than seen in the analysis by Zhang et al. Together, these findings suggest that some of the antihypertensive mechanisms of ω3 PUFAs may overlap with that derived from the existing pharmacological treatments, thereby diminishing beneficial return of ω3 PUFAs when used together with medications, although the additional BP reduction still will be clinically relevant.

Several mechanisms by which ω3 PUFAs reduce BP have been previously described. One of the major such mechanisms is the reduction of oxidative stress that elevates BP by reducing circulating levels of vasodilatory mediators such as endothelial nitric oxide. In animal models, PUFAs reduce oxidative stress by downregulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, suppression of the xanthine oxidase pathway, and activation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.ω3 PUFAs can also serve as the substrate for the synt46hesis of both classic oxylipins such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes as well as other oxylipins termed specialized preresolving mediators. Several of these oxylipins have also been described to have antioxidant effects. Although these effects may explain some of the BP‐reducing effects of ω3 PUFAs, similar antioxidative effects have also been described for drugs targeting the renin–angiotensin system.

In addition to these antioxidant effects, ω3 PUFAs, when incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes, have multiple effects that modulate a wide range of cellular functions including that of ion channels and receptors. For example, in blood vessels, DHA modulates calcium signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells enhancing vasodilation, and within the kidney, EPA regulates the epithelial sodium channel, leading to enhanced sodium excretion. However, both of these effects are also achieved by calcium channel blockers and diuretics, respectively.

Thus, although ω3 PUFAs reduce BP by multiple mechanisms, their effect is both modest and overlaps with existing therapies.

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) — dosage and lipid effects: Therapeutic dosages (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) might lower ASCVD event risk, including in patients with elevated TG or elevated TG plus low HDL-C; in JELIS, participants with TG ≥ 150 mg/dL plus HDL-C < 40 mg/dL had a larger reduction in CV events with EPA ethyl esters 1.8 g/day (53%) than the overall sample (19%). For TG lowering, intakes of 2.0 to 4.0 g/day are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) effects, whereas there is little evidence of clinically relevant efficacy at dosages < 1 g/day; recommended intakes of 200 to 500 mg/day lower TG by 3.1% to 7.9%, and higher intakes of 2.0 to 4.0 g/day lower TG by 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with very high TG (≥ 500 mg/dL), with greater percentage reductions at higher baseline TG in a non-linear fashion.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Table 12 — Lifestyle and dietary interventions to lower blood pressure in adults specify goals and approximate mean changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP). Weight loss aims for sustained ≥ 5% reduction in body weight or ≥ 3 kg/m^2 reduction in BMI, with an expected about 1 mm Hg reduction for every 1-kg reduction in body weight, and shows −6 to −8 mm Hg with hypertension and −3 to −5 mm Hg without. A heart-healthy diet using the DASH eating pattern emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy with reduced saturated and total fat, with −5 to −8 mm Hg with hypertension and −3 to −7 mm Hg without. Sodium restriction targets an optimal goal < 2300 mg/d and an ideal limit < 1500 mg/d, with −6 to −8 mm Hg with hypertension and −1 to −4 mm Hg without. Enhanced potassium intake targets 3500–5000 mg/d or moderate-dose pharmacological supplementation (< 80 mmol), with −6 mm Hg with hypertension and −3 to −6 mm Hg without. Values are labeled as approximate mean SBP changes and should not be compared directly for comparative effectiveness.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^1135RfsM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Atenolol and chlorthalidone tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol and chlorthalidone.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination drug is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed dose combination represents the dose appropriate to the individual patient's needs, it may be more convenient than the separate components.

Study Characteristics

After removing duplicates, the systematic search retrieved 3066 relevant articles. The title and abstract review further excluded 2897 articles. Full‐text examination of 169 articles yielded 71 eligible RCTs (references 23 and 24 and references 36 to 104 in the Supplemental Material) that were included in the analyses. A PRISMA flow diagram of the literature screening is shown in Figure 1. Study characteristics of the included trials are shown in Table S3. These trials, published between 1987 and 2020, reported an overall sample size of 4973 participants with an average age between 22 to 86 years. A parallel design was adopted predominantly in 60 trials, and only 11 trials used a crossover design. These trials were conducted in Europe (n = 27), North America (n = 25), Oceania (n = 16), and Asia (n = 3). More than a half of the trials (43 of 71) included both men and women, whereas 25 included only men and 3 included only women. Most trials were restricted to participants without hypertension (n = 56 [79%], average baseline SBP < 140 mm Hg) and without hyperlipidemia (n = 57 [80%], average total cholesterol < 200 mg/dL [5.2 mmol/L] and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L]). In terms of outcome measurement, BP was measured either manually (n = 13), automatically (n = 44), or not reported (n = 14), in ambulatory (n = 5), rest (n = 8), seated (n = 32), supine (n = 12), or unknown (n = 14) modalities. The average intervention duration was 10 weeks (interquartile range, 6–12 weeks) (Figure S1 A), and the duration was longer than 12 weeks (ranging from 12 to 52 weeks) in 29 trials and < 12 weeks in 42 trials. In the majority of studies (n = 64), interventions of supplementation were accomplished by capsuled fish oil, algal oil, or purified fish oil ethyl esters. The remainder of studies (n = 7) used a dietary intervention that included intake of fish meals (eg, mackerel, salmon, trout, and tuna) and other fish oil–fortified foods, either cooked at home or by a dietitian. The most commonly used placebo was olive oil, along with the remainder consisting of types of vegetable oils, such as safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean, and palm oils. Fifty‐three of 71 trials reported the combined effects of DHA and EPA, with an average combined dose of 2.8 g/d (interquartile range, 1.3–3.6; range 0.2–15 g/d) (Figure S1 B), DHA dose of 1.4 g/d (range, 0 to 6 g/d), and EPA dose of 1.8 g/d (range, 0 to 9 g/d); only 11 and 6 trials observed the effects of individual DHA or EPA, respectively.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116dKFcN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conducted a dose‐response meta‐analysis to characterize the effects of DHA+EPA supplementation and dietary enrichment on BP levels using updated literature. This research helps to improve our understanding of the moderate effects of omega‐3 fatty acids on BP reduction. The use of the new model suggests that an optimal dose of 3 g/d in overall and subgroup analyses may yield the greatest BP‐lowering performance. The seemingly J‐shaped associations between DHA+EPA dose and BP reduction in many subgroups might help reform preventive strategies for reducing cardiovascular risks in the general adult population. However, individuals who are at high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, such as those with hypertension, may be more responsive to the beneficial impacts of ω3 PUFA intake on reductions in BP.

### Primary prevention of CVD: treating hypertension [^117NWuSK]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension (persistent diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater and systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater) affects 20% of the world's adult population, and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, and retinopathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different antihypertensive drugs for people with hypertension? What are the effects of dietary modification for people with hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: a low-salt diet, antihypertensive drugs, calcium supplements, fish oil supplements, magnesium supplements, and potassium supplements.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^1139DfV6]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The potential for AEs related to n-3 supplementation in older adults appear mild-moderate at worst, and not of clinical importance. No reports of SAE including bleeding, stroke or bruising were observed. Non-SAE related to GI disturbances were the most commonly reported however these were infrequent and not significantly different when compared against the placebo group. However this review also highlights that well-documented data describing the potential for SAE following n-3 supplementation are limited nor adequately reported to draw definitive conclusions concerning the safety associated with n-3 supplementation. Although these results suggest that a low-moderate intake of EPA/DHA appear safe and acceptable for use in otherwise healthy older adults, caution should be applied when administering larger doses until further evidence is positioned. Our review further highlights that a more rigorous and systematic approach for monitoring and recording AE data in clinical settings that involve the use n-3 supplementation is required.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, more specifically with respect to potassium supplementation, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to advise using salt substitutes to replace part of the sodium chloride with potassium chloride to reduce BP and the risk for CVD in adult patients with HTN consuming a high sodium diet (most Europeans).

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1143Z73A]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to calculate weighted group mean differences (postintervention minus preintervention), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and corresponding P values for heterogeneity between the EPA+DHA group and the placebo group. The weight of each study was based on the inverse of the variance, which is a measure that accounts for the sample size in each group. The macro-level models included data on all subjects at all dose levels. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity or between-study variability and to estimate the effect of EPA+DHA according to key study characteristics. Categorical dose–response analyses were performed to discern potential patterns or thresholds of effect. Sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted by evaluating the impact of adding or removing studies based on important study characteristics and outlier status. The relative weight of each study was appreciated for each meta-analysis model to determine the influence that each study had on the overall summary effect. The presence of publication bias was assessed visually by examining a funnel plot measuring the SE as a function of effect size, as well as performing Egger's regression method and the Duval and Tweedie imputation method. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 2.2.046; Biostat, Englewood, NJ).

We also found stronger effects among studies examining study participants with an average age of ≥ 45 years (Table, Figure 5). The negligible departure from linearity between DHA+EPA and reductions in BP appeared to be limited to ≥ 45 years in both SBP and DBP models, while studies in patients with a mean age of < 45 years showed null effects. When examining by study duration, studies conducted < 12 weeks tended to show stronger findings for SBP at 2 g/d to 3 g/d. However, in studies with a duration of ≥ 12 weeks, DHA+EPA intake was found to lower BP in a fashion with a minor departure from linearity across the entire range of doses (Table, Figure S4). In a subgroup analysis stratified by study design (crossover versus parallel), we found slightly stronger effects among studies with a parallel design, in which relatively narrower CIs were estimated (Table, Figure S5).

2.3.6.3. Triglyceride-lowering drugs.

IPE is a purified formulation of EPA that reduces triglycerides and also confers cardiovascular benefits that may be mediated by anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, antioidant, and possibly other mechanisms beyond triglyceride reductions. IPE is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects, increased bleeding, and atrial fibrillation.

Combination EPA/DHA formulations reduce triglycerides levels but do not appear to reduce cardiovascular risk. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal intolerance. Prescription strength formulations of EPA/DHA are preferred because over-the-counter formulations may have impurities; may be contaminated with saturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats; or may not contain consistent quantities of EPA/DHA.

Fibrates may be the most potent triglyceride-lowering class, but these agents are associated with LDL-C increases, and fenofibrate may also increase creatinine. The risk of myopathy is increased when some fibrates are combined with certain statins; gemfibrozil is contraindicated with simvastatin.

Niacin reduces triglycerides and may also modestly reduce LDL-C. Adverse effects include flushing, pruritis, nausea, and glucose increases, as well as possibly increased myopathy when combined with statins. Hepatotoicity may occur, especially in patients taking over-the-counter niacin supplements.

2.3.6.4. Nonsteroidal MRA.

Finerenone is currently the only nonsteroidal MRA available. This agent blocks sodium reabsorption through the mineralocorticoid receptor and also reduces overactivation of this receptor in the kidney, heart, and blood vessels. In clinical trials, it reduced CKD progression, ESKD, HF hospitalization, and other cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD and T2D. It is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. It is not recommended if eGFR is < 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and it is contraindicated in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Lifestyle interventions to reduce raised blood pressure: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^115i2Muh]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To quantify effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for hypertension.

Data Sources

Electronic bibliographic databases from 1998 onwards, existing guidelines, systematic reviews.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

We included randomized, controlled trials with at least 8 weeks' follow-up, comparing lifestyle with control interventions, enrolling adults with blood pressure at least 140/85 mmHg. Primary outcome measures were systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Two independent reviewers selected trials and abstracted data; differences were resolved by discussion.

Results

We categorized trials by type of intervention and used random effects meta-analysis to combine mean differences between endpoint blood pressure in treatment and control groups in 105 trials randomizing 6805 participants. Robust statistically significant effects were found for improved diet, aerobic exercise, alcohol and sodium restriction, and fish oil supplements: mean reductions in systolic blood pressure of 5.0 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1–7.0], 4.6 mmHg (95% CI: 2.0–7.1), 3.8 mmHg (95% CI: 1.4–6.1), 3.6 mmHg (95% CI: 2.5–4.6) and 2.3 mmHg (95% CI: 0.2–4.3), respectively, with corresponding reductions in diastolic blood pressure. Relaxation significantly reduced blood pressure only when compared with non-intervention controls. We found no robust evidence of any important effect on blood pressure of potassium, magnesium or calcium supplements.

Conclusions

Patients with elevated blood pressure should follow a weight-reducing diet, take regular exercise, and restrict alcohol and salt intake. Available evidence does not support relaxation therapies, calcium, magnesium or potassium supplements to reduce blood pressure.

Omega-3 fish oil versus omega-6 vegetable oil

In a 10-week randomised study, 6 g of fish oil per day (5100 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) significantly lowered blood pressure (−4.6/−3.0 mm Hg) in those with previously untreated mild hypertension. This benefit was not found with 6 g of corn oil. Indeed, the blood pressure difference between the fish oil and corn oil groups, after adjusting for other covariates, was −6.4/−2.8 mm Hg in favour of the fish oil. There was also a borderline significant increase in standing arterial pressure after 10 weeks of supplementation with corn oil compared with baseline (+2.00 mm Hg, p = 0.055). Moreover, compared with baseline, the standing blood pressure increased from 143.6/97.8 mm Hg to 144.9/98.9 mm Hg and sitting blood pressure went from 142.8/94.6 to 144/94.4 mm Hg with corn oil supplementation. A diet high in omega-6 can increase the production of vasoconstricting eicosanoids which may promote increases in blood pressure. Thus, more data is needed to understand the effects of omega-6 rich vegetable oils such as corn oil on blood pressure. Box 1 summarises the potential mechanisms implicating linoleic acid from omega-6 vegetable oils and hypertension.

1.1 Hypertension

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children older than one month [see Pediatric Use (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)].

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

EPANED is effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of EPANED and thiazides are approximately additive.

1.2 Heart Failure

EPANED is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients, EPANED increases survival and decreases the frequency of hospitalization.

### Excessive dietary sodium intake and elevated blood pressure: a review of current prevention and management strategies and the emerging role of pharmaconutrigenetics [^114o7MEY]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2018). Medium credibility.

In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has responded to this excessive sodium consumption among the US population through a 2016 Draft Guidance for Industry that outlines short-term (2 years) and longer term (10 years) goals for sodium content reduction in commercially processed and packaged foods. This guidance document recognises the importance of a supportive food environment through engagement with industry to help the US population meet the sodium intake levels recommended in the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Although voluntary, it will be imperative for food companies to recognise the need to reduce sodium levels in their food products in ways that will not compromise the integrity of their products since sodium serves many functions beyond affecting taste, including texture, preservation and microbial safety.

In addition to addressing this issue from the food environment perspective, individuals with high blood pressure can work one-on-one with their dietitians to lower their sodium intake. A commonly prescribed heart-healthy diet for individuals with elevated blood pressure is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Broadly, the DASH diet emphasises the consumption of vegetables, fruits and whole grains while limiting foods high in saturated fat, sugar sweetened beverages and sweets. Low-fat and fat-free dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts and vegetable oils are also emphasised. One of the core recommendations of this diet is to consume less than 2.3 g of sodium each day and further recommends an intake of 1.5 g of sodium each day for better blood pressure control. A major randomised controlled trial studying the effects of the DASH diet in comparison with a control diet high in sodium observed a 7.1 mm Hg drop in blood pressure for non-hypertensive subjects and a 11.5 mm Hg drop in blood pressure for subjects with hypertension. The results of a meta-analysis that included 17 randomised controlled trials indicated that adhering to the DASH diet is associated with reduced blood pressure (6.74 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure and 3.54 mm Hg drop in diastolic pressure). In addition to the DASH diet, sodium reduction, weight loss in overweight an obese individuals, potassium supplementation, limiting alcoholic drinks and increased physical activity are other non-pharmacological interventions that are recommended for US adults with elevated or blood pressure hypertension.NICE guidelines recommend limiting alcoholic consumption and excessive caffeine-rich products, reducing sodium intake, avoiding calcium magnesium or potassium supplementation, smoking cessation, social support organisations that promote healthy lifestyle change, increasing exercise and engaging in relaxation therapies as non-pharmacological approaches to reducing blood pressure.

Although omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements reduce blood pressure (BP), the typical doses cause untoward side effects.

### Safety considerations with omega-3 fatty acid therapy [^1141QMgM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the potential antithrombotic effect of fish oils may theoretically increase the risk for bleeding, which may be a safety concern for individual patients. However, clinical trial evidence has not supported increased bleeding with omega-3 fatty acid intake, even when combined with other agents that might also increase bleeding (such as aspirin and warfarin). Another potential safety concern is the susceptibility of omega-3 fatty acid preparations to undergo oxidation, which contributes to patient intolerance and potential toxicity. Finally, large amounts of fish consumption may result in adverse experiences due to the potential presence of environmental toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and other contaminants. The risks of exposure to environmental toxins and hypervitaminosis with fish consumption are substantially reduced through purification processes used to develop selected concentrated fish oil supplements and prescription preparations. Thus, in choosing which fish oil therapies to recommend, clinicians should be aware of available information to best assess their relative safety, which includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advisory statement regarding fish consumption, the meaning of certain labeling (such as "verification" through the US Pharmacopeia) and the differences in FDA regulatory requirements between nonprescription fish oil supplements and prescription fish oil preparations, and how all of this is important to the optimal treatment of patients.

Exposure and Outcome Assessment

Most studies that examined the effects of omega‐3 fatty acids used a combined supplementation of EPA and DHA. The exposure levels were expressed by DHA+EPA combined or DHA/EPA alone. For intake of DHA/EPA through diet, the exposure level was determined by the fraction of pure DHA/EPA amount over the food consumed daily. For fatty oil supplementation trials, the exposure level was determined by the pure DHA/EPA content as claimed by the researchers or the manufacturers. We determined the net mean difference in BP (ΔBP between) between the exposure levels of each RCT as the difference at the end of the intervention minus the corresponding pretreatment value (ΔBP intragroup).

Publication Bias Assessment

Publication bias was examined visually using funnel plots to assess the SE as a function of effect size, and performing Egger regression test to examine small‐study bias using R metafor functions. We also used the trim‐and‐fill method to estimate the number of potential missing studies caused by publication bias. A leave‐one‐out strategy was applied for sensitivity analyses, where we repeatedly ran the dose‐response analysis to assess the missing study's influence on overall mean BP change.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^114WXm3g]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

As nutrition research evolves, more complexity is realized. Looking beyond traditional macronutrients and micronutrients for health benefits might be important, for example, evidence suggests that cocoa flavanol intake could be beneficial for CVD risk prevention. Further knowledge about how food components interact with each other could help maximize dietary approaches, for example, saturated fat in dairy may be less detrimental to CVD risk than in meat. Evidence suggests that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, lowers BP, heart rate and triglycerides. A recent dose–response meta-analysis suggests that the intake of 2–3 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids has optimal BP-lowering effects and more than 3 g/day might be beneficial for groups at higher risk of CVD. An RCT showed independent additive effects of regular fish meals and weight reduction in people with overweight. Unfortunately, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is below recommended levels in a significant proportion of the population and fish meals should be considered as an alternative to daily meat meals as part of a healthy diet. Emerging data suggest the gut microbiome is an important target for BP regulation, hence diets incorporating probiotics, prebiotics and/or postbiotics are essential. Indeed, this aligns with the relationship between fibre and BP control.

Personalized/precision nutrition approaches are also becoming widely appreciated, whether that be based on individuals' phenotype, genotype or even gut microbiota composition. Arguably they are harder to implement but may prove to be more effective. As the nutrition field advances, there needs to be a clear pathway for these recommendations to policy and clinical practice. We have included below separate sections for major nutritional components.

### Primary prevention of CVD: treating hypertension [^115RD1hC]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension (persistent diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher and systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or higher) affects 20% of the world's adult population, and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, end stage renal disease, and retinopathy.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different antihypertensive drugs for people with hypertension? What are the effects of dietary modification for people with hypertension? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: a low-salt diet, antihypertensives, calcium supplements, fish-oil supplements, magnesium supplements, and potassium supplements.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113PiGHt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega-3 PUFA and plant oils in omega-6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA-rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed-effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate-quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) andstroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low-quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake slightly reduces total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants) and probably slightly decreases triglycerides (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably causes slight weight gain (MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on serious adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via lipid reduction, but increasing PUFA probably slightly increases weight.

### Pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and hypertension [^117JQvcv]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia (raised blood pressure and proteinuria) complicates 2% to 8% of pregnancies, and raises morbidity and mortality in the mother and child. Pre-eclampsia is more common in women with multiple pregnancy and in those who have conditions associated with microvascular disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: what are the effects of preventive interventions in women at risk of pre-eclampsia? What are the effects of interventions in women who develop mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy? What are the effects of interventions in women who develop severe pre-eclampsia or very high blood pressure during pregnancy? What is the best choice of anticonvulsant for women with eclampsia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 69 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anticonvulsants, antihypertensive drugs, antioxidants, antiplatelet drugs, atenolol, bed rest, hospital admission, or day care, calcium supplementation, choice of analgesia during labour, early delivery (interventionist care), evening primrose oil, fish oil, glyceryl trinitrate, magnesium supplementation, plasma volume expansion, and salt restriction.

Figure 2
Dose‐response relationship between changes in blood pressure and combined docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)+eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake.

Marginal average dose‐response curve (solid line) with 95% point‐wise CIs (dashed lines) estimated by a 1‐stage random‐effects restricted cubic spline model, using 0 g/d as the referent. Studies included n = 70 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and n = 69 for diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Subgroup Analyses

For studies including an average baseline SBP of130 mm Hg, we found evidence that DHA+EPA supplementation had an approximately linear trend with BP, where increasing supplementation resulted in stronger reductions in SBP and DBP (Figure 3, Table). This trend was not evident among those with a baseline SBP of < 130 mm Hg, although a similar optimal intake of 2 g/d to 3 g/d as our original findings was found. Similar findings were also seen when stratified by hypertension status (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, as defined in most included trials), where patients with hypertension showed greater reductions in SBP and DBP, compared with those without hypertension (Table, Figure S3). When stratifying by the presence of hyperlipidemia, we found an approximately linear relationship among those with hyperlipidemia for SBP, suggesting that increasing supplementation was associated with greater reductions in SBP. Again, this trend was not evident among those without hyperlipidemia for SBP, but an optimal intake of 2 g/d to 3 g/d could be seen. For DBP, there was also some indication that patients with hyperlipidemia may have greater reductions in DBP at 2 g/d to 3 g/d, compared with those without hyperlipidemia (Table, Figure 4).

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115nRRnT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The subgroup analyses by dose are depicted in Figure 3. There was no clear pattern of dose–response between EPA+DHA and SBP. Significant reductions were observed with doses of 1 to < 2g/d (1.81; 95% CI = 3.59 to0.03) and 3 to < 4g/d (3.85; 95% CI = 5.55 to2.15). No apparent effect on DBP was observed for dose levels < 2g/day, whereas significant reductions were observed for 2 to < 3g/day (1.09; 95% CI = 2.08 to0.11) and 3 to < 4g/day (1.86; 95% CI = 2.67 to1.06).

An examination of potential publication bias indicated a modest proclivity for published studies that found a significant SBP reduction with EPA+DHA provision. There was a slight indication of publication bias with a proclivity for publication of results that showed a significant DBP reduction with EPA+DHA provision, which was modified by study region. Non-US studies were more likely to publish findings showing DBP reduction with EPA+DHA provision, whereas US studies were more likely to publish null findings or an increase in DBP with EPA+DHA provision.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: are these the missing link to explain the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease? [^115AXA9v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Zhang and colleagueshave reported that the intake of omega‐3 (ω3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are associated with a reduction in blood pressure (BP) and identified the optimal dose of 2 to 3 g/d. Although these findings are not entirely novel, they are robust and provide insights into the long‐standing debate on the role of ω3 PUFAs in modifying cardiovascular risk.

The interest in ω3 PUFAs as potential therapeutics for the reduction of cardiovascular risk stemmed from early observational studies demonstrating an association between a marine diet and reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease in Eskimo populations. Subsequently, a significant number of interventional studies examining the effects of purified ω3 PUFAs on cardiovascular risk, and its determinants, including hypertension, have been conducted.

However, despite decades of research, the role of ω3 PUFAs in modifying cardiovascular risk remains controversial, and their usefulness in routine clinical practice is unclear.

Table 12 — Lifestyle and stress-reduction interventions to lower blood pressure — weight loss, heart-healthy diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]), sodium reduction/salt substitute, potassium intake, and alcohol reduction list evidence-based goals and the Approximate Mean Change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mm Hg with and without hypertension. For weight loss (body weight or body mass index [BMI]), goals are "Aim for sustained ≥ 5% reduction in body weight or ≥ 3 kg/m2 reduction in BMI; expect about 1 mm Hg reduction for every 1-kg reduction in body weight", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −5. For a heart-healthy diet (DASH), the goal is to "Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced content of saturated and total fat", with hypertension −5 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −7. For reduced sodium intake, the target is "Optimal goal is < 2300 mg/d, but aim for an ideal limit of < 1500 mg/d", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −1 to −4; using a salt substitute to "Replace cooking/table salt (100% sodium chloride) with salt substitute (25%–30% potassium chloride, 65%–75% sodium chloride, and 0%–10% flavoring agents)" to "Reduce dietary sodium intake as above" yields with hypertension −5 to −7 and without hypertension −5. For enhanced potassium intake, the goal is "Aim for 3500–5000 mg/d, ideally by consumption of a diet rich in potassium; or alternative use of moderate-dose pharmacological potassium supplementation (< 80 mmol)", with hypertension −6 and without hypertension −3 to −6. For reduced alcohol intake, the goal is "Optimal goal is abstinence for all adults for best health outcomes; in patients who consume alcohol, aim for > 50% reduction in daily intake to no more than 2 drinks/d in men or 1 drink/d in women", with hypertension −4 to −6 and without hypertension −3. The table cautions that "these values should not be compared directly to indicate comparative effectiveness".

Marginal average dose‐response curve (solid line) with 95% point‐wise CIs (dashed lines) estimated by a 1‐stage random‐effects restricted cubic spline model, using 0 g/d as the referent, among participants with a mean age ≥ 45 years or < 45 years. n indicates the number of the included study.

We found no strong differences when stratifying by intervention type (diet versus supplementation), sex, and fish oil consumption (natural fish oil versus purified ethyl ester), possibly attributable to few studies that reported relationships for diet, women, and use of ethyl esters (Table, Figures S6 through S8). We retrieved few trials that evaluated DHA (n = 11) or EPA (n = 6) as individual fatty acids. There was insufficient statistical power to detect a meaningful difference between individual EPA and DHA on lowering either SBP or DBP (Table, Figure S9).

Risk of Study Bias and Publication Bias

One and 5 trials were ranked as high and moderate risk of bias, respectively, while the remainder of trials were ranked as low risk of bias (Table S4). Exclusion of moderate and high risk‐of‐bias trials did not appreciably change the shape of the dose‐response curve (results not shown). The funnel plot and Egger regression test indicated asymmetry in the overall SBP model (z = −3.05, P = 0.002). There was no evidence of plot asymmetry in pooled DBP and stratified models (Figures S10 and S11). This suggests that publication bias, if present because of small‐study effects, did not strongly impact our overall findings. The leave‐one‐out sensitivity analyses in 1‐stage regression models proved that overall effects were not driven by a small number of specific trials, but reflected the global effect of the included trials (Figures S12 and S13).

### Dietary fats, blood pressure and artery health [^111TkFi1]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the evidence is unclear whether omega-6 vegetable oils high in linoleic acid increase blood pressure. However, there is some evidence that if linoleic acid is coming from industrial seed oils, there may be an increase in blood pressure as well as cardiovascular disease/mortality. The marine omega-3s EPA and DHA, extra virgin olive oil and possibly the parent omega-3 ALA may reduce the risk hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The antihypertensive effect of DHA may outweigh that of EPA which may due to a greater ability to improve endothelial function and arterial vasodilation.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111WM3rD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Current evidence might support the use of omega-3 fatty acids (preferably docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) for lowering blood pressure (BP), but the strength and shape of the dose-response relationship remains unclear. Methods and Results This study included randomized controlled trials published before May 7, 2021, that involved participants aged ≥ 18 years, and examined an association between omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, or both) and BP. A random-effects 1-stage cubic spline regression model was used to predict the average dose-response association between daily omega-3 fatty acid intake and changes in BP. We also conducted stratified analyses to examine differences by prespecified subgroups. Seventy-one trials were included, involving 4973 individuals with a combined docosahexaenoic acid+eicosapentaenoic acid dose of 2.8 g/d (interquartile range, 1.3 g/d to 3.6 g/d). A nonlinear association was found overall or in most subgroups, depicted as J-shaped dose-response curves. The optimal intake in both systolic BP and diastolic BP reductions (mm Hg) were obtained by moderate doses between 2 g/d (systolic BP, -2.61 [95% CI, -3.57 to -1.65]; diastolic BP, -1.64 [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.99]) and 3 g/d (systolic BP, -2.61 [95% CI, -3.52 to -1.69]; diastolic BP, -1.80 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.23]). Subgroup studies revealed stronger and approximately linear dose-response relations among hypertensive, hyperlipidemic, and older populations. Conclusions This dose-response meta-analysis demonstrates that the optimal combined intake of omega-3 fatty acids for BP lowering is likely between 2 g/d and 3 g/d. Doses of omega-3 fatty acid intake above the recommended 3 g/d may be associated with additional benefits in lowering BP among groups at high risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Dose‐Response Analysis

The placebo dose (0 g/d) was used as the reference for all analyses. A 1‐stage random‐effects dose‐response modelwas performed to predict the average dose‐response relationship between administration of DHA+EPA and changes in SBP and DBP levels. We tested the linearity assumption underlying the dose‐response relationship by fitting a restricted cubic spline model with 3 knots (10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles) of the doses. Included studies were pooled into a continuous dose‐response curve, and then the predicted effect of omega‐3 on BP was estimated from the curve at given doses (ie, 1 g/d, 2 g/d, 3 g/d, 4 g/d, and 5 g/d). Additionally, subgroup analyses were conducted by stratifying studies according to study design (crossover versus parallel), hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), or hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL or triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL) status, intervention (supplementation versus diet), exposure composition (fish oil versus purified ethyl ester), duration of treatment (≥ 12 weeks or not), sex, and average age (≥ 45 years or < 45 years). We also conducted subgroup analyses by baseline SBP (≥ 130 mm Hg versus < 130 mm Hg), according to the new cut point suggested in a recent American Heart Association hypertension guideline. The 1‐stage cubic spline regression model was conducted using the dosresmeta R packages.

Hypertension dietary management — Mediterranean Diet recommendation states: In patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, we suggest considering a dietitian-led Mediterranean Diet as an alternative to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet (Weak for | Not Reviewed, Not Changed). The traditional Mediterranean diet is described as high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, unrefined grains, and olive oil; moderate intake of fish and poultry; low or moderate intake of wine; and low intake of red meat, processed meat, dairy, and sweets. Supporting evidence cited includes the PREDIMED trial in which groups randomized to the Mediterranean diet experienced a significant 28–30% reduction in major cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes), but the PREDIMED trial was subsequently retracted and republished in 2018 due to issues with the randomization process and reported results were similar after these corrections. As this is a Not Reviewed, Not Changed recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review new evidence for this update, confidence in the quality of evidence is low based on evidence put forth in the 2014 VA/DoD HTN CPG, and a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern may be beneficial to patients with HTN.

In the overall meta-analysis model of 93 data points from 70 RCTs, SBP decreased by 1.52mm Hg (95% CI = 2.25 to0.79) and DBP by 0.99mm Hg (95% CI = 1.54 to0.44), compared with placebo, after EPA+DHA provision (Table 3; and). Studies with multiple entries in the meta-analysis models reflect results presented separately by the authors for different subgroups (e.g. low-dose and high-dose EPA+DHA). In the meta-analysis of hypertensive subjects, significant reductions in SBP (4.51mm Hg; 95% CI = 6.12 to2.83) and DBP (3.05mm Hg; 95% CI = 4.35 to1.74) were observed (Figure 2). The meta-analysis of studies among normotensive subjects also found a significant reduction of SBP (1.25mm Hg; 95% CI = 2.05 to0.46) and DBP (0.62mm Hg; 95% CI = 1.22 to0.02) (Table 3). The summary estimates were modified by source of EPA+ DHA and by study region (Table 3). In the meta-analysis of supplement-only studies, SBP decreased by 1.75mm Hg (95% CI = 2.55 to0.94) and DBP by 1.11 (95% CI = 1.72 to0.50) after EPA+DHA provision, compared with placebo. Among US-only studies, reductions of 1.78mm Hg (95% CI = 3.33 to0.23) in SBP and 1.35mm Hg (95% CI = 2.48 to0.21) in DBP were observed. Because relatively few studies evaluated EPA+DHA as individual fatty acids, there was insufficient statistical power to detect a meaningful difference between EPA and DHA separately on lowering either SBP or DBP.

### Nonpharmacologic strategies for managing hypertension [^11734cPm]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends lifestyle modification for all patients with hypertension or prehypertension. Modifications include reducing dietary sodium to less than 2.4 g per day; increasing exercise to at least 30 minutes per day, four days per week; limiting alcohol consumption to two drinks or less per day for men and one drink or less per day for women; following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating plan (high in fruits, vegetables, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; low in fat and salt); and achieving a weight loss goal of 10 lb (4.5 kg) or more. Alternative treatments such as vitamin C, coenzyme Q10, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested for managing hypertension, but evidence for their effectiveness is lacking.

### Omega-3 fatty acids [^111UzR1B]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause mortality in patients with known coronary heart disease. Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, and fish oil are rich sources of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Flaxseed, canola oil, and walnuts also are good dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to being antiarrhythmic, the omega-3 fatty acids are antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory. In contrast, omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in most seeds, vegetable oils, and meat, are prothrombotic and proinflammatory. Omega-3 fatty acids also are used to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are no significant drug interactions with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of two servings of fish per week for persons with no history of coronary heart disease and at least one serving of fish daily for those with known coronary heart disease. Approximately 1 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid is recommended for cardioprotection. Higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids are required to reduce elevated triglyceride levels (2 to 4 g per day) and to reduce morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (at least 3 g per day). Modest decreases in blood pressure occur with significantly higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Guideline: potassium intake for adults and children [^1159hs7e]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, more specifically with respect to potassium supplementation, WHO 2012 guidelines recommend to advise increasing potassium intake from food to reduce BP and risk of CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease in adults.
Consider ensuring potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day in adults.

DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis of RCTs that examined EPA+DHA provision and BP provides the most comprehensive quantitative summary of the evidence to date. Before this meta-analysis, the most recent published meta-analysisexcluded studies < 8 weeks in duration and those that examined food sources of EPA+DHA. By liberalizing the duration restriction to 3 weeks, including RCTs conducted with EPA+DHA–rich and –fortified foods, and capturing recent RCTs published in the past 2 years, our meta-analysis evaluated an additional 53 studies not included by Campbell et al. The considerably larger volume of studies enhanced the statistical power to perform important subgroup analyses by factors such as dose, geographic region, hypertensive status, and source of EPA+DHA.

The results from our analysis demonstrate that EPA+DHA are as effective, and in some cases more effective, than other lifestyle-related interventions, including increasing physical activity and restricting alcohol and sodium, for lowering BP among hypertensive populations not taking antihypertensive medication. These results are consistent with findings from Campbell et al.as well as other earlier meta-analyses. Lowered systemic vascular resistance through changes in endothelial function is considered a primary mechanism by which EPA+DHA may lower BP. Recent systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of RCTs found improved endothelial function in response to EPA+DHA, particularly among patients with risk factors for CVD, including hypertension, but not consistently among healthy young and middle-aged subjects. This observation may explain the greater response of unmedicated hypertensive subjects when compared with normotensive subjects in our meta-analysis.

The reductions in BP observed in this analysis are not only statistically significant but also are clinically meaningful. Among adults, SBP rises by approximately 0.6mm Hg per year; among those aged ≥ 50 years, the lifetime risk of hypertension is 90%. Furthermore, only 1mm Hg SBP separates each stage of hypertension. The statistically significant reduction in SBP of 1.25mm Hg noted among normotensive individuals in our analysis would represent a delay of age-related SBP increase by 2 years and progression from prehypertensive to hypertensive status. The 4.51mm Hg decrease observed among hypertensive populations not taking antihypertensive medication could prevent an individual from requiring medication to control their hypertension or could help maintain an individual in a lower stage of progressive hypertension. Lowered systemic vascular resistance and BP can reduce risk of coronary plaque rupture, stroke, and complications of stroke, including related cognitive decline, thus improving clinical outcomes for higher-risk populations.

### Blood pressure-lowering effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: are these the missing link to explain the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease? [^113PhmqR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The stark difference between the findings of REDUCE‐IT and other contemporary RCTs, particularly STRENGH, which was of a similar design and size, are unexplained and remain the subject of debate. Factors that have been considered are the type of ω3 PUFAs (EPA‐only versus EPA+DHA [both 4 g/day]) and the placebo (mineral oil versus corn oil).

ω3 PUFAs RCT results have been the subject of multiple meta‐analyses over recent years. However, these have suffered from the significant heterogeneity within the field (eg, diet versus supplements, EPA+DHA versus EPA alone, primary versus secondary prevention, dose, eligibility criteria). One recent analysis, by the lead author of REDUCE‐IT, included 38 trials and 149 051 patients. Using a trial‐level, random‐effects model and pooling all doses used, they found ω3 PUFAs reduced cardiovascular mortality (number of RCTs = 25; relative risk, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88–0.98]) but not all‐cause mortality or stroke. They were also associated with a reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events. Effects were stronger with EPA monotherapy (4 trials), and the EPA effect remained after influence analysis removed REDUCE‐IT. With regard to adverse effects, they identified an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and total bleeding on EPA monotherapy. The authors commented that their analysis "provides reassurance about the role of omega‐3 fatty acids, specifically EPA" in the treatment of cardiovascular risk.

Despite the uncertainty generated by discordant RCT results, pooled data suggest a net modest benefit effect of ω3 PUFAs, particularly on cardiovascular mortality in patients at high risk and with raised triglycerides. As described by Zhang et al, the intake of ω3 PUFAs is associated with a BP‐lowering effect, and a dose of 2 to 3 g appears to be optimal. Given the modest effect on triglycerides, this BP‐lowering impact together with their other pleiotropic effects are likely the missing link to explain the cardiovascular risk reduction seen in REDUCE‐ITand subsequent meta‐analyses. However, further RCTs and postmarketing studies are required to resolve the remaining questions, particularly one that was raised by the disparity between REDUCE‐ITand STRENGHof EPA monotherapy versus the combination of EPA and DHA. Therefore, ω3 PUFAs are still not fully ready for prime time, and physicians should keep an open mind on these compounds with acute awareness toward of the mixed evidence base and the potential risks of increased atrial fibrillation and bleeding when prescribing.
