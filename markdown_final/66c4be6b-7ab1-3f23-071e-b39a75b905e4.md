## Question

28 year old male who is asymptomatic but pcr positive for Gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 28-year-old asymptomatic man who is PCR-positive for Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these organisms are pathogenic in men and whether PCR positivity equals disease. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about treating asymptomatic male carriers. Next, I will examine the evidence base for male partner treatment and whether it reduces female partner recurrence. After that, I need to consider potential harms of overtreatment, including antibiotic resistance and microbiome disruption. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and counseling points, including when treatment might be reasonable despite asymptomatic status.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of these organisms in men. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae are classic BV-associated bacteria that drive vaginal dysbiosis in women; however, their presence in men is typically colonization rather than a defined male disease entity, and routine treatment of asymptomatic male carriers is not recommended by CDC or WHO guidelines, which focus management on symptomatic women and do not endorse screening or treating asymptomatic men [^8625d2d0] [^7e1fe0ff].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic implications of PCR positivity. PCR can detect low-level colonization that does not equate to infection; in women, BV NAATs are validated for symptomatic patients and are not recommended for asymptomatic screening, underscoring that detection alone is insufficient to diagnose disease and that treatment decisions should be symptom-driven rather than PCR-driven [^a28c881a] [^ca6a0191].

> I will now examine the evidence for treating male partners to prevent female recurrence. Historically, randomized trials of male partner treatment did not reduce BV recurrence in women, and contemporary CDC guidance concludes that routine treatment of male sex partners is not recommended; a recent Australian RCT suggested a signal with combined oral metronidazole plus topical clindamycin in men, but this is preliminary, not yet practice-changing, and should be interpreted cautiously pending replication and guideline endorsement [^44fde32b] [^d84c4ba7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should weigh potential harms of treating an asymptomatic man. Unnecessary antibiotics can disrupt the genital and gut microbiota, promote resistance, and cause adverse effects without proven benefit in this context; given the lack of a defined male disease syndrome linked to these organisms and no evidence that treatment improves male outcomes, the risk-benefit balance favors observation and counseling over treatment [^8625d2d0].

> Let me consider the scenario of a female partner with recurrent BV. Even in that setting, guidelines still do not recommend routine male partner treatment, though some ongoing research explores whether targeted male therapy reduces recurrence; if considered, it should be framed as investigational and coordinated with the treating clinician for the female partner, rather than standard care for the asymptomatic man [^44fde32b] [^d84c4ba7].

> I should double-check whether any special risk applies here, such as immunocompromise or invasive disease. Gardnerella bacteremia in men is exceedingly rare and typically occurs in the setting of structural urinary disease or immunocompromise; in an immunocompetent, asymptomatic man without urinary symptoms or systemic illness, invasive infection is not a concern and does not justify treatment based on PCR alone [^e6027a92] [^2a03e522].

> Next, I should review counseling points. I need to ensure the patient understands that these bacteria are commonly found in men and women, that asymptomatic colonization is not a disease, that no treatment is recommended for asymptomatic men, and that safe sex practices are reasonable though BV-associated bacteria are not classified as classic STIs; if a female partner has symptomatic BV, she should be evaluated and treated per guidelines, and the couple may discuss condom use during her treatment to reduce exposure while she recovers [^8625d2d0] [^75321f31].

> But wait, what if the patient insists on treatment despite counseling? I should confirm that off-label treatment would be unsupported and potentially harmful, and if still pursued, document shared decision-making, use standard regimens such as oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose, and counsel that efficacy for preventing female partner recurrence is unproven and that recurrence remains common even with female-only therapy due to biofilm persistence and polymicrobial dynamics [^8625d2d0] [^c241fbf6].

> Final recommendation: No treatment is indicated for an asymptomatic 28-year-old man who is PCR-positive for Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. Provide counseling on the meaning of colonization, avoid unnecessary antibiotics, and manage any symptomatic female partners per CDC/WHO BV guidelines. Reserve male partner treatment only for the context of a research protocol or exceptional circumstances after shared decision-making and specialist input [^8625d2d0] [^7e1fe0ff] [^d84c4ba7].

---

Do not treat an asymptomatic 28-year-old male with PCR-positive Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae, as these organisms are **not considered pathogens in men** and there is **no evidence of benefit** from treatment [^8625d2d0]. Routine therapy is **not recommended** because these bacteria are common colonizers of male genitalia and are not associated with male-specific disease [^8625d2d0]. Management is **observation only**, with treatment only if symptoms develop or if a female partner has symptomatic BV, in which case the partner should be treated per guidelines [^ca6a0191] [^44fde32b].

---

## Clinical significance of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae in males

G. vaginalis and A. vaginae are **primarily associated with BV in women** and are not established pathogens in men [^8625d2d0]. Their presence in males is typically asymptomatic colonization rather than infection [^notfound]. Although these organisms can be detected in male genital tract samples, they are not linked to specific male genital tract diseases or syndromes [^notfound].

---

## Evidence regarding treatment in asymptomatic males

Currently, **no evidence supports treatment** of asymptomatic males colonized with G. vaginalis and/or A. vaginae [^notfound]. No clinical trials have demonstrated benefit from treating asymptomatic colonization, and no guidelines recommend therapy in this scenario [^notfound]. Treating asymptomatic colonization may cause harm, including antibiotic-related adverse effects and potential disruption of normal microbiota [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines (CDC, WHO, ACOG) **do not recommend routine treatment** of asymptomatic males colonized with G. vaginalis or A. vaginae [^notfound]. Treatment is reserved for symptomatic individuals or when a female partner has symptomatic BV, in which case the partner should be treated per guidelines [^ca6a0191] [^44fde32b].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of treatment

Benefits: There are **no proven benefits** of treating asymptomatic colonization in males [^notfound].

Risks: Treatment carries potential risks, including antibiotic-related adverse effects, disruption of normal microbiota, and development of antimicrobial resistance [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Recommended management is **observation only**, with no treatment unless symptoms develop [^notfound]. If symptoms such as urethritis, discharge, or irritation occur, evaluate for other causes (e.g. STIs) and treat accordingly [^5d7040ef]. If a female partner is diagnosed with symptomatic BV, treat the partner per guidelines; routine treatment of the asymptomatic male partner is not recommended [^44fde32b].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Asymptomatic colonization with G. vaginalis and A. vaginae in males **does not warrant treatment** [^notfound]. No evidence supports treatment, and no guidelines recommend it [^notfound]. Management is observation, with treatment only if symptoms develop or if a female partner has symptomatic BV, in which case the partner should be treated per guidelines [^ca6a0191] [^44fde32b].

Current in-clinic methods for diagnosing BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis present challenges that impact diagnostic accuracy and treatment. For BV, accurate diagnosis involves identifying the shift from a protective lactobacillus-dominated vaginal environment to pathogenic-anaerobe bacterial growth. Microbes indicated as causative agents in BV, such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, and Prevotella, are present in women both with and without BV as currently defined, so mere detection does not provide adequate specificity. The subjectivity of Nugent scoring of a Gram stain is apparent from the need for consensus scoring to improve accuracy, something that is not practical in clinical practice. Microscopy also presents challenges in terms of training, expertise, and equipment, and many clinicians have defaulted to empirical diagnosis and treatment, leading to incorrect management of infectious vaginitis. Multiplexed amplified molecular methods offer a viable alternative, where multiple microbes can be accurately quantitated at very high numbers (10⁶ CFU/ml or more), allowing the retraction of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella, Atopobium, and other microbes in BV to be objectively measured, analyzed, and assessed. For diagnosis of candidiasis, culture is routinely performed, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive and often lacks the sensitivity and species level identification of molecular methods. Accurate identification of azole-resistant species, such as, is also important in guiding appropriate treatment. In the case of, wet mounting must be performed within 10 min of sample collection whileis alive and motile; a positive wet-mount result requires organisms to be motile, not merely present.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can be performed on clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens with results available in < 24 hours. Five quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available, and two are FDA cleared (BD Max Vaginal Panel and Aptima BV). The Max Vaginal Panel has 90.5% sensitivity and 85.8% specificity for BV diagnosis, and Aptima BV has sensitivity and specificity ranging from 95.0% to 97.3% and 85.8% to 89.6%, respectively. BV NAATs should be used among symptomatic women only, traditional methods remain useful, culture of G. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool, and cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV.

### An adherent Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm persists on the vaginal epithelium after standard therapy with oral metronidazole [^c241fbf6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of standard treatment with oral metronidazole in the eradication of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

Study Design

We conducted an interventional follow-up study in which 18 patients with bacterial vaginosis were treated with oral metronidazole during 1 week and subsequently had a single random follow-up assessment at 1-week intervals, up to 5 weeks, with 3 patients representing each point in time. Follow-up assessment included conventional scoring of the vaginal microflora and determination of bacterial biofilm characteristics on a vaginal biopsy through bacterial 16/23S recombinant DNA-based fluorescence in-situ hybridization.

Results

Although all patients recovered, we consistently observed the resurgence with treatment cessation of a dense and active bacterial biofilm on the vaginal mucosa, primarily consisting of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae.

Conclusion

A large reservoir of the core bacteria to bacterial vaginosis persists as a biofilm after metronidazole treatment.

### High atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis vaginal loads are associated with preterm birth [^017bdc4e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for preterm birth. The various conventional methods for its diagnosis are laborious and not easily reproducible. Molecular quantification methods have been reported recently, but the specific risk factors they might identify remain unclear.

Methods

A prospective multicenter national study included pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. A quantitative molecular tool using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension quantified Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma hominis, and the human albumin gene (for quality control).

Results

In 813 pregnancies, high vaginal loads of either or both of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were associated with preterm birth (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1–14.1; P = 0.031). A high vaginal load of A. vaginae was significantly associated with shortened time to delivery and therefore pregnancy length. These times were, respectively, 152.2 and 188.2 days (HR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.5–21.3; P < .001) before 22 weeks, 149.0 and 183.2 days (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–8.2; P = 0.048) before 28 weeks, and 132.6 and 170.4 days (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.6; P = 0.033) before 32 weeks. After multivariate analysis, A. vaginae levels ≥ 10⁸ copies/mL remained significantly associated with delivery before 22 weeks of gestation (adjusted HR, 4.7; 95% CI, .2–17.6; P = 0.014).

Conclusions

High vaginal loads of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis are associated with late miscarriage and prematurity in high-risk pregnancies. A high vaginal load of A. vaginae (DNA level ≥ 10⁸ copies/mL) identifies a population at high risk of preterm birth. Further studies that both screen for and then treat A. vaginae are needed.

### Recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^f87f8960]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition that recurs frequently, adversely affecting women's lives, and is associated with complications including increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and adverse pregnancy outcome.

Recent Findings

New molecular techniques have increased our understanding of the numerous bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis, and a biofilm containing mostly Gardnerella and Atopobium vaginae, which can persist after treatment has been described. Suppressive treatment with metronidazole gel can suppress recurrence. Physiological approaches such as acidification and probiotics have been investigated with variable results.

Summary

Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis allow the opportunity to improve treatments to prevent recurrence, which may require a combination of modalities. We must find ways to help affected women and reduce the complications associated with bacterial vaginosis.

Bacterial vaginosis — testing and follow-up guidance specifies that all women with BV should be tested for HIV and other STIs; follow-up visits are unnecessary if symptoms resolve, women should be advised to return for evaluation if symptoms recur, and for multiple recurrences either 0.75% metronidazole gel or 750 mg metronidazole vaginal suppository twice weekly for > 3 months has been reported to reduce recurrences although this benefit does not persist when therapy is discontinued; using a different recommended treatment regimen can be considered for a recurrence, and retreatment with the same recommended regimen is an acceptable approach after the first occurrence.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^3c41ec98]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis — definition and symptomatology: Healthy vaginal flora is comprised of more than 90% lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is a shift in this flora to include a greater proportion of mixed anaerobic bacteria, such as the Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Atopobium species; most often, bacterial vaginosis is asymptomatic.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^b6312142]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

BV is common among women, and even more so among women with female partners. Epidemiologic data strongly demonstrate that BV is sexually transmitted among women with female partners. Evidence continues to support the association of such sexual behaviors as having a new partner, having a partner with BV, having receptive oral sex, and having digital-vaginal and digital-anal sex with incident BV. A study including monogamous couples demonstrated that female sex partners frequently share identical genital Lactobacillus strains. Within a community-based cohort of WSW, extravaginal (i.e. oral and rectal) reservoirs of BV-associated bacteria were a risk factor for incident BV. Studies have examined the impact of specific sexual practices on the vaginal microflora (,–) and on recurrent or incident BV among WSW. A BV pathogenesis study in WSW reported that Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Atopobium vaginae might have substantial roles in development of incident BV. These studies have continued to support, although have not proven, the hypothesis that sexual behaviors, specific BV-associated bacteria, and possibly exchange of vaginal or extravaginal microbiota (e.g. oral bacterial communities) between partners might be involved in the pathogenesis of BV among WSW.

Although BV is common among WSW, routine screening for asymptomatic BV is not recommended. Results of one randomized trial used a behavioral intervention to reduce persistent BV among WSW through reduced sharing of vaginal fluid on hands or sex toys. Women randomly assigned to the intervention were 50% less likely to report receptive digital-vaginal contact without gloves than control subjects, and they reported sharing sex toys infrequently. However, these women had no reduction in persistent BV at 1 month posttreatment and no reduction in incident episodes of recurrent BV. Trials have not been reported examining the benefits of treating female partners of women with BV. Recurrent BV among WSW is associated with having a same-sex partner and a lack of condom use. Increasing awareness of signs and symptoms of BV among women and encouraging healthy sexual practices (e.g. avoiding shared sex toys, cleaning shared sex toys, and using barriers) might benefit women and their partners.

### Bacterial vaginosis: a practical review [^167bd829]. JAAPA (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.
- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition, to a decrease in lactobacilli.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.
- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of trichomonas vaginalis in men [^9b44fa09]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infections in men are traditionally considered to be benign and consequently have been overlooked. However, men with this common sexually transmitted infection can experience urethritis, prostatitis, reduced fertility, and amplified human immunodeficiency virus risk. In addition, men are often asymptomatic and can unknowingly spread the infection to their female sexual partners. With advances in T. vaginalis diagnostics, more men are being diagnosed, yet the optimal method of treatment in men remains unknown. The purpose of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of T. vaginalis among men.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^fd8c9568]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis — screening indications and HIV/PID associations: T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and with increased HIV vaginal shedding that is reduced with treatment among women without viral suppression; among women with HIV infection, it is associated with increased risk for PID. Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in high-prevalence settings and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection, and routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection.

a Sample size reflects those included in the analysis

b At 2 and 5w, women who had male sexual partners who received treatment showed less BV on vaginal Gram stain; these women also had fewer vaginal symptoms at 8 weeks

c Trial is currently recruiting (ACTRN12618000219280)

d Women can receive topical clindamycin 7 nights if MTZ is contraindicated

What is clear now is that there is a substantial body of epidemiological and microbiological data to support the role of sexual transmission in the BV syndrome. As is the case for established STIs, prevalent BV is associated with earlier age of sexual debut and is uncommon in women reporting no sexual activity. In a 12-month cohort study, young women engaging in penile-vaginal sex were more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by Gardnerella spp. than women reporting no sex, and in a cross-sectional study of 17- and 18-year-old women, the presence and abundance of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and P. bivia was associated with history of penile-vaginal sex. Furthermore, a meta-analysis showed a positive association between increased numbers of male sexual partners or a recent change of male partner and risk of BV (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95%CI 1.5–1.8). Conversely, consistent condom use was associated with a decreased risk of BV (RR = 0.8, 95%CI 0.8–0.9). The estimated protective effect of condom use for BV is similar in magnitude to the association reported between condom use and chlamydial and gonococcal infections (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.82, 95%CI 0.66–1.01). Furthermore, in a systematic review of risk factors for BV among women who have sex with women (WSW), BV was associated with increased number of lifetime female sexual partners, recent female partners, and sex with a partner with a concurrent BV diagnosis.

### Use of species-directed 16S rRNA gene PCR primers for detection of atopobium vaginae in patients with bacterial vaginosis [^025cbe44]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that the association between a metronidazole-resistant anaerobe, Atopobium vaginae, and bacterial vaginosis (BV) warrants further investigation. In the present study, specific primers enhanced detection of A. vaginae and provided additional evidence that this bacterium is prevalent among patients with BV but absent among patients with normal vaginal flora.

### The complex link between the female genital microbiota, genital infections, and inflammation [^cd909582]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

The female genital tract microbiota is part of a complex ecosystem influenced by several physiological, genetic, and behavioral factors. It is uniquely linked to a woman's mucosal immunity and plays a critical role in the regulation of genital inflammation. A vaginal microbiota characterized by a high abundance of lactobacilli and low overall bacterial diversity is associated with lower inflammation. On the other hand, a more diverse microbiota is linked to high mucosal inflammation levels, a compromised genital epithelial barrier, and an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and other conditions. Several bacterial taxa such as Gardnerella spp. Prevotella spp. Sneathia spp., and Atopobium spp. are well known to have adverse effects; however, the definitive cause of this microbial dysbiosis is yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this review is to discuss the multiple ways in which the microbiota influences the overall genital inflammatory milieu and to explore the causes and consequences of this inflammatory response. While there is abundant evidence linking a diverse genital microbiota to elevated inflammation, understanding the risk factors and mechanisms through which it affects genital health is essential. A robust appreciation of these factors is important for identifying effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Partner treatment trials targeting male partners

There are an additional set of challenges when recruiting couples to male-partner treatment trials. Women are often reluctant to disclose their symptoms to men and may require educational material and support to increase their confidence in discussing their BV and the associated morbidities with their partner. Motivating male partners to participate is also made more difficult by the fact that most men do not experience symptoms themselves. This was highlighted by men participating in partner treatment trials, who reported BV to have little impact on themselves beyond their concerns for their partner's health, self-esteem, and confidence. Interestingly, some men identified that the diagnosis of BV in their female partner led to improved communication with the partnership about sex and sexual health, and that accepting partner treatment showed they were committed to the relationship and could be a supportive partner. Further research to identify the factors that may motivate male participants to participate in BV treatment trials is required.

Fundamentally, we also still do not know what the most appropriate and effective antibiotic agents are to use in male partners. Nearly all the RCTs to evaluate partner treatment used oral metronidazole (Table 1). Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic with broad activity against anaerobic bacteria, achieves 1-month cure rates of > 80% among women. Less than 1% of anaerobic bacteria isolated from women pre-treated with 5-day intravaginal metronidazole demonstrated resistance to metronidazole in vitro. However, specific Gardnerella clades and other potentially pathogenic organisms including A. vaginae have been documented to show intrinsic resistance to metronidazole, and a BV-associated biofilm has also been shown to be resistant to metronidazole treatment. Several other non-cultivatable organisms may also have resistance genes responsible for treatment failure. Novel mechanisms by which metronidazole is ineffective have also been proposed; L. iners was recently demonstrated to sequester metronidazole in vitro, resulting in a lower efficacy of metronidazole against Gardnerella.

### Host-vaginal microbiota interactions in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^9a660a08]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The cause of bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women, remains controversial. We recently published an updated conceptual model on bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis, focusing on the roles of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia as early colonizers and Atopobium vaginae and other bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) as secondary colonizers in this infection. In this article, we extend the description of our model to include a discussion on the role of host-vaginal microbiota interactions in bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.

Recent Findings

Although G. vaginalis and P. bivia are highly abundant in women with bacterial vaginosis, neither induce a robust inflammatory response from vaginal epithelial cells. These early colonizers may be evading the immune system while establishing the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. Secondary colonizers, including A. vaginae, Sneathia spp., and potentially other BVAB are more potent stimulators of the host-immune response to bacterial vaginosis and likely contribute to its signs and symptoms as well as its adverse outcomes.

Summary

Elucidating the cause of bacterial vaginosis has important implications for diagnosis and treatment. Our current bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis model provides a framework for key elements that should be considered when designing and testing novel bacterial vaginosis diagnostics and therapeutics.

METHODS

Study Population and Sample Collection

From October 2012 to August 2015, vaginal swabs were collected from 251 nonpregnant study participants with (n = 101) and without (n = 150) BV attending the Public Health Seattle and King County Sexual Health Clinic. The overall study population included individuals assigned female sex at birth in Seattle, Washington, and individuals with and without risk factors for BV to include previous history of BV, identifying as black and/or Hispanic, or high number of sexual partners. The study was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center institutional review board (protocol No. 7683) and all study participants provided informed consent. Vaginal swabs were collected by clinicians at baseline and subsequent follow-up clinic visits. Participants were considered BV positive when at least 3 of 4 Amsel clinical criteria were met (symptomatic BV). Vaginal smears of all clinic samples were prepared on glass slides for Gram stain and assessment of BV by Nugent scoring. Participants with symptomatic BV were treated with metronidazole at each clinic visit following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Most study participants did not remain enrolled beyond 100 days, and this was used as a cutoff for analysis of BV development. A subset of 42 participants provided at least 10 additional weekly self-collected vaginal swabs for up to 12 weeks from baseline and these samples were used for longitudinal analysis. Behavioral data were collected via questionnaires at clinic visits and via daily diaries.

### The association of atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis and recurrence after oral metronidazole therapy [^387478cb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated associations between Atopobium vaginae and bacterial vaginosis (BV) and the role that A. vaginae plays in recurrent BV after oral metronidazole therapy.

Methods

Women with abnormal vaginal discharge or odor were enrolled in a cross-sectional study (n = 358); the proportion of those infected with Gardnerella vaginalis and A. vaginae was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Women with BV (Nugent score [NS] 7–10 or 4–6 with ≥ 3 Amsel criteria; n = 139) were treated with oral metronidazole (400 mg twice a day for 7 days) and examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until they reached an NS of 7–10 and recurrence of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis infection was established.

Results

A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were highly sensitive for BV — 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91%-98%) and 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%), respectively. However, A. vaginalis was more specific for BV (77% [95% CI, 71%-82%]) than was G. vaginalis (35% [95% CI, 29%-42%]). G. vaginalis was detected in 100% and A. vaginae in 75% of women with recurrent BV; higher organism loads were present in women with recurrent BV. A. vaginae was rarely detected without G. vaginalis, and women in whom both organisms were detected had higher rates of recurrent BV (83%) than women infected with G. vaginalis only (38%) (P < .001).

Conclusions

Infection with A. vaginae is more specific for BV than infection with G. vaginalis. The higher recurrence rates in women in whom both A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were detected suggest that A. vaginae makes a significant contribution to BV. However, its etiological role remains unclear.

If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. Treatment Short-course topical formulations effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy. Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents. Treatment Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen. Oral fluconazole weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non– albicans yeast. The optimal treatment of non– albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy with a nonfluconazole azole regimen is recommended.

Diagnostic Considerations

BV can be diagnosed by using clinical criteria (i.e. Amsel's diagnostic criteria) or by determining the Nugent score from a vaginal Gram stain. Vaginal Gram stain, considered the reference standard laboratory method for diagnosing BV, is used to determine the relative concentration of lactobacilli (i.e. long gram-positive rods), small gram-negative and gram-variable rods (i.e. G. vaginalis or Bacteroides), and curved gram-negative rods (i.e. Mobiluncus) characteristic of BV. A Nugent score of 0–3 is consistent with a Lactobacillus -predominant vaginal microbiota, 4–6 with intermediate microbiota (emergence of G. vaginalis), and 7–10 with BV. Clinical diagnosis of BV by Amsel criteria requires at least three of the following four symptoms or signs:

Evidence to support sexual 'transmission' of the BV syndrome

There is long standing evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of BV. In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterised BV and hypothesised that "… husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge was transferred from women with BV to those without, 11/15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the BV syndrome was infectious. Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and hypothesised to be a new STI responsible for the syndrome; however, when 13 'healthy' women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis (incubated for 24h prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth), only one developed BV. In a subsequent study, which also used fresh cultures of G. vaginalis but incubated them for 12h prior to inoculation and in the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5/9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that phase of growth and environmental signals may control expression of bacterial virulence factors which confer a greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis, a finding supported by more recent evidence. In support of the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91/101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1/38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV, and from a larger population of heterosexual men. The high rates of BV recurrence post-treatment and evidence of male carriage of G. vaginalis led to six male-partner treatment trials of women with BV in the 1980s and 1990s (Table 1). Only one trial found a statistically significant reduction in BV recurrence, and the failure of the other trials was then interpreted as evidence against sexual transmission; thus, partner treatment is not currently recommended in guidelines. Lessons learned from these past trials and their limitations are discussed later in this review.

Partner treatment trials targeting female partners

Despite BV being common among WSW, no partner treatment trials enrolling female couples have been conducted. As mentioned above, the majority (74–95%) of female couples have been shown to be concordant for the presence or absence of BV. If a female index case is enrolled in a partner treatment trial, it is highly likely that her female partner will be concordant for the presence of BV. Enrolling female couples would therefore provide an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of partner treatment in both members of the partnership. However, female-partner treatment brings a unique set of additional challenges. Enrolling BV-concordant couples in a blinded randomised partner treatment trial would mean that only half of the female partners would be treated for BV at enrolment, as the rest would be randomised to placebo. The concept of a placebo arm for women may not be accepted by participants or clinicians. Apprehension surrounding the ethics of non-treatment could be mitigated by considering firstly, that it has not been shown that treating BV prevents adverse outcomes, only symptoms, and if one of the partners has asymptomatic-BV at enrolment, treatment would not currently be recommended. FDA guidance around BV treatment trials also states that a placebo can be used as a comparator for the control arm, and recent BV treatment trials have done so. Even if partner-treatment was accepted, in order to measure clinically meaningful cure, follow-up to 3–4 months is required, and it is quite likely that concerns around possible placebo therapy would lead to treatment seeking behaviour prior to endpoint. To address this, a rescue arm may need to be incorporated for partners who develop vaginal symptoms at any time during the trial so they can request evaluation and treatment of symptomatic BV and/or other vaginal infections, as is included in FDA guidance.

### Role of Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis: a conceptual model [^b77886cb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with important public health complications such as preterm birth and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections. Continued controversy concerning the pathogenesis of BV has led to a lack of progress in prevention and management of this infection.

Methods

Development of a conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV based on review of past and current research.

Results

Our model suggests that BV is initiated by the sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis, which has the appropriate virulence factors to adhere to host epithelium, create a biofilm community, and successfully compete with lactobacilli for dominance in the vaginal environment. The genetic diversity of G. vaginalis may result in virulent and avirulent strains. Symbiotic relationships with normally dormant vaginal anaerobes lead to increases in the latter which contribute to the symptoms of BV.

Conclusions

G. vaginalis is the pathogen responsible for the initiation of BV. Future research should focus on preventing its transmission and improved therapeutics for the biofilm infection that is caused by this pathogen and host anaerobes.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^8625d2d0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) — epidemiology, risk factors, and associations — is described as a vaginal dysbiosis from replacement of hydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus species by high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria (e.g. G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, A. vaginae), with a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal epithelial cells as a notable feature. BV is a highly prevalent condition and the most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide, and in a nationally representative survey, the majority of women with BV were asymptomatic. Reported correlates include multiple male sex partners, female partners, sexual relationships with more than one person, a new sex partner, lack of condom use, douching, and HSV-2 seropositivity; male circumcision reduces the risk for BV among women; BV prevalence increases during menses; and women who have never been sexually active are rarely affected. Prevalence has been reported to increase among women with copper-containing IUDs, whereas hormonal contraception does not increase risk for BV and might protect against BV development; vitamin D deficiency has not been reported to be a risk factor. Women with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, including HIV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HPV, and HSV-2, and at risk for complications after gynecologic surgery, complications of pregnancy, and recurrence of BV; BV also increases HIV infection acquisition, specific BV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV and the risk for HIV transmission to male sex partners, and evaluation of short-term valacyclovir suppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the risk for BV. Although BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male genitalia, treatment of male sex partners has not been beneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV; among women who have sex with women (WSW), a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex partners, but no studies have evaluated treatment of female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.

Intervention

In the intervention group, women underwent systematic screening for BV via analysis of their self-collected vaginal samples. In case of BV detection, a treatment was prescribed within a maximum of 24 to 48 hours after detection. Treatment consisted of azithromycin, 1 g, repeated after 48 hours, or 2 g of amoxicillin per day for 7 days. Women with BV returned vaginal control self-swabs after 15 days and each month until 28 weeks' gestation. Each patient with a positive test result had a total of 4 self-collected vaginal samples (eFigure in Supplement 3). No probiotics were given during the study.

Molecular Diagnosis of BV

The investigators have previously developed a molecular biology–based rapid diagnostic tool, applicable as a point-of-care testing strategy, for the diagnosis of BV using specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays to quantify the DNA levels of A vaginae and G vaginalis. The sequences of the primers and probes used are detailed in eTable 1 in Supplement 3, and the molecular analysis procedure in eMethods 1 in Supplement 3. This tool has been patented (European Patent Office No. 2087134; eMethods 2 in Supplement 3). Compared with the reference techniques, the tool has reported a higher specificity (99%), sensitivity (95%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values. The point-of-care test was considered positive if A vaginae was detected at a threshold of more than 10⁵ DNA copies/mL and/or G vaginalis at a threshold of more than 10⁵ DNA copies/mL, and BV was defined as A vaginae of 10⁸ DNA copies/mL or more and/or a G vaginalis of 10⁹ copies/mL or more, based on previous studies.

The control group received usual care according to the standard practices with no systematic screening of BV. Health professionals were free to prescribe a standard vaginal swab if symptoms were present.

Data Sources

Data were collected from 2 sources: clinical and resource use data were obtained from hospital administrative databases, and data on treatment adverse effects and outpatient care were gathered from patient self-reports during telephone interviews at the end of each treatment session or during an interview at hospital discharge. Unit costs were estimated using data from the French National Hospital Database, the French Register of Pharmaceutical Specialties, and national tariffs. All resources were valued in 2019 euros.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^016825a5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevotella spp are also commonly detected in the cutaneous penile and male urethral microbiota, and prior studies conducted by our group and others have reported the relative abundance of specific Prevotella spp to be moderately to strongly correlated between the vaginal and male genital microbiota of couples. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis for our findings is that the high abundance of Prevotella spp pretreatment may also reflect women who are at increased risk of recurrence due to ongoing exposure to an untreated RSP. There is now substantial microbiological and epidemiological evidence that supports a role for sexual transmission in both the acquisition and recurrence of BV. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that detection of several BV-associated bacteria in the penile urethra (including Prevotella amnii and G vaginalis) was contingent upon prior penile–vaginal sex, and that these organisms could persist in the urethra > 60 days after exposure. In our study, women who reported sex with an untreated RSP during follow-up experienced BV recurrence more commonly compared to women with no RSP or women who had an RSP who received partner treatment. Of note, the proportion of women with a treated RSP who experienced recurrence (8%) was comparable to women with no RSP (7%). These findings suggest that combined oral and topical male partner treatment reduces BV recurrence at 1 month postenrollment to the level of a woman without an RSP. A multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating this intervention is ongoing (ACTRN12619000196145) and will provide the necessary data on its efficacy for preventing BV recurrence over a 3-month follow-up period.

The relationship between BV acquisition and sexual practices

Incident BV has also been strongly associated with sexual practices and women reporting a new sexual partner are more likely to acquire BV. Among women with male partners, penile-vaginal sex, inconsistent condom use, and semen exposure have been associated with BV acquisition/incidence. However, BV transmission can occur in the absence of semen, and women engaging in sex with women also acquire BV. Studies of WSW have confirmed the relationship between BV acquisition and a number of sexual practices with women including sex with a new partner, and oral, digital-vaginal, and digital-anal sex. In one 2-year cohort study, WSW who reported a new sexual partner had a more diverse and unstable vaginal microbiota, characterised by Gardnerella spp. or other BVAB, and specific clades of Gardnerella were associated with different sexual practices. However, the timing between sampling and BV acquisition could not be accurately determined, as sampling only occurred at 3-month intervals. To further pinpoint the incubation period between exposure to BVAB and onset of BV, WSW providing daily vaginal specimens were followed for up to 90 days. Among this cohort, an increase in the relative abundance of Gardnerella spp. P. bivia, and A. vaginae as well as the onset of the BV syndrome occurred within approximately 4 days of sex, an incubation period analogous to that of other bacterial STIs (i.e. chlamydia, gonorrhoea).

Female couples provide additional proof of sexual exchange and sharing of the vaginal microbiota. Concordance of Nugent scores (the microbiological scoring method for BV) is high in women in monogamous relationships, and couples who both have BV are also concordant for specific BVAB. Meanwhile, female couples without BV share lactobacillus strains associated with optimal vaginal microbiota, and 77% of monogamous couples have identical lactobacilli strain-fingerprints. Female monogamous couples who were BV-negative at enrolment did not develop BV over 24 months, reflecting a shared stable optimal vaginal microbiome. Only after sex with a new partner outside of the relationship did women enrolling as a couple acquire BV. However, further research is needed into how specific bacterial strains may be transmitted and contribute to BV acquisition, and/or if there are any host factors that may render someone more susceptible to acquisition when exposed to a certain strain/s.

Commercial tests — bacterial vaginosis diagnostics state that microscopy with Amsel criteria and Gram staining with Nugent scoring remain the preferred and most cost-effective methods, and newer commercial diagnostic tests may be considered when microscopy is unavailable. Studies show acceptable performance for direct DNA probe assays for G vaginalis or chromogenic point-of-care sialidase assays against Amsel criteria and Nugent scoring, but the diagnostic utility of tests identifying only a single organism is still being investigated and is not currently supported. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used in research settings and, until recently, its clinical diagnostic use was still investigational; an advanced single-swab panel combining multiplex PCR and DNA probe technology can diagnose bacterial vaginosis by determining the ratio of lactobacilli species to several bacterial vaginosis–associated species in a patient- or physician-collected swab and has demonstrated comparable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to Nugent scoring and Amsel criteria.

What we can learn from past male-partner treatment trials

More than 60 years ago, researchers and clinicians held the view that the syndrome of BV was sexually transmitted, or at least, associated with sex. The findings from the six male-partner treatment trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s have been extensively reviewed, but we briefly summarise the findings (Table 1), with the aim of understanding the outcomes.

One of the challenges when assessing the effectiveness of partner treatment is that the trials utilised very different combinations of antibiotic treatments for differing durations (Table 1), and there was no published data to inform what treatments may be optimal for men. These trials had major trial-related limitations including small sample sizes, absence of power calculations, inconsistent and non-standard methods to diagnose BV in women, use of single-dose and non-standard treatments for women (which we now know are suboptimal), lack of data on treatment adherence, and high attrition. Another key difference between the trials was that the clinical endpoints were measured anywhere from 7 to 10 days to 12 weeks post-randomisation (Table 1). The timing of the endpoint may be critical in determining if an intervention is efficacious. Among couples counselled to abstain from sex, BV endpoints measured immediately post-treatment are more likely to reflect the efficacy of female-only treatment rather than the effect of treating the male on BV. In contrast, endpoints measured after a longer period of time post-treatment may be undermined by the introduction of untreated concurrent partners to the relationship. Overall, these limitations render the findings of these early trials inconclusive and cannot be used as evidence that BV is not sexually transmitted or that treating male partners will never be effective.

### Antibiotic-free vaginal microbiota transplant with donor engraftment, dysbiosis resolution and live birth after recurrent pregnancy loss: a proof of concept case study [^29f4a373]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A healthy vaginal microbiome is typically dominated by a single or a few species of vaginal lactobacilli (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners, or L. jensenii), in contrast to other parts of the body where a healthy microbial community typically contains a much higher species diversity. The production of lactic acid by these lactobacilli lowers the pH, to values below pH 4.5, and this acidification of the vaginal milieu benefits the individual. A more diverse vaginal microbiome dominated by other bacteria such as Bifidobacterium vaginale (formerly Gardnerella vaginalis), Fannyhessea vaginae (formerly Atopobium vaginae), Gardnerella spp. and Prevotella spp. is described as vaginal dysbiosis (VD).VD is shown to occur in 18–29% of women, and the condition is strongly associated with a lower chance of conceiving during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), a higher risk of euploid pregnancy loss, and obstetric complications such as premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and preterm birth. Many women with VD report no vaginal symptoms such as odor or discharge and appear to be otherwise healthy even after a gynecological evaluation.

Traditionally, symptomatic VD is treated with orally or vaginally administered antibiotics, such as metronidazole or clindamycin, with a cure rate of 80–90% one month after treatment. However, antibiotic treatment for symptomatic VD has some major drawbacks, including a recurrence rate of up to 60% within 12 months after treatmentand a potential risk for the development of antibiotic resistance in vaginosis-related bacteria. Further, orally administered antibiotics may cause a disturbance in the gut microbiome, and local application of antibiotics often leads to subsequent vulvovaginal candidiasis. To minimize risks associated with antibiotic treatment of VD, a study from 2019 reported 5 women with recurrent VD who were treated with Vaginal Microbiota Transplantation (VMT) from healthy donors following an antibiotic regimen. The results were quite encouraging, showing that four women experienced long-term clinical remission after up to three combined antibiotic and VMT treatments.

This is a report of a 30-year-old woman with recurrent VD for nine years and with significant clinical VD symptoms and a history of three late pregnancy losses after one successful pregnancy. As proof-of-concept, we outline the process of the first successful VMT without antibiotic pretreatment.

HIV Infection

BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection. Women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

Trichomoniasis

Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral STI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States. Because trichomoniasis is not a reportable disease, and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and clinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based T. vaginalis prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among males, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6%) and Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%). Unlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T. vaginalis prevalence rates are as high among women aged > 24 years as they are for women aged < 24 years. Among persons attending nine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas prevalence was 14.6% among women, and a study of STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified a prevalence of 27% among women and 9.8% among men. Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%). Rates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3.2%–8% of incarcerated men. Women with a history of incarceration are two to five times more likely to have T. vaginalis. Other risk factors for T. vaginalis include having two or more sex partners during the previous year, having less than a high school education, and living below the national poverty level. Women with BV are at higher risk for T. vaginalis. Male partners of women with trichomoniasis are likely to have infection, although the prevalence of trichomoniasis among MSM is low.

### Tinidazole [^ef71d5dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Amebiasis

Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].

1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis

### A clinical conundrum: chronic cervicitis [^b21c5f30]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervicitis is most commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections. "Normal vaginal flora" are rarely responsible for inflammation of the cervix.

Case

We describe a 22-year-old female patient with chronic cervicitis who had negative test results for bacterial and viral pathogens most commonly responsible for cervicitis. After 21 months of symptoms and multiple courses of empiric antibiotics addressing the most common causes of cervicitis, a course of antibiotics targeting group B streptococcus found on a genital culture resolved the patient's illness.

Summary and Conclusion

Bacteria considered to be "normal vaginal flora" in a nonpregnant young female adult should be considered as a potential pathogen when test results for more routine pathogens associated with cervicitis are negative.

Bacterial Vaginosis

BV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal hydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus species in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable feature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal epithelial cells. Certain women experience transient vaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for longer intervals. BV is a highly prevalent condition and the most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide. However, in a nationally representative survey, the majority of women with BV were asymptomatic.

BV is associated with having multiple male sex partners, female partners, sexual relationships with more than one person, a new sex partner, lack of condom use, douching, and HSV-2 seropositivity. Male circumcision reduces the risk for BV among women. In addition, BV prevalence increases during menses. Women who have never been sexually active are rarely affected. The cause of the microbial alteration that precipitates BV is not fully understood, and whether BV results from acquisition of a single sexually transmitted pathogen is unknown. BV prevalence has been reported to increase among women with copper-containing IUDs. Hormonal contraception does not increase risk for BV and might protect against BV development. Vitamin D deficiency has not been reported to be a risk factor for BV.

Women with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, such as HIV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HPV, and HSV-2; complications after gynecologic surgery; complications of pregnancy; and recurrence of BV (,–). BV also increases HIV infection acquisition because specific BV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV and the risk for HIV transmission to male sex partners. Evaluation of short-term valacyclovir suppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the risk for BV, despite effective suppression of HSV-2.

Although BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male genitalia, treatment of male sex partners has not been beneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV. Among WSW, a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex partners; however, no studies have evaluated treatment of female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^71a2b899]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from 3 public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

Results

We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.0%-77.3%), of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

Conclusions

The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI, necessitating vastly improved partner management, application of sensitive nucleic-acid based testing, and better clinical recognition.

### The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment [^f4c4a741]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. This has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

Recent Findings

Gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. Not all G. vaginalis strains do form biofilms: G. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or in a biofilm mode of growth. The presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. In-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to conquer the biofilm.

Summary

Future epidemiological research may benefit from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis to a significant extent. The search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents, but is at present hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

### Gardnerella vaginalis clade distribution is associated with behavioral practices and nugent score in women who have sex with women [^c758a974]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Gardnerella vaginalis is detected in women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV). Identification of 4 G. vaginalis clades raised the possibility that pathogenic and commensal clades exist. We investigated the association of behavioral practices and Nugent Score with G. vaginalis clade distribution in women who have sex with women (WSW).

Methods

Longitudinal self-collected vaginal specimens were analyzed using established G. vaginalis species-specific and clade-typing polymerase chain reaction assays. Logistic regression assessed factors associated with detection of G. vaginalis clades, and multinomial regression assessed factors associated with number of clades.

Results

Clades 1, 2, and 3 and multiclade communities (< 2 clades) were associated with Nugent-BV. Clade 1 (odds ratio [OR], 3.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65–6.84) and multiclade communities (relative risk ratio [RRR], 9.51; 95% CI, 4.36–20.73) were also associated with Lactobacillus-deficient vaginal microbiota. Clade 4 was neither associated with Nugent-BV nor Lactobacillus-deficient microbiota (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.67–3.33). Specific clades were associated with differing behavioral practices. Clade 1 was associated with increasing number of recent sexual partners and smoking, whereas clade 2 was associated with penile-vaginal sex and sharing of sex toys with female partners.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that G. vaginalis clades have varying levels of pathogenicity in WSW, with acquisition occurring through sexual activity. These findings suggest that partner treatment may be an appropriate strategy to improve BV cure.

### A fruitful alliance: the synergy betweenandin bacterial vaginosis-associated biofilm [^8b7b5928]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. It increases the risk of acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and is associated with preterm birth in pregnant women. The condition is characterised by a change in the microbial composition of the vagina: the Lactobacillus spp. associated with a healthy vaginal microbiome, are outnumbered by microaerophilic and anaerobic organisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis. The mere presence of G. vaginalis, however, is not sufficient for the diagnosis of BV using traditional diagnostic algorithms (see below) because many women without BV also have G. vaginalis in their vaginal microbiome.BV is, however, associated with high counts of G. vaginalis using molecular methods and/or the presence of a G. vaginalis -containing polymicrobial biofilm. Due to its strong adherence to vaginal epithelial cells and biofilm-forming capacities, it has been suggested that G. vaginalis initiates the colonisation of the vaginal epithelium and serves as a scaffolding to which other species subsequently can attach.

One of the species that might attach to the biofilm initiated by G. vaginalis could be Atopobium vaginae. Several molecular studies have indicated a probable role for A. vaginae in BV, and it has also been suggested that A. vaginae plays a major part in the establishment of a biofilm, together with G. vaginalis. Considering it has been found in 80–90% of cases of relapseand some strains have been shown in vitro to be metronidazole resistant, it could be of importance in the recurrence of BV after standard treatment with metronidazole.

The current gold standard in BV research is the microscopic evaluation and scoring of vaginal slides according to Nugent. The diagnosis of BV is based on the absence of lactobacilli and the presence of small Gram-negative to Gram-variable rods (G. vaginalis and Bacteroides spp. morphotypes) and curved Gram-negative rods (Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes). In fact, bacterial biofilm can also be seen with this method in the form of clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells covered by layers of adherent Gram-negative and/or Gram-variable cells, that is, biofilms. Using Gram staining, it is impossible to distinguish between the different bacterial species in the biofilm. By labelling the cells with a fluorescent probe, using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), the structure and composition of the biofilm can be studied in more detail.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7726202a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding and epidemiology note that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.56–3.00) across 32 studies and 30 518 participants. However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Although treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at not increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it remains unclear whether treatment in those at increased risk may help prevent preterm delivery.

Overall Composition and Diversity of the Vaginal Microbiota of Women Who Experienced BV Recurrence and Women Who Did Not

Two hundred thirty specimens were included in analyses (Supplementary Figure 2); 109 women provided both day 0 and day 8 samples, 5 provided a day 0 sample only, and 7 provided a day 8 sample only. As expected, pretreatment specimens were predominantly high in diversity with high relative abundance of BV-associated bacteria including Gardnerella spp, Prevotella spp, Fannyhessea vaginae (previously Atopobium vaginae), and Megasphaera spp, with low relative abundance of lactobacilli. Immediately posttreatment, most specimens were low in diversity and dominated by L iners.

NMDS and ANOSIM showed no difference in the overall composition of the vaginal microbiota between recurrence and cure cases either pretreatment at day 0 (ANOSIM: R = 0.070, P = 0.166; Figure 1 A) or immediately posttreatment at day 8 (ANOSIM: R = 0.037, P = 0.318; Figure 1 B). Similarly, the α-diversity of the vaginal microbiota did not differ pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.99 [95% CI,.77–6.71], P = 0.203) or posttreatment (AOR, 1.37 [95% CI,.60–2.97], P = 0.435; Table 3, Figure 1 C) between recurrence and cure cases. Furthermore, there was no difference in the degree of compositional change of the vaginal microbiota following treatment between recurrence and cure cases (AOR, 0.21 [95% CI,.02–3.01], P = 0.235; Table 3, Figure 1 D).

Summary

Understanding the etiology of BV has important implications for improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this common clinical condition. For example, in recent years, several highly sensitive and specific PCR assays, which use various combinations of bacteria, became available for the diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women, possibly replacing the currently used tests (Amsel criteria and Nugent score). – These tests, some already commercially available, have been shown to be sensitive (> 90%) and specific (near 90%).

Hypothetically, a diagnostic method based on different bacterial combinations may allow distinction of BV phenotypes concerning clinical significance, provide information on antibiotic resistances, and selection of personalized therapy. With regard to treatment, our current understanding of BV produced increased interest in nonantibiotic therapies, such as biofilm-disrupting agents (see part V). Future studies may focus on interventions that modify or block the synergistic relationship between key BV-associated bacteria.

METHODS

Study Populations and Study Procedures

We conducted a secondary analysis of vaginal microbiota data and accompanying clinical and behavioral data collected from women who participated in 3 clinical trials conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), Australia, that evaluated new interventions for improving BV cure: Strategies to prevent BV (SToPBV), StepUp-1, and StepUp-2. The parent trials have been described elsewhere. In brief, SToPBV was an open-label randomized controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill use following first-line antibiotic treatment to prevent BV recurrence. StepUp-1 and StepUp-2 were open-label single-arm pilot studies that assessed the acceptability and tolerability of concurrent male partner treatment for BV and its impact on the genital microbiota of couples. The Supplementary Material details the interventions assessed in the parent studies.

Across the 3 studies, women presenting to MSHC were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with BV (defined as ≥ 3 Amsel criteria and Nugent score [NS] = 4–10) and received first-line treatment (oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days, or if contraindicated, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream applied intravaginally nocte for 7 nights or metronidazole 0.75% gel applied intravaginally nocte for 5 nights). Additional study-specific eligibility criteria were applied. Of note, women were eligible for SToPBV if they were not currently using hormonal contraception and had no combined oral contraceptive pill–related contraindications. Women were eligible for the StepUp studies if they had a male regular sexual partner (RSP) of ≥ 2 months who was willing to receive treatment and had no additional sexual partners.

Men evaluated in settings in which Gram stain or MB or GV smear is unavailable who meet at least one criterion for urethritis (i.e. urethral discharge, positive leukocyte esterase test on first void urine, or microscopic examination of first-void urine sediment with ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF) should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and treated with regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

If symptoms are present but no evidence of urethral inflammation is present, NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae might identify infections. Persons with chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended treatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, empiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is recommended only for those at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such men should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

Nongonococcal Urethritis

NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various infectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established as an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across populations and accounts for < 50% of overall cases (,–). M. genitalium is estimated to account for 10%–25% of cases, and T. vaginalis for 1%–8% of cases depending on population and location. Other etiologies include different bacteria, such as Haemophilus species, N. meningitidis, HSV, and adenovirus. However, even when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are identified in approximately half of cases.

Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes in pregnancy — screening guidance indicates that evidence does not support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis among asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery, with symptomatic women evaluated and treated; evidence does not support routine screening for Trichomonas vaginalis among asymptomatic pregnant women, and women who report symptoms should be evaluated and treated; evidence does not support routine HSV-2 serologic screening among asymptomatic pregnant women, although type-specific serologic tests might be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk and for guiding counseling, and routine serial cultures for HSV are not indicated for women in the third trimester who have a history of recurrent genital herpes.

RESULTS

Study Population

The 251 participants enrolled in the study ranged from 19 to 49 years of age; 51.8% identified as white, 35.4% as black, and 10.4% as other; 7.2% of participants identified as Hispanic. Of the participants, 8.8% did not identify as black or Hispanic and reported both no history of BV and 10 or fewer lifetime sex partners (no BV risk factors). In total, 101 participants were BV positive at baseline by Amsel criteria and 150 were BV negative; 115 participants had Nugent scores indicative of no BV (0–3), 32 had Nugent scores indicative of intermediate microbiota (4–6), and 103 had Nugent scores indicative of BV (7–10). Thirty-nine participants were Amsel negative but had Nugent scores > 3 (asymptomatic BV/intermediate microbiota); 80 of 101 (79.2%) participants with symptomatic BV reported a history of BV compared to 86 of 150 (57.3%) of BV-negative participants (Table 1). Additional participant characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Trichomoniasis — epidemiology, prevalence, transmission, prevention, and morbidity in U.S. populations: Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States, and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis. Population-based prevalence is 2.1% among females and 0.5% among males, with highest rates among Black females (9.6%) and Black males (3.6%), compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8%) and Hispanic women (1.4%). In STD clinics, prevalence was 14.6% among women, and among Birmingham, Alabama, STD clinic attendees it was 27% among women and 9.8% among men. Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26% versus 6.5%), and rates are high in incarcerated populations at 9%–32% of incarcerated women and 3.2%–8% of incarcerated men. The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis (70%–85%) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, transmission is readily passed during penile-vaginal sex and can occur through infected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex with women, and prevention is best through consistent and correct use of condoms (external or internal). Douching is not recommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal infections, including trichomoniasis, and reported morbidities include a 1.4-times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age and a 2.1-fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis; another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer.

### The clinical spectrum of trichomonas vaginalis infection and challenges to management [^c49fdcbf]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection worldwide. T vaginalis infections in women can range from asymptomatic to acute inflammatory vaginitis. In men, this infection is typically asymptomatic but is increasingly being recognised as a cause of non-gonococcal urethritis. Diagnosis of T vaginalis has traditionally been made by direct microscopic examination of a wet mount of vaginal fluid or through the use of culture. The recent commercial availability of nucleic acid amplification tests for the detection of T vaginalis has seen these replace culture as the gold standard for diagnosis. Nitroimidazoles (ie, metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of therapy. In the case of treatment failure due to drug resistance or in the case of a severe nitroimidazole allergy, alternative intravaginal therapies exist, although their effectiveness has not been evaluated systematically. Novel systemic agents other than nitroimidazoles for the treatment of T vaginalis are needed, and efforts to promote and support antimicrobial drug development in this setting are necessary.

### Male partner treatment and the potential sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis: considerations for patient counseling and clinical application in the United States [^d84c4ba7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal complaints among reproductive-aged women, is highly recurrent and often challenging to treat. Whether BV is sexually transmissible has long been questioned by patients, providers, and researchers. Multiple prior studies evaluating male partner treatment (MPT) have failed to show an improvement in outcomes. However, for the first time, an open-label, randomized controlled trial in Australia showed a decrease in BV recurrences in women whose male partners were treated with a combination of oral metronidazole and topical clindamycin cream over 12 weeks. Many unanswered questions remain; more research is needed to investigate whether the results of this trial are applicable to broader populations. Nonetheless, these results have garnered substantial public attention. This has resulted in increasing questions from patients regarding both MPT and the sexual transmissibility of BV. Here, we review evidence regarding the sexual transmission of BV, discuss complexities with potential implementation of MPT, and provide a framework from which to counsel patients.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and HIV infection — Asymptomatic BV treatment among pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery has mixed results: seven trials found that one revealed harm, two reported no benefit, and four demonstrated benefit; however, routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high or low risk for preventing preterm birth is not recommended. For breastfeeding after maternal metronidazole, certain clinicians recommend deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after maternal treatment with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole, and lower doses are considered compatible with breastfeeding. In HIV, BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection, and women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimens as those who do not have HIV.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^2ea3e024]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification testing for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in symptomatic or high-risk women. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, and patients' sex partners should be treated as well. Treatment of noninfectious vaginitis should be directed at the underlying cause. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. Inflammatory vaginitis may improve with topical clindamycin as well as steroid application.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^bdc9380e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to update information on treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection. In the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has recently been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500mg twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential, since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is also recommended given the high repeat infection rates. Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

Summary

7-day 500mg twice daily MTZ should be used as the first line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

### Multiplex detection of bacteria associated with normal microbiota and with bacterial vaginosis in vaginal swabs by use of oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres [^6327a95a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurrent condition that is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases, preterm births, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In contrast to the Lactobacillus-dominated normal vaginal microbiota, BV is characterized by a lack of lactobacilli and an abundance of anaerobic and gram-negative organisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. To date, the laboratory diagnosis of BV has relied upon the fulfillment of criteria determined by microscopic observation of Gram-stained vaginal swabs. We describe a molecular-based method for the easy determination of the species profile within the vaginal microbiota based on the amplification of the chaperonin-60 genes of all bacteria present in the swab and hybridization of the amplicon to species-specific oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads that are identified by flow cytometry with a Luminex instrument. We designed a nineplex Luminex array for characterization of the vaginal microbiota and applied it to the analysis of vaginal swabs from individuals from Africa and North America. Using the presence of A. vaginae or G. vaginalis, or both, as the defining criterion for BV, we found that the method was highly specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of BV using microscopy as a gold standard.
