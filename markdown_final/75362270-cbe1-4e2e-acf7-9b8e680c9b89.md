## Question

Blood studies to check for a hormonally active neuroendocrine tumor (possible, cystic lesion in tail of pancreas)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which blood tests to order to evaluate a suspected hormonally active neuroendocrine tumor in a patient with a possible cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the symptom inventory and medication confounders that will shape which hormones to order and how to prepare the patient. Then, I should outline the baseline "general" NET markers, with caveats about their limited diagnostic utility and appropriate use in follow‑up. Next, I will prioritize a hormone‑specific panel based on the tail location and leading syndromic hypotheses, followed by criteria for dynamic testing when basal values are equivocal. Finally, I need to address pitfalls, MEN1 considerations, and a practical sequencing of tests with contingency plans for equivocal results.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and eliminate common biochemical confounders before any blood draw, because preanalytical issues can invalidate results. I should carefully review symptoms suggestive of functional PanNETs such as hypoglycemic spells for insulinoma, watery diarrhea for VIPoma, necrolytic migratory erythema for glucagonoma, refractory peptic ulcer disease for gastrinoma, and any cushingoid or acromegalic features for ectopic ACTH or GHRH, since the symptom constellation directs which hormone assays are most informative [^114Yny8e]. I need to check medications and stop proton pump inhibitors for at least 10–14 days and H2 blockers for 48 hours before gastrin and chromogranin A sampling, because these agents commonly cause false positives, and I should document renal and hepatic function since renal or hepatic insufficiency can elevate CgA independently of tumor burden [^115a8FyC]. I should ensure an overnight fast of 8–12 hours for most peptide measurements including insulin, gastrin, VIP, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide to reduce postprandial surges that may persist beyond 6 hours, but if the patient cannot fast, I will draw after the longest feasible interval and interpret cautiously [^116nxXqx].

> Now, for baseline general NET markers, I initially thought chromogranin A would serve as a good screening test, but wait, let me verify this against current guidance. Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions: CgA has limited sensitivity and specificity, is often normal in small or low‑grade tumors, and is particularly unreliable in insulinoma, so it should not be used as a screening test and is better suited to follow‑up when initially elevated, especially once confounders like PPI use and renal dysfunction are controlled [^112RLg5N] [^111uvmxo] [^115nZUyc]. I will add pancreatic polypeptide as a supportive adjunct because it can be elevated in a substantial subset of pancreatic NETs, especially nonfunctioning tumors, recognizing its nonspecificity, and I will consider neuron‑specific enolase primarily as a prognostic adjunct in higher‑grade disease rather than as a diagnostic tool for well‑differentiated lesions [^113ZaRcG] [^114hPzqp]. I should double‑check that insulinomas often do not raise CgA, which reinforces the point that normal CgA does not exclude a functional tail lesion, particularly insulinoma [^111CCHBR] [^116kyqBi] [^112RLg5N].

> Next, I will tailor a hormone‑specific panel guided by lesion location and clinical suspicion, but I need to acknowledge that while tail lesions are commonly insulinomas, they are not exclusively so. For suspected insulinoma I will draw simultaneous fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C‑peptide, and proinsulin to document inappropriately elevated insulin‑related indices during or near hypoglycemia, and I will concurrently consider measuring glucagon, gastrin, VIP, and somatostatin because PanNETs can be multihormonal and preoperative identification of all secreted peptides can alter surgical planning; I should confirm the fasting preparation and medication holds before sampling [^114Yny8e] [^114hPzqp]. Let me reconsider whether to add anything else up front: if there are cushingoid or acromegalic features, I will also include ACTH with morning cortisol, and IGF‑1 with GH as appropriate to screen for ectopic secretion while planning proper dynamic confirmation if basal values are equivocal [^114hPzqp].

> I will now examine the need for dynamic testing when basal insulinoma studies are nondiagnostic, and I need to ensure safety during provocation. The 72‑hour supervised fast remains the gold standard; a positive study documents plasma glucose less than about 55 mg/dL (or symptomatic hypoglycemia) with inappropriately elevated insulin (approximately ≥ 3 µU/mL), C‑peptide (approximately ≥ 0.2 nmol/L), and proinsulin (approximately ≥ 5 pmol/L), with values interpreted in clinical context and with appropriate monitoring to avert severe hypoglycemia [^114hPzqp]. But wait, what if insulin appears low while proinsulin is disproportionately high; I should recall that proinsulin‑predominant insulinomas exist and proinsulin measurement can rescue the diagnosis in that scenario, so I will not omit proinsulin from the panel [^115cnV8i] [^114hPzqp].

> For suspected gastrinoma, I should confirm that I am not confounded by acid suppression and atrophic gastritis before concluding hypergastrinemia is pathologic. I will measure fasting serum gastrin after stopping PPIs for 10–14 days and H2 antagonists for 48 hours when clinically safe, and if basal gastrin is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains high, I will perform a secretin stimulation test using intravenous secretin and consider a rise of at least 110 pg/mL above baseline as diagnostic in the right clinical context, while documenting or measuring gastric acidity where feasible to support interpretation [^115a8FyC] [^114xoDEj] [^112RLg5N] [^114hPzqp]. Hold on, I should verify that stopping PPIs is safe in this patient and institute bridging H2 antagonists with planned interruption before testing to avoid rebound acid complications, which is explicitly recommended in gastrinoma workups [^115a8FyC].

> For VIPoma, glucagonoma, and somatostatinoma, let me consider the clinical phenotype to guide and corroborate the laboratory data, because dynamic tests are not standardized here. I will obtain fasting plasma VIP in the setting of large‑volume secretory diarrhea and hypokalemia, fasting glucagon when there is hyperglycemia and necrolytic migratory erythema, and plasma somatostatin if there is a triad of diabetes, cholelithiasis, and steatorrhea or diarrhea, recognizing that marked basal elevations alongside characteristic symptoms carry the diagnostic weight for these rare entities without routine provocation studies [^114Yny8e] [^114hPzqp].

> But wait, what if there are features of ectopic hormone syndromes arising from a pancreatic NET. I should add targeted endocrine testing for rare but important ectopic ACTH and GHRH syndromes when cushingoid or acromegalic features are present, including ACTH with appropriate dexamethasone suppression or other pituitary‑adrenal testing for ACTH‑dependent hypercortisolism, and IGF‑1 with GH plus acromegaly confirmation when GHRH secretion is suspected, because PanNETs can occasionally produce these peptides and require specific perioperative and medical management adjustments [^114hPzqp] [^112FKUMv] [^112dE6HV].

> I should double‑check common pitfalls that can mislead interpretation and adjust my plan accordingly. Renal or hepatic dysfunction elevates CgA regardless of tumor activity, fasting is essential for insulin, gastrin, VIP, and glucagon, and PPIs and H2 blockers spuriously elevate both gastrin and CgA, so timing and clinical context must be documented with each draw; also, PP is nonspecific and can be released from normal islets under stimulation, and routine CgB testing rarely adds clinically meaningful information beyond CgA [^112RLg5N] [^111kcyEc] [^112BWQoU] [^116nxXqx]. Let me verify again that normal CgA cannot exclude insulinoma, since insulinomas frequently have normal CgA, reinforcing reliance on targeted insulin‑axis testing rather than general markers to establish functionality in a tail lesion [^111CCHBR] [^116kyqBi].

> Next, I should review MEN1 considerations because multifocality or a family history changes the breadth of biochemical screening. If there is clinical suspicion for MEN1, I will obtain the recommended annual fasting gastrointestinal hormone profile including gastrin, glucagon, VIP, PP, CgA, and insulin with fasting glucose, and pursue genetic testing in appropriate scenarios such as young age, multiple endocrine neoplasia features, or family history, because identifying MEN1 alters surveillance and surgical planning in pancreatic NETs [^113ojsip] [^112sg3VF] [^114nGCE7]. Hold on, I should verify the imaging component as well in MEN1, but for the purpose of this blood‑test plan I will at least flag that endocrine profiles should be interpreted alongside dedicated pancreatic and duodenal imaging when MEN1 is on the table [^1128QDqZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical sequencing so nothing critical is missed. After ensuring an 8–12 hour fast and safe withdrawal of acid suppression when feasible, I would draw baseline CgA, PP, and NSE acknowledging their limitations, and simultaneously obtain glucose with insulin, C‑peptide, and proinsulin to evaluate for insulinoma in this tail lesion, plus fasting gastrin, glucagon, VIP, and somatostatin to screen for other functional PanNETs, adding ACTH and morning cortisol or IGF‑1 and GH only if suggestive clinical features are present; if basal insulin‑axis studies are equivocal, proceed to a supervised 72‑hour fast, and if gastrin is equivocal in a high‑suspicion setting, proceed to a secretin stimulation test, documenting all preanalytical conditions on the requisition to aid interpretation [^114hPzqp] [^114Yny8e] [^112RLg5N] [^114xoDEj]. If general markers are normal but syndrome‑specific hormones or clinical suspicion are strong, I should not rule out a functional PanNET and should continue with dynamic testing and targeted imaging, recognizing that monoanalyte biomarkers have inherent limitations and are best used in concert with clinical and imaging assessments and, when elevated initially, for longitudinal follow‑up [^114rAZsH] [^114nWCS5] [^115nZUyc] [^111uvmxo].

For a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail suspicious for a hormonally active neuroendocrine tumor, order a **fasting hormone panel** (insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, gastrin, glucagon, VIP, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, ACTH, and serotonin/5-HIAA) to detect functional syndromes [^114Yny8e] [^114hPzqp]. Include **chromogranin A** as a general NET marker, but interpret cautiously due to false positives from PPIs, renal/hepatic impairment, and atrophic gastritis [^114rAZsH] [^112RLg5N]. Use **secretin stimulation** if gastrinoma is suspected and a **72-hour fast** for insulinoma evaluation [^114hPzqp] [^114xoDEj]. Consider NETest for high diagnostic accuracy and early relapse detection. Collect all samples fasting, stop PPIs 10–14 days prior, and interpret results with clinical context and imaging.

---

## General neuroendocrine tumor markers

- **Chromogranin A (CgA)**: A general NET marker, elevated in many NETs but not insulinomas; interpret cautiously due to false positives from PPIs, renal/hepatic impairment, and atrophic gastritis [^114rAZsH] [^112RLg5N] [^111CCHBR].

- **Pancreatic polypeptide (PP)**: Often elevated in non-functioning PanNETs; useful when CgA is inconclusive [^114rAZsH].

- **Neuron-specific enolase (NSE)**: Less specific; may be elevated in high-grade NETs [^114rAZsH].

## Hormone-specific blood tests

| **Hormone** | **Clinical syndrome** | **Indications** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin | Insulinoma | Hypoglycemia symptoms | Elevated insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin during hypoglycemia [^114hPzqp] |
| Gastrin | Gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison) | Refractory ulcers, diarrhea | Fasting gastrin > 10x ULN; confirm with secretin stimulation [^114hPzqp] [^114xoDEj] |
| Glucagon | Glucagonoma | Diabetes, rash, weight loss | Elevated fasting glucagon [^114hPzqp] |
| VIP | VIPoma | Profuse diarrhea, hypokalemia | Elevated fasting VIP [^114hPzqp] |
| Somatostatin | Somatostatinoma | Diabetes, steatorrhea, gallstones | Elevated fasting somatostatin [^114hPzqp] |
| ACTH | Ectopic Cushing's | Cushingoid features | Elevated ACTH, cortisol [^114hPzqp] |
| Serotonin, 5-HIAA | Carcinoid syndrome | Flushing, diarrhea | Elevated serotonin/5-HIAA [^114hPzqp] |

---

## Advanced and emerging biomarkers

The **NETest** is a multianalyte blood test with high sensitivity (85–98%) and specificity (93–97%) for NET detection; it is unaffected by PPIs or SSAs and useful for early relapse detection. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) correlate with tumor burden and grade but have **limited utility in routine diagnosis** [^114hPzqp].

---

## Sample collection and interpretation considerations

- **Fasting samples**: Collect after an overnight fast to avoid postprandial hormone elevations [^114rAZsH].

- **Medication interference**: Stop PPIs 10–14 days before testing; interpret results cautiously if PPIs cannot be stopped [^114rAZsH] [^112RLg5N].

- **Clinical context**: Interpret results with clinical presentation and imaging to avoid false positives/negatives [^114rAZsH].

---

## Recommended blood tests summary

- **General markers**: Chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, neuron-specific enolase.

- **Hormone-specific tests**: Insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, gastrin, glucagon, VIP, somatostatin, ACTH, serotonin/5-HIAA.

- **Advanced biomarkers**: NETest (if available).

- **Provocative tests**: Secretin stimulation (gastrinoma), 72-hour fast (insulinoma).

---

A comprehensive, fasting hormone panel with CgA and PP, plus selective provocative tests and NETest when available, provides the **best biochemical assessment** for a suspected hormonally active PanNET.

### Role of biomarker tests for diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours [^114rAZsH]. Nature Reviews. Endocrinology (2018).

Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are neoplasms arising from neuroendocrine cells. These cells, along with their tumours, can secrete a wide range of amines and polypeptide hormones into the systemic circulation. This characteristic has spurred extensive research into circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of NETs, as well as for predicting the biological behaviour of tumour cells.

Classic examples of circulating biomarkers for gastroenteropancreatic NETs include chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, pancreatic polypeptide, and hormones that cause clinical syndromes, such as serotonin (and its metabolites), insulin, glucagon, and gastrin. Although biomarker metrics for diagnosing all gastroenteropancreatic NET subtypes are limited, specific hormonal measurements can be diagnostically valuable in select cases.

- **Advancements in detection methods**: Over the past decade, detecting circulating transcripts and tumour cells has improved NET diagnosis.

- **Innovations in imaging**: Modern scanning techniques and superior radiotracers for functional imaging have significantly expanded the diagnostic options for clinicians managing NETs.

Here, we review the latest research on NET biomarkers to provide clinicians with a comprehensive overview of relevant diagnostic biomarkers applicable in specific situations.

### What every gastroenterologist should know about gastrointestinal NETs [^112RLg5N]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Establishing a NET diagnosis involves exercising caution in obtaining and interpreting NET markers. Chromogranin A (CgA) is the most common marker for managing NETs; however, it has limited sensitivity and specificity. It is not intended as a screening test and is more suitable for patients with a confirmed NET diagnosis and measurable disease, such as metastases. CgA can be normal in individuals with small and limited tumors. It is frequently elevated in patients without NETs; the most common reason for false positive CgA is proton pump inhibitor use. Additionally, renal or hepatic insufficiency and autoimmune atrophic gastritis are associated with elevated CgA levels.

- **Endoscopic characteristics and considerations**: Gastroduodenal and rectal NETs are often incidentally discovered during routine endoscopy. Most are not associated with a hormonal syndrome. It is important to note that tumors with low malignant potential cannot be distinguished endoscopically from higher-grade, more aggressive tumors. GI NETs may present as firm, nonmobile, and polypoid or round structures, with either smooth overlying mucosa or central erosion or depression. They may also display an underlying red or yellow hue. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) typically shows a hypoechoic, well-defined lesion within the deep mucosal and submucosal layers. Since NETs originate from enterochromaffin-like cells in the mucosal layer and infiltrate into the submucosa, biopsies using endoscopic forceps often establish a NET diagnosis, whereas mucosal biopsies generally fail to obtain diagnostic tissue for other subepithelial lesions.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms [^114hPzqp]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). High credibility.

The increase or inappropriate presence of relevant biomarkers, mainly peptide hormones, can confirm the diagnosis of a specific endocrine syndrome. Occasionally, when levels of a biomarker related to a specific clinical setting are nondiagnostic, a stimulation test may be required. This mostly applies to gastrinoma patients with nondiagnostic basal gastrin levels when the secretin test is performed. Patients suspected of insulinoma should undergo a 72-hour supervised fast to detect inadequately elevated (pro-)insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemia. Neuron-specific enolase is also commonly used and is mostly found to be elevated in patients with high-grade neoplasms, exhibiting a prognostic role.

- **Less commonly used markers**: These include pancreastatin, a CgA derivative that is less affected by PPI administration; it is found to be elevated in 58% to 81% of NENs. However, pancreastatin does not correlate with tumor burden and/or disease aggressiveness, and its measurement is not widely available. Other less commonly used monoanalytes are neurokinin A and progastrin-releasing peptide, whereas N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic protein is a valuable nonspecific tool for evaluating patients with CHD.

- **Circulating tumor cells**: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are secreted either by the primary tumor or metastatic deposits and are initially found in the circulation in 43% of midgut, 21% of pancreatic, and 31% of bronchopulmonary metastatic NENs. CTCs are associated with increased tumor load and grade and are also found to be predictors of a worse progression.

### Chirhostim 40 [^114xoDEj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A physician or institution planning to perform secretin stimulation testing as an aid to the diagnosis of pancreatic disease should begin by assessing enough normal subjects (greater than 5) to develop proficiency in proper techniques and to generate normal response ranges for the commonly assessed parameters for pancreatic exocrine response to Chirhostim®.

In three crossover studies evaluating 21 different patients with a documented history of chronic pancreatitis, sHS was compared to sPS and bPS at a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg for each drug. All of the patients treated with these drugs had peak bicarbonate concentrations of less than 80 mEq/L.

Pancreatic secretory response to intravenous synthetic human secretin in 35 healthy subjects demonstrated a mean peak bicarbonate concentration of 100 mEq/L and a mean total volume over one hour of 260.7 mL. All 35 subjects had peak bicarbonate concentrations greater than or equal to 80 mEq/L.

- **Stimulation of gastrin secretion to aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma**:

	- Chirhostim® administered intravenously stimulates gastrin release in patients with gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), whereas no or only small changes in serum gastrin concentrations occur in healthy subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer disease. Discriminant analysis was used to establish secretin stimulation testing as an aid in the diagnosis of gastrinoma. An increase from basal levels of greater than or equal to 110 pg/mL was the optimal point separating positive and negative tests. This gastrin response is the basis for the use of secretin as a provocative agent.

### European neuroendocrine tumor society 2023 guidance paper for functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour syndromes [^114Yny8e]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). High credibility.

This ENETS guidance paper aims to provide practical advice to clinicians for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of functioning syndromes in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET). A NET-associated functioning syndrome is defined by the presence of a clinical syndrome combined with biochemical evidence of inappropriately elevated hormonal levels.

Different hormonal syndromes can be encountered in pancreatic NET patients, including insulinoma and gastrinoma, as well as the rare glucagonoma, VIPoma, ACTHoma, PTHrPoma, carcinoid syndrome, calcitoninoma, GHRHoma, and somatostatinoma. The recommendations provided in this paper focus on several key areas:

- **Biochemical, genetic, and imaging work-up**: Focuses on assessing hormonal levels to determine the nature of the NET.

- **Therapeutic management of individual hormonal syndromes**: Strategies for managing well-differentiated, grade 1–3, functioning NET with the primary tumour originating in the pancreas, and for specific subtypes, also in the duodenum.

### Cushing's syndrome due to a corticotropin-releasing hormone- and adrenocorticotrophic hormone-producing neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor [^112FKUMv]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a case of ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production caused by a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. To our knowledge, only two cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have been described as the source of CRH in Cushing's syndrome.

- **Methods**: We analyzed and summarized the patient's medical history, physical examination results, laboratory data, imaging studies, and histopathologic results.

- **Results**: An endocrinologic workup revealed massive ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no pathologic findings, which led to extensive imaging in search of the suspected ectopic lesion. Ketoconazole treatment was initiated. Rapid deterioration of the patient's clinical condition due to escalating cortisol levels and resulting sepsis required an emergency adrenalectomy to control the hypercortisolism. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed a hepatic lesion, which was biopsied. Histology of the lesion showed a well-differentiated endocrine tumor. Subsequent scintigraphy with octreotide (a somatostatin [SMS] analog) detected a pancreatic tumor, which was endosonographically confirmed. The initiated SMS therapy was followed by a distal splenopancreatectomy and a right hemihepatectomy. Immunostaining of the specimen showed positive expression for CRH and ACTH.

- **Conclusion**: We conclude that SMS-scintigraphy did have an additional diagnostic benefit compared to PET-CT. In hypercortisolemic patients, rapid endocrinologic evaluation is crucial.

### Multiple proinsulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas treated by laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy [^115cnV8i]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with pancreatic tumors that induce hypoglycemia present with a myriad of symptoms. Laboratory testing can frequently result in data challenging for clinicians to confirm the biochemical diagnosis. Proinsulin, in addition to insulin levels, may be essential in evaluating and diagnosing an insulinoma.

- **Methods**: The objective of this case report is to demonstrate the potential importance of proinsulin levels in the evaluation of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. We report on a 49-year-old woman with an unusual clinical presentation. Unlike many patients with tumor-induced hypoglycemia, her fasting glucose levels were fairly unimpressive, her insulin levels were undetectable during a prolonged fast, and she had elevated proinsulin levels.

- **Results**: The inpatient fast was remarkable for levels of serum glucose 53 mg/dl or higher, serum insulin < 2 uIU/ml, C-peptide 0.7–1.1 (normal 0.8–3.1 ng/ml), and proinsulin 29.2–36.8 pmol/l (normal ≤ 18.8 pmol/l). CT scanning of the abdomen revealed multiple pancreatic lesions. A laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy led to the removal of multiple neuroendocrine tumors, which stained only for proinsulin and not for other pancreatic tumor markers. Postoperatively, she normalized her biochemical serum studies and has remained symptom-free 2 years later.

- **Conclusions**: The measurement of proinsulin plays an important part in the diagnostic workup of neuroendocrine tumors causing hypoglycemia. These potentially malignant tumors can be treated adequately with minimally invasive surgery.

### Circulating neuroendocrine gene transcripts (NETest): A postoperative strategy for early identification of the efficacy of radical surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^113wrcVL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Surgery remains the only treatment for the cure of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Biomarkers to identify the completeness of resection and predict recurrence are lacking.

The aims of this study were to evaluate if the blood measurement of neuroendocrine gene transcripts (NETest) was diagnostic of PanNETs, and whether NETest blood levels could identify complete resection. We compared transcript analysis with the biomarker chromogranin A (CgA).

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, longitudinal, single-center study including 30 patients with a postoperative histological confirmation of PanNET. Blood for NETest and CgA was collected preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1, POD5, and POD30. Transcripts were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and multianalyte algorithmic analysis (NETest; normal < 20), and CgA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; normal < 109 ng/mL). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

- **Results**: Pancreatic surgical resections (n = 30) were R0, 26; R1, 2; and R2, 2. Preoperatively, NETest scores were elevated in all 30 patients (44.7 ± 27), but postoperatively, NETest scores significantly decreased (p = 0.006) to POD30 (24.7 ± 24). The proportion of patients (15/30) with an elevated score significantly decreased by POD30 (p < 0.0001). CgA levels were elevated preoperatively (184 ± 360 ng/mL) in only 9/30 patients; however, they did not decrease significantly postoperatively at POD30 (260 ± 589 ng/mL, p = 0.398).

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116wiHYJ]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors:

- **Definition**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs are a heterogeneous group of epithelial neoplasms arising from neuroendocrine cells within the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, characterized by variable hormonal activity and malignant potential.

- **Pathophysiology**: Gastroenteropancreatic NETs originate from neuroendocrine cells capable of hormone production and secretion. They are classified by primary site (e.g. pancreas, small intestine, rectum), functional status (hormone-secreting vs. nonfunctional), and histologic grade based on mitotic rate and Ki-67 proliferation index. The biological behavior varies widely, ranging from indolent, well-differentiated tumors to aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Hormone-producing tumors may cause clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome or insulinoma, while nonfunctional tumors often present late with mass effect or metastases.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs has increased over recent decades. In the US, the estimated incidence is approximately 3.6 per 100,000 individuals per year, with a 20-year prevalence of 48 per 100,000. In Europe, incidence rates range from 1.3 to 2.3 per 100,000, though estimates vary due to heterogeneity in national and regional registry data.

- **Risk factors**: Most gastroenteropancreatic NETs are sporadic, but the risk is increased in patients with inherited syndromes such as MEN1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis complex.

### Routine measurement of plasma chromogranin B has limited clinical utility in the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumours [^112BWQoU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Chromogranin A (CgA) and B (CgB) are markers for monitoring disease status in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). These are specialized diagnostic tests often necessitating referral of specimens to a supraregional assay service (SAS) laboratory for analysis. The aim of this audit was to assess whether measurement of either plasma CgA or CgB alone provides sufficient clinical information in comparison with the practice of measuring both markers together.

- **Design**: A retrospective analysis was undertaken for all chromogranin tests requested for patients with a known NET diagnosis. Results were categorized based on whether plasma concentrations were elevated for one or both CgA and CgB.

- **Results**: A total of 325 sequential patients with a NET diagnosis had plasma chromogranin levels measured during the period of review. Baseline CgA was elevated in 60.9% of patients. Isolated elevations in CgA (with normal CgB) were found in 44.9% of patients, whilst combined elevations in both CgA and CgB were found in 16% of patients. Combined CgA and CgB concentrations within the normal range were observed for 38.5% of patients. Only two patients (0.6%) had an isolated elevation in CgB at baseline. Both patients had a diagnosis of pancreatic NET and were radiologically stable. Plasma CgA and CgB corresponded with disease stage (localized vs metastatic). CgB in addition to CgA did not provide any significant improvement in diagnostic performance for identification of metastatic disease compared to CgA alone.

### The impact of re-characterizing metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective study [^117CVrnT]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

This study received approval from the Ethical Review Board in Uppsala (reference ID: 2016/277), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The reporting of this study was based on the guidelines outlined in the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, with relevant adaptations to fit our unique dataset. Follow-up data collection concluded on August 30, 2023.

- **Study design, setting, and participants**: This was a single-center, longitudinal cohort study analyzing patients enrolled in a prospective protocol for panNET disease re-characterization at Uppsala University Hospital. This protocol included patients that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) age ≥ 18 years, (2) informed consent, (3) pathology-confirmed diagnosis of panNET (World Health Organization [WHO] 2017) grade (G) G1–G3, (4) inoperable, stage III or IV (according to the 8th TNM classification edition for NET), (5) WHO performance status ≤ 2, (6) progressive disease (as defined by the responsible physician), and (7) biopsy procedure not associated with inappropriate risk. Progressive disease was defined as progression based on clinical, radiological, and biochemical parameters, as assessed by the treating physician and the study coordinator (JC).

Radiological progression was the primary and most consistent inclusion criterion. While biochemical and clinical indicators contributed to the assessment, they were not used in isolation for patient selection but rather in conjunction with imaging findings.

### Sporadic pancreatic polypeptide secreting tumors (PPomas) of the pancreas [^116ZxnJL]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which predominantly secrete pancreatic polypeptide (PPoma), are rare and have not been associated with a clinical syndrome. A wider understanding of their pathological features and behavior is needed.

- **Methods**: Four PPoma patients who presented with nonspecific abdominal pain are described. Their diagnosis was established by the presence of an enhancing solitary pancreatic tumor on computed tomography (CT) and elevated fasting pancreatic polypeptide hormone levels. Patient 1 was treated with a pancreatoduodenectomy because of elevation of serum CEA level. Two of the cases underwent enucleation because of prolonged stable CT appearance. Patient 4 underwent distal pancreatectomy for a pancreatic neck tumor causing ductal obstruction and distal parenchymal atrophy.

- **Results**: All cases had benign histological features apart from patient 1 whose tumor demonstrated occasional mitotic activity. These tumors have not recurred following a median of 49 (range, 35–57) months. The protein expression in the tumor tissue was measured by SELDI-TOF MS and was different than the profile of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that was previously demonstrated in our laboratory. This may lead to future helpful diagnostic testing on fine needle aspirates.

- **Conclusion**: Resection of sporadic PPomas presenting as a solitary well-defined mass with benign histological features results in good long-term survival.

### Priorities for improving the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^1147cZAj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

A National Cancer Institute summit meeting on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors was held in September 2007 to present the currently accepted standards of care for patients with these tumors and to identify areas requiring investigation and development. These tumors are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous. They often present with obscure symptoms that lead to diagnostic delays of several years, and have an incidence in the United States of 2.5 to 5 cases per 100,000. The 5-year survival rates range between 15% and 95%, depending on the site and extent of disease.

This report delineates the main conclusions of the meeting, including the best practice diagnosis and treatment strategies for gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. It also identifies clinical and scientific areas most in need of attention.

- **Public and physician education**: The report emphasizes the need for public and physician education to increase awareness and understanding of these tumors.
- **Early diagnosis**: Identification of molecular markers for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring is crucial.
- **Imaging and prognosis**: Improved imaging modalities and molecular prognostication should be developed.
- **Classification system**: Development of a standardized pathological classification system is necessary.
- **Centers of expertise**: Creation of regional centers of expertise with tumor and laboratory data banks is essential.

In addition, adequately validated neuroendocrine tumor models and cell lines should be established to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of their growth and secretion. This initiative aims to facilitate the development of specific therapies that should be examined in well-designed multicenter studies of defined patient groups.

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^111CCHBR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Circulating CgA levels have been confirmed to be a useful diagnostic marker for NETs, with high specificity and sensitivity. In the present study, we verified the diagnostic value of serum CgA in a series of patients with non-insulinoma PNETs, aligning with previous studies. The sensitivity and specificity were 65.6% and 91.9%, respectively, similar to the rate of 67% and 96% when using CIS Bio kits, as described by Ardill and Erikkson. Similar to previous studies, we found that CgA levels in patients with gastrinomas were much higher than those in patients without gastrin-secreting PNETs.

An interesting finding in the study was that serum CgA levels were not elevated in patients with insulinomas, including one patient with extensive liver metastases (48 ng/ml). Most previous studies on PNETs did not clarify this unusual biochemical feature of insulinoma, the most common subtype of PNETs. However, Wouter de Herder pointed out in a review that blood levels of CgA were rarely slightly elevated in subjects with insulinomas, and Portela-Gomes GM et al. mentioned in a review that well-differentiated NETs expressed CgA epitopes except insulinomas. A recently published guideline revised by the UK and Ireland Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and the British Society of Gastroenterology addressed that CgA would not be raised in benign insulinomas. Moreover, Nobels et al. studied more than 200 NETs and found that serum CgA levels were rarely slightly elevated in patients with insulinomas, being elevated in 2 of 21 patients, with a range of 63–236 ng/ml.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) encompass a diverse group of malignancies marked by histological heterogeneity and highly variable clinical outcomes. We performed a systematic review on potential prognostic biomarkers in PNETs by searching the PubMed database. A total of 472 manuscripts were reviewed in detail, of which 52 multivariate studies met the inclusion criteria proposed by the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies. These altogether analyzed 53 unique targets, and 36 of them were statistically associated with survival.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^113ojsip]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, specifically in relation to tumor surveillance, the 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual plasma biochemical assessment. This should include fasting gastrointestinal tract hormone profiles, with measurements of gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pancreatic polypeptide, chromogranin A, and insulin, alongside an associated fasting glucose level. These assessments are considered the minimum requirement for screening gastropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

### Hereditary endocrine tumours: Current state-of-the-art and research opportunities: MEN1-related pancreatic NETs: Identification of unmet clinical needs and future directives [^112EXz38]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

The PanNET Working Group of the 16th International Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Workshop (MEN2019) convened in Houston, TX, USA, from 27–29 March 2019 to discuss key unmet clinical needs related to PanNET in the context of MEN1, with a special focus on non-functioning (nf)-PanNETs. The participants represented a broad range of medical scientists, as well as representatives from patient organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, and research societies.

In a case-based approach, participants addressed early detection, surveillance, prognostic factors, and management of localized and advanced disease. For each topic, following a review of evidence, key unmet clinical needs and future research directives to make meaningful progress for MEN1 patients with nf-PanNETs were identified. International multi-institutional collaboration is needed for adequately sized studies and validation of findings in independent datasets. Collaboration between basic, translational, and clinical scientists is paramount to establishing a translational science approach. In addition, bringing clinicians, scientists, and patients together improves the prioritization of research goals, assures a patient-centered approach, and maximizes patient involvement.

It was concluded that collaboration, research infrastructure, and methodologic and reporting rigor are essential to any translational science effort. The highest priority for nf-PanNETs in MEN1 syndrome are:

1. The development of a data and biospecimen collection architecture that is uniform across all MEN1 centers.
2. Unified strategies for diagnosis and follow-up.

Endocrine-related symptoms and syndromes caused by NENs:

Isolated or metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) can present with a spectrum of hormone-related symptoms and syndromes, resulting from the hypersecretion of one or more amines and/or peptides by these tumors. The production of bioactive compounds can be characteristic of the specific tissue of origin, leading to a secretory syndrome (eutopic secretion), or, rarely, compounds that are typically originating from other anatomical sites (ectopic secretion). The representative endocrine syndromes encountered in NEN patients are described below.

### Changing biological behaviour of nets during the evolution of the disease: Progress on progression [^111vEfzm]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

Following improvements in the management and outcome of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) in recent years, we see a subset, particularly of pancreatic NENs, that become more aggressive during the course of the disease. This is reflected by an increase in the Ki-67 labelling index as a marker of proliferation, which may lead to an increase in grading but generally does not appear to be correlated with histologically confirmed dedifferentiation.

A systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase until May 2020 to identify cases that have behaved in such a manner. We screened 244 articles; only seven studies included cases in their cohort, or in a subset of the cohort studied, with a proven increase in the Ki-67 during follow-up through additional biopsy. In addition to these studies, we have also tried to identify possible pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in advanced NENs. However, currently, no studies appear to have addressed the mechanisms implicated in the switch to a more aggressive biological phenotype over the course of the disease. Such progression of the disease course may demand a change in the management.

Summarizing the overall evidence, we suggest that future studies should concentrate on changes in the molecular pathways during disease progression with sequential biopsies in order to shed light on the mechanisms that render a neoplasm more aggressive than its initial phenotype or genotype.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms [^114nWCS5]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Clinicians are increasingly confronted with neuroendocrine neoplasms as their incidence and prevalence are rising across all primary sites. Patients presenting with a neuroendocrine neoplasm should be scrutinized for the presence of a functional hormonal syndrome, as this can impair survival, offers the possibility of sensitive biomarkers, and requires dedicated therapy.

Obtaining histology of a suspected neuroendocrine neoplasm is crucial for confirmation of the diagnosis, as well as for classification into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. Functional imaging with 68 Gallium-labelled somatostatin analogs and 18 F-FDG PET tracers ensures superior staging and prognostication of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

Long-acting somatostatin analogs constitute the preferred first-line option for several hormonal syndromes associated with neuroendocrine neoplasms, as well as for growth control in well-differentiated irresectable or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic tumors. Several novel treatment options for hormonal and/or antiproliferative control in neuroendocrine neoplasms have shown efficacy in randomized controlled trials, expanding the clinical repertoire and allowing for improved management based on individual patient and tumor characteristics.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^116nxXqx]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Non-functioning tumours of the pancreas often secrete PP, and this may be a helpful marker in patients with these tumours.

The majority of rectal tumours do not secrete CgA. Many secrete PP, and some may secrete enteroglucagon, human chorionic gonadotropin-β, or acid phosphatase. When a marker is identified, this is helpful; however, the absence of a marker does not equate to the absence of a tumour.

A range of peptide markers can be measured in two laboratories in the UK, and specimens may be sent to these laboratories through local hospitals. Some other NHS laboratories measure CgA. Some peptides show a significant rise postprandially, particularly insulin, gastrin, and PP. These peptides may remain elevated for more than 6 hours; therefore, it is ideal that all specimens should be collected after an overnight fast. For some of the markers (e.g. CgA), a fasting specimen is not required. If specimens at clinics are not always collected following a fast, the fasting or random status of the specimen should be recorded on the accompanying form to enable appropriate interpretation by the laboratory. With the exception of insulin, peptide markers for NETs are all raised in the circulation of patients with renal failure. Interpretation of results from these patients is difficult.

A number of circulating markers have been reported to be of prognostic value: CgA for the majority of tumours, pancreastatin for hepatic tumour bulk, and neurokinin A for serotonin-secreting tumours of the small bowel.

In a significant number of sporadic NETs, cell type may change and tumours will produce different markers.

### Current practices and novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary [^1177SG92]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

A complete pathological workup, including histomorphological examination of tumor tissue obtained by surgical resection or less invasive means (e.g. needle-guided biopsy or fine needle aspiration), is important for establishing the NET diagnosis. In the context of well-differentiated tumors, histomorphology often provides sufficient resolution to distinguish neuroendocrine neoplasms from other tumors and to further characterize the histology as either small cell or large cell, if applicable. Proliferative markers, such as mitotic count and Ki-67, are also used for grading and may inform prognosis and treatment decisions. However, nonstandard methodology for determining mitotic count and Ki-67 and incomplete characterization of the anatomic primary site may introduce uncertainty that affects grading and staging.

With the exception of the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A or synaptophysin, immunohistochemical markers may have limited diagnostic utility based on the tumor's differentiation state and expression of lineage-specific proteins with ranges of specificity that may stress the management of tissue for additional biomarker studies that may follow. Examples of lineage-specific protein markers include TTF-1, which is expressed in 30% to 70% of well-differentiated lung NETs but is also expressed in more than 40% of metastatic small cell NECs that are not of lung origin. The lack of marker specificity may limit the utility of TTF-1 in a high-grade NET-UP at a distant metastatic site. Other immunohistochemical markers such as CDX2, ISL1, and PDX1 also lack the necessary specificity.

### NETest® 2.0: A decade of innovation in neuroendocrine tumor diagnostics [^112niqX4]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP‐NENs) present significant diagnostic and management challenges. In response to the need for a reliable biomarker, we previously developed the NETest, a liquid biopsy test that quantifies the expression of 51 neuroendocrine tumor (NET)-specific genes in blood using real-time PCR (NETest 1.0). This study leverages our well-established laboratory techniques, including blood collection, RNA isolation, and qPCR, alongside contemporary supervised machine learning methods. We expanded both training and testing datasets to enhance the discrimination and calibration of the NETest algorithm, resulting in NETest 2.0.

qPCR measurements of RNA-stabilized blood-derived gene expression from 51 NET markers were utilized to train two supervised classifiers.

- **First classifier**: Trained on 78 controls and 162 NETs to distinguish NETs from controls.

- **Second classifier**: Trained on 134 stable disease samples and 61 progressive disease samples to differentiate stable from progressive NET disease. For all classifiers, 80% of data was retained for model training, with the remaining 20% used for evaluating performance.

The predictive performance of the AI system was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and area under received operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The highest-performing algorithm was validated using two independent validation sets. Validation Cohort #I included 277 patients and 186 healthy controls from the United States, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Validation Cohort #II comprised 291 European patients from the Swiss NET Registry.

### Challenges and controversies in management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours in patients with MEN1 [^1168PZ73]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by the occurrence of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (P-NETs) in association with parathyroid and pituitary tumours. P-NETs, which include gastrinomas, insulinomas, and non-functioning tumours, occur in more than 80% of MEN1 patients and account for 50% of disease-specific deaths. However, there is no consensus about the optimal methods for detecting and treating P-NETs in MEN1 patients, and extrapolations from approaches used in patients with non-familial (sporadic) P-NETs require caution because of differences, such as the younger age of onset, multi-focality of P-NETs, and concomitant presence of other tumours in MEN1 patients.

Thus, the early detection of P-NETs by circulating biomarkers and imaging modalities, and their appropriate treatments by surgical approaches and/or radionuclide therapy, chemotherapy, and biotherapy pose challenges and controversies. These challenges and controversies will be reviewed and possible approaches proposed.

### Marked expansion of exocrine and endocrine pancreas with incretin therapy in humans with increased exocrine pancreas dysplasia and the potential for glucagon-producing neuroendocrine tumors [^115naBag]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The β-cell mass, computed from the product of the pancreatic fractional insulin-positive area and pancreatic mass, was 55% decreased in DM patients not on incretin therapy compared with ND control subjects (0.29 ± 0.08 vs. 0.60 ± 0.10 g; P < 0.05). In contrast, β-cell mass increased sixfold in DM-I patients (1.81 ± 0.56 vs. 0.29 ± 0.08 g; P < 0.01). Moreover, β-cell mass was threefold greater in DM-I individuals compared with ND control subjects (1.81 ± 0.56 vs. 0.60 ± 0.10 g; P < 0.05).

The sixfold increase in β-cell mass in DM-I subjects was almost all due to increased β-cell numbers rather than β-cell size, although there was a 3% increase in β-cell size with incretin therapy (8.9 ± 0.1 vs. 8.6 ± 0.1 μm, DM vs. DM-I; P < 0.05). The pancreatic fractional area immunostained for glucagon was comparable between DM individuals not subject to incretin therapy and ND control subjects (0.57 ± 0.12 vs. 0.52 ± 0.08%; P = NS).

However, the pancreatic fractional area immunostained for glucagon markedly increased in DM-I individuals compared with DM patients on other therapy (1.65 ± 0.39 vs. 0.57 ± 0.12%; P < 0.0001) and compared with ND control subjects (1.65 ± 0.39 vs. 0.52 ± 0.08%; P < 0.0001). The pattern of the calculated glucagon mass followed that of the pancreatic fractional area, being comparable in individuals with DM not treated with incretin therapy and control subjects, but fivefold increased in DM-I individuals compared with DM patients not treated with incretin therapy (2.08 ± 0.75 vs. 0.45 ± 0.10 g, DM-I vs. DM; P).

### Consensus on biomarkers for neuroendocrine tumour disease [^117L7TBr]. The Lancet Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of neuroendocrine neoplasia represents a clinical challenge because of its late presentation, lack of treatment options, and limitations in present imaging modalities and biomarkers to guide management. Monoanalyte biomarkers have poor sensitivity, specificity, and predictive ability. A National Cancer Institute summit, held in 2007, on neuroendocrine tumours noted biomarker limitations to be a crucial unmet need in the management of neuroendocrine tumours.

A multinational consensus meeting of multidisciplinary experts in neuroendocrine tumours assessed the use of biomarkers and defined the prerequisites for novel biomarkers via the Delphi method.

- **Consensus achievement**: Consensus (at > 75%) was achieved for 88 (82%) of 107 assessment questions.
- **Panel conclusions**: The panel concluded that circulating multianalyte biomarkers provide the highest sensitivity and specificity necessary for minimum disease detection and that this type of biomarker had sufficient information to predict treatment effectiveness and prognosis.
- **Insufficiency of current biomarkers**: The panel also concluded that no monoanalyte biomarker of neuroendocrine tumours has yet fulfilled these criteria, and there is insufficient information to support the clinical use of miRNA or circulating tumour cells as useful prognostic markers for this disease.
- **Future trial considerations**: The panel considered that trials measuring multianalytes (e.g. neuroendocrine gene transcripts) should also identify how such information can optimise the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumours.

### Current practices and novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary [^1146rT4i]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms comprise a broad, heterogeneous group of tumors that develop from hormone- or neuropeptide-producing cells, which function to regulate various physiological and homeostatic processes. These tumors are diagnosed in approximately 5.25 per 100,000 people in the United States and may occur at slightly higher frequencies among African Americans (6.50 per 100,000) than among whites (4.44 per 100,000).

Neuroendocrine neoplasms can vary widely in their secretion of vasoactive substances, histological appearance, malignancy, and prognosis. Well-differentiated (grade 1 and some grade 2) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) often progress slowly, can secrete hormones that manifest as a set of nonspecific clinical symptoms, and are frequently diagnosed after metastasis to the liver. In contrast, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are often more aggressive and associated with a worse prognosis. Partly because of their lack of differentiation, NECs are less likely to secrete vasoactive substances, and patients are often diagnosed with widespread metastatic disease without first presenting with hormone-related symptoms.

Neuroendocrine cells are an important cellular component of multiple organ systems, such as the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and pancreaticobiliary tracts; therefore, tumors that initiate from neuroendocrine cells can be found in a wide variety of organ systems. Anatomic sites of primary neuroendocrine neoplasms include, but are not limited to, the lung, stomach, jejunum/ileum, pancreas, skin, and at least seven other anatomic sites.

### Neuroendocrine neoplasms: Current and potential diagnostic, predictive and prognostic markers [^112y5Ggq]. Endocrine-related cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Some biomarkers for functioning and non-functioning neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are currently available. Despite their application in clinical practice, results should be interpreted cautiously, considering the variable sensitivity and specificity of these parameters. There is an unmet need for novel biomarkers to improve diagnosis and predict patient outcomes. Currently, several new biomarkers are being evaluated and may become future tools for the management of NENs. These biomarkers include the following:

- **Peptides and growth factors**: Newly investigated markers may offer insights into tumor biology and therapy response.
- **DNA and RNA markers based on genomics analysis**: For example, the so-called NET test, which has been developed for analyzing gene transcripts in circulating blood.
- **Circulating tumor/endothelial/progenitor cells or cell-free tumor DNA**: These represent minimally invasive methods that provide additional information for monitoring treatment response.
- **Improved imaging techniques**: Novel radiolabeled somatostatin analogs or peptides enhance visualization and diagnostic accuracy.

Below, we summarize some future directions in the development of novel diagnostic and predictive/prognostic biomarkers in NENs. This review is focused on circulating and selected tissue markers.

### Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: A current summary of diagnostic, prognostic, and differential diagnostic information [^1172pERE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) continue to present challenges in both diagnostics and prognostics within surgical pathology and clinical medicine. These neoplasms can be categorized into one of three tiers based on histologic characteristics, akin to epithelial neuroendocrine tumors in other anatomical sites. However, grade 1 tumors are the most common and the most difficult to prognosticate.

The most helpful features for assessing the behavior of these lesions include the following criteria:

- **Size**: 3 cm or larger.
- **Mitotic activity**: 2 or more mitoses per 10 high-power (x400) microscopic fields.
- **Marked nuclear atypia**: Especially with atypical mitotic figures.
- **Predominant tumor synthesis of hormones**: Such as gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, somatostatin, glucagon, calcitonin, or adrenocorticotropic hormone.
- **Complete nonfunctionality of the tumor** at an immunohistochemical level.
- **Invasion characteristics**: Including invasion of blood vessels, nerves, or adjacent organs by the neoplasm.

The differential diagnosis of PETs includes:

- Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms
- Acinar carcinomas
- Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
- Plasmacytomas

### Plasma protein biomarkers for the detection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and differentiation from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [^112CM3En]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

The baseline characteristics of the three study groups are shown in Table 1. Baseline chromogranin A (nmol L–1) values, presented as mean (SD) and median (range), were as follows: for controls, 4.4 (4.8) and 3.3 (2–43); for SI-NET, 46.7 (85.5) and 12.0 (2–620); and for PanNET, 55.8 (145.4) and 8.8 (2–785).

- **Clinical characteristics for PanNET, SI-NET, and controls at the time of diagnosis**: Altogether, 33 (24%) patients with SI-NET and 5 (13%) patients with PanNET had primary tumor surgery prior to study inclusion. At the time of diagnosis (baseline visit), 78% of the SI-NET cohort and 57% of the PanNET cohort had CgA levels > ULN. Eighteen (46%) patients with PanNET had fewer than three liver metastases, and nine (23%) patients had no liver metastases. In this non-functional PanNET patient cohort, only a minority (15%) of patients experienced any daily symptoms that could be related to NETs. In the SI-NET cohort, 48% of the patients reported experiencing at least one daily symptom that could be tumor-related, such as flushing, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

### Somatostatin analogs versus active surveillance in small pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^112mfca6]. Pancreas (2025). Low credibility.

Despite being considered rare pancreatic neoplasms, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) account for about 2% of all pancreatic cancers. They represent the second most common malignancy of the pancreas, with their frequency almost doubling over the last 20 years. The majority of newly diagnosed PanNETs are G1-G2 sporadic (not genetically determined), non-functional (NF) lesions that do not cause any syndrome due to hormone hypersecretion. These tumors are typically smaller than 2 cm and are incidentally detected through the widespread use of axial imaging and/or endoscopic ultrasound in clinical practice for other reasons.

- **Factors affecting treatment**: Whether a small NF, G1-G2 PanNET requires treatment may depend on several factors, including both the tumor's characteristics (e.g. grade) and individual patient circumstances. According to the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society guidelines, if the PanNET is NF, not growing rapidly (G1-G2), and not causing symptoms due to its localization in the pancreas (i.e. in the head of the pancreas and likely to cause symptoms versus those in the body/tail), it may not require surgery. Indeed, NF, G1-G2 PanNETs that are 2 cm or smaller are considered to have lower aggressiveness and a better prognosis than larger tumors.

Recent studies have suggested that active surveillance (AS) may be a viable option for certain patients with small, NF, G1-G2 PanNETs compared to surgery. However, data in the literature are inconsistent and limited by the retrospective design of studies and the small number of patients investigated. Because of their relatively heterogeneous biology, the malignant potential of PanNETs and the possibility of progression are not negligible, particularly when considering their clinical outcomes.

### Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^1174MEqH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are characterized by their ability to produce, store, and secrete a large number of peptide hormones and biogenic amines, which can lead to the development of distinct clinical syndromes. Based on this, GEP-NETs are broadly subdivided into "functional" or "non-functional" tumors, with or without a clinical syndrome attributable to hormonal hypersecretion, respectively. Most GEP-NETs do not secrete biologically active substances and present fairly late with symptoms of mass effects or distant metastases.

Among the "functional" tumors, each secreted substance causes a specific clinical syndrome, including carcinoid, Zollinger-Ellison, insulinoma, Verner-Morrison, and glucagonoma syndromes. Specific markers for these syndromes are basal and/or stimulated levels of urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, serum or plasma gastrin, insulin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and glucagon, respectively.

- **General markers**: Chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, serum neuron-specific enolase, and the subunit of glycoprotein hormones have been used for screening in patients without distinct clinical hormone-related syndromes.

The most important general circulating tumor marker is chromogranin A, expressed in 80–90% of all patients with GEP-NETs. Chromogranin A determination is also useful for staging, prognosis, and follow-up, since the serum concentration correlates to the tumor mass.

- **Biochemical screening**: All CoEs screen patients for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with serum calcium measurement. With the exception of three of the four Dutch CoEs, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is also measured. Practices regarding biochemical screening for duodenopancreatic NETs are heterogeneous. Larger centers more often screen with fasting serum gastrin (FSG), glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). There are important variations among countries. Chromogranin A (CgA), glucagon, PP, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are more often determined in the United Kingdom (UK) compared to other countries. Swiss CoEs also measure CgA, glucagon, and PP more often, and the majority of German CoEs determine CgA. Regarding pituitary screening, 93% of CoEs screen with prolactin and 80% with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Additionally, thyroid hormones are measured frequently. Sex hormones (including gonadotropins) and cortisol are measured less frequently as part of screening. CoEs with ≥ 50 patients test for them less often than CoEs with < 50 patients. No country-specific pattern regarding pituitary biochemical screening was observed.

- **Gastrinoma diagnosis and esophagogastroduodenoscopy**: Nearly all CoEs use FSG for diagnosing gastrinoma, with 55% of cases also utilizing gastric pH and less often other tests. The secretin stimulation test is used by 10 CoEs from 8 different countries.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^113ZaRcG]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of NETs is based on clinical manifestations, peptide and amine secretion, and specialized radiological and nuclear imaging. Diagnosis is secured by detailed histology, which should be obtained whenever possible.

- **Biochemistry**: The measurement of the secretory products of NETs is helpful in three respects: to assist with initial diagnosis, to assess the efficacy of treatment, and to assess changing prognosis. The life of patients with NET may be under more immediate threat from the syndrome than from the underlying malignancy. As the syndromes are driven by circulating secretory products, it is usually beneficial to reduce these.

Chromogranin A (CgA) is the only general marker for NETs as it is usually found in high concentrations regardless of whether the tumour is accompanied by hormone-related clinical features. However, chromogranin B (CgB) may be elevated when CgA is in the reference range. Two chromogranin B assays are commercially available from Euro Diagnostic UK and Byorbyt Ltd. Pancreastatin, one of the post-translational products of CgA, is a useful additional marker, as it is only raised in metastatic NETs and results are not confounded by conditions that raise CgA (e.g. treatment with proton pump inhibitors or atrophic gastritis).

Pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a product of the normal pancreas, is secreted in high concentrations from a significant proportion of NETs throughout the gastroenteropancreatic tract (50–80% of pancreatic NETs and > 30% of all gut NETs). Therefore, PP is a useful additional or alternative general marker in some circumstances.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^115J8YPB]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic and periampullary NETs form a special group that requires particular consideration. As with all other neoplasms at these sites, surgery should only be undertaken in specialist hepatopancreatobiliary units. It is recognized that pancreatic resectional surgery is increasingly being performed via laparoscopic access. Currently, the decision whether to perform this surgery via the traditional open or laparoscopic route should be left to the discretion of each designated specialist pancreatic surgery center.

According to the WHO classification, tumor size correlates with malignant potential. Localized tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter warrant aggressive resection. Surgical management remains to be proven effective for non-functioning pancreatic NETs in MEN1 syndrome. Often, the diagnosis is established biochemically before surgery. Although preoperative localization can be difficult, the biochemical diagnosis provides some indication of the likelihood of malignancy (e.g. low with insulinoma). Localization can be aided by hepatic venous sampling after calcium stimulation. For insulinoma, if the lesion is clearly localized before surgery, is near or at the surface of the pancreas, and easily defined at surgery, enucleation may be sufficient, provided histopathology demonstrates complete excision and benign features. However, this may not be possible, and Kausch–Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy, left pancreatectomy, or even total pancreatectomy may be justified in selected cases.

### The importance of the measurement of circulating markers in patients with neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas and gut [^1153KZtF]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The measurement of general and specific biochemical markers in patients with neuroendocrine tumours assists with diagnosis and gives an indication of the effectiveness of treatment, and they may be used as prognostic indicators. There is much agreement that chromogranin A is the most universally helpful marker; it is found to be elevated in the circulation of about 90% of patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours, and there are several excellent commercially available kits which provide reliable estimations. Specific markers are useful for diagnosis and are helpful indicators of treatment effectiveness, particularly where tumour bulk may not change as much as tumour activity. Sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours may secrete more than one peptide, which indicates a worsening prognosis. Because of the wide variation in the progression of neuroendocrine tumours, a prognostic indicator gives a significant advantage to the clinician to facilitate optimum treatment at the optimum stage of disease. Both chromogranin A and neurokinin A have been used as powerful prognostic indicators for midgut carcinoid tumours.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of MEN type 1 and type 2 [^112nATwD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

This is a consensus statement from an international group, mostly of clinical endocrinologists. MEN1 and MEN2 are hereditary cancer syndromes. The commonest tumors secrete PTH or gastrin in MEN1, and calcitonin or catecholamines in MEN2. Management strategies improved after the discoveries of their genes.

Tumor monitoring in MEN1 carriers includes biochemical tests yearly and imaging tests less often. Neck surgery includes subtotal or total parathyroidectomy, parathyroid cryopreservation, and thymectomy. Proton pump inhibitors or somatostatin analogs are the main management for oversecretion of entero-pancreatic hormones, except insulin.

- **Surgical considerations**: The roles for surgery of most entero-pancreatic tumors present several controversies: exclusion of most operations on gastrinomas and indications for surgery on other tumors. Each MEN1 family probably has an inactivating MEN1 germline mutation. Testing for a germline MEN1 mutation gives useful information but rarely mandates an intervention.

The most distinctive MEN2 variants are MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). They vary in aggressiveness of MTC and spectrum of disturbed organs. Mortality in MEN2 is greater from MTC than from pheochromocytoma. Thyroidectomy, during childhood if possible, is the goal in all MEN2 carriers to prevent or cure MTC.

- **Genetic testing in MEN2**: Each MEN2 index case probably has an activating germline RET mutation. RET testing has replaced calcitonin testing to diagnose the MEN2 carrier state. The specific RET codon mutation correlates with the MEN2 syndromic variant.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, especially concerning genetic testing, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasias, including hyperparathyroidism and/or pituitary tumors, a family history of neuroendocrine neoplasms or associated diseases, and features suggestive of a hereditary disease. It is also advised to perform genetic testing in young patients (age < 40 years) with gastrinoma.

### Are biochemical markers of neuroendocrine tumors coreleased with insulin following local calcium stimulation in patients with insulinomas [^111kcyEc]. Pancreas (2011). Low credibility.

The objective was to test whether chromogranin A (CgA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) are released from the pancreas during the selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling test (ASVS) in patients with insulinomas.

- **Methods**: We determined CgA, NSE, PP, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin in blood samples obtained during the ASVS test in 19 patients with insulinomas. Levels following calcium injection into the arteries supplying the tumor were compared with levels following calcium stimulation of arteries supplying healthy pancreatic tissue.

- **Results**: After calcium injection into the artery supplying the insulinoma, a significant 8-fold increase in insulin (range, 2.3–117; P < 0.001), a 3.8-fold increase in C-peptide (1.7–32.4; P < 0.001), and a 1.9-fold increase in proinsulin (0.7–5.3; P < 0.001) were detectable whereas NSE and CgA did not increase. No significant increases in insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, CgA, and NSE concentrations were found after calcium injection into control arteries. Pancreatic polypeptide increased 1.5-fold (0.8–4.5; P = 0.017) after calcium injection into the tumor artery and 2.4-fold (0.8–7.9; P = 0.016) after injection into the control artery.

- **Conclusions**: Insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin are released by insulinoma cells in response to arterial calcium stimulation, whereas CgA and NSE are not released. Also, from our study, it seems that PP may be released by healthy islet cells after calcium stimulation.

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^116kyqBi]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

We studied 89 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs); 73 patients underwent curative surgery and 16 patients did not undergo operation. All tumors were well-differentiated. The clinicopathological characteristics of the 89 patients with PNETs and 57 patients with insulinomas are summarized.

- **Chromogranin A (CgA) serum levels in PNET patients and ROC curves**: The median values of CgA levels in 86 healthy controls, 57 patients with insulinomas, and 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs were 53.4 ng/ml (range 39.1–94.1 ng/ml), 64.8 ng/ml (range 25.0–164.2 ng/ml), and 192.5 ng/ml (range 26.9–9020.7 ng/ml), respectively (Figure 1).

Serum levels of CgA in 89 PNET patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P = 7.2 × 10^-9). Compared with the serum levels of CgA in the healthy controls, CgA levels were significantly elevated in 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (P = 3.7 × 10^-7). In contrast, the levels of CgA in the 57 patients with insulinomas were just slightly higher than those in healthy participants (median 64.8 ng/ml vs. 53.4 ng/ml). The serum levels of CgA in patients with insulinomas (median 64.8 ng/ml) were significantly lower than those in patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (median 192.5 ng/ml), P = 0.001.

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^111yPFwy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are a group of rare tumors. The prevalence and incidence have increased over the past three decades. The clinical presentations of PNETs are very complicated due to the excess of gut peptides produced by functioning PNETs, while symptoms of nonfunctioning PNETs (NF) are obscure. Moreover, most PNETs could be biologically aggressive. Thus, the earlier and accurate diagnosis of PNETs is important to facilitate surgical resection and/or initiate appropriate medical management such as molecular targeted therapy, biotherapy, and other intensive care.

Chromogranin A (CgA) is a 46-kDa glycoprotein, a member of the granin family, which exists within all types of neurons, and normal neuroendocrine cells, and is expressed in NET cells. Over the past two decades, many studies have reported and confirmed that CgA is a reliable diagnostic biomarker for NETs, including gastroentero-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NET). It also might be a prognostic biomarker for NETs. Moreover, several studies have shown that peripheral blood levels of CgA were increased in endocrine-associated tumors, for example, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Recently, elevated serum/plasma levels of CgA were found in a number of non-endocrine solid tumors, such as hepatic carcinomas and pancreatic cancer. Examination of CgA levels could be used not only for diagnosis but also for prognostic evaluation in these tumors.

In recent ENETS and NANETS consensus guidelines, CgA was considered the most practical and useful serum tumor marker in PNET patients. Some studies suggested that testi…

### Chromogranin A is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but not for insulinomas [^1172ibyj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The underlying mechanism of low chromogranin A (CgA) levels in patients with insulinomas is not clear. Nobels et al. speculated that serum levels of CgA were only slightly elevated in subjects with small neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) such as insulinomas and pituitary adenomas. However, there is disagreement in the literature about whether serum CgA levels correlate with the extent of NETs or the size of these tumors.

In the present study, we did not observe a correlation between tumor size and CgA levels in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) (P = 0.545) and in insulinomas alone (P = 0.942). Some non-insulinoma PNETs, despite their relatively small size, still had very high serum levels of CgA. For example, a CgA level of 4572 ng/ml was observed in a gastrinoma measuring 1.5 cm in size, and the highest CgA level in the present study exceeded 9000 ng/ml in a glucagonoma measuring 2.5 cm. Furthermore, one patient with a non-functional (NF) tumor measuring 3.5 cm had a CgA level of 5772 ng/ml, whereas another patient with an NF tumor of 8 cm had a CgA level of 59 ng/ml.

### Preoperative assessment of the pancreas in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^114dp9Ez]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Many serologic and radiographic modalities are used for monitoring multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) patients for pancreaticoduodenal neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). We compared serum markers and imaging studies obtained preoperatively with the gross pathology and immunohistochemical findings and correlated preoperative testing with postoperative outcome.

- **Methods**: From 2000 to 2008, 52 MEN 1 patients [32 (62%) female; median age = 43 years, range 19–74 years] underwent 56 pancreatic operations [49 (88%) distal pancreatectomies] for suspected PNETs. Preoperative serum markers [human pancreatic polypeptide (HPP), gastrin, and glucagon] and imaging [CT, (111)In pentetreotide scintigraphy, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)] were compared to the pathologic findings. Postoperative serum markers and survival were followed.

- **Results**: Human pancreatic polypeptide had the highest agreement between an elevated serum level and positive tumor immunostaining (83% vs. 50% agreement for gastrin vs. 67% agreement for glucagon). Preoperative CT had 81% sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% for PNETs. (111)In pentetreotide scintigraphy had 84% sensitivity and PPV of 96%. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) had 100% sensitivity and PPV, with close correlation (r(s) = 0.93) between the largest lesion seen on EUS and pathology. Median follow-up was 4.3 years (range = 0.1–10.9 years). Overall survival was 89% at 5-year follow-up.

### Chromogranin A in the follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms: Is it really game over? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uvmxo]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about chromogranin A (CgA) during the follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. We hypothesized that serial CgA monitoring might be useful for assessing tumor progression, and we performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: A bibliographical search was conducted on PubMed using the keywords "chromogranin A", "neuroendocrine tumors", "follow-up", and "biomarker" to identify relevant articles published in the last 10 years.

- **Results**: Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Chromogranin A as a follow-up marker shows sensitivity between 46% and 100% and specificity between 68% and 90%. The meta-analysis results revealed an overall accuracy of 84% (95% confidence interval, 81–86.6), a cumulative sensitivity of 74.6% (95% CI, 61.9–85.4), and a cumulative specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 81.3–87.7). These data suggest that circulating CgA has better overall accuracy in the follow-up setting; it can be used to rule in the diagnosis of recurrence/progression rather than to rule it out.

- **Conclusions**: Chromogranin A is more reliable when used to monitor disease progression and response to treatment, and for the early detection of recurrence after treatment rather than in the diagnostic setting. It is more sensible to use this marker in cases where the initial values were impaired.

### Guidelines for the management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (including carcinoid) tumours (NETs) [^115a8FyC]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of gastrinoma may be difficult. Both gastrin and chromogranin A (CgA) levels are raised in gastrinoma, but these markers are also elevated in many common conditions, particularly when gastric acid is reduced or absent. This is observed in patients with atrophic gastritis or those receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric biopsy are always necessary to differentiate gastrinoma from atrophic gastritis. Secretin stimulation and intragastric pH measurement may also be required in some cases.

When circulating gastrin and CgA levels are raised, a fasting specimen is necessary. Autoimmune atrophic gastritis must be excluded, and Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated. Peptic ulcer disease, especially with gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of H. pylori, strongly suggests gastrinoma. PPIs and H2 antagonists elevate both circulating CgA and gastrin levels. PPIs should be cautiously withdrawn and ideally stopped 10 days to 2 weeks before any planned estimation of circulating fasting gastrin. In patients with suspected gastrinoma, oral H2 antagonists may be used instead during this period, but it is advisable to interrupt these 48 hours before the test. Patients with gastrinoma should be advised that it is dangerous to stop PPIs without supervision.

Where a question regarding the diagnosis remains, a secretin test may be performed, with or without gastric acid studies. Patients with gastrinoma may present with circulating gastrin levels less than 10% above the reference range. The majority of gastrinomas are l

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual plasma biochemical assessment of fasting gastrointestinal tract hormone profile. This includes the measurement of gastrin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pancreatic polypeptide, chromogranin A, and insulin, with an associated fasting glucose level, as a minimum for screening of gastropancreatic NETs in patients with MEN1.

### Circulating chromogranin A as a surveillance biomarker in patients with carcinoids-the CASPAR study [^115nZUyc]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To definitively address the question of whether CgA is a useful serum biomarker for GEP-NET, we initiated the first international, multicenter, prospective CgA validation study. The planning, conduct, and reporting of the CASPAR study were done according to Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria, including a detailed study protocol, prespecified analysis, and study success criteria. CgA results were compared with the currently best available oncologic imaging standard, RECIST version 1.1, to assess patients with GEP-NET.

Our results show that CgA measurements and changes in CgA concentrations are useful during the follow-up of patients with GEP-NET. The performance of a clinical algorithm that included serial CgA measurements during patient follow-up and the prespecified cut-off of 50% was successfully validated. We concluded that defined ΔCgA and tumor progression status according to RECIST 1.1 were substantially associated and that the diagnostic performance of binary ΔCgA to diagnose progression is useful for clinical application. With the observed performance results (e.g. 84% NPV and 93% specificity), ΔCgA provides additional useful information about a patient's disease state for clinical decision-making, such as determining imaging frequency. Furthermore, the CgA concentration was associated with tumor burden (sum of the length of lesions). In a sensitivity analysis, performance results were similar for small changes in the definition of ΔCgA, with similar results for using a different or no CgA threshold at all.

### Ectopic acromegaly due to a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor producing growth hormone-releasing hormone [^112dE6HV]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to present a case of acromegaly due to ectopic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1).

- **Methods**: We describe the clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings of the study patient.

- **Results**: A 46-year-old woman presented with clinical and biochemical findings diagnostic of acromegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1.2-cm sellar mass. Following resection of the macroadenoma, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone (GH) levels remained unchanged. Pathologic examination revealed adenomatous changes, including a nonsecretory focus and a prolactin immunopositive area (GH stain negative in both). Octreotide long-acting release was ineffective. Search for an ectopic tumor included normal octreoscan and abdominal computed tomography. GHRH was greater than 1000 pg/mL. Repeated abdominal computed tomography documented a 6.2-cm mass in the tail and body of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that stained positive for GHRH. Postoperatively, serum GHRH and IGF-1 normalized. Re-evaluation of the initial pituitary pathologic specimen revealed additional somatotroph hyperplasia of the adjacent, normal pituitary gland. Primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed, and multigland parathyroid hyperplasia was noted at surgery. Genetic testing was positive for a mutation in the MEN1 gene.

- **Conclusion**: This patient's acromegaly was resistant to somatostatin analogue therapy, reflecting the negative octreoscan.

### Utility of chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon and gastrin in the diagnosis and follow-up of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients [^115qwDLe]. Clinical endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs) are the major source of disease-specific mortality in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) patients. Chromogranin A (CgA), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), glucagon, and gastrin have some diagnostic value in sporadic PNETs, but there is very little evidence for their efficacy in diagnosing PNETs in MEN1 patients.

- **Design**: We performed a retrospective chart review of the existing MEN1 database in our institution.

- **Patients**: One hundred and thirteen patients were eligible for diagnostic value analysis of tumour markers. Patients were excluded if measurement of tumour markers was missing, either 3 months prior to PNET diagnosis (PNET patients) or prior to abdominal imaging (non-PNET patients).

- **Measurements**: Clinicopathologic characteristics and tumour marker measurements were analysed.

- **Results**: Of 293 confirmed MEN1 cases, 55 PNETs and 58 non-PNETs met the inclusion criteria. The area under the curve (AUC) for CgA, PP, glucagon, and gastrin in MEN1 cases was 59.5%, 64.1%, 77.0%, and 75.9%, respectively. The AUC for the combination of CgA, PP, and gastrin was 59.6%. PP, but not CgA, glucagon, or gastrin, was significantly associated with both age and PNET functional status (P = 0.0485 and 0.0188, respectively). No markers were significantly associated with sex, PNET size, tumour number, tumour location, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, or overall survival. CgA values were not significantly lower following PNET resection than pre-operatively (P = 0.554).
