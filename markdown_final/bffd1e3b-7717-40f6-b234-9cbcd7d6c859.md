## Question

Dopamine infusion for celiac disease remission

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of dopamine infusion in inducing or maintaining remission in celiac disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about dopamine's approved clinical indications and mechanism to see if there's any conceptual fit. Then, I should verify guideline-directed therapy for celiac disease remission. Next, I will search for any direct evidence linking dopamine to celiac outcomes, consider mechanistic plausibility, and finally weigh safety data before synthesizing a clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the on-label use of dopamine. Dopamine hydrochloride injection is indicated as a catecholamine vasopressor/inotrope to improve hemodynamic status in distributive shock, shock due to reduced cardiac output, or hypotension with inadequate cardiac output; typical starting doses are 2–5 mcg/kg/min IV infusion, titrated to response, with no approved role in immunomodulation or intestinal mucosal healing, and warnings emphasize correcting hypovolemia, monitoring for arrhythmias, extravasation necrosis, and limb ischemia or gangrene in susceptible patients [^114HZdAG] [^116LpK5g] [^117Vtnre] [^114dYa1k] [^1131mDzE] [^114PiGnt]. I should double-check context-of-use statements as well: sepsis and anaphylaxis management documents position norepinephrine as first-line and consider dopamine only in select hemodynamic scenarios, reinforcing that its domain is circulatory support rather than autoimmune enteropathy treatment [^1168JfHm] [^113EWwkC].

> Next, I should review what induces and maintains remission in celiac disease per guidelines. The standard of care across major societies is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet as the only disease-modifying therapy, with goals including clinical response, serologic improvement, and histologic healing; care includes assessment and replacement of micronutrient deficiencies such as iron, folate, vitamin D, and B12, and structured follow-up to monitor adherence and recovery, with no routine pharmacologic induction agent endorsed for typical cases [^114sJVLJ] [^112aAyDN] [^111G3Req]. I need to ensure I'm not missing pediatric nuances: ESPGHAN confirms diagnosis pathways and similarly emphasizes dietary management without pharmacologic remission strategies; ESsCD also focuses on nonpharmacologic dietary advice and structured evaluation, aligning with this paradigm [^114bXoCv] [^111HWg1u] [^1115qeAj] [^114aiWMd]. Hold on, for refractory contexts and special phenotypes, adjuncts can be considered: budesonide or systemic immunosuppression for refractory celiac disease and dapsone for dermatitis herpetiformis while the diet takes effect, and in highly selected RCD II, investigational options like autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been explored, but these do not intersect with dopamine biology [^111J7FrE] [^113xgA68] [^1112m85X]. As an additional systems guideline touchpoint, ADA standards also reinforce GFD as core management when CD coexists with type 1 diabetes, again with no mention of catecholamines [^1115PHpH].

> Now, I will examine whether any guideline or trial supports dopamine for celiac remission. Wait, let me verify guideline silence first: ACG, AGA, ESPGHAN, and ESsCD documents do not mention dopamine as a diagnostic or therapeutic modality for celiac disease, which strongly argues against any accepted role in remission induction or maintenance [^114sJVLJ] [^112aAyDN] [^114bXoCv] [^1115qeAj]. I should double-check for any physiologic or clinical data: there are no celiac trials or case series evaluating dopamine for mucosal healing, serologic normalization, or symptom control; the closest physiologic study I see shows dopamine reduces gastric tone in healthy volunteers, a directionally unfavorable effect in dysmotility-prone patients, and a postoperative study shows adding low-dose dopamine to norepinephrine increases jejunal mucosal perfusion but without demonstrated disease-modifying outcomes, which does not translate to autoimmune enteropathy remission [^113DpKw9] [^1161kTBF]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — improved perfusion does not equate to immune-mediated villous healing, and the absence of any celiac-focused evidence remains decisive here [^112aAyDN] [^114sJVLJ].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. Celiac disease pathogenesis is driven by gluten-triggered, HLA-DQ2/DQ8–restricted, T cell–mediated autoimmunity with villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia; removing the antigen with a GFD or suppressing immune activity in refractory states is the logical therapeutic lever, not adrenergic or dopaminergic receptor stimulation [^115ek4Sw] [^114sJVLJ]. But wait, what if peripheral dopamine signaling affected enteric function enough to help? The Parkinson's GI literature cautions that enteric neurotransmission differs from central pathways, and dopamine replacement is not a viable approach for GI dysfunction, underscoring the disconnect between dopaminergic pharmacology and the pathophysiology relevant to mucosal autoimmunity in celiac disease [^1116FNfM]. I should confirm, therefore, that there is no plausible immune-modulatory pathway here that would induce remission, and nothing in the references suggests such an effect [^112aAyDN] [^114sJVLJ].

> Next, I should review safety in contexts relevant to celiac patients. I initially considered the historical belief that "renal-dose" dopamine might protect kidneys, but I need to check high-quality data; a large randomized controlled trial found no renal-protective effect of low-dose dopamine in critical illness, and multiple surgical cohort analyses link intraoperative dopamine to higher rates of postoperative AKI, more frequent renal replacement therapy, and longer hospital stays, which would be particularly undesirable in potentially volume-depleted or malnourished celiac patients, even if mechanistically unrelated to CD itself [^117R9o76] [^111Rm9gT] [^111g2KuX] [^1142RsJz] [^115zFrnU]. I should also confirm GI and vascular adverse effects: dopamine dose-dependently reduces gastric tone, and labeling warns of extravasation necrosis and limb ischemia, reiterating the need to reserve its use for hemodynamic indications with careful monitoring rather than elective, non-indicated uses in CD; preclinical work also suggests potentially unfavorable immune modulation in sepsis models, which, while not definitive for humans, further cautions against off-target use [^113DpKw9] [^1131mDzE] [^113VBKfC].

> Synthesis time. Given an indication mismatch, unanimous guideline exclusion, absence of any celiac-focused efficacy data, pathophysiologic implausibility for modifying adaptive immune injury, and a nontrivial safety burden, dopamine infusion has no role in inducing or maintaining remission in celiac disease; it should be used in celiac patients only for standard hemodynamic indications when clearly indicated by shock physiology and with usual vasopressor precautions, while remission should be pursued with a strict gluten-free diet, nutritional optimization, and, in refractory cases, evidence-based immunosuppressive strategies under specialty care [^114HZdAG] [^114sJVLJ] [^112aAyDN] [^111G3Req] [^111J7FrE] [^1112m85X]. Let me reconsider whether any exception exists; I should double-check one more time, but nothing in these references supports dopamine as a disease-modifying agent for celiac disease, and my clinical recommendation is therefore to avoid dopamine for remission and adhere to guideline-directed management, reserving dopamine strictly for appropriate shock states when necessary [^114sJVLJ] [^112aAyDN] [^114HZdAG].

---

No — dopamine infusion is **not indicated for celiac disease remission**. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support for its use in celiac disease, and it is not recommended by ACG [^114sJVLJ] or ESPGHAN. Dopamine is reserved for hemodynamic support in shock [^114HZdAG] — not for immune or mucosal healing in celiac disease. The **standard of care remains a strict gluten-free diet** [^114sJVLJ], with immunosuppressive therapy reserved for refractory cases.

---

## Current standard of care for celiac disease remission

The cornerstone of celiac disease management is a **strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD)** [^114sJVLJ], which leads to clinical, serologic, and histologic remission in most patients. Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) emphasize dietary adherence and regular monitoring of serologic markers (anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA) and histologic assessment to confirm remission [^112aAyDN]. In **refractory celiac disease (RCD)** [^11581EaN] — defined by nonresponse to a strict GFD — immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids (e.g. budesonide) or immunomodulators (e.g. azathioprine) may be considered [^114sJVLJ] [^111J7FrE]. These treatments are reserved for select cases and are not part of routine management.

## Dopamine infusion: pharmacological properties and clinical indications

Dopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter and hormone primarily used as a **vasopressor** [^114HZdAG] to manage hemodynamic instability in shock states [^1168JfHm], including distributive shock and shock due to reduced cardiac output. It is indicated to improve hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and renal perfusion. The recommended starting dosage in adults is 2 to 5 mcg/kg/min [^117Vtnre], titrated to hemodynamic response, with a maximum of 50 mcg/kg/min [^116LpK5g]. Dopamine infusion is associated with **significant adverse effects**, including arrhythmias, tissue ischemia, and hypotension upon abrupt discontinuation.

---

## Evidence regarding dopamine infusion in celiac disease remission

A comprehensive review of the available literature reveals **no clinical studies**, case reports, or guidelines [^114sJVLJ] supporting dopamine infusion to induce remission in celiac disease. It has not been investigated or recommended as a therapeutic intervention for celiac disease in any clinical context. The only documented clinical indications are related to **hemodynamic support** [^114HZdAG] in shock states, not autoimmune or inflammatory conditions such as celiac disease. It is also associated with significant risks and adverse effects, making it unsuitable for chronic or long-term management of autoimmune diseases.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of dopamine infusion in celiac disease patients

Administering dopamine infusion to celiac disease patients carries **significant risks and adverse effects**, including:

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Dopamine infusion can cause serious arrhythmias, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions [^1131mDzE].

- **Tissue ischemia**: Dopamine infusion can cause severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis [^1131mDzE].

- **Hypotension**: Abrupt discontinuation of dopamine infusion can result in significant hypotension.

- **Immune modulation**: Dopamine infusion has been shown to modulate immune function, potentially exacerbating autoimmune responses [^113VBKfC].

Given these risks, dopamine infusion is **not a safe or appropriate therapeutic option** for celiac disease patients.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements from major gastroenterological societies (ACG, ESPGHAN, ESsCD) **do not mention or recommend** dopamine infusion for celiac disease remission [^1115qeAj] [^114sJVLJ]. The only recommended interventions are strict adherence to a gluten-free diet and, in refractory cases, immunosuppressive therapies.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for celiac disease remission

Several **alternative pharmacological interventions** have been investigated for celiac disease remission, including:

- **Budesonide**: A locally active corticosteroid used in refractory celiac disease, showing clinical improvement in symptoms [^111J7FrE].

- **Rituximab**: A monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-positive B cells, used in refractory cases with aberrant T-cell populations.

- **Low-dose naltrexone**: Investigated for its potential immunomodulatory effects, though evidence remains limited.

However, these interventions are reserved for specific cases of refractory celiac disease and are not part of routine management [^114sJVLJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** [^114sJVLJ] for dopamine infusion in celiac disease remission. It is not recommended due to significant risks and adverse effects [^1131mDzE]. The **standard of care remains a strict gluten-free diet**, with immunosuppressive therapies reserved for refractory cases.

### Effects of clonidine and dopamine on gastric tone [^113DpKw9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

The effects of clonidine and dopamine, both alone and together, on gastric tone were studied using an electronic barostat, enabling volume changes to be measured in an intragastric bag with a constant preset pressure.

- **Methods**: Nine healthy male volunteers were each studied on two occasions in a randomized order. During each study period, a continuous infusion of dopamine was administered, starting with a dose of 2.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) and increasing at 15-minute intervals to 5.0 and 7.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Clonidine, 150 microg intravenously, was administered on one occasion during the infusion of dopamine (7.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) and on the other occasion, 15 minutes before the dopamine infusion started.

- **Results**: During dopamine infusion, the intragastric bag volume increased, indicating a decrease in gastric tone, in a dose-related manner (total increase 290 ± 114 mL). Clonidine given either during or before dopamine infusion did not influence the bag volume. When dopamine infusion started 15 minutes after clonidine administration, the bag volume did not change until the infusion of dopamine reached 7.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) (total increase 205 ± 156 mL).

- **Conclusions**: Dopamine reduced gastric tone in a dose-related manner, and clonidine did not influence gastric tone per se. If clonidine is administered before dopamine, the effects of dopamine are reduced.

### Barhemsys [^116mRWEM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Amisulpride is a selective dopamine-2 (D2) and dopamine-3 (D3) receptor antagonist. D2 receptors are located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and respond to the dopamine released from nerve endings. Activation of the CTZ relays stimuli to the vomiting center involved in emesis. Studies in multiple species indicate that D3 receptors in the area postrema also play a role in emesis. Studies conducted in ferrets have shown that amisulpride inhibits emesis caused by apomorphine, with an estimated ED50 of less than 1 mcg/kg subcutaneously, and inhibits cisplatin-induced emesis at 2 mg/kg and morphine-induced emesis at 3 to 6 mg/kg when given intravenously.

Amisulpride has no appreciable affinity for any other receptor types apart from low affinities for 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics: Cardiac electrophysiology**: A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between amisulpride concentration and ΔΔQTcF. In 40 healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects, the maximum mean difference (95% upper confidence bound) in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction (ΔΔQTcF) was 5.0 (7.1) milliseconds following a 2-minute intravenous infusion of 5 mg BARHEMSYS and 23.4 (25.5) milliseconds after an 8-minute intravenous infusion of 40 mg BARHEMSYS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The recommended infusion rate is 1 to 2 minutes for 5 mg or 10 mg of BARHEMSYS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: After an intravenous infusion, the peak plasma concentration of amisulpride is achieved at the end of the infusion.

### Budesonide in the treatment of refractory celiac disease [^111J7FrE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

This study explores the use of corticosteroids in patients with refractory celiac disease. To minimize systemic side effects, the researchers assessed a locally active sustained release corticosteroid, specifically budesonide, which has minimal systemic bioavailability. This evaluation was conducted as part of an open-labeled, non-controlled study.

Patients who received budesonide for refractory celiac disease were categorized based on dietary response and intraepithelial lymphocyte classification, whether polyclonal (type I) or clonal (type II). The effectiveness of budesonide was evaluated both globally and in terms of reduction in bowel movements.

A total of 29 patients (72% female) were administered budesonide for an average of 6.7 ± 8.5 months. Among them, 5 patients (18%) had type II disease (clonal T-cell population). The medication was effective in 76% of cases, with 55% achieving complete response. Improvement occurred when budesonide was administered alone or alongside oral corticosteroids and/or azathioprine. Notably, responses were observed in patients with both primary and secondary refractory disease and those with type II disease, irrespective of microscopic colitis presence (N = 7). No enhancement was seen in the duodenal biopsy during the study period, and no side effects of budesonide were reported.

In conclusion, budesonide appears to be valuable in managing refractory celiac disease.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^111G3Req]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, particularly with respect to the evaluation for micronutrient deficiencies, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend evaluating and treating micronutrient deficiencies in patients with newly diagnosed CD. Consider testing for deficiency in:

- **Iron**: Treatment should be considered based on individual patient needs.
- **Folic acid**: Ensure that patients receive appropriate supplementation if needed.
- **Vitamin D**: Monitor levels to maintain adequate bone health.
- **Vitamin B12**: Assess especially in patients displaying neurological symptoms.

### Epitol [^113pxig3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The prognosis in cases of severe poisoning is critically dependent upon prompt elimination of the drug, which may be achieved by inducing vomiting, irrigating the stomach, and taking appropriate steps to diminish absorption. If these measures cannot be implemented without risk on the spot, the patient should be transferred at once to a hospital while ensuring that vital functions are safeguarded. There is no specific antidote.

- **Elimination of the drug**: Induction of vomiting and gastric lavage. Even when more than 4 hours have elapsed following ingestion of the drug, the stomach should be repeatedly irrigated, especially if the patient has also consumed alcohol.

- **Measures to reduce absorption**: Activated charcoal and laxatives.

- **Measures to accelerate elimination**: Forced diuresis.

Dialysis is indicated only in severe poisoning associated with renal failure. Replacement transfusion is indicated in severe poisoning in small children.

- **Respiratory depression**: Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen.

- **Hypotension, shock**: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, the use of vasoactive substances should be considered.

- **Convulsions**: Diazepam or barbiturates. Warning: Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient.

### Treatment approaches of gastrointestinal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, therapeutical options and future perspectives [^1116FNfM]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a common but often underestimated feature in Parkinson's disease (PD). Out of the multimodal spectrum of treatment options, there are currently only a few pharmacological treatments available to improve gastrointestinal motility and symptoms. Since enteric nervous function is mainly regulated by transmitters different from those involved in the brain, dopamine replacement is not a viable treatment option in PD patients. This article focuses on the known regulatory mechanisms of GI function and presents known and upcoming treatment options for GI dysfunction in PD.

### Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in refractory celiac disease with aberrant T cells [^1112m85X]. Blood (2007). High credibility.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an increasingly accepted treatment for refractory autoimmune diseases. Refractory celiac disease with aberrant T cells (RCD type II) is unresponsive to available therapies and carries a high risk of transition into enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). This study reports on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of ASCT in patients with RCD type II.

Thirteen patients with RCD type II were evaluated. Seven patients (4 men, 3 women, mean age 61.5 years [range, 51–69 years]) underwent transplantation. After conditioning with fludarabine and melphalan, ASCT was performed. Patients were monitored for response, adverse effects, and hematopoietic reconstitution. All 7 patients completed the mobilization and leukapheresis procedures successfully and subsequently underwent conditioning and transplantation. Engraftment occurred in all patients. No major nonhematologic toxicity or transplantation-related mortality was observed.

There was a significant reduction in the aberrant T cells in duodenal biopsies associated with improvement in clinical well-being and normalization of hematologic and biochemical markers (mean follow-up, 15.5 months; range, 7–30 months). One patient died 8 months after transplantation from progressive neuroceliac disease. These preliminary results showed that high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT seems feasible and safe and might result in long-term improvement of patients with RCD type II whose condition did not respond promptly to available drugs.

### Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of celiac-associated arthritis: A retrospective cohort study [^1113EW48]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

- **Treatment**: Treatments received over the course of therapy for celiac-associated arthritis are detailed in the analysis.

Four of the twelve patients (33.3%) who were seen at a 6-month follow-up visit reported starting a gluten-free diet. However, among those, none had cleared celiac antibodies. The remaining patients did not yet have a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease. All patients were started on a gluten-free diet once celiac disease diagnosis was confirmed, and all but one reported compliance with the diet at the last documented rheumatology visit. Nevertheless, only 3 patients (23.1%) had cleared celiac antibodies by the last documented visit (median time from celiac diagnosis 64 months, IQR 42–164); clearance was documented a median of 14 months (IQR 3–35) after initiation of the gluten-free diet.

Ten children (76.9%) underwent intra-articular joint injections, eight of which occurred in the first 6 months of treatment. Eleven (84.6%) were started on systemic therapy with a DMARD (n = 4), a biologic (n = 1), or both (n = 6). Seven of these began systemic medications in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Two patients (16.7%) were never on systemic medications and achieved remission with intra-articular corticosteroid injections and a gluten-free diet alone. Both patients had mild joint disease from the onset, with only one joint involved at diagnosis. One was a 15-year-old male with negative ANA and right wrist arthritis.

### Effects of norepinephrine alone and norepinephrine plus dopamine on human intestinal mucosal perfusion [^1161kTBF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effect of norepinephrine alone and norepinephrine combined with dopamine on jejunal mucosal perfusion, gastric-arterial pCO(2) gradient, and global splanchnic oxygen demand-supply relationship after cardiac surgery, a prospective interventional study was conducted in a university cardiothoracic intensive care unit.

Eighteen patients were studied during propofol sedation and mechanical ventilation after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass surgery.

- **Interventions**: After control measurements, each patient received norepinephrine (50 ± 26 ng/kg/min) to increase mean arterial blood pressure by 30%, followed by the addition of low-dose dopamine (2.6 ± 0.3 µg/kg/min). Postdrug control measurements were performed 120 minutes after discontinuation of the catecholamines.

- **Measurements and results**: Norepinephrine induced a 32% increase in systemic vascular resistance with no change in cardiac index. Neither jejunal mucosal perfusion, assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry, nor gastric-arterial pCO(2) gradient (tonometry) was affected by norepinephrine. Splanchnic O(2)-extraction increased (P < 0.05), and this increase was positively correlated to the individual dose of norepinephrine (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Splanchnic lactate extraction was increased by norepinephrine (P < 0.05). None of the patients had splanchnic lactate production during norepinephrine infusion. The addition of dopamine increased cardiac index by 27% (P < 0.001) and decreased splanchnic O(2) extraction. Dopamine increased jejunal mucosal perfusion by 32% (P < 0.001).

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1115PHpH]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of celiac disease, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering a gluten-free diet for the treatment and avoidance of complications in patients with confirmed celiac disease in type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is also advisable to offer young patients and their caregivers a consultation with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in managing both diabetes and celiac disease.

### Effects of dopamine donor pretreatment on graft survival after kidney transplantation: A randomized trial [^117NfgXA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Donor dopamine improves initial graft function after kidney transplantation due to its antioxidant properties. We investigated if a 4 µg/kg per minute continuous dopamine infusion administered after brain-death confirmation affects long-term graft survival and examined the exposure-response relationship with treatment duration.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Five-year follow-up of 487 renal transplant patients from 60 European centers who had participated in the randomized, multicenter trial of dopamine donor pretreatment between 2004 and 2007 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00115115).

- **Results**: Follow-up was complete in 99.2% of participants. Graft survival was 72.6% versus 68.7% (P = 0.34), and 83.3% versus 80.4% (P = 0.42) after death-censoring in treatment and control arms according to trial assignment. Although infusion times varied substantially in the treatment arm (range 0–32.2 hours), duration of the dopamine infusion and all-cause graft failure exhibited an exposure-response relationship (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.92 to 1.00, per hour). Cumulative frequency curves of graft survival and exposure time of the dopamine infusion indicated a maximum response rate at 7.10 hours (95% CI, 6.99 to 7.21), which almost coincided with the optimum infusion time for improvement of early graft function (7.05 hours; 95% CI, 6.92 to 7.18). Taking infusion time of 7.1 hours as the threshold in subsequent graft survival analyses indicated a relevant benefit: Overall, 81.5% versus 68.5% (P = 0.03); and 90.3% versus 80.2% (P = 0.04).

### Relationship between intraoperative dopamine infusion and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing open abdominal aorta aneurysm repair [^111pzy9V]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, intraoperative dopamine use greatly increased postoperative AKI and was associated with higher postoperative RRT and a longer hospital length of stay in patients undergoing AAA repair. However, intraoperative norepinephrine infusion did not increase the incidence of AKI. The use of intraoperative dopamine should be avoided during open AAA repair. We may be careful to use dopamine during open AAA repair.

### Dopamine-induced changes in renal blood flow in normals and in patients with renal dysfunction [^114J8WV3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Despite their controversial effect, "renal" doses of dopamine (3–5 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) are often used in intensive care units to preserve renal function and to improve final outcomes.

- **Aim**: To assess the effects of different doses of dopamine on renal blood flow in patients with normal renal function and in patients with renal dysfunction.

- **Methods and results**: In 17 patients with normal renal function and 12 patients with moderate renal dysfunction, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and average peak renal flow velocities (FlowWire APV) were continuously recorded at baseline and during IV administration of increasing dopamine doses (3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 microg kg(-1) min(-1)). MAP and HR did not change during infusion of 3–5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) but increased to the same extent in both groups during infusion of > 10 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Baseline APV was similar in both groups. Infusion of 3–5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) induced a significant change in APV only in patients with normal renal function. In patients with renal dysfunction, APV increased only during infusion of > 10 microg kg(-1) min(-1) in parallel with MAP and HR.

- **Conclusion**: "Renal" doses of dopamine increase renal blood flow in normals but not in patients with moderate renal dysfunction.

### Effect of norepinephrine infusion on hepatic blood flow and its interaction with somatostatin: An observational cohort study [^113b9ffz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

The administration of norepinephrine (NE) reduced total hepatic blood flow (HBF) by decreasing hepatic arterial flow (HAF), while the effect on portal venous flow (PVF) remained unclear. Patients treated with somatostatin (SOMATO) had a lower PVF at baseline, which remained unaffected during NE infusion. In these patients, the decrease in total HBF with NE was entirely related to the decrease in HAF. In SOMATO-untreated patients, PVF also significantly decreased with NE.

### Celiac disease: A clinical review [^115ek4Sw]. Abdominal Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Celiac disease can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include poor weight gain and growth, malabsorption, loss of appetite, delayed puberty, and the presence of antiendomysial antibody. Patients may also experience neuropathy, limb numbness, arthritis, increased serum AST levels, and faltering growth.

Malnutrition, early menopause, abdominal distension, fatigue, pruritus, and dermatitis herpetiformis are other common features. The disease can lead to hyposplenism, iron deficiency anemia, and positive anti-tissue transglutaminase tests. Additional symptoms include steatorrhea, weight loss, late menarche, constipation, osteopenia, and loss of balance.

The condition is linked to gluten-sensitive enteropathy, anxiety, increased serum ALT levels, chronic diarrhea, cognitive impairment, and chronic watery diarrhea. Short stature, flatulence, depression, osteoporosis, amenorrhea, nausea, diarrhea, and various celiac disease findings are prevalent. Other issues include abdominal pain, a positive schilling test, genetic predispositions, skin rash, anemia, joint pain, vomiting, and positive anti-gliadin antibodies.

Patients may also experience bloating, headache, and associations with HLA-DQ2/DQ8 alleles.

### Sandostatin LAR depot [^1138LdG5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Steatorrhea and malabsorption of dietary fats**: New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration, and loose stool have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including Sandostatin LAR depot. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If a new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms is reported in patients receiving Sandostatin LAR depot, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly.

- **Changes in vitamin B12 levels**: Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during therapy with Sandostatin LAR depot.

- **Changes in zinc levels**: Octreotide has been investigated for the reduction of excessive fluid loss from the GI tract in patients with conditions producing such a loss. If such patients are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), serum zinc may rise excessively when the fluid loss is reversed. Patients on TPN and octreotide should have periodic monitoring of zinc levels.

- **Monitoring: Laboratory tests**: Laboratory tests that may be helpful as biochemical markers in determining and following patient response depend on the specific tumor. Based on diagnosis, measurement of the following substances may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2).

### Rituximab treatment for recalcitrant dermatitis herpetiformis [^1155NUBm]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Importance

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering condition seen in the context of celiac disease. While typically managed by a gluten-free diet and dapsone, treatment of DH refractory to standard treatments is not well defined.

Observations

A man in his 80s with DH not controlled by a gluten-free diet (with poor adherence), dapsone, and conventional immune-suppressing agents responded to treatment with rituximab according to the lymphoma protocol (4 weekly infusions of 375 mg/m²). Thirteen months after treatment, the patient had achieved complete resolution of pruritus and clinical manifestations of the disease, as well as normalization of antibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminases. He achieved complete clinical and serological remission and has remained symptom-free up to 18 months following treatment.

Conclusions and relevance

We present here the first case of a patient with DH treated with rituximab who achieved complete clinical and serological remission. We suggest rituximab as a viable treatment option for recalcitrant DH.

### Subcutaneous levodopa infusion for Parkinson's disease: 1-year data from the open-label BeyoND study [^112uKkw9]. Movement Disorders (2021). High credibility.

**Patient flow and baseline characteristics**: Of the 276 patients screened, 214 patients were enrolled (24-hour dosing regimen: n = 90; 16-hour dosing regimen: n = 124) at 46 sites in eight countries. One hundred and twenty patients (56.1%) completed 12 months in the study and 94 (43.9%) terminated early, with a similar proportion of early terminations between the two regimens. Leading causes for premature discontinuation over the course of the study were consent withdrawal (n = 42, 19.6%) and adverse events (AEs) (n = 37, 17.3%), most of which discontinued before day 150. Concomitant catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor use and low baseline body mass index (BMI) (< 20) were each associated with higher rates of discontinuations (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, P = 0.01 and OR 3.15, P = 0.03, respectively). Rates of discontinuation decreased from 49% to 29% for patients enrolled after the March 2018 protocol amendment and increased site training on infusion site reactions (ISRs).

### Sustained striatal dopamine levels following intestinal levodopa infusions in Parkinson's disease patients [^117FDkFP]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate in vivo the ability of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusions to produce sustained striatal dopamine levels and to improve clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease patients.

- **Methods**: Six advanced Parkinson's disease patients underwent serial [11C]raclopride PET scans to assess the levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion-induced rises in striatal dopamine, as reflected by a fall in dopamine-D2/3 receptor availability. These patients had a baseline scan conducted in an OFF-dopaminergic stimulation state, followed by two scans post-initiation of the infusions. Striatal D2/3 binding was measured in subregions corresponding to sensorimotor, limbic, and cognitive/associative functions.

- **Results**: The mean striatal [11C]raclopride nondisplaceable binding potential decreased by 14.0% to 16.7% in the sensorimotor region, 12.0% to 14.4% in the limbic region, and 8.7% to 11.6% in the cognitive/associative region at 1- to 10-hour time points (P < 0.01). Notably, reductions in the sensorimotor subregion [11C]raclopride nondisplaceable binding potential correlated with reductions in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores over the course of the infusion (r = 0.81; P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusions generate a stable rise in striatal dopamine levels and are associated with improvements in motor manifestations.

### Relationship between intraoperative dopamine infusion and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing open abdominal aorta aneurysm repair [^111g2KuX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Among the 381 patients who underwent open abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) repair surgery during the study period, 294 patients were included and analyzed. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 64 out of 294 patients (21.8%) after open AAA surgery. Postoperative AKI occurred in 17 out of 44 patients who received an intraoperative dopamine infusion and in 47 out of 250 patients who did not receive an intraoperative dopamine infusion, respectively (38.6% vs. 18.8%, p = 0.003).

The incidences of AKI were higher across all dopamine dose range groups compared to the no dopamine group. Moreover, the incidence of AKI in patients who received renal-dose dopamine infusion (≤ 3 mcg/kg/min) was higher than in those who did not receive dopamine infusion (50% vs. 18.8%, p < 0.05). At doses exceeding 3 mcg/kg/min, the incidence was 50% compared to 28.6% in the corresponding group without dopamine (p = 0.0081).

The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a tendency for lower survival in both the dopamine and norepinephrine infusion groups without statistical significance (Fig. 3).

- **Postoperative outcomes**: Patients who received the dopamine infusion underwent postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT) five times more frequently than those who did not receive the dopamine infusion (6.8% vs. 1.2%; p = 0.045). The ICU length of stay was comparable between the two groups (1 vs. 1 day; p = 0.996). However, the hospital length of stay was significantly longer in patients who received an intraoperative dopamine infusion (18 vs. 16 days, p = 0.024).

### Relationship between intraoperative dopamine infusion and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing open abdominal aorta aneurysm repair [^112R6q7w]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

In this retrospective study, intraoperative dopamine infusion was associated with more than three times the incidence of postoperative AKI, more than five times the likelihood of postoperative RRT, and a longer hospital length of stay in patients undergoing open AAA surgery. Conversely, intraoperative norepinephrine infusion was not associated with postoperative AKI but rather tended to decrease its incidence.

Surgery is a leading cause of AKI in hospitalized patients, accounting for up to 40% of in-hospital AKI cases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that postoperative AKI in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is associated with high in-hospital mortality, long-term mortality, and an increase in cardiovascular complications. Even in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative AKI is a well-known complication that results in higher adverse postoperative outcomes, including a high 90-day mortality rate and increased hospital costs. The mechanisms of postoperative renal dysfunction are multifactorial, involving renal ischemia, circulatory failure, nephrotoxic agents, and an inflammatory stress response to surgery.

AAA repair is one of the most high-risk noncardiac surgeries for postoperative AKI. Up to 33% of patients undergoing AAA repair develop postoperative AKI. The development of AKI is known to affect postoperative morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in patients undergoing AAA surgery. Patients requiring RRT after AAA surgery have a high mortality rate. Additionally, postoperative AKI not requiring RRT also increases the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Comtan [^1171HGLh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Diarrhea and colitis

In clinical studies, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10%) and 16 of 400 (4%) of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively. In patients treated with Comtan, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of Comtan. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.

Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases, diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery, and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when Comtan treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy-confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of Comtan but recurred after retreatment with Comtan.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Comtan, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains.

### Relationship between intraoperative dopamine infusion and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing open abdominal aorta aneurysm repair [^116rGWNm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

There have been insufficient studies evaluating the effect of intraoperative dopamine use on postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. A randomized controlled trial with a small number of patients (n = 37) undergoing elective major abdominal vascular surgery suggested that a low-dose dopamine infusion during the postoperative period failed to show a reno-protective effect. In a retrospective study involving 162 patients undergoing AAA repair, intraoperative dopamine infusion was associated with postoperative complications. Although these complications included renal issues, separate analysis data on AKI was not provided.

- **Norepinephrine infusion**: Although the association was not significant, norepinephrine infusion appeared to be associated with a decreased incidence of AKI, suggesting norepinephrine successfully maintained renal perfusion without damaging the kidneys. Previous studies have shown that norepinephrine increases cardiac index and improves systemic oxygen delivery dose-dependently via the beta-1 effect. In addition, norepinephrine induces an increase in renal perfusion pressure by increasing renal vascular resistance through vasoconstriction mediated by the alpha-1 effect and pressure-dependent renal auto-regulation. Therefore, norepinephrine may be an alternative to dopamine. Validating this finding in a prospective study with a larger patient population would be valuable.

### Changes in cardiovascular effects of dopamine in response to graded hypothermia in vivo [^113HEsS6]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Inotropic drugs are frequently administered in hypothermic patients to support an assumed inadequate circulation, but their pharmacologic properties at reduced temperatures are largely unknown. Thus, we estimated dopamine pharmacokinetics as well as left ventricular function and global hemodynamics after dopamine infusions at various core temperatures in a pig model of surface cooling and rewarming.

- **Design**: Prospective, randomized, open, placebo-controlled experimental study.

- **Setting**: University-affiliated animal research laboratory.

- **Subjects**: Sixteen healthy, anesthetized juvenile (2–3 months) castrated male pigs.

- **Interventions**: After normothermic infusions of dopamine at different doses (4, 8, and 16 μg/kg/min), effects of dopamine (n = 8) or saline (n = 8) were tested at 25 °C and during rewarming (30–34 °C).

- **Measurements and main results**: Dopamine half-time was 5.4 ± 0.7 min at normothermia, increased to 11.6 ± 0.8 min at 25 °C, but returned to control during rewarming at 34–35 °C. Dopamine infusion at 25 °C elevated dopamine plasma concentration four-fold compared to the same infusion rate at normothermia, leading to increased systemic vascular resistance index not seen at normothermia. In contrast to the dopamine-mediated increase in cardiac index observed at normothermia, high-dose dopamine at 25 °C left cardiac index unchanged despite a concomitant increase in heart rate, since stroke index decreased by 43%. During rewarming, cardiovascular effects of dopamine at moderate hypothermia (30–34 °C) were principally similar to responses during normothermia.

### Relationship between intraoperative dopamine infusion and postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing open abdominal aorta aneurysm repair [^115zFrnU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

In the propensity score-matched samples (44 patients who received the dopamine infusion vs. 132 patients who did not receive the dopamine infusion), the overall incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) was 44 out of 176 (25%). The dopamine infusion was an independent risk factor for postoperative AKI in all multivariable analyses within the matched samples (adjusted model 1, OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.27–6.52, p = 0.011; adjusted model 2, OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.25–5.70, p = 0.030; Supplementary Table 1 in Additional file 1).

- **Impact of norepinephrine infusion**: In contrast, when the same analyses were conducted based on the use of norepinephrine, the intraoperative norepinephrine infusion group exhibited a tendency toward decreased postoperative AKI (Fig. 1). Additionally, the norepinephrine infusion was not associated with postoperative AKI after propensity score matching (adjusted model 1, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20–1.03, p = 0.058; adjusted model 2, OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31–1.32, p = 0.225; Supplementary Table 2 in Additional file 1) without statistical significance. Furthermore, the patients who received an intraoperative norepinephrine infusion demonstrated a lower incidence of postoperative AKI (use vs. no use: 19.3% vs. 22.4%; p = 0.615, Supplementary Fig. 2 in Additional file 1).

- **Comparison of infusion groups**: When patients were divided into four groups (norepinephrine infusion group, dopamine infusion group, no drug infusion group, and both drug infusion group), the incidence of AKI was highest in the both drug infusion group (45.4%), followed by the dopamine infusion group (36.4%), and the no drug infusion group (20.1%). The norepinephrine infusion group (13.0%) had the lowest incidence of postoperative AKI.

### Clinical presentation and long-term follow-up of dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency [^1177dDau]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Anemia is also clearly part of the clinical presentation of DBH-deficiency in most Dutch patients. It is mostly mild and can improve with treatment using L-DOPS. Chronic kidney disease is often associated with anemia due to relative erythropoietin deficiency, especially in moderate to severe kidney failure. However, anemia was also found in patients with DBH-deficiency who exhibited only mildly decreased kidney function; therefore, this is not likely to be the only explanation. Sympathetic innervation of the bone marrow plays an important role in hematopoiesis. Adrenergic signals induce mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells, and continuous trafficking of stem cells between bone marrow and blood compartments likely contributes to maintaining normal hematopoiesis. Anemia, with or without reduced kidney function, has been described in several other autonomic disorders. The precise mechanism of anemia in DBH-deficiency and the reason it does not resolve completely with treatment in most patients remain unknown.

Hypomagnesaemia was present in five Dutch patients with DBH-deficiency before and during treatment. Fractional magnesium excretion was increased in four Dutch patients. Magnesium handling depends on gastrointestinal uptake and renal excretion, with fine regulation of magnesium transport in the distal tubule. The precise pathophysiology, clinical significance, and optimal treatment strategy of hypomagnesaemia in patients with DBH-deficiency require further investigation.

While plasma norepinephrine showed the expected — although incomplete — increase on L-DOPS…

### Patients discharged from the intensive care unit on a dopamine infusion-a retrospective, observational study [^112jWKbx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety of discharging cardiac surgical patients from the intensive care unit (ICU) to wards while the patients are still receiving a dopamine infusion.

- **Design**: Retrospective, observational study.
- **Setting**: Cardiothoracic ICU of a tertiary academic hospital in the United Kingdom.
- **Participants**: The study comprised all cardiac surgical patients older than 18 years admitted between September 1, 2015, and September 16, 2016, to the ICU and subsequently discharged to a surgical ward. Patients were divided into two groups: a dopamine group with patients discharged with a dopamine infusion and a control group with patients discharged without any dopamine infusion.
- **Interventions**: None.
- **Measurements and main results**: The hospital mortality rate was comparable in both groups (0.7% in the dopamine group vs. 0.2% in the control group [p = 0.11]), despite the median logistic EuroSCORE being significantly higher in the dopamine group (7.0 vs. 3.8 [p < 0.01]). The ICU readmission rate was higher in the dopamine group (6.6% vs. 2.4% [p < 0.01]). ICU and hospital lengths of stay were longer in the dopamine group (1.7 vs. 0.9 days [p < 0.01] and 11.4 vs. 8.0 days [p < 0.01], respectively).

In conclusion, despite a higher ICU readmission rate, ICU discharge of patients on dopamine infusion was not associated with increased mortality.

### Dopamine hydrochloride [^1131mDzE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Administration of dopamine to patients who are hypotensive due to hypovolemia can lead to severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and hypouresis, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and poor systemic blood flow despite "normal" blood pressure. It is crucial to address hypovolemia prior to initiating dopamine HCl injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Gangrene of the extremities has been reported in patients with occlusive vascular disease or those who have received prolonged or high-dose infusions. It is important to monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients.

Extravasation of dopamine HCl injection can result in necrosis and sloughing of the surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, the injection should be infused into a large vein [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow, and monitoring for signs of extravasation is necessary.

- **Emergency treatment of extravasation**: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas where extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible. Use a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle to deliver:

	- 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection in adults.
	- 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of phentolamine mesylate, up to a maximum of 10 mg per dose, in pediatric patients.

	- Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours.

Dopamine may cause arrhythmias; therefore, it is essential to monitor patients with arrhythmias and treat them appropriately.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^114vN1V4]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) should be reserved for patients with significant malnutrition or electrolyte disturbance who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. Complications associated with total PN include infections, sepsis, and cholestatic hepatic dysfunction.

If safe nutritional status cannot be maintained through the oral and enteral route, then home parenteral nutrition (HPN) may be required. Patients with chronic intestinal dysmotility often face greater challenges than those with a short bowel, particularly having a higher incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections, septicaemia, and venous thrombosis. The underlying reasons for these complications are not entirely clear. Procoagulation states might exist, and increased bacterial translocation from the gut is possible. Additionally, opioid medication, which at high doses suppresses some aspects of immune function, and/or cyclizine increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections partly because these medications can impair patient management of infusions at home due to cognitive effects. Using feeding lines for drug administration is strongly discouraged because of the risk of catheter infection.

Such patients test the capabilities of even the best-organized nutrition teams and should be managed in centers with significant experience. Vigilance for psychopathology and ongoing involvement of psychology and liaison psychiatry should be offered. There may be benefits from the mutual support that patients can provide each other in these situations, although patients with significant psychopathology can present additional challenges.

### Effects of different catecholamines on the dynamics of volume expansion of crystalloid infusion [^116fhrVw]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

The authors studied the influence of alpha, beta, and dopaminergic catecholamines on blood volume expansion in conscious normovolemic sheep before, during, and following a bolus infusion of a crystalloid.

- **Methods**: A 0.9% NaCl bolus (24 ml/kg in 20 min) was infused in four paired experiments: no drug, dopamine infusion (50 microg. kg. min), isoproterenol infusion (0.1 microg. kg. min), and phenylephrine infusion (3 microg. kg. min). Blood volume expansion was calculated by the dilution of blood hemoglobin concentration.

- **Results**: Dopamine had little effect on peak blood volume expansion (12.7 ± 0.9 ml/kg) compared to 0.9% NaCl (13.0 ± 2.7 ml/kg); in contrast, isoproterenol augmented blood volume expansion (18.5 ± 1.8 ml/kg), and phenylephrine reduced blood volume expansion (8.9 ± 1.4 ml/kg). Two hours after the 0.9% NaCl bolus, sustained blood volume expansion was greatest in the isoproterenol protocol (12.2 ml/kg), whereas the dopamine protocol (6.8 ml/kg) remained similar to the control protocol (4.1 ml/kg), and the phenylephrine protocol had a net volume loss (-1.9 ml/kg). Some blood volume expansion differences were attributed to changes in renal function as phenylephrine infusion increased urinary output, whereas isoproterenol was associated with antidiuresis. However, dopamine caused diuresis and sustained augmentation of blood volume.

- **Conclusion**: Catecholamines can alter the intravascular volume expansion of fluid therapy. Beta-receptor (isoproterenol) stimulation augmented blood volume expansion, whereas alpha (phenylephrine) stimulation reduced it.

### Effect of dopamine infusion on hemodynamics after hepatic denervation [^11767yGC]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

The effects of dopamine (DA) on systemic hemodynamics are better understood than its effects on hepatic hemodynamics, especially after liver denervation occurring during liver transplantation. Therefore, a porcine model was used to study DA's effects on hemodynamics after hepatic denervation.

- **Materials and methods**: Fifteen pigs underwent laparotomy for catheter and flow probe placement. The experimental group (n = 7) also underwent hepatic denervation. After 1 week, all pigs underwent DA infusion at increasing doses (3–30 mcg/kg/min) while measuring hepatic parameters [portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), total hepatic blood flow (THBF = HAF + PVF), portal and hepatic vein pressures] and systemic parameters [heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP)].

- **Results**: There was a significant increase in HAF from baseline to the 30 mcg/kg/min DA infusion rate (within-subjects P < 0.01) but the differences between the two groups were not significant. PVF and THBF showed large effects (increases) with denervation, but the increase in flow with DA infusion was not present after denervation. Perihepatic pressures were unchanged by denervation or DA. Heart rate differed significantly between the control and denervated animals at baseline, 3, 6, 12 (all P < 0.05), and 30 mcg/kg/min DA (P = 0.10). Control vs. denervation MAP at baseline was 100 ± 4 vs. 98 ± 4 Torr and at 30 mcg/kg/min it was 110 ± 3 vs. 101 ± 5 mm Hg.

- **Conclusions**: Hepatic flows tended to be higher after denervation. HAF showed similar increases with DA in both control and denervated animals.

### Effect of norepinephrine infusion on hepatic blood flow and its interaction with somatostatin: An observational cohort study [^115KDWja]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Data summarized in Table 3 indicate that norepinephrine (NE) significantly increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRi), with similar results observed in both groups. Cardiac index (CI), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi), mean circulatory filling pressure (Pms), and heart performance (Eh) remained unchanged. NE infusion commenced after T1 measurements, increasing to 0.06 mcg kg−1 min−1 (SD 0.03 mcg kg−1 min−1) at T2 and 0.101 mcg kg−1 min−1 (SD 0.05 mcg kg−1 min−1) at T3. All patients met predefined hemodynamic targets, with no necessity for NE prior to experimental measurements. Both ephedrine and phenylephrine were administered to counteract post-induction hypotension, at dosages of 10.5 mg (SD 7.9 mg) and 270 mcg (SD 310 mcg) respectively. All patients achieved hemodynamic stability by the first measurement, and predefined hemodynamic targets were attained at baseline T1, as shown in Table 3.

- **Hemodynamic data**: Data are expressed in mean (SD). Significant differences are denoted as * for significant between-group differences and # for significant within-group differences, compared to T1 (p < 0.05).

### Management of infusion reactions to systemic anticancer therapy: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^113EWwkC]. Annals of Oncology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy, more specifically with respect to the management of anaphylaxis, ESMO 2017 guidelines recommend considering administering dopamine (400 mg in 500 mL of 5% dextrose water) at 2–20 mg/kg/min, titrating to increase SBP if epinephrine and fluid resuscitation have failed to alleviate hypotension. It is also advised to consider adding vasopressin (0.1 U/mL with a dose range of 0.01–0.04 U/min) and norepinephrine in patients with anaphylaxis unresponsive to epinephrine.

### Ultrarare cause of childhood chorea: Celiac disease [^113g2ghB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Chorea, a movement disorder that commonly affects children, may be caused by various diseases with metabolic, structural, pharmacologic, or autoimmune origins. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy that may rarely cause neurologic symptoms in children, primarily ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Case report**: A 9-year-old male patient diagnosed with Sydenham chorea was admitted to our clinic due to resistance to valproic acid. He presented with involuntary, brief, random, and irregular movements in his arms over the past 2 weeks. A low-dose, high-potency dopamine-2 receptor-blocking agent was added to his treatment regimen. After 2 weeks, the patient developed maculopapular rashes on his hands and arms, as well as arthritis in his left hand. Oral prednisone was prescribed, which completely resolved both the arthritis and rashes. Although movement disorder symptoms persisted in the distal left upper extremity, the chorea in the right upper extremity improved.

Extensive investigations were conducted to rule out possible metabolic, autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, and paraneoplastic diseases, all of which yielded normal results. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were normal, and genetic analysis results for chorea were negative. The patient's tissue transglutaminase IgG levels exceeded 200U/mL (normal range: 0–10U/mL) and IgA levels were at 24U/mL (normal range: 0–10U/mL), leading to a diagnosis of celiac disease. His duodenal biopsies showed changes consistent with gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

### Dopamine hydrochloride [^114PiGnt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dopamine, a sympathomimetic amine vasopressor, is the naturally occurring immediate precursor of norepinephrine. Dopamine hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder, which may have a slight odor of hydrochloric acid. It is freely soluble in water and soluble in alcohol. Dopamine HCl is sensitive to alkalies, iron salts, and oxidizing agents. Chemically, it is designated as 4-(2-aminoethyl) pyrocatechol hydrochloride, with a molecular formula of C8H11NO2• HCl. The molecular weight of dopamine HCl is 189.64, and its structural formula is as follows:

Dopamine, also referred to as 3-hydroxytyramine, is a naturally occurring endogenous catecholamine.

Dopamine hydrochloride injection is a clear, practically colorless, sterile, pyrogen-free, aqueous solution of dopamine HCl for intravenous infusion after dilution. Each milliliter of the 40 mg/mL preparation contains 40 mg of dopamine hydrochloride, equivalent to 32.31 mg of dopamine base. Each milliliter of preparation contains the following: sodium metabisulfite 9 mg added as an antioxidant; citric acid, anhydrous 10 mg; and sodium citrate, dihydrate 5 mg added as a buffer. It may contain additional citric acid and/or sodium citrate for pH adjustment. The pH is 3.3 (2.5 to 5.0).

Dopamine must be diluted in an appropriate sterile parenteral solution before intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^1168JfHm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion if fluid resuscitation fails in optimizing blood flow and if hypotension persists following fluid loading. These agents should be globally available. Vasopressor and inotropic agents have increasingly become a therapeutic cornerstone for the management of sepsis. They have excitatory and inhibitory actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, as well as important metabolic, central nervous system, and presynaptic autonomic nervous system effects.

The optimal timing of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion has been debated. Recently, a large multi-center retrospective analysis of 2849 patients with septic shock found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were delayed by 1 hour and infused from hours 1 to 6 following the onset of shock. Norepinephrine is now the first-line vasopressor agent used to correct hypotension in the event of septic shock. Norepinephrine is more efficacious than dopamine and may be more effective for reversing hypotension in patients with septic shock. Dopamine may cause more tachycardia and may be more arrhythmogenic than norepinephrine; as an alternative vasopressor agent to norepinephrine, it should be used only in patients with a low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative bradycardia.

Dobutamine is an inotropic agent used to treat septic shock patients by increasing cardiac output, stroke index, and oxygen delivery (DO2). It has been suggested to be administered in addition to pre-existing vasopressor therapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction.

### Pharmacological interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in childhood [^114J23Pz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Between 4% and 25% of school-aged children at some stage complain of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of sufficient severity to interfere with their daily lives. When no clear organic cause is found, the children are managed with reassurance and simple measures; a large range of pharmacological interventions have been recommended for use in these children.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for RAP in children of school age.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and eight other electronic databases up to June 2016. We also searched two trials registers and contacted researchers of published studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials involving children aged five to 18 years old with RAP or an abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). The interventions were any pharmacological intervention compared to placebo, no treatment, waiting list, or standard care. The primary outcome measures were pain intensity, pain duration, or pain frequency, and improvement in pain. The secondary outcome measures were school performance, social or psychological functioning, and quality of daily life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and potentially relevant full-text reports for eligible studies. Two review authors extracted data and performed a 'Risk of bias' assessment. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall quality of evidence.

### Low-dose dopamine in patients with early renal dysfunction: a placebo-controlled randomised trial. Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Clinical Trials Group [^117R9o76]. Lancet (2001). High credibility.

Low-dose dopamine is commonly administered to critically ill patients in the belief that it reduces the risk of renal failure by increasing renal blood flow. However, these effects have not been established in a large randomised controlled trial, and the use of dopamine remains controversial. We have conducted a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low-dose dopamine in patients with at least two criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and clinical evidence of early renal dysfunction, such as oliguria or an increase in serum creatinine concentration.

- **Methods**: A total of 328 patients admitted to 23 participating intensive care units (ICUs) were randomly assigned a continuous intravenous infusion of low-dose dopamine (2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or placebo, administered through a central venous catheter while in the ICU. The primary endpoint was the peak serum creatinine concentration during the infusion. Analyses excluded four patients with major protocol violations.

- **Findings**: The groups assigned dopamine (n = 161) and placebo (n = 163) were similar in terms of baseline characteristics, renal function, and duration of trial infusion. There was no difference between the dopamine and placebo groups in peak serum creatinine concentration during treatment (245 [SD 144] vs 249 [147] micromol/L; p = 0.93), in the increase from baseline to the highest value during treatment (62 [107] vs 66 [108] micromol/L; p = 0.82), or in the numbers of patients whose serum creatinine concentration exceeded 300 micromol/L (56 vs 56; p = 0.92) or who required renal replacement therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

The management of diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly regarding insulin infusion, is addressed in the ADA 2025 guidelines. Insulin route and dosage should be determined based on the severity of the hyperglycemic crisis.

- **Mild DKA**:
	- **Insulin SC**: Administer 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as a subcutaneous bolus, followed by either 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every hour or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours.
	- **Insulin IV**: This can be used as an alternative to subcutaneous insulin, with a regimen similar to that for moderate-to-severe DKA.
	- As blood glucose levels decrease, reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg every 2 hours subcutaneously.
	- If there is a delay in the setup of the infusion, consider administering 0.1 units/kg of short-acting insulin as an IV bolus.
	- Once glucose levels reach < 150 mg/dL, further reduce the short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or use a nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values.
	- Aim to maintain glucose in the 200–250 mg/dL range.

In specific circumstances related to celiac disease, particularly concerning pediatric and adolescent patients, the ESPGHAN 2020 guidelines recommend confirming the diagnosis of celiac disease. This is achieved by obtaining a positive endomysial IgA test in a second blood sample for pediatric patients with anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA levels equal to or greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), provided there is agreement from the parents or patient regarding the no-biopsy approach.

### Duopa [^113MrwrK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Carbidopa, when combined with levodopa, plays a crucial role in its mechanism of action. Levodopa, when administered orally, is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues, allowing only a small portion of the dose to reach the central nervous system unchanged. Carbidopa acts by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa, thereby making more levodopa available for delivery to the brain.

	- Levodopa itself is the metabolic precursor of dopamine and is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is presumably converted to dopamine, a process thought to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The decarboxylase inhibiting activity of carbidopa is limited to extracerebral tissues. Administering carbidopa alongside levodopa increases the amount of levodopa available to the brain. The inclusion of carbidopa with levodopa mitigates the peripheral effects such as nausea and vomiting, which are associated with decarboxylation of levodopa. However, it does not reduce the adverse reactions due to the central effects of levodopa.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetics of carbidopa and levodopa were evaluated during a 16-hour intrajejunal infusion of DUOPA in 18 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, all of whom had been on DUOPA therapy for at least 30 days. The patients continued on their individualized DUOPA doses during the study.

	- The plasma concentrations versus time profile for levodopa during the 16-hour intrajejunal infusion with DUOPA is documented.

### Gastric electrical stimulation with Enterra therapy improves symptoms of idiopathic gastroparesis [^11484gok]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

This study was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled, two-period crossover study conducted at eight centers in the United States, approved by the Institutional Review Board. The device was initially turned on for the first 1½ months after implantation to allow full recovery from surgery prior to randomization. At 1½ months, each subject was randomized in a masked fashion to one of two treatment arms: three months of stimulation "OFF" followed by three months of stimulation "ON". The subject, physician, and study coordinator were blinded to the stimulation status during the crossover phase. At the end of the crossover period, the subjects were programmed to have the device "ON" and were evaluated at a 12-month follow-up visit and annually thereafter until study closure. All subjects signed written informed consent prior to enrollment.

To be eligible for the study, subjects were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: at least 18 years of age, symptoms of nausea and vomiting requiring treatment for more than one year associated with gastroparesis (GP) of idiopathic (ID) etiology, unresponsive or intolerant to prokinetic and antiemetic drug classes tried over a minimum of one month, and on a stable dose of prokinetics for a minimum of 30 days prior to baseline unless contraindicated. Subjects were required to undergo a gastric emptying test (GET) using the standardized isotope-labeled low-fat egg substitute meal with imaging out to four hours and were considered eligible if results showed greater emptying times.

### Hemodynamic and metabolic efficacy of dopamine versus norepinephrine in a brain-dead swine model [^113j1K2y]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that hepatosplanchnic and systemic hemodynamics are improved with equi-effective doses of dopamine (DA) versus norepinephrine (NE) in a brain-dead swine model. Pigs (n = 18) were anesthetized and ventilated. Brain death was induced by epidural balloon inflation, hypoventilation, and hypoxia. After 30 minutes, mechanical ventilation was restored without anesthesia. During 60 and until 480 minutes, half received DA (10 microg/kg/minute) and half received NE (0.1 microg/kg/minute) titrated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mm Hg with supplemental fluid to maintain a central venous pressure > 8 mm Hg. Hemodynamics, hepatic laser Doppler blood flow, and hepatic and gastric tissue oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy were continuously monitored. Serial blood samples were analyzed for blood gases and electrolytes, coagulation changes, and serum chemistries.

Balloon inflation caused brain death and autonomic storm, and 8 of 18 were nonsurvivors. After 30 minutes, the MAP, mixed venous O(2) saturation, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen values decreased to 37 ± 2 mm Hg, 38 ± 4, and 49 ± 8 mm Hg, respectively. Serum lactate increased to 5.4 ± 0.7 mM. Among survivors (n = 10), MAP stabilized with either pressor. Urine output was maintained (> 1 mL/kg/hour), but creatinine increased > 30% with respect to the baseline.

- **Tachyphylaxis effects**: Tachyphylaxis developed with NE but not with DA (P < 0.05). Cardiac index was higher with DA versus NE (P < 0.05). There were no differences in stroke volume, metabolic indices, or liver blood flow. Liver tissue O(2) was high.

### Dopamine affects cellular immune functions during polymicrobial sepsis [^113VBKfC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether infusion of dopamine modulates cellular immune functions and survival during systemic inflammation.

- **Design and setting**: This was a randomized animal study conducted in a university research laboratory at a Level I trauma center.

- **Subjects**: The study involved male NMRI mice.

- **Interventions**: Mice underwent either a laparotomy (sham intervention, LAP) or polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In each condition, they received either an intraperitoneal infusion of 0.9% saline (CLP/saline; LAP/saline) or an intraperitoneal infusion of dopamine (1.0 µg/kg/min i.p. CLP/DOP; LAP/DOP). Metabolic data and survival were monitored 24 and 48 hours after sepsis onset, with animals terminated after 48 hours to assess splenocyte apoptosis (Annexin V binding capacity), splenocyte proliferation (3H-Thymidine incorporation assay), splenocyte IL-2, IL-6, and IFN-gamma release (ELISA), and leukocyte distribution (WBC; CD3, CD4, CD8, B220, F4/80, NK1.1).

- **Measurements and results**: The infusion of dopamine in septic mice increased splenocyte apoptosis and decreased proliferation and IL-2 release in these mice. In sham-operated control mice, dopamine infusion inhibited splenocyte proliferation and the release of the TH1-cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma. These effects corresponded with a decreased survival rate of dopamine-treated septic animals (47% vs. 67%). Dopamine treatment did not affect sepsis-induced changes in leukocyte distribution.

- **Conclusions**: The study concludes that dopamine is capable of modulating cell functions during systemic inflammation.
