## Question

When to confirm eradication of h pylori?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to confirm eradication of H. pylori. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether confirmation is universally recommended or only in select scenarios. Then, I should verify the optimal timing and medication washout rules. Next, I will review which test modalities are appropriate and which to avoid. After that, I need to consider special populations and high-risk conditions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note implementation gaps and how to address them.

> Let me first confirm the principle: do all treated patients need a test-of-cure, or only some? The most authoritative, contemporary guidance states that all patients treated for H. pylori should undergo a test-of-cure, using a urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test, at least 4 weeks after therapy, because eradication failure is common and confirmation enables timely retreatment and surveillance of local outcomes [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686] [^e76725ff]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions; some older or region-specific guidance allowed selective confirmation, but current ACG and AGA positions endorse universal confirmation, with pediatric guidelines aligning on routine post-treatment assessment, so I should not overgeneralize exceptions without a compelling rationale [^d2a1c7f7] [^0842b87d].

> Next, I should review timing and medication washout, because false negatives are frequent if testing is too early or if interfering drugs are on board. I need to ensure testing occurs at least 4 weeks after completing antibiotics and bismuth, and that PPIs are held for at least 2 weeks before testing; H2-receptor antagonists and antacids do not meaningfully affect accuracy, and serology should not be used for test-of-cure because antibodies persist for months to years [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686] [^1183c084]. Wait, let me verify pediatric nuances; ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN similarly advises waiting at least 2 weeks off PPIs and 4 weeks off antibiotics/bismuth before noninvasive testing, reinforcing the same washout strategy in children [^edd15122] [^7fc748f6].

> I will now examine which tests are appropriate for confirmation. Noninvasive options with high accuracy are preferred: 13C-urea breath test or a validated monoclonal stool antigen test; both have sensitivity and specificity around 90–100% when performed after the proper washout period, and either is acceptable depending on availability and patient factors [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686]. Hold on, I should verify endoscopic testing; if endoscopy is already indicated for other reasons, biopsy-based methods can be used, but a negative rapid urease test alone is insufficient due to low post-treatment sensitivity, so multiple biopsies with histology improve detection and should be interpreted cautiously [^d2a1c7f7] [^2fe7d80e].

> Let me consider special populations and high-risk scenarios where confirmation is especially critical. In children and adolescents, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN recommends confirming eradication 6–8 weeks after therapy using 13C-UBT or monoclonal stool antigen, given nontrivial reinfection risk and the need to ensure cure in this transmissible infection [^0842b87d] [^c13e7135]. In patients with peptic ulcer disease, especially complicated by bleeding, confirmation is mandatory to prevent recurrence and complications, and noninvasive testing is preferred when feasible [^76dc807b]. In those with atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, MALT lymphoma, or a history of gastric cancer, confirmation of eradication is essential and often integrated with surveillance planning because residual cancer risk persists despite cure of infection [^b143a4a4] [^88b6e5a9] [^a479c191].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist after therapy? I should confirm that persistent dyspepsia does not obviate the need for test-of-cure; in fact, symptom persistence is a reason to ensure eradication was successful and, if negative, to pursue alternative diagnoses such as functional dyspepsia, whereas a positive test prompts retreatment with attention to adherence, acid suppression, and resistance considerations [^e76725ff] [^0af4ab42]. I should double-check that this aligns with dyspepsia guidance; yes, even in uninvestigated dyspepsia managed with test-and-treat, confirmation of cure is advised when H. pylori was treated, reinforcing the universal principle rather than a symptom-driven exception [^e76725ff].

> Next, I should review implementation realities, because underuse of test-of-cure is a persistent gap. Surveys suggest only 20–40% of primary care physicians routinely confirm eradication, whereas gastroenterologists do so more often, and education initiatives can improve retesting rates; this matters for detecting resistance patterns and improving local cure rates [^81821baf] [^e7487923]. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines emphasize feedback loops; indeed, ACG notes that routine testing enables monitoring of local outcomes and should trigger regimen changes if eradication rates fall below about 85%, which is a key quality metric [^d2a1c7f7].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, plan for test-of-cure at the time of prescribing, counseling on the need to return 4 or more weeks after antibiotics and to stop PPIs for 2 weeks before testing. Second, select a noninvasive test (13C-UBT or monoclonal stool antigen) unless endoscopy is otherwise indicated. Third, if the test is positive, reassess adherence, acid suppression, and prior antibiotic exposures, and consider susceptibility testing after two failures; if negative, document cure and proceed with symptom management or surveillance as indicated by the underlying condition [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686] [^3d8082fa]. I should confirm that this aligns with pediatric guidance; yes, the same washout and noninvasive testing principles apply, with testing at 6–8 weeks in children, which is a minor timing difference that does not change the core algorithm [^0842b87d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: confirm eradication in all treated patients, at least 4 weeks after antibiotics and 2 weeks off PPIs, using a urea breath test or stool antigen, avoiding serology, and adapt timing to 6–8 weeks in children; this universal approach is supported by ACG, AGA, and pediatric guidelines and is especially critical in ulcer disease, premalignant conditions, and pediatric populations where reinfection and complications matter [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686] [^0842b87d].

Confirm H. pylori eradication in **all patients** [^d2a1c7f7] using a **urea breath test or stool antigen** [^37ecb686] at least 4 weeks after completing therapy, with PPIs held for 2 weeks prior to testing [^d2a1c7f7]. Serology is unreliable for this purpose [^d2a1c7f7]. In children, confirm eradication 6–8 weeks after therapy [^0842b87d] using the same noninvasive tests [^ce6dff6a]. For high-risk patients (e.g. gastric ulcer, MALT lymphoma, or gastric cancer risk), confirm eradication and consider endoscopic follow-up if indicated [^7b080369] [^b143a4a4]. If eradication fails, repeat testing after 4 weeks off antibiotics and bismuth, and consider susceptibility testing [^3d8082fa] [^d2a1c7f7].

---

## Timing of confirmation

- **Minimum interval**: Wait at least 4 weeks after completing therapy before testing [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686].

- **PPI washout**: Stop PPIs for at least 2 weeks before testing to avoid false negatives [^d2a1c7f7] [^1183c084].

- **Antibiotics and bismuth**: Avoid for at least 4 weeks before testing [^d2a1c7f7] [^edd15122].

- **Pediatric patients**: Confirm 6–8 weeks after therapy [^0842b87d] [^c13e7135].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Timing** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Urea breath test (UBT) | All patients | ≥ 4 weeks after therapy | - Highly sensitive/specific [^d2a1c7f7] <br/> - Preferred noninvasive test [^2fe7d80e] |
| Stool antigen test (SAT) | All patients | ≥ 4 weeks after therapy | - Monoclonal assays preferred [^f0e8344b] <br/> - Alternative to UBT [^2fe7d80e] |
| Endoscopy with biopsy | - Persistent symptoms <br/> - Complicated disease <br/> - High-risk patients | ≥ 4 weeks after therapy | - Histology or RUT [^2fe7d80e] <br/> - Use if noninvasive tests are inconclusive or contraindicated [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

- **High-risk patients**: Confirm eradication in those with gastric ulcer, MALT lymphoma, or gastric cancer risk; consider endoscopic follow-up [^7b080369] [^b143a4a4].

- **Persistent symptoms**: If symptoms persist, confirm eradication and evaluate for other causes [^e76725ff].

- **Treatment failure**: After failure, repeat testing after 4 weeks off antibiotics and bismuth, and consider susceptibility testing [^3d8082fa] [^7b727c9a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Universal testing**: Confirm eradication in all treated patients [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686].

- **Noninvasive tests**: Use UBT or SAT [^d2a1c7f7] [^37ecb686].

- **Timing**: Test at ≥ 4 weeks after therapy, with PPIs held for 2 weeks [^d2a1c7f7] [^1183c084].

- **Pediatrics**: Confirm at 6–8 weeks [^0842b87d] [^c13e7135].

- **High-risk patients**: Confirm and consider endoscopic follow-up [^7b080369] [^b143a4a4].

---

Confirming H. pylori eradication is essential to ensure treatment success and prevent complications; use **UBT or SAT** [^d2a1c7f7] at least 4 weeks after therapy, with appropriate medication washout, and tailor follow-up to patient risk and symptoms [^37ecb686].

Purpose Of Review

The recognition that Helicobacter pylori should be considered and treated as an infectious disease has yet to fundamentally change diagnostic and treatment practices and has resulted in many controversies.

Recent Findings

We discuss the following controversies: whether the current 'per-patient' approach to H. pylori testing based on symptoms should be expanded to include achieving population-level H. pylori eradication, whether H. pylori should be approached as an infectious gastrointestinal disease similar to that of other infectious diseases of similar severity and outcome, whether treatment of H. pylori should be primarily empiric or based on antibiotic susceptibility and locally proven successful therapies as are other infectious diseases, whether it is necessary to obtain confirmation of treatment success in every patient treated for H. pylori, and whether potassium-competitive acid blockers should replace proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori therapy.

Summary

Available guidelines and meta-analyses do not yet address H. pylori as an infectious disease. The diagnosis and management and treatment success of H. pylori infections trails behind that of other important infectious diseases. We provide new insights and propose changes in the traditional understanding required to modernize the management of H. pylori infections.

### Efficient identification and evaluation of effective Helicobacter pylori therapies [^648cde8a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Annually hundreds if not thousands of patients fail empiric H. pylori eradication therapy. Failure occurs in part because routine post treatment testing, which provides an early warning of increasing antibiotic resistance, is not universally done and physicians are generally unaware that cure rates with legacy triple therapy (a proton-pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin) in most places has fallen below 80%. We propose first, institution of routine post eradication testing and second, abandonment of the "better than another therapy" approach to separating acceptable from unacceptable therapies. Instead, we propose using results-based outcomes (ie, > 95% cure rates). H. pylori should be evaluated as other infectious diseases (ie, few would compare a new antibiotic for pneumonia with the previous best choice whose effectiveness was now impaired because of resistance). Randomized comparisons should be restricted to studies designed to improve (eg, simplify or reduce costs) high cure rate therapies while maintaining efficacy. We also discuss potential ethical issues such as those including known or suspected low cure rate therapies. Legacy therapies cannot be identified as "approved" or "recommended" even if both statements were true. Instead patients and ethics boards must receive "full disclosures" both before and during studies that include all that might affect a patient's decision to enter or to continue. Finally, we provides advice regarding trial design using "best shot" pilot studies to efficiently identify tentative effective regimens which are then confirmed in randomized trials all the while minimizing patient risks and drug exposure.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)–positive ulcer — confirmation of eradication and test selection: Document cure of infection at ≥ 1 month after completing therapy, and if repeat endoscopy is not needed, a urea breath test or stool antigen test should be done; antibody testing should not be employed. Because PPIs can cause falsely negative results in approximately one third of cases, PPIs should be discontinued 2 weeks before testing to ensure optimal sensitivity.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8–11 for refractory H pylori infection state that longer treatment durations provide greater eradication success than shorter durations (eg, 14 days vs 7 days) and whenever possible longer durations should be selected. In some cases there should be shared decision making regarding ongoing attempts to eradicate H pylori, weighing benefits against adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression. With confirmed patient adherence, H pylori susceptibility testing should be considered to guide selection of subsequent regimens. Compiling local data on eradication success rates for each regimen and relevant patient factors is important, and aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^e76725ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^1c53961f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The principal effect of Helicobacter pylori infection is lifelong chronic gastritis, affecting up to 20% of younger adults but 50% to 80% of adults born in resource-rich countries before 1950.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment in people with a confirmed duodenal ulcer, a confirmed gastric ulcer, confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), confirmed non-ulcer dyspepsia, uninvestigated dyspepsia, localised B cell lymphoma of the stomach, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related peptic ulcers? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment for preventing NSAID-related peptic ulcers in people with or without previous ulcers or dyspepsia? What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment on the risk of developing gastric cancer? Do H pylori eradication treatments differ in their effects? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: effects of H pylori eradication in different populations; relative effects of triple regimens, quadruple regimens, and sequential regimens.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^d2a1c7f7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — post-treatment testing for cure — All patients treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure using an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 weeks after therapy, and the nonendoscopic urea breath test and fecal antigen test are highly accurate for confirming treatment success when performed at least 4 weeks after completion; because proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can cause false-negative results, they should be stopped for 2 weeks before testing, standard doses of H2RAs or antacids do not affect accuracy, and patients should avoid bismuth and antibiotics for at least 4 weeks before a test of cure; serological testing should not be used to assess post-treatment status, and while a positive biopsy urease test may confirm ongoing infection, a negative result without corroboration should not be considered definitive proof of eradication; in the United States, recurrence after successful eradication occurs at 1% (95% CI 0.3%–3%) per year, and routine testing for cure also enables providers to monitor local results and change regimens if outcomes are suboptimal (e.g., if under 85%).

Comment

The success of a proven successful H. pylori eradication regimen depends on the pattern of resistance in the population and on the common host genotypes of drug metabolising enzymes in the population. The prevalence of H. pylori resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents greatly varies geographically and is linked to consumption of antibiotics in the region, so the preferred eradication regimen often differs between regions. Ideally, treatment regimens should be chosen based on susceptibility testing. Within any region, only regimens that reliably produce eradication rates of ≥ 90% in that population should be used for empirical treatment.

CQ20. Does eradication of H. pylori prevent gastric cancer?

Statement 20

Eradication of H. pylori reduces the risk of gastric cancer. The degree of risk reduction depends on the presence, severity and extent of atrophic damage at the time of eradication.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

Comment

H. pylori infection is the most important cause of gastric cancer as it is estimated that 89% of non-cardia gastric cancer, representing 78% of all cases of gastric cancer, can be attributed to chronic H. pylori infection. Prevention of H. pylori infections removes the primary cause of gastric cancer and will thus reduce the incidence of gastric cancer in that population. The effectiveness of H. pylori eradication for prevention of gastric cancer depends on the severity and extent of atrophic damage at the time of eradication and ranges from essentially complete prevention for those with non-atrophic gastritis to stabilisation or reduction of risk in those with established atrophic changes. As noted in Section 3, risk can be stratified using a variety of approaches, such as one of the validated histological stratification systems (eg, OLGA or OLGIM), and H. pylori eradication can stabilise risk and halt the progression of risk. Prevention of acquisition of H. pylori infections and eradication of the infection before the development of atrophic changes are forms of primary prevention. Secondary prevention involves identification and surveillance of those at risk in order to remove intraepithelial lesions and early gastric cancer(s) before they become invasive. There may be also a role for cancer immunotherapy to treat premalignant lesions and halt their progression to more advanced lesions.

CQ21. Should the outcome of eradication therapy always be assessed (ie, test for cure)?

Statement 21

The outcome of eradication therapy should always be assessed, preferably non-invasively.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^d6a60504]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Selection Criteria

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^cee7b7b7]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori infection is mainly acquired in childhood, up to the age of 12 years, in developed countries mostly by intrafamilial transmission. The bacterium and associated gastritis persist lifelong, unless treated by eradication therapy, or unless end-stage widespread atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia occur. The risk for gastric cancer depends on the grade of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori eradication can reduce the risk for cancer, but this effect is largely confined to patients without atrophy and metaplasia. In patients with these lesions, H. pylori eradication reduces gastritis, but may not stop further progression to cancer. As a result, cancer can occur more than 10 years after H. pylori eradication treatment. Against this background, it is appropriate to search and screen for H. pylori gastritis at an age when new infections become less likely (> 12 years) and before development of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. This all depends on the geographical location and epidemiological context, taking into account the prevalence of infection and age-related cancer incidence.

### Chinese consensus report on family-basedInfection control and management (2021 edition) [^04fe04f9]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

CQ13. What is the management strategy in treating H. pylori infection among family members?

Statement 13: The concept of 'eradicating H. pylori at the first-time treatment' is applicable in the management of H. pylori infection among family members.

Evidence quality: high.

Recommendation strength: strong recommendation 86.8%, conditional recommendation 13.2%.

Consensus level: 94.7%.

Comments: The nature of H. pylori eradication is similar to the treatment of other commonly found pathogenic bacterial infections, but their characteristics are different. H. pylori eradication rates can be improved by using high-efficiency acid-suppressing PPIs to raise the stomach pH and therefore increase antibiotic bioavailability. In recent years, with widespread H. pylori eradication in many hospitals and clinics in China, the H. pylori resistance rate to antibiotics has been gradually increasing, which is accompanied with a decline in the empirical eradication rate. Failure of the first-time eradication may lead to the development of bacterial resistance and reduce the range of antibiotic options for future retreatment. Hence, successfully eradicating H. pylori infection in the first treatment is desirable.

H. pylori resistance to antibiotics is usually related to local bacteria resistance patterns and previous antibiotic usage. Before selecting an empirical treatment regimen, the cure rate, adverse drug reactions, convenience, accessibility, adherence and costs, along with the antibiotic resistance situation of the patient, should be evaluated to achieve the maximal therapeutic effect. It should also avoid misuse or unnecessary use of antibiotics. When treating H. pylori infection in children and adolescents, the safety and benefits of eradication should be assessed carefully based on individual infection history, antibiotic usage and disease status; doses of antibiotics should be adjusted according to body weight before eradication is implemented.

Regarding the efficacy of susceptibility-guided individualised treatment and empirical therapy in eradicating H. pylori infection, a recent Chinese study confirmed that susceptibility-guided individualised therapy and previously proven locally highly effective empiric therapy are highly and equally effective. However, for patients who have repeatedly failed eradication, individualised therapy guided by drug-sensitivity testing is recommended. In addition, if the patient's history of antibiotic use can be incorporated into the selection of empirical treatment regimen, it will help to increase the first-time H. pylori eradication rate and reduce the chance of developing drug resistance, and only therapies that are known to be highly effective locally should be used empirically.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^b143a4a4]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Failure of eradication is common and allows the mucosal damage to progress, and so eradication should always be confirmed, preferably using a non-invasive test such as a urea breath test or a validated monoclonal-based stool antigen test. For patients requiring endoscopic follow-up, such as after endoscopic removal of a gastric adenoma, histological assessment can be used. Confirmation of cure also provides an early warning system for the increasing antibiotic resistance in a population that will manifest as increasing rates of treatment failure.

CQ22. Which patients need long-term follow-up after eradication?

Statement 22

H. pylori eradication may not completely eliminate the risk of gastric cancer. Patients who remain at risk, as defined by the extent and severity of atrophy, should be offered endoscopic and histological surveillance.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.3%

Comment

Long-term follow-up such as regular endoscopic surveillance should be based on estimating the risk of developing gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication (ie, risk stratification). Cancer risk correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis and risk stratification should be confirmed using a validated histological risk scoring systems such as OLGA or OLGIM. In areas with proven expertise in endoscopic scoring, a system such as that of Kimura and Takemoto can be used initially, although histological confirmation is still recommended. Patients whose H. pylori infection was diagnosed non-invasively (eg, urea breath test or stool antigen) should be considered for histological assessment. These patients should include those within the age range in which atrophic changes are common in that population and those with a history of gastric ulcer as well as those with a pretreatment serum pepsinogen I of ≤ 70 ng/mL and a pepsinogen I:II ratio ≤ 3. All those at especially high risk, including those at risk for intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or early gastric cancer, are candidates for regular endoscopic surveillance.

### Best treatment approach: should a national consensus be the best consensus? [^7ee2ee02]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti- H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance (Table 1). According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori -related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance. It seems apparent that an international consensus should play a major role in a specialist's decision making, but it also appears quite reasonable and inevitable that a national consensus, based on nationwide surveys of first-line, second-line and rescue therapies, as well as the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance, should play the major role in each clinician's judgment. In a recently published review, De Francesco et al provided a critical reappraisal of updated worldwide guidelines. The authors fairly concluded that, although several of these guidelines highlighted that the results being achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable to another one, it emerged that some therapeutic regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the need to consult existing national data. However, if solid susceptibility data are available for a specific population, then one could recommend or reject various therapeutic regimens for this population, because antimicrobial resistance seems to represent the key factor adversely affecting the outcome of eradication treatment. Nevertheless, each national study group and consensus panel should avoid taking isolated data from one study in a specific region of the country and arbitrarily generalizing them to the entire country's population. On the other hand, this extrapolation seems to be generally accepted for one country if its susceptibility pattern has been thoroughly defined.

Basic conclusive suggestions and data concerning the best approach to H. pylori treatment from the worldwide existing guidelines and consensuses in relation to antibiotic resistance

It seems that the best treatment approach to H. pylori is running at full speed toward treatments based on a national consensus that should exist for each country. Undoubtedly, guidelines of a neighboring country or a continental consensus could be used in a tutorial manner, particularly when local information is lacking.

Therefore, although H. pylori eradication is a feasible, efficacious and potentially cost-effective method (at least in some populations) for reducing the risk of subsequent gastric adenocarcinoma development, its use has not yet been adopted anywhere in the world. The final results of a very large Chinese trial involving more than 180 000 participants will be available within the next few years, and its results may influence future public health policy in this area, particularly in East Asian countries. However, at present, in areas of relatively low gastric cancer incidence such as the UK, we cannot currently recommend population testing and treating for H. pylori as a means for preventing subsequent gastric cancer development

Does eradication of H. pylori prevent progression to cancer?

We recommend H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma development in patients who have H. pylori-associated GA (evidence level: high quality; grade of recommendation: high; level of agreement: 100%).

### How to use Helicobacter pylori testing in paediatric practice [^8a281f70]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

The current reference standard for investigating H. pylori associated disease in children remains upper intestinal endoscopy and biopsies for histology and culture or RUT. Non-invasive tests should be used to confirm H. pylori eradication following treatment. Currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend them over invasive tests in symptomatic children, because they cannot be used reliably in children to diagnose or distinguish H. pylori-associated diseases from conditions that are not H. pylori related. Recent evidence-based guidelines recommend treatment in children with confirmed H. pylori–related diseases. However, with further knowledge of the measurable health risks for H. pylori–infected children, or with the availability of vaccination or future treatment options, the risk-benefit relationship and recommendations regarding non-invasive testing may change.

Despite guidelines for detection and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, recommendations to test patients before and after therapy are commonly not followed in the United States. At the Houston Consensus Conference, 11 experts on management of adult and pediatric patients with H pylori, from different geographic regions of the United States, met to discuss key factors in diagnosis of H pylori infection, including identification of appropriate patients for testing, effects of antibiotic susceptibility on testing and treatment, appropriate methods for confirmation of infection and eradication, and relevant health system considerations. The experts divided into groups that used a modified Delphi panel approach to assess appropriate patients for testing, testing for antibiotic susceptibility and treatment, and test methods and confirmation of eradication. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the GRADE system. The results of the individual workshops were presented for a final consensus vote by all panel members. After the Expert Consensus Development meeting, the conclusions were validated by a separate panel of gastroenterologists, who assessed their level of agreement with each of the 29 statements developed at the Expert Consensus Development. The final recommendations are provided, on the basis of the best available evidence, and provide consensus statements with supporting literature to implement testing for H pylori infection at health care systems across the United States.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication: gastric cancer prevention [^f80acc93]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The principal effect of Helicobacter pylori infection is lifelong chronic gastritis, affecting up to 20% of younger adults but 50% to 80% of adults born in resource-rich countries before 1950.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of H pylori eradication treatment on the risk of developing gastric cancer? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 208 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 166 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 124 studies and the further review of 42 full publications. Of the 42 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for two PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for one intervention based on information about the effectiveness and safety of H pylori eradication treatment for the prevention of gastric cancer.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^f1b78e34]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The causes of H. pylori eradication treatment failure (Figure 1)

Failure to eradicate H. pylori results from the complex interaction of host-, microbial- and systems-related factors. Antibiotic resistance (microbial and systems) and patient nonadherence (host and systems) are the two most commonly cited reasons for eradication failure. However, because primary eradication failure still occurs despite confirmed antibiotic sensitivity and patient adherence, potentially with higher frequency in refractory H. pylori specifically, additional factors are likely also relevant. Providers should attempt to identify all contributing etiologies before simply prescribing alternative antibiotics. (BPA#1) These factors, along with antibiotic resistance and nonadherence, are described herein.

### Hellenic consensus oninfection [^2fe7d80e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 11: 13 C UBT is the best method to confirm H. pylori eradication after treatment. When this is not available, SAT with monoclonal antibody is an alternative. If endoscopy is indicated, eradication should be confirmed not only by RUT, but also by histology of multiple biopsies.

Recommendation grade: A; Evidence level: 1a; Agreement level: 94.7%

The bacterial load after treatment may be low, and this may interfere with the sensitivity of methods that depend on the amount of tissue tested. The RUT has a low sensitivity (up to 60%) for H. pylori detection after treatment. The sensitivity of histology also depends on the site, number and size of biopsies, as well as pathologist experience. In contrast, the UBT and SAT have shown good results (sensitivity > 90%) as they reflect the whole gastric surface. If endoscopy is indicated (gastric ulcer, MALT lymphoma, etc.) then multiple biopsies (Sydney protocol) should be taken to increase the sensitivity. Because of the high cost of histology, biopsies should not be taken if the only purpose is to confirm H. pylori eradication. UBT should be offered instead, and H. pylori eradication should be tested at least 2 weeks after PPI discontinuation and 4 weeks after stopping antibiotic and bismuth. Serology is not indicated, because antibodies to H. pylori remain positive for a long period after eradication. Other invasive tests, such as culture and PCR, are also not indicated as confirmatory tests for H. pylori eradication in everyday clinical practice.

B. H. pylori and extragastric-associated disorders

Statement 12: A. The association between H. pylori infection and unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is supported in the literature. We propose that, after the exclusion of the etiologies most frequently associated with these disorders, H. pylori should be sought and treated.

Recommendation grade: A; Level of Evidence: 1c; Agreement Level: 84.6%

B. The association between H. pylori infection and unexplained idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is supported in the literature. We propose that, after the exclusion of the etiologies most frequently associated with these disorders, H. pylori should be sought and treated.

Eradication confirmation

When asked whether they confirm the eradication of H. pylori after the end of treatment, most (82.8%) physicians answered that they always or almost always, 13.9% that they usually, and only 3.3% that they rarely or never confirm eradication. The preferred method of confirming eradication was the UBT (79.4%), with fewer preferring detection of H. pylori antigen in the stool (14.4%) and 5.6% preferring re-endoscopy (Fig. 3). Again, a statistically significant difference was observed in terms of age and years of professional practice (P = 0.008 and P = 0.019, respectively), with older and more experienced doctors being more likely to confirm eradication by means of endoscopy. A statistically significant difference was found depending on the doctors' employment type (P = 0.022), with NHS doctors almost exclusively using the UBT as a method to verify eradication (90.6%), in contrast to the private sector where, in addition to this test (75%), a significant percentage used fecal antigen detection (20.8%), The most important criteria for choosing a diagnostic eradication test (with the possibility of choosing 2) were the sensitivity of the method (59.7%), ease of execution (48.6%), availability (25.4%), immediacy (19.3%), and cost (16.6%).

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^0af4ab42]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

As is apparent from statement 8, there is a group of patients with FD for whom H. pylori is considered the cause of their symptoms, and this can be established if eradication is associated with sustained symptom benefit. This scenario is the only one where patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy can be 'cured', albeit with some delay after successful eradication therapy. Moreover, very few effective alternative therapeutic approaches have been proved to have substantial and sustained benefit in FD. Finally, eradication therapy is a short treatment, with acceptable cost–benefit for controlling dyspeptic symptoms, and with other potential benefits for prevention of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Based on these considerations, eradication therapy can be proposed as first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, which is in line with a recent management algorithm by the Rome foundation.

CQ10. How effective is H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms — in the short and long term — and how does it compare with other treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs))?

Statement 10

In H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, eradication therapy for dyspeptic symptoms is better than placebo and is the preferred option.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Comment

Eradication therapy studies have confirmed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD is relieved of dyspeptic symptoms by eradication therapy. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly compared eradication therapy with other treatments that are used for FD, such as PPIs or prokinetic therapy. Hence, although the symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months, eradication is the preferred treatment. Future trials should compare eradication with treatment modalities other than placebo in H pylori -infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy.

CQ11. Should patients who remain dyspeptic after successful H. pylori eradication be considered to have FD?

Statement 11

Patients who remain symptomatic after successful H. pylori eradication should be considered to have FD.

RESULTS

A total of 3716 articles were identified in the literature search, from which 3136 articles were excluded after removal of duplicates, conference abstracts without full text publication and title/abstract screening. The full texts of 580 articles were reviewed for eligibility. Of these, 329 studies were excluded for not meeting full inclusion criteria. Thus, we abstracted data from 121 articles. Figure 2, summarizes the PRISMA flow diagram of the studies screened and included in this review. The baseline characteristics and risk of bias of the individual studies, the results of the meta-analyses, and the quality of evidence are summarized below according to the relevant PICO question(s). Detailed risk of bias summaries for all studies are available in Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 6.

PICO 1: In patients with GIM does testing and treating for H. pylori vs no testing and treating affect patient-important outcomes?

The benefit of H. pylori testing and treatment has been established and addressed previously for NCGA prevention and for the management of dyspepsia. The specific focus of PICO 1 was to identify direct evidence to assess the effects of testing for and treating H. pylori infection, when diagnosed, in patients with GIM when compared to a no empiric testing and treatment strategy. Among H. pylori -related studies meeting inclusion criteria, only those studies which specifically included patients with GIM were included to answer this question. Studies which assessed the effect of H. pylori treatment on the different outcomes (e.g. NCGA incidence) but did not specify the inclusion of GIM patients, were excluded to limit heterogeneity and potential for bias. We acknowledge that the analysis focuses on the efficacy of the primary intervention of an H. pylori treatment regimen versus placebo, but not necessarily H. pylori infection status over the entire time course nor at the time of the endpoint of interest. To this end, confirmation of eradication following H. pylori treatment was variably documented. Table 2 summarizes the included studies that informed PICO1.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^cadfc744]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Causes of Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment failure — failure to eradicate H pylori results from the complex interplay of host-, microbial-, and systems-related factors, with antibiotic resistance and patient nonadherence being the 2 most commonly cited reasons; however, because failure still occurs despite confirmed sensitivity and adherence, providers should attempt to identify all contributing etiologies before simply prescribing alternative antibiotics (BPA #1). Resistance to several antibiotics used in eradication regimens has risen globally over the last 20 years, and eradication failure is more likely when an antibiotic to which H pylori demonstrates in vitro resistance is included; combining studies of both treatment naive and refractory H pylori infection, in vitro resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin are associated with a 7.0-fold (95% CI, 5.2–9.3-fold) and 8.2-fold (95% CI, 3.8–17.6-fold) significantly higher likelihood of treatment.

### Should all patients with stage IE gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma receive antibiotic eradication therapy for? [^8e4875f2]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

According to both National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines)and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, if HP infection is negative on the basis of histopathologic examination, the above-mentioned noninvasive testing methods should be performed to confirm the negative status before making treatment decisions. The NCCN guideline recommends H. pylori eradication therapy (HPE) as the first-line treatment if HP infection is detected, and the lesion is confined to the gastric wall. HPE therapy has been documented to induce complete remission (CR) in 78% of patients with early-stage disease and 5-year survival of ≥ 95%. Approximately 11% of patients with gastric MALT lymphoma have no evidence of HP infection and are thus designated H. pylori –negative (HPN). These patients are recommended to undergo involved site radiation therapy (ISRT), or rituximab (if ISRT is contraindicated). However, the ESMO guideline recommends HPE should be given to all patients with gastric MZL, irrespective of stage.

Although the treatment guideline pathways are consistent with respect to H. pylori –positive (HPP) patients, they diverge with respect to the patient who presents with documented stage I gastric MALT but is HPN. To study this clinical practice dilemma, we performed a retrospective quality assessment study of our experience to guide our clinical practice and inform future guidelines.

### Which test for Helicobacter pylori in primary care? [^9e3a2133]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Around 4% of primary care consultations are for dyspepsia, a term used for a specific group of upper gastrointestinal symptoms that includes abdominal discomfort, recurrent epigastric pain, bloating and heartburn. National guidelines recommend testing patients with uncomplicated dyspepsia for Helicobacter pylori infection, giving eradication therapy to those found to be infected and re-testing those who remain symptomatic after such treatment. Non-invasive tests for H. pylori avoid the need for endoscopy and biopsy to confirm infection, and several are now available for use in primary care. Here we review these tests and consider their role in the management of adults with dyspepsia.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^80c61b83]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted in populations that are relatively homogenous within geographic borders, albeit ethnically distinct (e.g. Asian-Pacific populations). In contrast, the United States (US) population comprises individuals with diverse ancestral backgrounds, with correspondingly diverse H. pylori strains. In the US, the lack of recent comparative clinical trials is coupled with limited knowledge of locoregional H. pylori antibiotic resistance patterns and of regimen-specific local cure rates, as well as limited contemporary data on temporal trends and relevant demographic details (e.g. age, race and ethnicity). Current national and international guidelines provide limited guidance on how to approach factors other than H. pylori antibiotic resistance which might also underlie eradication failure, such as host- and systems-related factors. Collectively, these issues contribute to persistent H. pylori infection (Figure 1).

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^bb2a7bd9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Test-of-cure

The classic three-step approach to H. pylori therapy is accurate diagnosis of an active infection, therapy, and confirmation of cure. It is critical that each course of therapy be followed by a test-of-cure, preferably using noninvasive testing such as the stool antigen or urea breath test (UBT). To prevent false negative results, care must be taken to follow the recommendations regarding stopping PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth for an adequate time for testing. The test-of-cure provides direct and immediate feedback regarding outcome and informs clinicians regarding which therapies are successful and which are failing. Ideally, test-of-cure data would also be shared with colleagues to expand the local and regional knowledge base. It retrospect, it is amazing that this simple approach was not immediately recognized as a critical element able to provide immediate and local feedback to clinicians. As such, decades of local treatment failures have been recorded and published as observations rather than as critical opportunities for providing better care.

### Meta-analysis: can Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment reduce the risk for gastric cancer? [^759eee8b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer, but the effect of eradication treatment on gastric cancer risk is not well defined.

Purpose

To determine whether H. pylori eradication treatment can reduce the risk for gastric cancer.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and online clinical trial registers through 31 January 2009, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials that compared eradication treatment with no treatment in H. pylori-positive patients and that assessed gastric cancer or progression of preneoplastic lesions during follow-up.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles and extracted data.

Data Synthesis

Seven studies met inclusion criteria, 1 of which was excluded from pooled analysis because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. All studies were performed in areas with high incidence of gastric cancer, mostly in Asia. Overall, 37 of 3388 (1.1%) treated patients developed gastric cancer compared with 56 of 3307 (1.7%) untreated (control) participants. In a pooled analysis of 6 studies with a total of 6695 participants followed from 4 to 10 years, the relative risk for gastric cancer was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98).

Limitations

All studies but 1 were performed in Asia. Only 2 assessed gastric cancer incidence, and only 2 were double-blinded.

Conclusion

Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment seems to reduce gastric cancer risk.

Strategies to advance the field and surveillance infrastructure (BPA #11) — Aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of H pylori eradication therapy, and this information could be used for both initial and refractory treatment choices. Noninvasive H pylori antibiotic sensitivity testing on stool would overcome many rate-limiting barriers precluding widespread uptake of sensitivity testing, and next-generation sequencing technology offers the potential to detect the resistance footprint of all antibiotics considered in H pylori therapy. Implementation and adherence to standard quality metrics should include appropriate eradication confirmation testing in all individuals treated for H pylori as part of advancing surveillance programs.

### Helicobacter pylori diagnosis and management [^3521626c]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

H pylori is a global human pathogen and is the major cause of gastritis and the gastritis-associated diseases: gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, and primary gastric B-cell lymphoma (MALToma). Although several reliable diagnostic tests are widely available, the ideal regimen for treating the infection re-mains to be established. The current first-line or legacy triple therapy regimens fail in 20% to 40% of patients. Causes of treatment failure include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, short (7–10 days) duration of therapy, and drug-related side effects. Fourteen-day triple therapy has an approximately 12% better cure rate than does 7-day therapy; therefore, shorter durations can no longer be recommended. Recent studies confirmed older observations that the success rate of legacy triple regimens (PPI plus two antibiotics) can be improved if the duration is extended to 14 days or if a third antibiotic is given. Sequential therapy (PPI plus amoxicillin followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin plus metronidazole) requires further evaluation although the concept appears very promising and therapy should probably replace the legacy triple therapies. More studies are needed to examine doses, durations, and the need for sequential administration of the drugs, which extends the duration to 14 days. Nonetheless, sequential quadruple therapy probably should replace the legacy triple therapies. Classic quadruple therapy contains bismuth, a PPI, 1500 mg of metronidazole, and 1500 mg of tetracycline. It provides the highest average eradication rates and in many regions should be considered as the initial approach. Confirmation of eradication using noninvasive diagnostic tests, such as a urea breath test or stool antigen assay, is now the standard of care. The diagnosis of latent or symptomatic H pylori like the diagnosis of latent or symptomatic syphilis, always should prompt treatment. Because of decreasing cure rates, new and improved therapies are needed.

Comment

A large number of observations support the conclusion that H. pylori infection may be a cause of symptoms in a proportion of patients presenting with dyspepsia. First, acute iatrogenic or self-administered infection with H. pylori can induce acute dyspeptic symptoms. However, while persistent colonisation virtually always leads to chronic gastritis, in the majority of individuals severe dyspeptic symptoms are transient. Second, most but not all, epidemiological studies show associations between H. pylori infection and (uninvestigated) dyspeptic symptoms. The most convincing evidence can be derived from H. pylori eradication studies in infected patients with uninvestigated or FD. In these studies, eradication is associated with a small but statistically significant benefit for symptom control over no eradication; the estimated number needed to treat is 14and in a more recent study the number was 8. At present there are no criteria to predict whether a patient with dyspeptic symptoms will respond to eradication therapy or not. Therefore, the only way in clinical practice is to eradicate the H. pylori infection and see whether symptoms resolve or whether additional treatments will be required. The symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months to become significant over no eradication and this has been attributed to the time it takes for gastritis to recover.

CQ8. Should we categorise H. pylori -associated dyspepsia as a specific entity?

Statement 8A

In H. pylori -infected patients with dyspepsia, symptoms can be attributed to H. pylori gastritis if successful eradication therapy is followed by sustained symptom remission.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Statement 8B

H. pylori -associated dyspepsia (as in statement 8A) is a distinct entity.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: moderate

CQ5. Should all H. pylori -infected adult family members be treated to eliminate the infection?

Statement 5: For all H. pylori- infected adult family members in a household, eradication should be considered.

Evidence quality: moderate.

Recommendation strength: strong recommendation 52.6%, conditional recommendation 47.4%.

Consensus level: 81.5%.

Comments: For infected adult family members, H. pylori eradication is recommended following guidelines from the 'Fifth Chinese National Consensus Report on the Management of Helicobacter pylori Infection', unless there are competing considerations. The 2015 'Kyoto Global Consensus Report on Helicobacter pylori Gastritis' also indicated that H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease. Eradicating H. pylori can eliminate the source of infection, reduce infection rate of the population and prevent serious complications. Other guidelines and consensus suggestions including the 2017 'Management of Helicobacter pylori Infection — The Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report', consensus of the USA, Japan and Asia-Pacific region, and results from several large-scale clinical observationshave all recommended eradicating H. pylori before the occurrence of gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia to reduce the risk of GC. Therefore, unless there are competing considerations, eradicating H. pylori infection is recommended for all adults within the family.

The phenomenon of family cluster infections can also partially explain the fact that gastric mucosal precancerous lesions or GC are present in one or more infected family members at different times of their lives, indicating that H. pylori infection may play a critical role in disease progression.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^c5dcf66a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroenterologists and many general internists and primary care physicians confront questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori on a daily basis. The subject remains of global interest and continue to generate debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management' we identified over 1000 relevant articles in PubMed published over the time period 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. We have selected the most highly clinically relevant of these to review here.

Recent Findings

Clinical evidence grows regarding the benefits of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer prevention. High rates of resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, correlating with treatment failure in regimens utilizing these drugs, has stimulated interest in alternative regimens as well as the need for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well established, implementation of appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal throughout healthcare settings.

Summary

Increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice is needed to identify implementation gaps, and to suggest means to best apply the knowledge gained on H. pylori for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management ofinfections [^b944effa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Whom to test?

As the importance of H. pylori as a cause of human disease has increasingly been recognized, treatment recommendations have evolved from (a) curing those with peptic ulcer to (b) curing all H. pylori infections identified unless there are compelling reasons not to (e.g. advanced age, etc.), and to (c) proactively searching for and eradicating H. pylori with the goal of eliminating gastric cancer. The solution to the 'whom to test' question is predicated on the presumption that all those infected can be cured. The recommendations for whom to test have greatly expanded and now include all first-degree relatives of those with H. pylori infections, those with active or a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer and all those living in the same household as a patient discovered to have an H. pylori infection, (Table 2).

Table 2.
Recommendations for Helicobacter pylori testing for individuals and populations.

Extension of treatment recommendations to family members and those with H. pylori -related diseases is based on the high frequency of transmission within families. China, a country with one of the highest rates of gastric cancer, has also recently introduced family screening as part of their efforts to eliminate H. pylori and gastric cancer.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^3c57ae43]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — clarithromycin triple therapy as salvage is limited to susceptibility-confirmed cases and requires optimized acid suppression. Key concept states that in treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Because eradication is critically dependent on adequate gastric acid suppression (intragastric pH > 6), every effort should be made to optimize aspects of treatment known to influence success, particularly when clarithromycin triple therapy is used as salvage; this includes attention to adherence and optimization of gastric acid suppression. The only clinical scenario in which clarithromycin triple therapy could be repeated after failure of PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy is if H. pylori sensitivity to clarithromycin and amoxicillin has been demonstrated on antibiotic susceptibility testing and there is opportunity to optimize acid suppression, and for such patients the guideline panel suggests using esomeprazole or rabeprazole or a PCAB in the salvage regimen if not already used in the previous regimen.

Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) screening and eradication in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer (GC) should emphasize opportunistic testing rather than universal screening, and all adults diagnosed with infection warrant eradication with confirmation at least 4 weeks after therapy; screening adult household members should also be considered. A meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (9 from China, 2 from Turkey, 1 from England) showed whole-family test and treatment achieving a 3-fold higher eradication success (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.68–5.13) and a 70% lower recurrence rate (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19–0.48) than single-patient treatment. A non-US RCT with nearly 27 years of endoscopic follow-up suggests eradication results in a less than 63% reduction in GC risk without baseline moderate to severe atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia vs a 43% reduction overall, and the Taipei Global Consensus suggests screening between ages 20 and 40 years; because eradication alone does not suffice as a stand-alone population prevention strategy, opportunistic screening and treatment should be considered an adjunct to endoscopic screening.

Comment

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is aetiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori -positive individuals are also the major reservoir for transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection, similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for life-time risk to an individual patient, their family or to the community. Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilisation or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilisation or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, cure of H. pylori -related PUD, reduction in risk of gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy and prevention of future development of H. pylori -related peptic ulcer.

For society, the benefits include reduction of the reservoir of infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to others, and avoidance of the costs associated with diagnosis, management and outcomes of H. pylori -related diseases that are prevented. Thus, H. pylori -infected patients should be offered eradication therapy unless there are competing considerations such as comorbidities, re-infection rates in their communities, competing health priorities of society and financial cost. It has to be remembered, however, that there are concerns about the negative impact of eradication therapies on human health, such as increase in allergy or obesity and perturbation of microbiota.

CQ18. What is the optimal timing for H. pylori eradication in asymptomatic subjects?

Statement 18

The maximum benefit of H. pylori eradication is obtained if it is done while the mucosal damage is still non-atrophic.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^269e0a84]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been an increase in resistance to many of the antimicrobials used to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) nationally and internationally. Primary clarithromycin resistance and dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance are high in Ireland. These trends call for an evaluation of best-practice management strategies.

Objective

The objective of this study was to revise the recommendations for the management of H. pylori infection in adult patients in the Irish healthcare setting.

Methods

The Irish H. pylori working group (IHPWG) was established in 2016 and reconvened in 2023 to evaluate the most up-to-date literature on H. pylori diagnosis, eradication rates and antimicrobial resistance. The 'GRADE' approach was then used to rate the quality of available evidence and grade the resulting recommendations.

Results

The Irish H. pylori working group agreed on 14 consensus statements. Key recommendations include (1) routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide therapy is no longer recommended other than for clarithromycin susceptibility testing for first-line treatment (statements 6 and 9), (2) clarithromycin triple therapy should only be prescribed as first-line therapy in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility has been confirmed (statement 9), (3) bismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline) is the recommended first-line therapy if clarithromycin resistance is unknown or confirmed (statement 10), (4) bismuth quadruple therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, levofloxacin and amoxicillin is the recommended second-line treatment (statement 11) and (5) rifabutin amoxicillin triple therapy is the recommend rescue therapy (statement 12).

Conclusion

These recommendations are intended to provide the most relevant current best-practice guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection in adults in Ireland.

### Optimal duration of treatment regimens for H. pylori… [^fe74f150]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer When using proton pump inhibitor triple therapy, increasing the duration of treatment from seven to 10 days or from 10 to 14 days significantly increases the eradication of H. pylori. When using other treatment regimens, it is unclear whether increasing duration of treatment changes eradication rates. H. pylori eradication improves with a longer duration of PPI triple therapy. The number needed to treat for one additional H. pylori eradication is 21 when treatment is lengthened from seven to 10 days; the NNT is 17 when increasing from 10 to 14 days, and 11 when increasing from seven to 14 days. H.

pylori eradication regimens over the course of seven, 10, or 14 days: PPI plus bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; PPI plus three antibiotics; PPI plus one antibiotic; H 2 blocker plus bismuth salt plus an antibiotic; H 2 blocker plus two antibiotics; bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; and H 2 blocker bismuth quadruple therapy. There were few randomized controlled trials available for each of these treatment regimens. Across the three treatment durations, no significant differences were noted in the rate of H. pylori eradication except with the use of H 2 blocker bismuth quadruple therapy. Only one study was available for this treatment regimen, and the eradication rate was higher in persons treated for 14 days than in those treated for seven days. H. pylori regimens. H.

pylori causes several gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, and gastric cancer. 2 This Cochrane review demonstrates that PPI triple therapy, which is the most studied regimen to date, has an increased H. pylori eradication rate with an increased duration of treatment.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two authors independently extracted the data, which were recorded on a standard spreadsheet. Disagreements were resolved through discussions with two other researchers. To understand better the effects of the type or duration of treatment on eradication, we divided the treatments into 14 groups (table 1). Extracted data included the characteristics of the studies (title, publication year, country, and study design), characteristics of the patients (number of patients, age, number of men and women, assessment method for H pylori infection, assessment method for H pylori eradication, observation interval between end of treatment and time H pylori eradication was confirmed), characteristics of the treatments (intervention, dosage, and duration), and outcomes (number of patients included in the intention to treat analysis, number of patients with successful eradication according to the intention to treat analysis, number of patients included in the analysis of adverse events, number of patients presenting with each of the most common adverse events). The primary outcome of this study was the efficacy of each eradication treatment, according to intention to treat analysis. The secondary outcome was the tolerance analysis, including the occurrence of adverse events in each eradication treatment. Two authors independently assessed the quality of evidence using both the Jadad scaleand the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for evaluating study bias.

Strategies to advance the field and potential adjunctive therapies

The most effective strategy for managing refractory H. pylori is preventing refractory H. pylori infection by improving success rates of primary eradication therapy.

Personalizing the initial H. pylori eradication therapy by incorporating individual host genetic, host non-genetic, and, microbial factors (Figure 1) might help achieve this by shifting the paradigm away from empiric therapy alone. Population-specific research with particular attention to race, ethnic, and age groups, can indicate determinants that impact eradication success in the US. Regional information of local success rates would further refine regimen selection. The Pan-European Registry on H. pylori managementis one prototype to emulate. Ideally, such a model would encompass systematic collection and reporting, together with periodic updates of regimen-specific local eradication rates — including regimens for primary and refractory infection — along with relevant nonidentifiable individual-level data such as demographics, smoking history, prior antibiotic exposure, and antibiotic sensitivity data if available. Aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of H. pylori eradication therapy. (BPA #11) This information could be utilized for both initial and refractory treatment choices.

Non-invasive H. pylori antibiotic sensitivity testing on stool, to supplant the current sensitivity testing using endoscopically obtained samples, would overcome many rate-limiting barriers precluding widespread uptake of sensitivity testing. Molecular testing of stool for the small number of known mutations responsible for clarithromycin of levofloxacin resistance is relatively straightforward, as there are several commercial kits for these purposes that utilize PCR. However, next generation sequencing technology offers the potential to detect the resistance footprint of all antibiotics considered in H. pylori therapy. While the clinical utility of utilizing stool-based predictions to guide antibiotic therapy remains to be fully determined, collecting this information would galvanize a data pipeline to accelerate the establishment of surveillance registries, which are immediately needed. Hand-in-hand, implementation and adherence to standard quality metrics based on current clinical guidelines, including appropriate eradication confirmation testing in all individuals treated for H. pylori would simultaneously advance surveillance programs and ideally attenuate the high practice pattern variability observed in the management of refractory H. pylori infection.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection… [^ebea0a01]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Eradication is defined as a negative result from a repeated test for the detection of H pylori at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Antibiotic resistance and its effect on eradication efficacy will also be discussed with recommendations for proper therapeutic choice. After an initial oral dose of 1000 mg, followed by 500 mg/d for 5 days, the elimination half-life has been reported to be 57 hours. 18 Azithromycin has excellent in vitro activity against H pylori. 19 It is not effective as a single agent because of acquired resistance. 20 However, when it is used in combination with other antibiotics, improved eradication rates are achieved.
21. This regimen resulted in an eradication rate of 91%. In the arm of the study that used metronidazole placebo, the eradication rate dropped to 9%. This implies that the efficacy of this regimen is highly dependent on metronidazole.

Another recent trial50 demonstrated a similar eradication rate with a comparable regimen of bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline. Helicobacter pylori was eradicated in 88% of the patients. Moreover, 90% of those patients who had failed prior eradication therapy achieved a cure with this regimen. A similar eradication rate was achieved in another trial41 using the same 2-week regimen of metronidazole, omeprazole, and clarithromycin in 30 patients. Histamine2-receptor antagonists have been used in combination with 2 antibiotics for the eradication of H pylori with good success. Hentschel et al, 65 in a randomized, double-blind trial, achieved an 89% eradication rate using metronidazole, amoxicillin, and ranitidine for 12 days, followed by 30 additional days of ranitidine. One-hundred twenty two of the 125 patients who completed the study achieved eradication whereas only 110 of 124 of those patients who were receiving famotidine had cleared their infection. The pretreatment prevalence of metronidazole-resistant strains was greater in the group receiving omeprazole, compared with the group receiving famotidine. Again, addition of a proton pump inhibitor resulted in enhanced eradication efficacy despite a greater prevalence of metronidazole-resistant isolates.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^37ecb686]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — key concepts emphasize prevalence, linked testing-treatment decisions, regimen selection, and follow-up. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America remains substantial at 30%–40%. The determination of when to test for — and treat — H. pylori should be viewed as a single, rather than 2 separate and distinct, decisions. Clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-containing treatment regimens should be avoided in the absence of demonstrated macrolide and quinolone susceptibility, respectively. All patients who are treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure with an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 wk after completion of therapy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy. PCAB denotes potassium-competitive acid blocker and PPI denotes proton pump inhibitor.

### Appropriate interval for assessing H. pylori eradication… [^86a08e92]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancies. Eradicating this bacteria in selected patients can significantly reduce the incidence of recurrent PUD. Treatment typically includes the use of acid suppressive medications along with antimicrobials. Assessing for eradication can be reliably accomplished with histology, rapid urease testing and urea breath testing, but these tests are typically performed no less than four weeks after the completion of treatment. Chey and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of the 14C-UBT at two weeks after treatment and compared those results with results obtained four to six weeks after treatment. Patients with active H. pylori infection received proton-pump inhibitor –based treatment for 10 to 14 days. Eradication was assessed using the 14C-UBT at two weeks and again at four to six weeks after treatment. A positive test for H.

pylori was a carbon dioxide excretion of more than 200 disintegrations per minute, a negative test was less than 50 dpm and an equivocal test was 50 to 200 dpm. Confidence intervals for the two-week UBT were established by using the four-to six-week UBT as the gold standard. A total of 82 patients completed the protocol. Four had an equivocal UBT test and were excluded. Of the remaining patients, 68 had a negative UBT at four to six weeks. Of the 10 patients who had a positive UBT at four to six weeks, nine also had a positive test at two weeks. Given these data, the two-week UBT had a sensitivity of 90 percent, a specificity of 99 percent and an accuracy rate of 97 percent. In addition, patients with a positive UBT at four weeks also had lower CO. 2 excretion levels at two weeks than at four weeks. The authors conclude that the results of the two-week 14C-UBT for H.

pylori eradication were similar to those obtained at the standard four- to six-week follow-up interval. Early testing for eradication allows physicians to identify treatment failures sooner and to provide appropriate interventions in a more timely manner.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role oferadication in preventing gastric cancer [^2841e132]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis support the notion that H. pylori is a significant risk factor for GC. In addition, the results confirmed that H. pylori eradication is associated with a reduction in the incidence of GC and may therefore be the most viable strategy for GC prevention. However, as these results come mainly from East Asian countries, they must be interpreted with caution for European and North American countries; more studies from these parts of the world are needed to better define the role of H. pylori eradication in preventing GC.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The International Agency for Research on Cancer declared Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as a class I human carcinogen and individuals who tested positive for H. pylori are at increased risk of developing gastric cancer (GC) compared with uninfected controls
A growing body of evidence has suggested that H. pylori eradication might prevent GC development
An earlier meta-analysis reported that H. pylori treatment could reduce the risk of GC in Asians

What the new findings are:

This meta-analysis evaluated updated data concerning the effect of H. pylori eradication on GC risk and in particular examined the effect of H. pylori eradication on GC risk according to baseline histology
The results support the notion that H. pylori is a significant risk factor for GC and that H. pylori eradication is associated with a reduction in the incidence of GC
H. pylori eradication represents a primary preventive strategy in a subset of subjects with non-atrophic or atrophic gastritis. However, H. pylori eradication in patients who have already developed advanced pre-neoplastic lesions, i.e. intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, does not prevent GC development

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — testing timing and susceptibility methods: We recommend that before invasive testing for diagnosis and noninvasive testing confirmation of H. pylori eradication, to wait at least 2 weeks after stopping PPIs and 4 weeks after stopping antibiotics and bismuth salts, we recommend that antimicrobial susceptibility be obtained by culture for the infecting H. pylori strain(s) according to a standardized methodology and/or by real-time polymerase chain reaction for CLA resistance, and eradication treatment tailored accordingly, and we suggest against the use of stool molecular tests for H. pylori infection detection or for susceptibility testing.

### "Cervia II working group report 2006": guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in Italy [^c755727c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Proper management of Helicobacter pylori infection in clinical practice — when supported by evidence-based data — is expected to produce substantial cost-efficacy advantages. This consideration has prompted the Cervia Working Group to organise a meeting of experts to update the National Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection in Italy. Recommendations in the new European Guidelines were considered in the National setting, here in the light of factors such as the incidence of gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma, the accessibility to different diagnostic tools, the prevalence of bacterial resistance against antibiotics, and the availability of different drugs. The main revisions in respect to the previous guidelines include H. pylori eradication in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients and in non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug users, as well as in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and iron deficiency anaemia. The stool antigen test is now accepted as a valid test for confirmation of H. pylori eradication following therapy. New therapeutic approaches have been recommended for both first- (sequential therapy) and second-line (levofloxacin-based) treatment in our country.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^d54c38ad]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

H. pylori eradication always confers a benefit by halting progression of gastric mucosal damage, reducing the reservoir of infected individuals and reducing or preventing H. pylori -associated diseases. The maximum benefit of eradication for an individual is obtained if eradication is done while the H. pylori -induced mucosal damage has not progressed beyond the non-atrophic stage. This population is found in countries where gastric cancer is still prevalent and is concentrated in the younger generation. H. pylori eradication of adolescents and young adults has an additional advantage of reducing or preventing transmission of the infection to their children.

As noted above (Section 3), the risk for development of gastric cancer correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. It is impossible to define the risk for an individual based on age. Cancer risk in any population relates to the rate of progression of gastric mucosal damage, which is high in populations at high risk of cancer and low in H. pylori -infected populations with a low cancer risk. Thus, while it is possible to identify an average age at which the transition from non-atrophic to atrophic phenotype occurs for any population, one should expect that any age group will contain individuals with a wide range of damage, ranging from uninfected (normal) to advanced atrophy. This emphasises the need for risk stratification based on objective parameters including a validated histological staging system rather than on age, to identify whether one eradication treatment is needed or whether the patient might require surveillance.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to H. pylori testing, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for H. pylori infection with a nonserological test in patients with autoimmune gastritis, followed by eradication treatment if positive and post-treatment testing to confirm eradication.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^60eb5c83]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent, global infectious disease that causes dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The American College of Gastroenterology commissioned this clinical practice guideline (CPG) to inform the evidence-based management of patients with H. pylori infection in North America. This CPG used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to systematically analyze 11 Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions and generate recommendations. Where evidence was insufficient or the topic did not lend itself to GRADE, expert consensus was used to create 6 key concepts. For treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) for 14 days is the preferred regimen when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or potassium-competitive acid blocker dual therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative in patients without penicillin allergy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, "optimized" BQT for 14 days is preferred for those who have not been treated with optimized BQT previously and for whom antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. In patients previously treated with optimized BQT, rifabutin triple therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative. Salvage regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin should only be used if antibiotic susceptibility is confirmed. The CPG also addresses who to test, the need for universal post-treatment test-of-cure, and the current evidence regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing and its role in guiding the choice of initial and salvage treatment. The CPG concludes with a discussion of proposed research priorities to address knowledge gaps and inform future management recommendations in patients with H. pylori infection from North America.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^bd6dcf4c]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Apart from the practicalities of obtaining H. pylori antibiotic sensitivity testing, especially in the US, a note of caution is still warranted when embarking on therapy directed by susceptibility testing (also referred to as "tailored therapy"); the published literature in this area, which derives almost entirely from studies conducted in the Western Pacific, provides little to no evidence that sensitivity-based treatment selection actually results in significantly improved rates of successful H. pylori eradication over empirically selected second-line regimens. High quality clinical trials of tailored versus empiric therapy after two or more failed attempts at eradication are unfortunately lacking in the US and should be prioritized for future research. Cost-effectiveness analyses will also be valuable, especially if non-endoscopic modalities for susceptibility testing become a viable option, such as molecular testing of stool samples. In the absence of such data, the Maastricht strategy of susceptibility testing after two unsuccessful therapies should be considered in most cases (Figure 2; BPA #10).

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^410e2003]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary objectives of this Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Expert Review are to 1) provide a salient overview of determinants of H. pylori eradication treatment failure, including host-, microbe-, and systems-related factors as they are currently understood; and, 2) leverage these data to provide clinical practitioners with evidence- and consensus-based multimodal best practice advice for treating H. pylori after the first treatment failure. We include a clinically relevant synthesis of contemporary data on the appropriateness and efficacy, or lack thereof, of specific antimicrobial treatment regimens and adjunctive therapeutic agents for this purpose. The terms "salvage" and "rescue" therapy are commonly used in the literature to describe treatment courses following the initial eradication therapy, but without a consistent definition. As such, we avoid the use of these terms. Additionally, to the extent possible, we focus on evidence from North America in order to ensure that this article is most relevant for US practitioners.

Definition of refractory infection

For the purpose of this CPU Expert Review, refractory H. pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive non-serological H. pylori test (i.e. a breath-, stool-, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks following one or more completed course(s) of current guideline-recommended first-line H. pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications that might impact the test sensitivity (e.g. proton-pump inhibitors (PPI)). Refractory H. pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a non-serological test which was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — as the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^d07f1a98]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

These consensus recommendations are intended to provide the most relevant current best-practice guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland, with a view to improving eradication rates and preventing the progression of H. pylori -associated disease. As antibiotic resistance is a constantly evolving process, an on-going effort to monitor both antibiotic resistance rates and eradication rates should be made at a national level with centralised data collection protocols.

### The stool antigen test for detection of Helicobacter pylori after eradication therapy [^d109707d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Current noninvasive tests to confirm the eradication of Helicobacter pylori must be performed 4 weeks or more after eradication therapy is completed.

Objective

To determine whether the stool antigen test, a relatively new noninvasive test for H. pylori, administered at various times after eradication therapy correctly identifies persons with persistent H. pylori infection.

Design

Prospective blinded study.

Setting

Six clinical centers in the United States and Europe.

Patients

84 H. pylori — infected patients undergoing endoscopy for upper abdominal symptoms.

Measurements

At baseline and on day 35 after the completion of triple eradication therapy, all patients underwent endoscopy with histologic examination, rapid urease test and culture, urea breath test, and a stool antigen test. The stool antigen test was also performed on days 3, 7, 15, 21, 28, and 35 after completion of therapy.

Results

Compared with the gold-standard endoscopic tests on day 35 after antimicrobial therapy, the urea breath test had a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI, 71% to 100%) and a specificity of 100% (CI, 94% to 100%). The stool antigen test had a sensitivity of 94% (CI, 71% to 100%) and a specificity of 97% (CI, 89% to 100%). On day 7 after treatment, the stool antigen test was predictive of eradication (positive predictive value, 100% [CI, 69% to 100%]; negative predictive value, 91% [CI, 82% to 97%]).

Conclusion

A positive result on the stool antigen test 7 days after completion of therapy identifies patients in whom eradication of H. pylori was unsuccessful.

### The most important diagnostic modalities for Helicobacter pylori, now and in the future [^66acd778]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: Helicobacter pylori infection plays a central role in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disease, and its accurate diagnosis and successful eradication is crucial in a wide range of different circumstances. Currently, serology is recommended for initial screening, followed by histology and/or culture to confirm the diagnosis before treatment. Since H. pylori is developing greater resistance to certain antibiotics, culture is becoming increasingly important in some populations to test for susceptibility to antibiotics. To confirm eradication after treatment, the urea breath test is used. This test is presently the best non-invasive test to determine eradication. NEW APPROACHES: Considerable efforts are being made to improve diagnostic methods, and a host of new or improved approaches can be expected in the near future. For general screening, tests are being developed that use whole blood and can be used by general practitioners to give rapid results in a cost-effective manner. The evidence so far suggests that these new 'office' tests are not as accurate as laboratory tests, but they are nevertheless important for general diagnostic purposes. Serological tests for cagA antibodies and immunoblot tests are also under development. New biopsy-based tests include the development of a true rapid urease test which will give accurate results in 1 h. Polymerase chain reaction/DNA enzyme immunoassay detection is another field receiving attention. Non-invasive direct tests of the future are likely to include the use of the polymerase chain reaction in faeces. This paper reviews current diagnostic modalities for H. pylori and gives an overview of expected future developments.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer in the United States: expert review [^3a9e7932]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 4 — opportunistic Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) screening and eradication for gastric cancer (GC) prevention states that H pylori eradication is essential and serves as an adjunct to endoscopic screening and surveillance; opportunistic screening for H pylori infection should be considered in individuals deemed to be at increased risk for GC and screening for H pylori infection in adult household members of individuals who test positive for H pylori ("familial-based testing") should also be considered. H pylori is described as the most common chronic infection worldwide and responsible for 90% of the global GC burden. Non–US randomized controlled trials show that H pylori eradication reduces GC incidence and mortality, with a meta-analysis reporting 46% (relative risk, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40–0.72; number needed to treat = 72) and 39% (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40–0.92; number needed to treat = 135) respective reductions; corresponding US observational studies similarly found substantially reduced GC risk in patients with successful eradication compared with those with persistent infection.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^b6d2eae1]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Definition of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection — refractory H pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive nonserologic H pylori test result (ie, a breath, stool, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks after 1 or more completed course(s) of a current guideline-recommended first-line H pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications, such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), that might impact the test sensitivity. Refractory H pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a nonserologic test that was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — because the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^327c2e91]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Initial examination and H. pylori management in dysplastic GPMC — In the United States, "the reality is that the diagnosis of dysplasia generally hinges on confirmation from biopsy sampling". For active Helicobacter pylori infection, "it is recommended that eradication treatment be immediately provided with confirmation of eradication because (i) concomitant H. pylori infection may affect the diagnostic certainty of dysplasia; (ii) H. pylori eradication is associated with reduced risk of progression, particularly for IND and LGD; and (iii) active H. pylori infection may compromise delineation of the resection margin for visible lesions", yet "awaiting eradication confirmation should not delay endoscopic management, especially for patients with HGD". If the index examination was performed by a provider with limited volume or there are quality concerns, "referral to a high-volume center with expertise is preferred", and re-evaluation should include "systematic protocol biopsies of the surrounding flat mucosa to inform surveillance intervals", with recognition that "several studies have demonstrated rates of missed synchronous cancers around 10%, even in expert hands".

### Host genetic determinants associated with Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^07db0761]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Helicobacter pylori infects approximately 50% of individuals worldwide. Successful H pylori eradication is associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease, among other conditions. We hypothesized that host genetic determinants, especially those affecting gastric pH, might contribute to eradication therapy failure, particularly when treatment adherence and antibiotic susceptibility are confirmed. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of host genetic variants associated with H pylori eradication failure.

Methods

We searched the literature for studies comparing posttreatment H pylori eradication failure vs success (outcome) according to host genetic polymorphisms (exposure). Reference groups were defined according to genotypes (or corresponding phenotypes) hypothesized to be associated with successful eradication. We pooled estimates using a random-effects model and performed comprehensive sensitivity analyses.

Results

We analyzed 57 studies from 11 countries; the vast majority analyzed CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Among individuals prescribed eradication regimens with proton pump inhibitors predominantly CYP2C19 metabolized, enhanced vs poor metabolizer phenotypes were associated with a 2.52-fold significantly higher likelihood of eradication failure and 4.44-fold significantly higher likelihood when treatment adherence and H pylori clarithromycin susceptibility (if relevant) were confirmed. There was no association between CYP2C19 variants and eradication failure if proton pump inhibitors less metabolized by or that bypass CYP2C19 metabolism were used. IL1B polymorphisms that are vs are not associated with less gastric acid suppression were associated with 1.72-fold significantly higher likelihood of eradication failure. There was no association between MDR1 polymorphisms and H pylori eradication failure. The certainty of evidence was moderate.

Conclusion

Based on meta-analysis, we identified host genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with H pylori eradication failure; host genetics might underlie eradication failure among treatment-adherent individuals with confirmed H pylori antibiotic susceptibility.

A lack of physician follow-up is an additional challenge. The American Clinical Guidelines recommendation is to test patients after treatment therapy for eradication determination, but it is estimated that only 20 to 40% of primary care physicians confirm H. pylori eradication, with only slightly higher rates among gastroenterologists. However, education of clinicians to this clinical guideline can improve retesting for eradication.

### Infection diagnosis and management: current practices of Greek gastroenterologists [^c1766178]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection vary significantly, depending on country, area, and specialty. The aim of this study was to record the current practices of Greek gastroenterologists in the screening and treatment of H. pylori infection.

Method

An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 19 questions about the management of H. pylori infection was sent with the aid of the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology to all members of the Society.

Results

The questionnaire was completed by 180 gastroenterologists, with a response rate of 31.4%. Diagnostic tests to confirm H. pylori infection are ordered by > 90% of the gastroenterologists for patients with current peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, family history of gastric cancer, and an endoscopic appearance suggestive of gastritis. Most gastroenterologists (55.8%) also tested for H. pylori in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Histopathology was the most preferred (60.6%) method when testing was decided during endoscopy, while urea breath test was the most preferred method (67.8%) regardless of endoscopy. Most gastroenterologists use quadruple eradication regimens supported by international guidelines (90%), while 65.6% of the physicians answered that they systematically recommend the addition of probiotics to standard therapy. Most physicians (82.8%) answered that they always confirm the eradication of the pathogen.

Conclusions

The majority of Greek gastroenterologists conform to the recommendations of international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of H. pylori infection, except for the screening of patients with GERD. A considerable number of doctors use probiotics in addition to standard therapy.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^9e8ca49c]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Comment

Based on the Rome III consensus, FD is defined as "the presence of chronic dyspeptic symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain or burning) without evidence of structural disease (including at upper endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms" (figure 1). This group was contrasted with those in whom chronic dyspeptic symptoms have an identified organic or metabolic cause, where elimination of that cause or improvement of the disease leads to resolution or improvement of symptoms.

Figure 1
Diagnostic algorithm of Helicobacter pylori -associated dyspepsia. Patients with dyspeptic symptoms after negative routine laboratory and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy except for positive H. pylori tests, should undergo eradication therapy. If sustained symptomatic relief is obtained, their dyspeptic symptoms are considered as H. pylori- associated dyspepsia. On the other hand, if dyspeptic symptoms do not resolve or recur after eradication therapy, they are judged to have functional dyspepsia. EGD, oesophagastroduodenoscopy.

The Rome III consensus mentions a subset of patients with H. pylori gastritis as representative of organic dyspepsia if they respond to eradication. Patients with H. pylori gastritis in whom symptoms persist despite eradication therapy eliminating the infection were identified as having FD. As mentioned above, eradication therapy studies showed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD derive symptomatic benefit from eradication, with a delay of at least 6 months from cure of the infection.

Based on these considerations, sustained symptom control after successful eradication identifies H. pylori as the organic cause of the symptoms in these patients and provides the rationale to consider H. pylori- associated dyspepsia as a separate clinical entity. H. pylori- infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and negative endoscopy are now treated and labelled depending on their treatment response as outlined in figure 1.

Eradication of H. pylori is first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients.
