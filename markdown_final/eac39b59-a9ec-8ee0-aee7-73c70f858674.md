## Question

Does secondary CVID persist

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "secondary CVID" persists. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "secondary CVID" means in this context and whether that phrase is technically accurate. Then, I should verify the distinction between primary CVID and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and how persistence is defined in guidelines. Next, I will examine evidence on persistence in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia across common causes like B-cell–targeted therapy, glucocorticoids, protein-losing states, and HIV. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful answer with monitoring and management implications, making sure I don't conflate terminology or overgeneralize from limited data.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not mixing concepts. "Secondary CVID" is not a standard diagnostic term; CVID is a primary immunodeficiency (inborn error of immunity) defined by low IgG with low IgA and/or IgM, impaired vaccine responses, onset after age 2–4 years, and exclusion of secondary causes, so by definition CVID is primary, not secondary [^8b059e86] [^ad20778d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what patients often mean by "secondary CVID" is secondary hypogammaglobulinemia, i.e., low immunoglobulins due to external factors such as medications, protein loss, or infections, which is a different entity from CVID and requires a different diagnostic and management approach [^a5180f81] [^6aff3831].

> Next, I should review how persistence is framed in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia guidance. The AAAAI workgroup proposes standardized duration categories for secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: 3–6 months, 6–12 months, 12–24 months, and more than 24 months, which operationalizes "persistence" for research and clinical follow-up even though these brackets are not prescriptive treatment thresholds [^00e53a99] [^6aff3831]. Wait, let me verify the severity cutoffs too — adult hypogammaglobulinemia is often defined as IgG less than 700 mg/dL with stratification into 400–699, 200–399, and 0–199 mg/dL, which helps quantify severity but again does not dictate when to start immunoglobulin replacement by itself [^6aff3831] [^00e53a99].

> I will now examine B-cell–targeted therapies, where persistence is most clinically salient. Rituximab and other anti-CD20 agents can cause prolonged or even persistent hypogammaglobulinemia in a subset of patients, with some requiring long-term immunoglobulin replacement; recovery can be delayed beyond 12 months and occasionally does not normalize, indicating a durable B-cell functional defect in a minority [^850f8889] [^06f56406]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring advice — expert guidance recommends baseline immunoglobulins, periodic checks after therapy, and consideration of IgG replacement for persistent low IgG with recurrent or serious infections, reflecting that persistence is not universal but is clinically meaningful when it occurs [^850f8889] [^f1042731].

> Let me consider glucocorticoids next. In a cohort of giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica patients on steroids, about half developed hypogammaglobulinemia and nearly half of those with reduced IgG had persistent deficiency during observation, though the pattern often shows isolated IgG reduction with preserved class-switched memory B cells, which helps distinguish it from CVID phenotypes [^4140ff51]. I should double-check the implication — yes, persistence can occur after steroid exposure, but it is not inevitable and may reverse with dose reduction or cessation, so persistence is variable and context dependent [^4140ff51].

> Now, protein-losing states and other secondary causes. In nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathy, hypogammaglobulinemia reflects increased IgG catabolism or loss rather than impaired production; persistence tracks with the underlying disease activity and may improve if protein loss is corrected, though some patients have chronic, ongoing losses that sustain low IgG until definitive therapy of the primary condition [^1138dc07] [^a5180f81]. But wait, what if the protein loss is irreversible? In that scenario, the secondary hypogammaglobulinemia can be chronic and may warrant IgG replacement for infection prevention despite the secondary mechanism [^notfound].

> HIV deserves special mention. Initially, I thought HIV universally elevates immunoglobulins and thus would not cause persistent hypogammaglobulinemia; wait, let me verify that because it is too broad a generalization. While hypergammaglobulinemia is common in untreated HIV, case reports document coexisting CVID or hypogammaglobulinemia, and rare descriptions suggest that with HAART-mediated viral suppression, some patients experience improvement in IgG/IgM production, implying that persistence is not guaranteed and may be modifiable with treatment of the underlying infection, although this remains exceptional and not a typical course [^e4a75a55] [^b21cd5b8]. I should confirm that this does not redefine CVID as secondary — correct, CVID remains a primary diagnosis even if HIV coexists, and any secondary hypogammaglobulinemia in HIV is managed as SHG alongside HIV care [^a5180f81].

> Let me synthesize the answer carefully. Yes, secondary hypogammaglobulinemia can persist, and in some settings — particularly after B-cell–targeted therapy and in chronic protein-losing conditions — it may be prolonged or even permanent, necessitating ongoing monitoring and, in selected cases, immunoglobulin replacement to reduce infection risk; however, persistence is not universal and depends on the cause, reversibility of the underlying condition, and individual immune recovery kinetics [^a5180f81] [^6aff3831]. Hold on, I should verify the practical takeaway — clinicians should monitor immunoglobulins periodically after exposures like rituximab or prolonged steroids, assess vaccine responses and infection history, and consider IgG replacement when IgG remains low with recurrent or serious infections despite optimal management of the secondary cause, aligning with consensus guidance for SHG [^f1042731] [^b236bc21].

Secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia can persist after the underlying cause is removed, especially with **rituximab** [^850f8889] or **chronic glucocorticoids** [^4140ff51], where B-cell recovery is slow or incomplete. Persistence is also common in **protein-losing states** (nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) and with **chronic infections** (HIV, CMV) [^1138dc07] [^26d3e6d1]. In contrast, drug-induced hypogammaglobulinemia from short-term immunosuppression often resolves within 6–12 months after stopping the agent [^notfound]. Persistent cases may require ongoing immunoglobulin replacement and infection prophylaxis until recovery is confirmed [^f1042731].

---

## Factors influencing persistence

Several factors influence whether secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia persists after the underlying cause is addressed:

- **Underlying cause**: The etiology of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia significantly impacts persistence. Conditions such as chronic infections (e.g. HIV, CMV), protein-losing states (e.g. nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy), and certain malignancies (e.g. chronic lymphocytic leukemia) can cause persistent hypogammaglobulinemia even after initial treatment [^1138dc07] [^26d3e6d1].

- **Duration and severity of immunosuppression**: Prolonged or intense immunosuppressive therapy, particularly with B-cell-depleting agents like rituximab, can result in prolonged or persistent hypogammaglobulinemia due to delayed or incomplete B-cell reconstitution [^850f8889] [^06f56406].

- **Individual immune response**: Variability in individual immune system recovery plays a crucial role. Some patients experience rapid recovery of immunoglobulin levels and B-cell function, while others have prolonged or incomplete recovery, necessitating ongoing immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) [^f1042731].

---

## Clinical evidence on persistence

Recent studies and clinical guidelines provide evidence on the persistence of secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia:

- **Rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinemia**: Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, frequently causes prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of patients receiving rituximab develop persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, with some requiring long-term IgRT [^850f8889] [^06f56406].

- **Glucocorticoid-induced hypogammaglobulinemia**: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy can cause persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, particularly affecting IgG levels. Recovery may be slow and incomplete upon discontinuation of therapy, especially if administered at high doses or for prolonged periods [^4140ff51].

- **Protein-losing states**: Conditions such as nephrotic syndrome and protein-losing enteropathy can cause persistent hypogammaglobulinemia due to ongoing immunoglobulin loss, which may continue until the underlying protein-losing condition is adequately controlled or resolved [^1138dc07].

- **Chronic infections**: Persistent viral infections, such as HIV and CMV, can cause ongoing immune suppression and hypogammaglobulinemia, which may persist until effective antiviral therapy is instituted and viral control is achieved [^26d3e6d1].

---

## Management strategies for persistent secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia

Management of persistent secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia involves a multidisciplinary approach:

- **Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT)**: IgRT is the cornerstone of management for persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, providing passive immunity and reducing the risk of recurrent infections until immune recovery occurs [^f1042731].

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in patients with recurrent infections or high-risk profiles, particularly in the setting of persistent hypogammaglobulinemia [^f1042731].

- **Monitoring and reassessment**: Regular monitoring of immunoglobulin levels, B-cell subsets, and clinical infection history is essential to assess immune recovery and guide ongoing management decisions [^b236bc21].

- **Addressing underlying causes**: Continued efforts to treat or control the underlying cause of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g. viral infections, protein-losing states) are critical to facilitate immune recovery and reduce the need for ongoing IgRT [^a5180f81].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

The prognosis and recovery timeline vary widely depending on the underlying cause, duration, and severity of immunosuppression, and individual immune response. In general:

- **Short-term immunosuppression**: Hypogammaglobulinemia resulting from short-term immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. brief corticosteroid courses) often resolves within 6–12 months after discontinuation of therapy.

- **Long-term or intense immunosuppression**: Persistent hypogammaglobulinemia is more likely after prolonged or intense immunosuppression, particularly with rituximab or chronic glucocorticoid therapy, with recovery taking several years or remaining incomplete [^850f8889] [^4140ff51].

- **Protein-losing states and chronic infections**: Recovery depends on effective control of the underlying condition, and hypogammaglobulinemia may persist until adequate treatment is achieved [^1138dc07] [^26d3e6d1].

---

Secondary CVID-like hypogammaglobulinemia can persist after the underlying cause is removed, particularly with rituximab, chronic glucocorticoids, protein-losing states, or chronic infections. Persistence varies with the cause, treatment duration, and individual immune recovery; some cases resolve within 6–12 months, while others persist for years or indefinitely. Management includes **immunoglobulin replacement**, infection prophylaxis, and ongoing monitoring, with recovery contingent on addressing the underlying condition and immune reconstitution.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are the most frequent symptomatic primary immune deficiency in adults. Because there is no known cause for these conditions, there is no single clinical feature or laboratory test that can confirm the diagnosis with certainty. If a causative mutation is identified, patients are deemed to have a CVID-like disorder caused by a specific primary immunodeficiency/inborn error of immunity. In the remaining patients, the explanation for these disorders remains unclear. The understanding of CVID continues to evolve and the authors review recent studies, which have addressed some of these uncertainties.

Immune System and Gut Abnormalities in Patients With Common Variable Immunodeficiency With and Without Gastrointestinal SymptomsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study will determine whether people with common variable immunodeficiency with and without gastrointestinal symptoms have gut abnormalities and changes in immune system cells and chemicals in the blood and gut. People with CVID have decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA. Patients have sinus, lung and other infections, and many also have stomach and intestinal problems, such as chronic diarrhea, inability to absorb nutrition from food, and intestinal infections caused by bacteria. CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms 10 years of age and older may be eligible for this study; CVID patients without gastrointestinal symptoms 18 years of age and older will be enrolled as control subjects.

Candidates will be screened with a review of their medical records, a medical history and physical examination, HIV blood test, stool sample, and hydrogen breath test. The breath test measures the amount of hydrogen in the breath after drinking sugar water, showing the digestive effects of bacteria in the upper intestine.

- Lower endoscopy a thin lighted tube is advanced through the rectum to evaluate the colon Identification of GI abnormalities associated with changes in immune response in CVID patients will help in developing and testing new treatments for this disease. Common variable immunodeficiency is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA levels.

In addition to chronic or recurrent sinopulmonary infections, many patients develop gastrointestinal manifestations that can be disabling or fatal. Data suggest that these gut abnormalities have a primary immune basis, implicating T cells primarily, and are not related to the infectious complications of CVID. Currently there is no standard therapy for the associated gastrointestinal disease outside of empiric nutritional intervention for weight loss and non-specific anti-diarrheal agents. In addition there is no data about the prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in CVID patients who have no overt gastrointestinal symptoms. The objectives of this study are to characterize the gastrointestinal abnormalities that occur in CVID patients and correlate this with the immunophenotype and cytokine secretion of peripheral blood and lamina propria lymphocytes and monocytes.

CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms of malabsorption/maldigestion and chronic diarrhea will be targeted for study.

### Common variable immunodeficiency: an update on etiology and management [^b0babcce]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents a heterogeneous group of primary antibody deficiency disorders characterized by recurrent infection and by inflammatory, granulomatous, and autoimmune complications. Recently, there have been significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, with five genetic mutations identified in patients who have a CVID phenotype. Clinical care also has progressed with refinements in treatment and the development of classification schemes for prognostic and research purposes. Significant delays in diagnosis remain, however. It is likely that more genetic defects will be identified in the future, further shrinking the pool of patients who have CVID of unknown cause.

### The variable in common variable immunodeficiency: a disease of complex phenotypes [^a3b5a0f1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common and clinically most important severe primary antibody deficiency and is characterized by low levels of IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, with a failure to produce specific antibodies. This diagnostic category represents a heterogeneous group of disorders, which present not only with acute and chronic infections but also with a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as an increased incidence of lymphoma and other malignancies. Patients can now be categorized into distinct clinical phenotypes based on analysis of large cohort studies and be further stratified by immunologic laboratory testing. The biologic importance of this categorization is made clear by the 11-fold increase in mortality if even one of these phenotypes (cytopenias, lymphoproliferation, or enteropathy) is present. Limited progress in defining the underlying molecular causes has been made with known causative single gene defects accounting for only 3% of cases, and, for this and the reasons mentioned above, CVID remains resolute in its variability. This review provides a practical approach to risk stratification of these complex phenotypes by using current clinical categories and laboratory biomarkers. The effects of infection as well as inflammatory and autoimmune complications on different organ systems are discussed alongside strategies to reduce diagnostic delay. Recent developments in diagnostics and therapy are also explored.

### Common variable immune deficiency and Associated complications [^88d88cf6]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders refer to a relatively common primary immune deficiency group of diseases that present with infectious and inflammatory complications secondary to defects in antibody production and sometimes in cellular immunity. The disorder often presents in middle age or later with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, or a plethora of noninfectious complications such as autoimmune disorders, granulomatous interstitial lung disease, GI diseases, malignancies (including lymphoma), and multisystem granulomatous disease resembling sarcoidosis. Infusion of immunoglobulin by IV or subcutaneous is the mainstay of therapy. Management of complications is often difficult as immune suppression may be necessary in these conditions and entails the use of medications and biologicals which may further increase the risk for infections. Specifically, bronchiectasis, granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease, repeated sinopulmonary infections, and malignancies are sequelae of antibody deficiency that may present to the pulmonologist. This review will provide an updated understanding of the molecular aspects, differential diagnosis, presentations, and the management of common variable immunodeficiency disorders.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^fc3527a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunodeficiency, defined as a weakened or dysfunctional immune system that increases susceptibility to infections and cancer, is common in adults. Recent estimates suggest that more than 6% of US adults may be affected, with most cases resulting from secondary immunodeficiencies (SID). These deficiencies arise due to external factors such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, medications, intrinsic factors including systemic diseases, malignancies, and metabolic disorders, or a combination of both. Primary immunodeficiencies, traditionally referred to as "primary immune deficiencies (PID)," are now classified as inborn errors of immunity (IEI). These conditions can also be diagnosed in adult patients, often with delayed diagnoses due to their heterogeneous manifestations. Importantly, this terminology can be misleading, as not all IEI initially present with immunodeficiency, and some may manifest only in adulthood. Moreover, IEI encompasses not only classical primary immunodeficiencies with recurrent or severe infections, but also conditions of immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy, and malignancy.

This review aims to provide clinicians with a practical framework for recognizing immunodeficiency in adults, with a focus on SID, which accounts for most cases. We will outline key warning signs, initial diagnostic steps, and indications for specialist referral and management. Additionally, we will discuss common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most frequently diagnosed symptomatic IEI in adults. These considerations are based on a narrative review of literature, expert consensus, and the authors' clinical experience to guide decision making in practice.

### Update in understanding common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs) and the management of patients with these conditions [^fc8e8d60]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The common variable immunodeficiency disorders are a mixed group of heterogeneous conditions linked by lack of immunoglobulin production and primary antibody failure. This variability results in difficulty in making coherent sense of either immunopathogenesis or the role of various genetic abnormalities reported in the literature. The recent attempt to collate the varied complications in these conditions and to define particular clinical phenotypes has improved our understanding of these diseases. Once refined and confirmed by other studies, these definitions will facilitate improved accuracy of prognosis and better management of clinical complication. They may also provide a method of analysing outcomes as related to new immunopathological and genetic findings.

### Advances in the care of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs): from birth to adulthood [^42b8fb19]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Another example of change and continuing evolution in PID is our improved understanding and approach to the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVIDs). The term CVID describes a heterogeneous set of disorders that are collectively characterized by defective antibody production and which can have a highly variable clinical presentation typified by recurrent infection of the respiratory tract. Readers are referred to recent publications for fuller details of the diagnostic criteria that apply in CVID, ESID Working Clinical Criteria (available here:), and to recent publications describing current PID and CVID classifications.

While survival of patients with CVIDs has improved in recent decades due in part to the wider availability and advances in immunoglobulin replacement therapy, this has exposed a risk of morbidity and mortality in CVID due to secondary, non-infectious complications of disease that may include autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases, functional and structural lung disease, liver diseases, and the development of malignancies. We now appreciate that these secondary complications need to be actively searched out, as part of any diagnosis and patient phenotyping, as well as throughout continuing patient assessment.

Diagnosis on the basis of clinical presentation and close clinical scrutiny of the patient and their history remain of paramount and primary importance; but today, they are not sufficient alone to reach an accurate diagnosis of a CVID because of the large degree of overlap in phenotypes and the variable presentation of different genetic disorders, which may present like CVID but which do not constitute a CVID diagnosis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The three key diagnostic aspects of immunodeficiency to consider in CVID

Among patients diagnosed with CVID, the number with undiagnosed combined immunodeficiency is generally underestimated, and this is a group that needs urgently to be identified through better clinical, laboratory, and increasingly genetic assessment.

The infection profile in CVIDs has been examined in several reports, such as those from the French DEF-I national study in which it was found that upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are highly prevalent and often manifest early as presenting features in CVID. Unusual, opportunistic infections need to be interpreted as potential signs of a combined immunodeficiency, and patients presenting with these need to be further evaluated even when formally fulfilling the criteria for CVID. Similarly, clinical signs of immune dysregulation — often termed as complex CVID patients — should alert for a diagnostic work-up for combined immunodeficiency and end-organ disease(s).

### Autoimmunity in common variable immunodeficiency [^4185d21a]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmunity has been increasingly recognized as a major issue in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adulthood. Different authors report high prevalences of autoimmune diseases in CVID, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this apparent paradox. Genetic predisposition, under current surveillance, innate and adaptive immunity deficiencies leading to persistent/recurrent infections, variable degrees of immune dysregulation, and possible failure in central and peripheral mechanisms of tolerance induction or maintenance may all contribute to increased autoimmunity.

Conclusions

Data on the clinical/immunological profile of affected patients and treatment are available mostly concerning autoimmune cytopenias, the most common autoimmune diseases in CVID. Treatment is based on conventional alternatives, in association with short experience with new agents, including rituximab and infliximab. Benefits of early immunoglobulin substitutive treatment and hypothetical premature predictors of autoimmunity are discussed as potential improvements to CVID patients' follow-up.

### Perspective: evolving concepts in the diagnosis and understanding of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) [^365fec32]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are the most frequent symptomatic primary immune deficiency in adults. At this time, the causes of these conditions are unknown. Patients with CVID experience immune system failure consequent to late onset antibody failure. They have increased susceptibility to infections and are also at risk of severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders as a result of immune dysregulation. An increasing number of monogenic causes as well as a digenic disorder have been described in patients with a CVID phenotype. If a causative mutation is identified, patients are removed from the umbrella diagnosis of CVID and are reclassified as having a CVID-like disorder, resulting from a specific mutation. In non-consanguineous populations, next-generation sequencing (NGS) identifies a genetic cause in approximately 25% of patients with a CVID phenotype. It is six years since we published our diagnostic criteria for CVID. There is ongoing debate about diagnostic criteria, the role of vaccine responses and genetic analysis in the diagnosis of CVID. There have been several recent studies, which have addressed some of these uncertainties. Here we review this new evidence from the perspective of our CVID diagnostic criteria and speculate on future approaches, which may assist in identifying and assessing this group of enigmatic disorders.

### Diagnostic criteria for primary immunodeficiencies. representing PAGID (pan-American group for immunodeficiency) and ESID (European society for immunodeficiencies) [^ad20778d]. Clinical Immunology (1999). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for common variable immunodeficiency" for common variable immunodeficiency.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The clinical purpose of the criteria is to facilitate the diagnosis of CVID, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of serum immunoglobulins and an increased susceptibility to infections. The intended patient population includes individuals who present with recurrent infections and are suspected of having an immunodeficiency disorder.

The key components of the Diagnostic Criteria for Common Variable Immunodeficiency include the measurement of serum immunoglobulin G and A levels, with a decrease of at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age being indicative of CVID. Additionally, a decrease in any of the immunoglobulin isotypes (M, G, and A) of at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age is also considered. The criteria also take into account the age of onset of immunodeficiency, with a requirement of the onset being at or after 2 years of age. The presence of absent isohemagglutinins and/or a poor response to vaccines is another component of the criteria. Lastly, the criteria necessitate the exclusion of defined causes of hypogammaglobulinemia to ensure that the immunodeficiency is not secondary to another condition.

The tool assesses whether an individual meets the criteria for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) based on specific diagnostic factors. Five criteria guide the evaluation process, used to determine if the individual falls into categories of "Probable CVID", "Possible CVID", or if the criteria are not met.

Key criteria include:

- Decreased serum immunoglobulin G and A at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age.
- Decreased serum immunoglobulin in any of the isotypes (M, G, and A) at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age.
- Onset of immunodeficiency at 2 years of age or older.
- Absent isohemagglutinins and/or poor response to vaccines.
- Exclusion of defined causes of hypogammaglobulinemia.

The interpretation process involves checking these combinations:

- "Probable CVID" is indicated if criteria A (Decreased serum immunoglobulin G and A at least 2 SD below the mean for age), C, D, and E are selected. This set confirms that specific immunoglobulin levels are low, the onset age is appropriate, and there is no response to key immunity tests, while ruling out other known causes.

- "Possible CVID" is suggested if the input includes B (Decreased serum immunoglobulin in any of the isotype M, G, and A at least 2 SD below the mean for age), C, D, and E. This acknowledges a broader range of low immunoglobulin type but still needs to meet the other criteria.

- If the selected criteria do not match either configuration exactly, the classification is that "Diagnostic criteria are not met". This means the individual's condition doesn't squarely fit the patterns recognized for any form of CVID.

This structured approach helps clinicians systematically align patient symptoms and test results with known diagnostic frameworks for CVID, guiding proper assessment and possible confirmation or exclusion of the condition.

### Common variable immunodeficiency: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^d09fc742]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) refers to a grouping of antibody deficiencies that lack a more specific genetic or phenotypic classification. It is the immunodeficiency classification with the greatest number of constituents, likely because of the numerous ways in which antibody production can be impaired and the frequency in which antibody production becomes impaired in human beings. CVID comprises a heterogeneous group of rare diseases. Consequently, CVID presents a significant challenge for researchers and clinicians. Despite these difficulties, both our understanding of and ability to manage this grouping of complex immune diseases has advanced significantly over the past 60 years.

### Neurologic manifestations of common variable immunodeficiency: impact on quality of life [^660392e1]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common primary immunodeficiency of adults with an estimated prevalence between 1:10,000 and 1:100,000 worldwide and approximately 1:67,000 in the United States.CVID is characterized by low immunoglobulin levels with low or absent antibody production, resulting in recurrent infections and poor or no response to vaccinations. Despite the common presenting immunologic defect of hypogammaglobulinemia, the pathways that lead to this defect in patients with CVID are varied. Between 10% and 20% of cases with CVID have been shown to have a heritable cause to date; monogenic forms of CVID account for 2%–10% of patients, and the remainder of cases are polygenic or multifactorial. Clinical phenotypes in patients with CVID are highly variable, ranging from no complications to multisystem autoimmunity, polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration, enteropathy, and lymphoid malignancy. Neurologic manifestations of CVID have historically largely been attributed to complications from infections of the nervous system or secondary to autoimmune/inflammatory causes. To date, limited epidemiologic data on the co-occurrence of CVID and neurologic disorders and/or related symptoms has been reported. Using surveys of patient-reported neurologic symptoms, we sought to characterize the prevalence of these symptoms in our immunodeficiency clinic population.

### Common variable immunodeficiency: a new look at an old disease [^0b9c0062]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies comprise many diseases caused by genetic defects primarily affecting the immune system. About 150 such diseases have been identified with more than 120 associated genetic defects. Although primary immunodeficiencies are quite rare in incidence, the prevalence can range from one in 500 to one in 500 000 in the general population, depending on the diagnostic skills and medical resources available in different countries. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the primary immunodeficiency most commonly encountered in clinical practice, and appropriate diagnosis and management of patients will have a significant effect on morbidity and mortality as well as financial aspects of health care. Advances in diagnostic laboratory methods, including B-cell subset analysis and genetic testing, coupled with new insights into the molecular basis of immune dysfunction in some patients with CVID, have enabled advances in the clinical classification of this heterogeneous disease.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^9e92526b]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunodeficiencies in adults are increasingly recognized yet often remain underdiagnosed, leading to significant morbidity from recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Both primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), now known as inborn errors of immunity (IEI), and secondary immunodeficiencies (SIDs) contribute to immune dysfunction in adults. Although SIDs are more common in adults due to factors like medications, malignancies, metabolic disorders, chronic conditions, and protein-losing conditions, IEI-particularly common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)-can also manifest in adulthood with diverse clinical features. Early recognition is crucial, with key warning signs including recurrent sinopulmonary infections, unexplained autoimmunity, poor vaccine responses, chronic diarrhea, bronchiectasis, and persistent lymphadenopathy. The diagnostic approach should be systematic. It begins with a detailed patient history and status followed by the evaluation of immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte subsets, vaccine-specific antibody responses, and exclusion of secondary causes. Genetic testing, increasingly accessible, plays an important role in confirming the diagnosis of IEI and guiding prognosis and treatment. Management strategies focus on treating the underlying condition in SIDs. Preventive measures, including antimicrobial prophylaxis, vaccination, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT) in patients with significant antibody deficiencies, are essential for reducing infections and complications in high-risk patients. Given the growing recognition of adult-onset immunodeficiency, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and adopt a structured diagnostic and management approach to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Cytomegalovirus drives V δ 1 γ δ T cell expansion and clonality in common variable immunodeficiency [^3807fccc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder clinically defined as a diagnosis of exclusion for individuals with low serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G, impaired vaccine responses, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. The cause for CVID is heterogeneous, with approximately 20% of patients having a confirmed genetic diagnosis. The majority of CVID patients also develop immune dysregulation, with complications such as autoimmunity or inflammation often requiring immunosuppression, leaving these individuals vulnerable to secondary infections.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an opportunistic beta-herpes virus that can cause serious disease in the immunocompromised. CMV has a seroprevalence of 40–90% and is typically an asymptomatic infection followed by latency in healthy individuals. In an immunocompromised setting, such as following solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), CMV can become reactivated, persist, and in some cases lead to CMV disease. This is characterized by tissue invasive manifestations, such as enteritis, esophagitis, or pneumonitis.

γδ T cells mount a robust immune response to CMV infection. As an unconventional T cell population, they are not typically restricted by classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for ligand recognition. γδ T cells make up to 10% of circulating T cells and respond rapidly to microbial infection and cancer –. They are predominately composed of two subsets defined by their T cell receptor (TCR)δ chain usage. The Vδ2 + (predominantly paired with Vγ9 chain) subset is the most abundant in circulation and is considered innate-like as they uniformly recognize and rapidly respond to phosphoantigens, such as (E)−4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) produced by a range of bacteria and parasites. The Vδ1 + subset is typically abundant at mucosal sites and is considered more adaptive-like as they can transition from naïve to effector cells in various infectious diseases and have a predominately private TCR repertoire recognizing a range of largely unknown antigens. It is the Vδ1 + γδ T cell subset that reportedly undergo clonotypic expansion in response to CMV reactivation post-transplant. Despite this knowledge, the response of γδ T cells to CMV viremia in the context of primary immunodeficiency remains poorly understood.

### Cytomegalovirus in primary immunodeficiency [^26d3e6d1]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease are well described in the setting of secondary immunodeficiency. Less is known about CMV in the context of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), where inborn errors in one or more arms of the immune system result in variable degrees of CMV susceptibility.

Recent Findings

PID presents unique challenges in the diagnosis and management of CMV disease. The clinical presentation of CMV in PID is often severe, accelerated by underlying immune dysregulation and iatrogenic immunosuppression. Here we describe the clinical significance of CMV infection in PID, the key components of immune defence against CMV and how these are affected in specific PIDs. CMV disease is under-recognized as a complication of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). High rates of CMV end-organ disease, mortality, development of CMV resistance and prolonged antiviral use have been observed in individuals with CVID.

Summary

We recommend that clinicians tailor their approach to the individual based on their underlying immune deficit and maintain a high index of suspicion and low threshold for treatment. More research is required to improve stratification of CMV risk in PID, develop new diagnostic tools and manage end-organ disease in this cohort.

### Chronic norovirus infection and common variable immunodeficiency [^532b0293]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with norovirus is emerging as a significant risk for patients with immunodeficiency - either primary or secondary to therapeutic immunosuppression. Patients with primary immunodeficiency present a range of pathological responses to norovirus infection. Asymptomatic infections occur and differentiating viral carriage or prolonged viral shedding after self-limiting infection from infection causing protracted diarrhoea can be challenging, due to relatively mild pathological changes that may mimic other causes of diarrhoea in such patients (for instance pathogenic bacteria or parasites or graft-versus-host disease). However, a subset of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) experience a severe norovirus-associated enteropathy leading to intestinal villous atrophy and malabsorption. Symptomatic infection of up to 8 years has been demonstrated with clinical and histological recovery on viral clearance. Although oral immunoglobulins and nitazoxanide have been used to treat noroviral infections associated with immunosuppression, ribavirin is the only agent to date that has been linked to viral clearance in the Noroviral enteropathy associated with CVID.

### Common variable immunodeficiency in horses is characterized by B cell depletion in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues [^55cd64ab]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in horse patients is characterized by late-onset B cell lymphopenia or depletion, hypo- or agammaglobulinemia, impaired humoral response to tetanus toxoid vaccination, and recurrent fevers and bacterial infections.

Discussion

This study describes the clinical and immunologic findings of 14 affected horses (average age 10.7 ± 4.4 years) of both genders (six females, eight males) and different breeds (eight Thoroughbreds, four Quarter Horses, one Warmblood, one Pony). Serial immunological testing in peripheral blood revealed persistent, severe B cell lymphopenia (mean 1.3 ± 2.3% positive cells) in all patients. Serum IgG (range < 200 to 800 mg/dL) and IgM (≤ 25.0 mg/dL) deficiency was common to all horses. Serum IgA concentrations declined with time. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed absence of lymphoid follicles and B cells in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. CVID is a cause of recurrent pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis in adult horses and has a grave prognosis for clinical management and survival.

### Common variable immunodeficiency: crossroads between infections, inflammation and autoimmunity [^b6abf35d]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency is a collection of diseases characterized by primary hypogammaglobulinemia. The causes of CVID are extremely heterogeneous and may affect virtually every pathway linked to B cell development and function. Clinical manifestations of CVID mainly include recurrent bacterial infections, but autoimmune, gastrointestinal, lymphoproliferative, granulomatous, and malignant disorders have also been frequently reported as associated conditions. We aimed to focus on the state of the art of the relationship between infections, inflammation and autoimmunity in CVID.

### Common variable immunodeficiency is associated with defective functions of dendritic cells [^8bcacba9]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and defects in T-cell functions that could be primary or secondary. We addressed whether CVID is associated with impairment in the dendritic cell (DC) compartment, as DCs play a central role in the development of adaptive immunity. We demonstrate that DCs from CVID patients display severely perturbed differentiation, maturation, and function, and express markedly reduced levels of the costimulatory molecules that are critical for T-cell stimulation. Patients' DCs induced weak proliferation of allogeneic T cells and produced significantly low amounts of interleukin-12 (IL-12) upon CD40 signaling. Multiple defects in the immune system, including malfunctioning of DCs, appear to be prominent features of CVID patients. Impairment in both the innate and adaptive compartments of the immune system may thus cumulatively account for the inability of CVID patients to eradicate pathogens through conventional immune pathways, thus resulting in an increased risk for recurrent bacterial infections.

Summary

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents a heterogeneous group of rare disorders. There is considerable morbidity and mortality as a result of non‐infectious complications, and this presents clinicians with management challenges. Clinical guidelines to support the management of CVID are urgently required. The UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network and the British Society for Immunology funded a joint project to address this. A modified Delphi Survey was conducted for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the non‐infectious blood, respiratory, gut and liver complications of CVID. A steering group of 10 consultant immunologists and one nurse specialist developed and reviewed the survey statements and agreed the final recommendations. In total, 22 recommendations and three areas for research were developed.

### Common variable immunodeficiency disorders, T-Cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and the risk of chronic COVID-19 [^efaf830a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-Pātari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.

### T-cell abnormalities in common variable immunodeficiency: the hidden defect [^f9b40fae]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and therapeutic consideration

Given the prevalence of T-cell abnormalities among patients with CVID, the recent redefinition of CVID by the ESID now emphasises on the use of T-cell immunophenotyping during the diagnostic workup. However, while there is a sound rationale to exclude patients with recurrent opportunistic infections and late-onset combined immunodeficiency, the arbitrary cut-offs for CD4 lymphopenia and naïve T-cell lymphopenia will exclude a proportion of patients (box 1). Patients with massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia are not particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections and may face diagnostic exclusion. As a significant amount of the T-cell data were generated before the introduction of the revised ESID criteria, it will be of interest to revisit T-cell functions under the new definition in the future.

Box 1

Neurology — evaluation during B-cell–targeted therapy (BCTT) includes monitoring for immunodeficiency and infection, as neurology publications have recommended monitoring immunoglobulins and regular screening for infections during BCTT treatment. Autoimmune neurologic conditions can be a manifestation of common variable immunodeficiency, warranting attention to primary immunodeficiency as a cause of pretreatment hypogammaglobulinemia, and lymphocyte counts monitored for B cell repopulation can also help identify patients with prolonged B-cell depletion or low memory B-cell counts.

Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is a prevalent primary immunodeficiency in adults, marked by low immunoglobulin levels and recurrent infections. This review examines the gastrointestinal complications of CVID, including both infectious and non-infectious manifestations. It highlights therapeutic strategies, from antimicrobials to novel biologics, and the role of immune modulation. The review also explores the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on CVID pathogenesis and emphasizes the need for personalized treatment approaches and routine cancer screening due to the elevated risk of gastrointestinal malignancy in CVID patients.

### Changes in B cell immunophenotype in common variable immunodeficiency: cause or effect-is bronchiectasis indicative of undiagnosed immunodeficiency? [^6c48ecfe]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common severe primary immunodeficiency, but the pathology of this condition is poorly understood. CVID involves a defect in the production of immunoglobulin from B cells, with a subsequent predisposition to infections. Approximately 10–20% of cases are inherited, but even in families with a genetic defect the penetrance is far from complete. A classification system for CVID has been suggested (EUROclass) based on B cell immunophenotyping, but it has not been shown that altered B cell immunophenotype is not a consequence of the complications and treatment of CVID. This study compares the EUROclass B cell immunophenotype of CVID patients (n = 30) with suitable disease controls with bronchiectasis (n = 11), granulomatous disease (Crohn's disease) (n = 9) and neurological patients on immunoglobulin treatment (n = 6). The results of this study correlate with previous literature, that alterations in B cell immunophenotype are associated strongly with CVID. Interestingly, three of the 11 bronchiectasis patients without known immunodeficiency had an altered B cell immunophenotype, suggesting the possibility of undiagnosed immunodeficiency, or that bronchiectasis may cause a secondary alteration in B cell immunophenotype. This study showed a significant difference in B cell immunophenotype between CVID patients compared to disease control groups of granulomatous disease and immunoglobulin treatment. This suggests that granulomatous disease (in Crohn's disease) and immunoglobulin treatment (for chronic neurological conditions) are not causal of an altered B cell immunophenotype in these control populations.

### British society for immunology / United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network consensus statement on managing non-infectious complications of common variable immunodeficiency disorders [^e04e5b92]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents a heterogeneous group of rare disorders, with prevalence ranging from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 50 000 in different populations 1, 2. CVID is characterized by hypogammaglobulinaemia, defective specific antibody production and increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections 2, 3, 4. In addition to the increased risk of recurrent infections, patients with CVID are also at greater risk of autoimmune disorders and cancer 1, 5, 6. Immunoglobulin replacement is the main treatment for the prevention of recurrent infections; however, there is little evidence regarding treatment options for the non‐infective complications of CVID 3, 7, 8.

There is considerable morbidity and mortality as a result of non‐infectious complications, and this presents clinicians with management challenges. Further clinical guidelines to support the management of CVID are urgently required. The UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network and the British Society for Immunology funded a joint project, facilitated by the National Guidelines Centre (NGC), to address this. A comprehensive search of the literature undertaken by the NGC revealed little evidence or clinical guidance on the management of other non‐infectious complications of CVID. The lack of evidence reflects the challenges posed in CVID and other rare diseases, where meaningful randomized controlled studies are extremely difficult to conduct.

Common variable immunodeficiency is the most common symptomatic primary immune deficiency characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and increased risk of autoimmune disease and malignancy. Secondary amyloidosis develops from chronic inflammatory conditions. The co-existence of CVID (especially in patients with bronchiectasis) and secondary amyloidosis has been reported rarely. We describe the first case of pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary amyloidosis in a patient with CVID.

### Large scale causal modeling to identify adults at risk for combined and common variable immunodeficiencies [^4adfcee5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary immunodeficiencies (PI) are heterogeneous genetic disorders characterized by immune system defects. PI patients are susceptible to life-threatening infections, malignancies, organ damage, severe allergies, and autoimmunity. As of 2022, research has linked 485 PI phenotypes to 511 genetic defects, and this number is expected to increase with ongoing PI research –.

PI is more common than originally thought. Recent studies suggest that PI affects 1–2% of the global population, with 70–90% of patients remaining undiagnosed. Early PI diagnosis is important to improve health outcomes but is hampered by the heterogeneous clinical presentation and low awareness among primary care practitioners leading to a lack of timely referrals –. Misdiagnosis, underdiagnosis or diagnosis delay are therefore common in PI. Undiagnosis is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, healthcare visits and costs –. Therefore, robust methods for systematic PI screening are urgently needed –.

Combined immunodeficiencies (CID) are a subgroup of PI defined by both cellular (T-cell) and humoral (B-cell) immunity defects. Common variable immunodeficiencies (CVID) are characterized by humoral immunity and are among the most frequent PI. Severe CID (SCID), characterized by profound T-cell impairment, is life-threatening without early infancy treatment via newborn screening and bone marrow (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CID, excluding SCID, are marked by partial T-cell dysfunction, are associated with variable disease progression and are among the least investigated PI –. Unlike SCID, CID patients typically present with late symptom onset (> 1-year of age) due to residual T-cell function. Beyond SCID, there is no population-based screening method for PI, leading to many CVID/CID diagnoses only in adulthood due to delayed disease onset and lack of awareness hindering childhood diagnosis –. Despite the availability of definitive treatments like HSCT, BMT, and Ig replacement therapy, the lack of population-wide screening beyond SCID necessitates a systematic approach to identify at-risk adults, facilitating early referral and intervention.

In this case report we describe the first account in the literature of a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia and common variable immunodeficiency. A 17-year-old boy with previously diagnosed Kartagener syndrome and stable lung disease developed a deteriorating clinical course that prompted the search for a secondary diagnosis. Although both of these rare conditions can result in similar lung pathology, they require different management strategies, which illustrates the need to consider associated diagnoses in complicated clinical situations.

THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED POPULATION: A HETEROGENEOUS POPULATION AT RISK FOR POOR OUTCOMES WITH COVID-19

Approximately 3% of the adult population in the United States is immunocompromised and less capable of fighting infections due to alterations in the immune system. Immunocompromising conditions can arise through a multitude of causes, and the underlying reason for immunosuppression can result in drastically different responses to infection and vaccination. Specifically, individuals can be considered immunocompromised for reasons related directly to an underlying medical condition or to immunomodulatory therapies that alter the immune system. Medical conditions include primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Primary immunodeficiencies are caused by genetic abnormalities affecting immune system cells such as common variable immunodeficiency disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Secondary immunodeficiencies develop from conditions that are extrinsic to the immune system but subsequently cause an impaired immune response. For example, AIDS is a secondary immunodeficiency caused by HIV infection, occurring in individuals living with advanced or untreated HIV infection or those who do not adequately respond to antiretroviral therapy. Metabolic diseases such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease can also lead to secondary immunodeficiencies. In addition to these medical conditions, moderate to severe immunocompromise can result from immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications given to recipients of organ transplants, individuals with cancer, or those with autoimmune conditions.

### Secondary immunodeficiencies, including HIV infection [^9337ebbf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Extrinsic factors can adversely affect immune responses, producing states of secondary immunodeficiency and consequent increased risk of infections. These immunodeficiencies, which can be encountered in routine clinical practice, arise from a number of conditions, such as treatment with glucocorticoids and immunomodulatory drugs, surgery and trauma, extreme environmental conditions, and chronic infections, such as those caused by HIV. The most common cause of immunodeficiency is malnutrition, affecting many communities around the world with restricted access to food resources. Protein-calorie deficiency and micronutrient deficiencies have been shown to alter immune responses; of note, recent progress has been made in the influence of vitamin D deficiency in causing failure of immune activation. Other categories of disease that might present with secondary immunodeficiency include metabolic diseases and genetic multisystemic syndromes. The immune defects observed in secondary immunodeficiency are usually heterogeneous in their clinical presentation, and their prognosis depends on the severity of the immune defect. Management of the primary condition often results in improvement of the immunodeficiency; however, this is sometimes not possible, and the risk of infections can be reduced with prompt antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis.

### Learning from inborn errors of immunity and secondary immune deficiencies about vaccine immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety [^f6dee956]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibody-deficiency

IEI predominantly affecting antibody production are the most common causes of primary immunodeficiency. These disorders can result from monogenic defects in B cell development, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), or other autosomal recessive forms arising from mutations in genes involved in B cell development such as Igα/β, µ heavy chain, and λ5 deficiencies. The most prevalent polygenic antibody-deficiency IEI is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), defined by IgG levels two standard deviations below the age-appropriate reference range, combined with either low IgA or IgM, poor antibody responses to vaccination, age greater than 4 years, and exclusion of secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia.

Test vaccination is an essential component of diagnosing antibody deficiencies and determining eligibility for treatment with immunoglobulin replacement. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Pneumovax-23 (PPV-23) is the most frequently recommended test vaccine. Measuring pneumococcal-specific antibody levels before and after vaccination allows assessment of the antibody response magnitude. By definition, therefore, patients with antibody deficiency show inadequate responses to at least some vaccines. However, methodological variability in how anti-pneumococcal antibody titres are measured, along with heterogeneity among healthy individuals in their response to PPV-23, significantly complicates the interpretation and utility of test vaccination with unconjugated pneumococcal vaccines. In contrast, protein-containing or conjugated vaccines (e.g. tetanus toxoid) tend to elicit more consistent responses, reflecting differences in immunogenicity between vaccine platforms. Assessing responses to different vaccine types provides a nuanced understanding of immune compromise, helping to identify patients at the highest risk of non-response and infection.

### Rubella vaccine persistence within cutaneous granulomas in common variable immunodeficiency disorder [^d159d234]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorder is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by reduced levels of serum immunoglobulins and impaired antibody response. This condition may be associated with development of noninfectious granulomatous dermatitis of the skin which may be disfiguring and destructive. There are no published guidelines for the treatment of cutaneous granulomas in this patient population. In recent studies, rubella virus-positive cells in granulomas were localized to M2 macrophages which have an important role in wound healing and the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines. We present a case of treatment-refractory, disfiguring common variable immunodeficiency disorder-associated granulomatous dermatitis. Immunofluorescence microscopy of the biopsy specimen confirmed the presence of rubella vaccine capsid proteins in M2 macrophages within the granuloma, a newly recognized phenomenon in this patient population. This knowledge may serve to identify future therapeutic targets or preventative strategies for granulomatous dermatitis in patients with primary immunodeficiency disorder.

### Vaccine-derived poliomyelitis 12 years after infection in Minnesota [^18b4004a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

A 44-year-old woman with long-standing common variable immunodeficiency who was receiving intravenous immune globulin suddenly had paralysis of all four limbs and the respiratory muscles, resulting in death. Type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus was isolated from stool. The viral capsid protein VP1 region had diverged from the vaccine strain at 12.3% of nucleotide positions, and the two attenuating substitutions had reverted to the wild-type sequence. Infection probably occurred 11.9 years earlier (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.9 to 13.2), when her child received the oral poliovirus vaccine. No secondary cases were identified among close contacts or 2038 screened health care workers. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency can be chronically infected with poliovirus, and poliomyelitis can develop despite treatment with intravenous immune globulin.

### Common variable immunodeficiency and autoimmunity – an inconvenient truth [^3b450b15]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Coexisting morbidities in CVID include bronchiectasis, autoimmunity and malignancies. The incidence of autoimmune disease in CVID patients may approach 20% of cases. The most common autoimmune disease found in CVID patients is autoimmune cytopenia, but rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and now primary biliary cirrhosis have also been reported. The coexistence of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity appears paradoxical, since one represents a hypoimmune state and the other a hyperimmune state. However, this paradox may not actually be all that implausible due to the complex nature of immune cells, signaling pathways and their interactions. The cellular alterations in combined variable immunodeficiency include a range of T and B cell abnormalities. Selective immune derangements found in CVID include a downregulation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), accelerated T cell apoptosis, abnormal cytokine production secondary to cytokine gene polymorphisms and increased autoreactive B cell production. The impact of these abnormalities on T and B cell interaction may not only explain the immunodeficiency but also the development of autoimmunity in select groups of patients with CVID. The variability in the clinical manifestations of CVID as a result of this immune interaction suggests that CVID is not one disease but many. This is important because it follows that the treatment of CVID may not always be the same, but may need to be directed specifically towards each individual patient.

Neurology — secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) in multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has been identified with B-cell–targeted therapy (BCTT) and other agents, with disease-modifying therapies associated with a higher prevalence of IgG levels less than 700 mg/dL (24.6% [34 of 129] vs 8.1% [16 of 198]). In another cohort, SHG was mostly associated with prior receipt of BCTT (rituximab [RTX], ocrelizumab, or both) but also occurred with only non-BCTT immunomodulatory agents. In NMOSD, hypogammaglobulinemia has been observed both before and after RTX initiation, and infectious complications have been reported in up to 17% to 45% of patients with SHG. Common variable immunodeficiency has been diagnosed in patients with MS and NMOSD found to have SHG, and non-BCTTs such as natalizumab and cyclophosphamide have been associated with SHG while dimethyl fumarate and fingolimod have been associated with lymphopenia.

Summary of previously published literature — multiple myeloma (MM) states that SHG and infections with encapsulated bacteria are common in MM, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of IgG-RT; for evaluation, immune evaluation is recommended in the setting of severe or recurrent infections; vaccines are recommended per CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance for immunocompromised patients; for management, IgG-RT may provide benefit for those with decreased IgG and attenuated antibody responses, but decisions should reflect concurrent treatments because previous studies have shown variable results between treatments; randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether and when IgG-RT may provide benefit.

### Large scale causal modeling to identify adults at risk for combined and common variable immunodeficiencies [^83a4ddd7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Combined immunodeficiencies (CID) and common variable immunodeficiencies (CVID), prevalent yet substantially underdiagnosed primary immunodeficiencies, necessitate improved early detection. Leveraging large-scale electronic health records (EHR) from four nationwide US cohorts, we developed a novel causal Bayesian Network (BN) model to identify antecedent clinical phenotypes associated with CID/CVID. Consensus directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) demonstrated robust predictive performance within each cohort (ROC AUC: 0.61–0.77) and generalizability across unseen cohorts (ROC AUC: 0.56–0.72) in identifying CID/CVID, despite varying inclusion criteria across cohorts. The consensus DAGs reveal causal relationships between comorbidities preceding CID/CVID diagnosis, including autoimmune and blood disorders, lymphomas, organ damage or inflammation, respiratory conditions, genetic anomalies, recurrent infections, and allergies. Further evaluation through causal inference and by expert clinical immunologists substantiates the clinical relevance of the identified phenotypic trajectories. These findings hold promise for translation into improved clinical practice, potentially leading to earlier identification and intervention of adults at risk for CID/CVID.

### The many faces of common variable immunodeficiency [^286be383]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a rare immune deficiency characterized by low levels of serum IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, with a loss of Ab production. The diagnosis is most commonly made in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years, but both children and much older adults can be found to have this immune defect. The range of clinical manifestations is broad, including acute and chronic infections, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and an increased incidence of cancer and lymphoma. For all of these reasons, the disease phenotype is both heterogeneous and complex. In the past few years, data from large patient registries have revealed that both selected laboratory markers and clinical phenotyping may aid in separating groups of subjects into biologically relevant categories. CVID consists of 2 phenotypes, 1 in which infections are the characteristic and another in which impressive inflammatory and/or hematologic complications also develop, including lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, autoimmune cytopenias, enteropathy, and/or and granulomatous disease. These phenotypes appear to be stable, are related to immunologic and inflammatory markers, and are predictive of outcomes. This review outlines current understanding about this syndrome based on studies of large cohorts, highlighting the evaluation and treatment of complications and, in particular, the autoimmune and inflammatory conditions that affect these patients.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^6aff3831]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) definitions and severity criteria propose that adult hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) be defined as a serum IgG level below 700 mg/dL with stratification into 400 to 699 mg/dL, 200 to 399 mg/dL, and 0 to 199 mg/dL; age-appropriate pediatric reference ranges should be considered. To characterize persistence, SHG duration can be categorized as lasting 3 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and more than 24 months. Severe infection is proposed as requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, or antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal therapy for treatment, and recurrent infection is proposed per Jeffrey Modell Foundation criteria as 4 or more new ear infections, 2 or more serious sinus infections, 2 or more pneumonias, and 2 or more deep-seated infections including septicemia.

### Common variable immunodeficiency and idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia: two different conditions within the same disease spectrum [^eb97e74c]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia who do not fulfill all the classical diagnostic criteria for common variable immunodeficiency (reduction of two immunoglobulin isotypes and a reduced response to vaccination) constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma, because information concerning the clinical and immunological characteristics of these patients with idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia is not available. In 44 common variable immunodeficiency and 21 idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia patients we determined the clinical phenotypes and performed flow cytometric immunophenotyping to assess the pathophysiological B-cell patterns and memory B-cell subset counts. Age-matched B-cell subset reference values of 130 healthy donors were generated. Severe pneumonia and bronchiectasis occurred at similar frequencies in idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency. Although IgG levels were only moderately reduced compared to common variable immunodeficiency, 12 of 21 idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia patients required immunoglobulin replacement. Non-infectious disease-related clinical phenotypes (autoimmune cytopenia, polyclonal lymphocytic proliferation and persistent unexplained enteropathy) were exclusively observed in common variable immunodeficiency and were associated with early peripheral B-cell maturation defects or B-cell survival defects. T-cell dependent memory B-cell formation was more severely affected in common variable immunodeficiency. Furthermore, 14 of 21 idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia patients showed normal peripheral B-cell subset counts, suggestive for a plasma cell defect. In conclusion, idiopathic primary hypogammaglobulinemia patients who do not fulfill all diagnostic criteria of common variable immunodeficiency have moderately decreased immunoglobulin levels and often a normal peripheral B-cell subset distribution, but still suffer from serious infectious complications.

### Calculated globulin (CG) as a screening test for antibody deficiency [^3be894c8]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antibody deficiency may be either primary or secondary, and the most common severe primary antibody deficiency (PAD) is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which accounts for the majority (57%) of all symptomatic primary immunodeficiency (PID) cases on the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry. Secondary antibody deficiency occurs even more frequently than PAD.

CVID is an important diagnosis not only because of its prevalence (one in 25 000–50 000), but also because of the frequent requirement for medical attention and intervention. The morbidity and need for health resources is exacerbated by a diagnostic delay of, on average, between 6 and 7 years before appropriate treatment is started. In contrast to many other PID diseases, patients with CVID may be diagnosed at almost any age, which has implications for screening approaches.

The misconception that PID always presents in infancy in combination with the protean manifestations of CVID, the number of specialities to which patients may present and the wide range of non-infectious complications all contribute to the delay in recognition of the underlying diagnosis. This may result in recurrent infections leading to irreversible end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis.

Clinical strategies to reduce diagnostic delay include improved education and awareness of antibody deficiency in both primary and secondary care, patient-centred screening, the use of the '10 warning signs' of PID and using computer sorting of diagnostic codes. A study into the clinical features which identify children with immunodeficiency found that of the 10 warning signs the strongest predictors were family history, intravenous antibiotics for sepsis (neutrophil defects) and failure to thrive (T cell defects), while for B cell defects the only predictor was family history of immune deficiency.

### T-cell abnormalities in common variable immunodeficiency: the hidden defect [^e4ef4c88]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous and enigmatic primary immunodeficiency disorder marked by the failure of humoral immunity and immune dysregulation. The discoveries of T-cell-related molecular defects in hyper IgM syndrome and Inducible T-cell costimulatory (ICOS) deficiency highlighted the negative consequences to humoral immunity of the absence of T-cell support, and growing experimental data are now suggesting that the T-cell compartment is also disrupted in patients with CVID.

CD4 T-cell lymphopenia was first noted among patients with CVIDand can dramatically reverse the normal CD4:8 ratio when combined with expansion of senescent CD8 T cells, a feature not usually found in other antibody deficiencies. Despite the array of observed in vitro T-cell abnormalities, the clinical hallmarks of a T-cell immunodeficiency such as recurrent fungal and viral opportunistic infections are lacking in the majority of patients.

The heterogeneity of CVID and the progressive change in its definition over the years make comparing experimental data between studies difficult, but much can still be learnt. This article will examine existing experimental data in the literature regarding the role of T-cell defects in CVID and discuss how infection risk may increase progressively with decreasing thymic output, while the memory compartment shows evidence of abnormal activation. Additionally, we will assess these findings in the context of the revised 2014 European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) diagnostic criteria and discuss their therapeutic implications.

### An exploratory approach of clinically useful biomarkers of cvid by logistic regression [^46262779]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents the most frequently encountered primary antibody deficiency, affecting 1:25,000 individuals. The disorder is characterized by its broad clinical heterogeneity and largely idiopathic genetic underpinnings, factors that contribute to the complexity and potential delay in its diagnosis.

In 1999, the European Society of Immunodeficiencies (ESID) and the Pan-American Group of Immunodeficiency (PAGID) established the original diagnostic criteria for CVID focused on marked hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired vaccine response. These criteria have subsequently undergone revisions to enhance diagnostic precision. In 2008, Chapel et al. emphasized the necessity of categorizing clinical manifestations into two major phenotypes: one manifesting solely infections; and the other characterized by dysregulatory complications, including autoimmune disease, malabsorption and/or lymphoproliferation. These latter phenotypes are associated with a reduced proportion of switched-memory B cells (smB), which was proposed as a predictive marker. Subsequent research has led to the proposition of clinical severity scores aiming to quantify disease impact. More recently, VISUAL score has emerged as a promising prognostic tool at CVID diagnosis leveraging five independent risk predictors, - the smB phenotype, serum IgA and IgM, CD4 + T cells counts, and immunization antibody responses.

Despite advancements in genetic and functional diagnostic studies, timely identification of CVID remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable efforts on developing innovative biomarkers to bridge this diagnostic gap. Importantly, the aggregated levels of κ and λ light chains alongside the soluble B-cell maturation antigen (sBCMA), have emerged as potential markers. Both exhibit marked reductions in CVID compared to those with other primary (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies (SID), suggesting their utility in distinguishing CVID from other immunological disorders.

In this study, we explored the diagnostic performance of these recent biomarkers against established gold-standard tests through comprehensive multivariate logistic and regression analyses. Our aim is to enhance the early detection of CVID among other immunodeficiencies, thereby facilitating more tailored and effective management strategies for affected individuals.

### COVID-19 progression and convalescence in common variable immunodeficiency patients show dysregulated adaptive immune responses and persistent type I interferon and inflammasome activation [^a19d936d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent primary immunodeficiency, marked by hypogammaglobulinemia, poor antibody responses, and increased infection susceptibility. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of prolonged viral infections on the immune responses of CVID patients. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq and spectral flow cytometry of peripheral blood samples before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection showing that COVID-19 CVID patients display a persistent type I interferon signature at convalescence across immune compartments. Alterations in adaptive immunity include sustained activation of naïve B cells, increased CD21 low B cells, impaired Th1 polarization, CD4 + T central memory exhaustion, and increased CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity. NK cell differentiation is defective, although cytotoxicity remains intact. Monocytes show persistent activation of inflammasome-related genes. These findings suggest the involvement of intact humoral immunity in regulating these processes and might indicate the need for early intervention to manage viral infections in CVID patients.

### Review: diagnosing common variable immunodeficiency disorder in the era of genome sequencing [^979b5738]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are an enigmatic group of often heritable conditions, which may manifest for the first time in early childhood or as late as the eighth decade of life. In the last 5 years, next generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionised identification of genetic disorders. However, despite the best efforts of researchers around the globe, CVID conditions have been slow to yield their molecular secrets. We have previously described the many clinical advantages of identifying the genetic basis of primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs). In a minority of CVID patients, monogenic defects have now been identified. If a causative mutation is identified, these conditions are reclassified as CVID-like disorders. Here we discuss recent advances in the genetics of CVID and discuss how NGS can be optimally deployed to identify the causal mutations responsible for the protean clinical manifestations of these conditions. Diagnostic criteria such as the Ameratunga et al. criteria will continue to play an important role in patient management as well as case selection and sequencing strategy design until the genetic conundrum of CVID is solved.

### The rapidly expanding genetic spectrum of common variable immunodeficiency-like disorders [^6dd285b0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The understanding of common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) is in evolution. CVID was previously a diagnosis of exclusion. New diagnostic criteria have allowed the disorder to be identified with greater precision. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it has become apparent that an increasing number of patients with a CVID phenotype have a causative genetic variant. If a pathogenic variant is identified, these patients are removed from the overarching diagnosis of CVID and are deemed to have a CVID-like disorder. In populations where consanguinity is more prevalent, the majority of patients with severe primary hypogammaglobulinemia will have an underlying inborn error of immunity, usually an early-onset autosomal recessive disorder. In nonconsanguineous societies, pathogenic variants are identified in approximately 20% to 30% of patients. These are often autosomal dominant mutations with variable penetrance and expressivity. To add to the complexity of CVID and CVID-like disorders, some genetic variants such as those in TNFSF13B (transmembrane activator calcium modulator cyclophilin ligand interactor) predispose to, or enhance, disease severity. These variants are not causative but can have epistatic (synergistic) interactions with more deleterious mutations to worsen disease severity. This review is a description of the current understanding of genes associated with CVID and CVID-like disorders. This information will assist clinicians in interpreting NGS reports when investigating the genetic basis of disease in patients with a CVID phenotype.

### When to initiate immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT) in antibody deficiency: a practical approach [^20c3b103]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary antibody deficiencies (PAD) constitute the majority of all primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) and immunoglobulin replacement forms the mainstay of therapy for many patients in this category. Secondary antibody deficiencies (SAD) represent a larger and expanding number of patients resulting from the use of a wide range of immunosuppressive therapies, in particular those targeting B cells, and may also result from renal or gastrointestinal immunoglobulin losses. While there are clear similarities between primary and secondary antibody deficiencies, there are also significant differences. This review describes a practical approach to the clinical, laboratory and radiological assessment of patients with antibody deficiency, focusing on the factors that determine whether or not immunoglobulin replacement should be used. The decision to treat is more straightforward when defined diagnostic criteria for some of the major PADs, such as common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) or X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA), are fulfilled or, indeed, when there is a very low level of immunoglobulin production in association with an increased frequency of severe or recurrent infections in SAD. However, the presentation of many patients is less clear-cut and represents a considerable challenge in terms of the decision whether or not to treat and the best way in which to assess the outcome of therapy. This decision is important, not least to improve individual quality of life and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with recurrent infections but also to avoid inappropriate exposure to blood products and to ensure that immunoglobulin, a costly and limited resource, is used to maximal benefit.

### Utility of serum cytokine testing to differentiate complicated common variable immunodeficiency in resource limited settings [^1c5a0442]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

The term inborn error of immunity (IEI) describes a heterogenous classification of primary immunodeficiency disorders due to known or suspected underlying genetic defects of immune system function. Patients with IEI typically present with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including severe or atypical infections, autoimmune and inflammatory (AI) disease (including autoantibody or end-organ lympho-infiltrative disorders), malignancy, and/or atopy. Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is the most common, symptomatic IEI worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 25,000 people in the United States. Onset of symptoms can range from early childhood to late adulthood, with a peak diagnosis age of 30–40 years.

Consensus guidelines recommend diagnosing CVID using a combination of immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM), antibody responses (including at time points pre- and postimmunization), and flow cytometry, with incomplete diagnostic overlap comparing International Consensus Document (ICON) to European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) criteria. B-cell flow cytometry, specifically quantitation of class-switched memory B cells in blood, is a key component of the ESID criteria.T-cell flow cytometry, specifically quantitation of total CD4 + T cells and naive CD45RA + CD4 + T cells in blood, is further required to exclude a diagnosis of combined immune deficiency in the ESID criteria.

### Secondary antibody deficiency in glucocorticoid therapy clearly differs from primary antibody deficiency [^4140ff51]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to glucocorticoid therapy and their value in the differential diagnosis to primary forms of antibody deficiency.

Methods

We investigated prevalence and character of hypogammaglobulinemia in a cohort of 36 patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) on glucocorticoid therapy in comparison to a gender- and age-matched cohort of hospital controls. We therefore determined serum immunoglobulin levels as well as B- and T cell-subsets in the peripheral blood of all participants. In addition, prior serum immunoglobulin levels and clinical data of the GCA and PMR patients were extracted from the electronic patient data-base.

Results

21/36 GCA/PMR patients on glucocorticoid treatment developed antibody deficiency. In 19 patients this included IgG and in 13 patients IgG was the only affected isotype. The reduction of IgG was persistent in nearly 50% of these patients during the observed period. GCA/PMR patients had reduced circulating naive and transitional B cells (p = 0.0043 and p = 0.0002 respectively) while IgM, IgG and IgA memory B cells were preserved. Amongst T-cell subsets, we found a reduction of CD4 memory T cells (p < 0.0001), CD4 regulatory T cells (p = 0.0002) and few CD8 memory T-cell subtypes.

Conclusion

Persistent humoral immunodeficiency occurs in about a quarter of GCA/PMR patients under glucocorticoid therapy. Because most patients have isolated IgG deficiency, preserved IgA production and class-switched memory B cells, by these markers this form of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia can be clearly distinguished from common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — prioritized research needs include determining the optimal laboratory evaluations for screening and monitoring, determining reliable measures for humoral immune recovery versus continued humoral immunodeficiency/immunosuppression, identifying mechanisms of persistent B-cell functional defects following immunosuppression, defining clinically significant SHG for which IgG-RT should be started, comparing IVIG and SCIG including whether SCIG is equivalent or preferable in patients with venous thromboembolism, renal disease, or protein loss as in patients with primary immunodeficiency (PI), determining goal IgG trough levels required to maximize clinical benefit, and understanding timing of immune recovery after immunosuppressive or ablative treatment in patients who have and have not started IgG-RT.

### Rituximab and immune deficiency: case series and review of the literature [^06f56406]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

As the indications and use of rituximab continue to expand, the reports of long-term effects of anti-CD20 — mediated B-cell depletion on the immune system accumulate.

Objective

We report a group of patients with immunodeficiency who were treated with rituximab and present their immunologic data.

Methods

A retrospective chart review identified patients with immunodeficiency who received rituximab for treatment of their primary disease and required immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT). Pre-IGRT immunoglobulins, specific antibodies, B-cells, and B-cell phenotype were recorded and analyzed.

Results

We identified 11 patients with immunodeficiency who received rituximab and required IGRT. Two of these patients were diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency before rituximab treatment. Nine other patients had hypogammaglobulinemia and did not achieve an adequate response to polysaccharide vaccine. There was a significant delay in B-cell recovery. B-cell phenotypes identified predominantly naive B cells in the blood of these patients with significant decrease in switched and memory B cells.

Conclusion

There are patients with persistent B-cell dysfunction long after rituximab treatment was discontinued. Some of these patients required IGRT. These patients should be distinguished from patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. Routine baseline B-cell numbers and serum immunoglobulin levels before starting immunomodulatory therapy are required to help distinguish primary immunodeficiency diseases from secondary rituximab-induced, transient, and, at times, prolonged immune suppression. Periodic monitoring is prudent to identify immune recovery. Post-rituximab B-cell phenotyping may help identify the patients who will develop persistent immune dysfunction caused by an unidentified underlying disease or the prolonged effect of rituximab treatment.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^a5180f81]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — definition and initial management: Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) is characterized by reduced immunoglobulin levels due to a medication or a disease process, leading to decreased antibody production or increased antibody loss, and is distinct from primary hypogammaglobulinemia due to inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiencies, which comprise more than 400 inherited disorders. Of note, the distinction between primary HG and SHG can be challenging to make, and we recommend thorough consideration of both primary and secondary causes when evaluating HG. When iatrogenic causes cannot be removed or underlying conditions cannot be reversed, therapeutic options are not clearly delineated but include heightened monitoring for clinical infections, supportive antimicrobials, and in some cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

### Hepatitis in common variable immunodeficiency [^7e4cf7a7]. Human Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency is an important form of primary immunodeficiency disease. The most recognized histologic manifestation of common variable immunodeficiency is a paucity of plasma cells in gut biopsies. However, chronic inflammation can affect other organs including the liver. This study was designed to characterize the histologic findings in liver biopsies of individuals with common variable immunodeficiency. Thirteen liver biopsies from 10 patients were identified. The most common indication for biopsy was elevated liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and/or splenomegaly. The biopsies typically showed mild portal and mild-to-moderate lobular chronic inflammation with minimal or absent interface activity. Plasma cells were absent in all cases. The biopsy specimens showed no fibrosis (n = 5) or mild portal fibrosis (n = 5). In 2 patients with follow-up biopsies, no fibrosis progression was identified. Four individuals showed small numbers of scattered portal and/or lobular granulomas, 3 of whom had diagnoses of coexistent sarcoidosis. Overall, the inflammatory changes in the biopsies were reminiscent of those seen in individuals with chronic inflammation of the gut, which can lead to translocation of intestinal luminal antigens to the liver and a mild hepatitis. Subsequent review of concurrent intestinal biopsies available in 7 individuals showed intestinal inflammation in 5 of 7 cases. In conclusion, liver biopsies in individuals with common variable immunodeficiency show mild portal and lobular inflammation with no or mild portal fibrosis. The etiology of the common variable immunodeficiency hepatitis remains unclear but, in some cases, may be secondary to mucosal inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^1138dc07]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — common etiologies and settings: A large proportion of SHG is due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive treatments, most notably B-cell–targeted therapy (BCTT), in autoimmune hematologic and neurologic conditions as well as hematologic/oncologic conditions, and corticosteroids are another common cause of iatrogenic SHG, although it does not appear to be associated with significant increases in frequency or severity of infections. Studies have shown that antibody defects are also observed in autoimmune and hematologic/oncologic conditions before initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, and there is an increasingly recognized category of IEI/PI called primary immune regulatory disorders that presents primarily with autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation rather than the classic PI presentation of severe, recurrent, and/or unusual infections. SHG observed in pulmonary conditions appears largely driven by immunosuppression rather than immune aberrations due to the underlying disease, and SHG observed after solid organ transplant for lung, heart, and kidney transplant also appears largely iatrogenic in nature due to immunosuppression with additional contribution of protein losses particularly for kidney transplant patients with nephrotic syndrome. Protein loss syndromes that can cause SHG, including nephrotic syndrome, are covered in the Protein-Losing Conditions section; primary causes including monogenic causes of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) such as FOXP3, IL10RA, and XIAP, and loss-of-function mutations in CD55 and DGAT1 also exist.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — monitoring intervals and CAR-T schedules are specified as follows: For populations without existing guidance, the authors state, "we recommend periodic laboratory and clinical monitoring every 6 to 12 months and whenever there are significant or recurrent infections to identify patients with persistent immune dysfunction who may benefit from IgG-RT." Before CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, "baseline immunoglobulin levels, specific antibody titers, and lymphocyte subsets be obtained," with follow-up monitoring "either 3 months after initiation of CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy or monthly until the sixth month after infusion and then twice a year after that." In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, experts "have recommended monitoring immunoglobulins and specific antibody responses every 6 months or as needed on the basis of patient's infection history."

### Long term recovery of IgG and IgM production during HIV infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [^e4a75a55]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Aims

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common serious primary immunodeficiency. This paper describes the immunological consequences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a patient with familial CVID subsequently treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

Methods

Serial measurements over 11 years of serum immunoglobulins, specific antibodies to tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal polysaccharides, lymphocyte phenotypes, and HIV viral load were made.

Results

The patient recovered total serum IgG and IgM, but not IgA production, with adequate concentrations of specific antibodies, allowing withdrawal of intravenous immunoglobulin without an increase in infections. T cell numbers gradually declined and the patient developed a high grade B cell lymphoma. After successful chemotherapy, HAART was commenced, viral load fell from 472 000 to < 50 copies/ml, and CD4+ T cell numbers increased from 13 to 661 x 10(6)/litre. Antibody production was maintained after suppression of viral load.

Conclusions

This is the first definitive report of reversal of IgG and IgM deficiency in familial CVID after HIV infection. Failure to normalise IgA supports the concept of separate predisposing genetic factors for selective IgA deficiency, which when combined with others lead to CVID. Furthermore, a persistently high viraemia is not required to maintain the recovery of immunoglobulin values, suggesting this depends either on a transitory effect of a high viral load, or a persistence of low amounts of virus.

### Utility of serum cytokine testing to differentiate complicated common variable immunodeficiency in resource limited settings [^ef5b7a95]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the establishment of international consensus guidelines for CVID diagnosis, a median diagnostic delay of 5–10 years persists. Diagnostic delay adversely impacts health care systems, with earlier CVID diagnosis estimated to save $6,500 per patient with CVID annually in the United States. More importantly, diagnostic delay adversely impacts patients with CVID, with those who experience diagnostic delay having higher rates of serious adverse clinical events. This includes higher rates of lower respiratory tract infections, granulomatous lesions, cytopenias, malignancies, and even death. Reducing diagnostic delay in care of patients with CVID is most critical in the approximate one- to two-thirds of patients who develop AI complications, also termed complicated CVID (CVIDc). Patients with CVIDc have an 11-fold higher risk of death as compared to patients with CVID who suffer from infections only without associated AI complications.CVIDc can be immunophenotypically distinguished from CVID with infections only using B-cell and T-cell blood flow cytometry. Specifically, patients with CVIDc have been identified to have lower percentages of class-switched memory B cells and higher percentages of CD21 lo B cells in blood., Additionally, patients with CVIDc have lower percentages and absolute counts of naive CD45RA + CD4 + T cells in blood., Whether there are other biomarkers that may have comparable utility in the risk stratification of patients with CVID is not currently known.

Introduction

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with different pathophysiologic causes and genetic etiologies which all lead to hypogammaglobulinemia and inadequate responses to vaccination. As many as 85% of patients with CVID will develop infectious pulmonary complications, specifically recurrent and/or severe lower respiratory bacterial infections. The infectious complications should be excluded before a noninfectious CVID-associated pulmonary diagnosis is rendered. Common non-infection CVID complications include autoimmune cytopenias, enteropathies such as nonceliac sprue, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphocytic colitis, ILD, lymphadenopathy and a predisposition to lymphoma. Noninfectious pulmonary manifestations can be divided into primary or secondary malignancies, airway-limited entities, interstitial lung disease (ILD), and benign lymphoproliferative disorders.

Patients with CVID can develop ILD in various pathologic patterns, with GLILD being the most commonly described in the literature. GLILD is a significant cause of morbidity and premature mortality among patients with CVID. Although several large registries of patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) have been established globally, because of methodological limitations, it is not possible to describe the epidemiology of GLILD precisely. Nevertheless, rough estimates from several cohorts suggest GLILD occurs in 8–20% of patients with CVID.

In 2017, the British Lung Foundation and United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network published a consensus statement that defined GLILD as "a distinct clinico-radio-pathologic interstitial lung disease occurring in patients with CVID, associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate and/or granuloma of the lung, and in whom other conditions have been considered and where possible excluded."

Evaluating suspected GLILD cases requires a probabilistic diagnostic approach that considers the impact of the heterogeneous disease course and patient-centered decision-making. This review focuses on the current approach to diagnosis and management of GLILD and is not intended to provide an exhaustive approach to screening or managing inborn errors of immunity (IEI). The target audience primarily includes pulmonologists, immunologists, and other clinicians who diagnose and manage suspected or confirmed GLILD cases.

### Organising pneumonia in common variable immunodeficiency [^0a03ee58]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common of the primary immunodeficiency disorders. Pulmonary manifestations are characterised by recurrent rhinosinusitis, respiratory tract infections and bronchiectasis. Less commonly the lung may be affected by lymphoid disorders and sarcoid-like granulomas. Organising pneumonia (OP) is a rare pulmonary manifestation. We report the case of a 32-year-old woman with CVID who presented with fever, dyspnoea and persistent lung infiltrates despite antibiotic therapy. CT of the chest showed bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates. Pulmonary function tests revealed moderate restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity. Initial bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies did not yield a diagnosis but surgical lung biopsies identified OP. Significant clinical, radiographic and physiological improvement was achieved after institution of corticosteroid therapy.

### Exclusion of patients with a severe T-Cell defect improves the definition of common variable immunodeficiency [^b5263362]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In 2014, the European Society for Immune Deficiencies (ESID) revised the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) diagnosis criteria by incorporating new clinical and biological markers. The new definition appeared more restrictive but had not yet been evaluated in a large cohort of patients.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of this new definition in a large cohort of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia.

Methods

Evaluation of 3 different CVID definitions (ESID/Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency [PAGID] 1999, ESID 2014, DEFI 2015) in 521 patients included in the French DEFI study with a diagnosis of primary hypogammaglobulinemia.

Results

Using the ESID/PAGID 1999 definition, 351 patients were classified as CVID. The new ESID 2014 definition excluded 62 (18%) patients. Most of them (n = 56; 90%) had a less severe disease, whereas 6 (10%) presented with a severe disease with major T-cell defect. We propose different criteria (occurrence of opportunistic infection or very low naive CD4+ T-cell count) to define this population with severe T-cell defect. Sixty-two patients fulfilled these criteria, represented 20% of the initial CVID population but accounted for 77% of the deaths, with a 5-year overall survival of 67.6% (95% confidence interval, 51.0–79.6), and were considered as late onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID).

Conclusions

The new ESID definition for CVID still fails to exclude a large number of patients with severe T-cell defect. We propose a new definition (DEFI 2015) that excluded more patients with a T-cell defect and consider these patients as LOCID. This population has a poor outcome and should be considered as a distinct group requiring specific care.

### Differentiation of common variable immunodeficiency from IgG deficiency [^7d3ab4aa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgG deficiency are 2 of the more prevalent primary humoral immune defects. The former is defined by consensus with criteria for quantitative and qualitative antibody defects, whereas the latter is used to describe patients with reduced IgG, who commonly have recurrent sinopulmonary infections but do not fulfill CVID criteria. However, these patients are often given this diagnosis.

Objective

To compare immunologic findings and clinical manifestations of 2 large cohorts of patients with CVID or IgG deficiency to better delineate differences between these syndromes.

Methods

We extracted clinical and laboratory data from electronic medical records of patients at our institution who had received International Classification of Disease codes for either CVID, or IgG deficiency. We gathered immunoglobulin levels, lymphocyte subpopulation counts, and serological vaccine responses. In some patients, we performed flow cytometry to determine percentages of memory and switched-memory B cells. We compiled and statistically compared clinical data related to infectious manifestations, bronchiectasis, autoimmune diseases, infiltrative inflammatory processes, and lymphoid malignancies.

Results

In contrast to IgG-deficient patients, we found that patients with CVID had lower IgG levels, greater unresponsiveness to most vaccines, lower percentages of memory and isotype switched-memory B cells, and lower CD4 T-cell counts. Clinically, patients with CVID presented similar rates of sinusitis and pneumonias, but a significantly higher prevalence of bronchiectasis and especially noninfectious complications.

Conclusions

CVID and IgG deficiency do not share the same disease spectrum, the former being associated with immunodysregulative manifestations and markers of a more severe immune defect. These data may allow clinicians to distinguish these conditions and the management differences that these patients pose.

### T-cell abnormalities in common variable immunodeficiency: the hidden defect [^098364dd]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Orthogonal evidence from multiple studies indicates an arrest in thymic output coupled with exhaustion in the memory T-cell compartment in patients with CVID and inflammatory complications or Freiburg Group 1a. It is anticipated that the revised ESID diagnostic criteria will result in an increased focus on T-cell abnormalities in CVID and it will be of interest to re-examine many of the observed abnormalities in well-characterised cohorts under the revised criteria. Importantly, this review calls for additional care in the use of immunosuppressants in CVID, with close monitoring of outcomes, perhaps through an international database.

Take home messages

Reduction in thymic output is a common feature of CVID.
T cells are driven towards exhaustion either via an antigen-dependent or an antigen-independent manner.
Additional care in the use of immunosuppressants is needed to preserve patients' existing immunity.

### COVID-19 progression and convalescence in common variable immunodeficiency patients show dysregulated adaptive immune responses and persistent type I interferon and inflammasome activation [^fd8cff93]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this context, patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) have demonstrated the role of type I interferon (IFN) in the control of the infection. The prominent role of humoral memory in the antiviral protection, was underlined by the longer persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most common symptomatic PAD, is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and poorly protective vaccine titers. Most CVID patients have recurrent severe infections, and a substantial proportion develop autoimmune and inflammatory features. Besides, the classic defining antibody deficiency and B cell abnormalities, alterations in other immune compartments, including T cells and myeloid cells, have been described in CVID patients –.

The course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with CVID in comparison with the general population has been a matter of debate. Most studies have reported a benign course of this particular viral infection in most CVID patients. whereas one study found higher mortality rates among IEI patients including CVID patients. In addition, it has been described that immunodeficient individuals, especially those with antibody deficiencies, show a persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, as well as increased risks of both first infection and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 among CVID individuals. This situation provides the unique opportunity to investigate the effect of a persisting viral infection on the human immune system in the absence of a specific humoral response on a single-cell level.

Here, we performed a longitudinal study of peripheral blood samples from nine CVID patients collected prior, during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using single-cell RNA-seq and spectral flow cytometry, we compared alterations of the immune system during viral infection and recovery of these patients in comparison with non-CVID cohorts –. Our analysis shows an increased type I interferon signature in almost all compartments, altered homeostasis of the entire adaptive immune system, and persistent inflammasome activation in monocytes.

### British society for immunology / United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network consensus statement on managing non-infectious complications of common variable immunodeficiency disorders [^86f8513f]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The published evidence available to date did not support the development of a formal evidence‐based guideline in this area, so a Delphi consensus process (anonymous, multi‐round, consensus building technique) was adopted to address the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the non‐infectious blood, respiratory, gut and liver complications of CVID. The Delphi method was developed in the 1950s, and has been used successfully for generating, analysing and synthesizing an expert view to reach a group consensus position. The Delphi process relies upon a group of experts (in this case, all consultant immunologists and specialist immunology nurses in the United Kingdom were invited to participate) responding to and providing critical feedback on two or more consecutive surveys (in this case, a set of statements regarding the management of non‐infectious complications of CVID). The initial statements were developed by a steering group of 10 consultant immunologists and a nurse specialist. Following the Delphi principles, the initial recommendations that had not met consensus after the first round of the survey were modified according to the expert feedback and recirculated to the expert group. The recommendations that achieved consensus group are described in the Results section of this paper. The group were aware of the consensus statement on granulomatous–lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) 9 and therefore did not repeat this work.

### Childhood autoimmune cytopenia secondary to unsuspected common variable immunodeficiency [^15929b72]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia are typically idiopathic processes without underlying systemic illness. Four children with autoimmune cytopenia had low immunoglobulin levels that led to the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency. Routine screening of immunoglobulins is suggested for children with chronic or recurrent immune thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

### Clonal lymphoproliferations in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency [^c4a64a30]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders of humoral immunity, characterized by marked deficiencies in serum immunoglobulins. Immune dysregulation causes susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections, as well as autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. Although the lymphoid cells comprising the atypical proliferations are often clonally related, their malignant potential and clinical significance differ from similar lesions in individuals with immunocompetence. Herein, we describe a Caucasian woman with CVID who over 7 years developed multiple clonal lymphoproliferative lesions, comprising a spectrum of morphologic characteristics. Many of the lesions harbored distinct clonal populations. Though a majority responded to conservative intervention, 1 lesion persisted, met the diagnostic criteria for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and responded well to conventional chemotherapeutic treatment. The patient subsequently developed additional lymphoproliferations, but the lesions were clonally distinct and responded to conservative therapy. The clinical course of this patient emphasizes the variable nature of lymphoproliferative lesions arising in patients with CVID and underscores an individualized approach to pathologic interpretation and diagnostic intervention.

### Health care utilisation in a cohort of patients with primary and secondary antibody deficiency in the United Kingdom [^4c4e159b]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the preceding five years, 48.6% of the Birmingham cohort were reviewed by respiratory medicine, 38.0% by haematology, 27.7% by ear, nose and throat surgery and 21.2% by gastroenterology (Table 5). Individuals with secondary immunodeficiency were more likely to be reviewed in secondary care by haematology (66.1% vs. 19.8%) and rheumatology (22.6% vs. 11.3%), reflecting the underlying aetiology of diseases associated with secondary immunodeficiency.

Table 5
Specialist clinics attended by adult patients with antibody deficiency between July 2018 and July 2023 (n = 292)

To understand the impact and financial cost to individuals with antibody deficiency of attending hospital appointments, we analysed postcode data from 525 individuals enrolled in the national COV-AD study. The enrolment to this cohort is summarised in Fig. 1 and its characterised described in Table 6. The most common diagnoses amongst participants in the study were common variable immunodeficiency (n = 233/525, 44.4%) and secondary immunodeficiency (n = 139/525, 26.5%). 93.3% (n = 490/525) of all participants were receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy: 48.8% intravenous therapy, which requires regular visits to their immunology centre every three to four weeks; 44.5% of participants were receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement therapy which is self-administered at home.

### Cytomegalovirus drives V δ 1 γ δ T cell expansion and clonality in common variable immunodeficiency [^a2b579ca]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The function and phenotype of γδ T cells in the context of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) has not been explored. CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by impaired antibody responses resulting in increased susceptibility to infections. γδ T cells are a subset of unconventional T cells that play crucial roles in host defence against infections. In this study, we aim to determine the roles and functions of γδ T cells in CVID. We observe a higher frequency of Vδ1 + γδ T cells compared to healthy controls, particularly in older patients. We also find a higher proportion of effector-memory Vδ1 + γδ T cells and a more clonal T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in CVID. The most significant driver of the Vδ1 + γδ T cell expansion and phenotype in CVID patients is persistent cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. These findings provide valuable insights into γδ T cell biology and their contribution to immune defence in CVID.

### Low serum IgE is a sensitive and specific marker for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) [^a19089f1]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Although small prior studies have suggested that IgE can be low in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the workup for patients with recurrent infections and suspected hypogammaglobulinemia does not include the routine measurement of serum IgE. We sought to test the hypothesis that low/undetectable serum IgE is characteristic of CVID by comparing the frequency of low/undetectable serum IgE in healthy controls and patients with CVID. We measured total serum IgE in a large multi-center cohort of patients with CVID (n = 354) and compared this to large population-based cohorts of children and adults. We further compared IgE levels in patients with CVID to those with other forms of humoral immunodeficiency, and in a subset, measured levels of allergen-specific serum IgE and IgG subclasses. Lastly, we evaluated for the presence of IgE in commercially available immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) products. An undetectable serum IgE (< 2 IU/ml) occurs in only 3.3% (95% CI, 1.9–5.7%) of the general population. In contrast, an undetectable IgE occurs in 75.6% (95% CI, 65.6–85.7%) of patients with CVID. Conversely, a high IgE (> 180 IU/ml) is very uncommon in CVID (0.3% of patients). IgE is > 2 IU/ml in 91.2% of patients with secondary hypogammaglobulinemia, and thus, an IgE < LLOD is suggestive of a primary humoral immunodeficiency. Allergen-specific IgE is not detectable in 96.5% of patients with CVID. Sufficient quantities of IgE to change the total serum IgE are not contained in IgRT. The IgG1/IgG4 ratio is increased in subjects with low IgE, regardless of whether they are controls or have CVID. These findings support the routine measurement of serum IgE in the workup of patients with hypogammaglobulinemia.

### Association of common variable immunodeficiency and rare and complex connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases. A systematic literature review [^07c7bf6e]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To perform a systematic literature review (SLR) on the association of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and rare and complex connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases, namely systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), relapsing polychondritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease, as well as undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease.

Methods

An SLR on studies and cases about the association of CVID and rare and complex connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases was performed. Animal studies were excluded.

Results

170 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sjögren's syndrome was the most frequent connective tissue disease in CVID-patients. Most case reports exist on SLE and CVID with SLE mostly preceding the manifestation of CVID. Multiple cases were published reporting the concurrence of CVID and inclusion body myositis and single cases were found on CVID and antisynthetase syndrome, polymyositis, limited SSc and relapsing polychondritis, respectively. There are no cases of CVID and antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG4-related disease, as well as undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease.

Conclusions

The concurrence of CVID and complex connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases, especially SS, IIM, SSc and relapsing polychondritis is rare but relevant. The measurements of Ig-levels should be performed before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy to allow for the differentiation of primary and secondary Ig-deficiency and substitute IG if necessary.

### Dissecting secondary immunodeficiency: identification of primary immunodeficiency within B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [^4220329c]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The distinction between PIDs and SIDs associated with hematological malignancies raises critical questions about their relationship — whether they represent distinct entities or varying expressions within the same clinical spectrum. Identifying biomarkers capable of distinguishing PIDs from genuine SIDs in patients with B-CLPD is crucial for enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This study proposes the hypothesis that there exists a "hidden" subgroup of PID patients among those classified as having SID, who may experience a unique clinical trajectory. Such patients could potentially benefit from tailored follow-up strategies and specific treatments, including immunotherapies or targeted therapies that address known altered signaling pathways, ultimately influencing their clinical outcomes and familial implications.

In this pioneering observational study, we aimed to evaluate classical and more recent clinical and immunological biomarkers for PID diagnosis in a cohort of SID with B-CLPD. We assessed the ability of these biomarkers to differentiate between late-onset PID and SID, aiming to refine the clinical understanding and management of these complex conditions.

### Common variable immunodeficiency and liver involvement [^9e92f528]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary B-cell immunodeficiency disorder, characterized by remarkable hypogammaglobulinemia. The disease can develop at any age without gender predominance. The prevalence of CVID varies widely worldwide. The underlying causes of CVID remain largely unknown; primary B-cell dysfunctions, defects in T cells and antigen-presenting cells are involved. Although some monogenetic defects have been identified in some CVID patients, it is likely that CVID is polygenic. Patients with CVID develop recurrent and chronic infections (e.g., bacterial infections of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract), autoimmune diseases, lymphoproliferation, malignancies, and granulomatous lesions. Interestingly, autoimmunity can be the only clinical manifestation of CVID at the time of diagnosis and may even develop prior to hypogammaglobulinemia. The diagnosis of CVID is largely based on the criteria established by European Society for Immunodeficiencies and Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency (ESID/PAGID) and with some recent modifications. The disease can affect multiple organs, including the liver. Clinical features of CVID patients with liver involvement include abnormal liver biochemistries, primarily elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), or liver cirrhosis and its complications. Replacement therapy with immunoglobulin (Ig) and anti-infection therapy are the primary treatment regimen for CVID patients. No specific therapy for liver involvement of CVID is currently available, and liver transplantation is an option only in select cases. The prognosis of CVID varies widely. Further understanding in the etiology and pathophysiology will facilitate early diagnosis and treatments to improve prognosis.

### Lymphoma as an exclusion criteria for CVID diagnosis revisited [^1ac3b5d4]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hypogammaglobulinemia in a context of lymphoma is usually considered as secondary and prior lymphoma remains an exclusion criterion for a common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) diagnosis. We hypothesized that lymphoma could be the revealing symptom of an underlying primary immunodeficiency (PID), challenging the distinction between primary and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia.

Methods

Within a French cohort of adult patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, patients who developed a lymphoma either during follow-up or before the diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia were identified. These two chronology groups were then compared. For patients without previous genetic diagnosis, a targeted next-generation sequencing of 300 PID-associated genes was performed.

Results

A total of forty-seven patients had developed 54 distinct lymphomas: non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma (67%), Hodgkin lymphoma (26%), and T cell lymphoma (7%). In 25 patients, lymphoma developed prior to the diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia. In this group of patients, Hodgkin lymphoma was overrepresented compared to the group of patients in whom lymphoma occurred during follow-up (48% versus 9%), whereas MALT lymphoma was absent (0 versus 32%). Despite the histopathological differences, both groups presented with similar characteristics in terms of age at hypogammaglobulinemia diagnosis, consanguinity rate, or severe T cell defect. Overall, genetic analyses identified a molecular diagnosis in 10/47 patients (21%), distributed in both groups and without peculiar gene recurrence. Most of these patients presented with a late onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID) phenotype.

Conclusion

Prior or concomitant lymphoma should not be used as an exclusion criteria for CVID diagnosis, and these patients should be investigated accordingly.

### Common variable immune deficiency: case studies [^969f7f5e]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is one of the most common congenital immune defects encountered in clinical practice. The condition occurs equally in males and females, and most commonly in the 20- to 40-year-old age group. The diagnosis is made by documenting reduced serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and usually IgM, together with loss of protective antibodies. The genetics of this syndrome are complex and are still being unraveled, but the hallmarks for most patients, as with other immune defects, include acute and chronic infections of the sinopulmonary tract. However, other noninfectious autoimmune or inflammatory conditions may also occur in CVID, and indeed these may be the first and only sign that a significant immune defect is present. These manifestations include episodes of immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or neutropenia, in addition to splenomegaly, generalized or worrisome lymphadenopathy, and malignancy, especially lymphoma. These issues commonly bring the patient to the attention of hematologists for both evaluation and treatment. This article discusses 3 cases in which patients with CVID had some of these presenting issues and what hematology input was required.

### British society for immunology / United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network consensus statement on managing non-infectious complications of common variable immunodeficiency disorders [^a929d20b]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Demographics

The steering group that developed the questionnaire consisted of a facilitator from the NGC, 10 consultant immunologists and one nurse specialist.

Thirty‐nine participants from 21 immunodeficiency services (of a total of 34 adult UK immunodeficiency services) took part in the first round of the survey; 35 of 85 (41%) consultants and four of 75 (5%) nurse specialists. The first‐round survey was completed by 33 of the 39 participants, while six participants only partially completed the survey. More than 70% of the participants had worked in immunology as a speciality for more than 10 years, and each had direct involvement with more than 50 patients with CVID. Twenty‐two participants, all of them consultants, from 16 immunodeficiency centres completed the second round of the survey. More than 80% of the participants had worked in immunology as a speciality for more than 10 years and 50% have direct involvement with more than 50 patients with CVID.

Of the 63 statements in the first round, 57 achieved consensus. For details of the statements that did not reach consensus see Appendix 1. Of the remaining six statements, two still did not achieve consensus in the second round. The steering group made the decision not to make recommendations based on the two statements that did not reach consensus. The statements that achieved consensus were reviewed by groups representing patients with CVID, and their comments have been incorporated into the discussions below.

Summary of recommendations

The recommendations should be considered in the context of the individual needs of the adult with CVID.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^a713dafb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — medication associations and evidence base are summarized as follows: "Many immunosuppressive medications have been associated with SHG, which can but does not always lead to secondary recurrent infections," and "Studies of clinical outcomes with SHG from medications, aside from BCTT and corticosteroids, are limited mostly to case reports, expert opinion, or reviews."

### Association of immunoglobulin levels, infectious risk, and mortality with rituximab and hypogammaglobulinemia [^850f8889]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

There have been some advances toward routine immunologic screening in certain subsets of patients and subspecialties given these findings. The Rituximab Consensus Expert Committee recommended that before initiating rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis treatment, a baseline IgG level should be obtained, in addition to measuring IgG levels before each rituximab cycle and longitudinally. Buch et alreported that, in both the registry data and clinical trial–compiled data, low levels of IgG prior to rituximab were associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Sustained low IgG levels (≥ 4 months) were associated with increased risk for serious infections in open extension studies. Despite these recommendations, the widespread adoption of a basic immunologic workup, including regularly checking immunoglobulin levels before and after the initiation of rituximab, has not occurred across the many specialties in which rituximab treatment is indicated.

Given that many patients do not undergo immunologic evaluation before rituximab treatment, it can be difficult to determine whether underlying immune dysfunction was present at baseline (eg, primary immunodeficiency, such as CVID) or if the dysfunction is a long-lasting effect (secondary immunodeficiency). Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogeneous collection of syndromes characterized by impaired B-cell differentiation, defective immunoglobulin production, and recurrent infections. In addition to recurrent sinopulmonary infections, patients with CVID are at increased risk for autoimmunity, granulomatous disease, and cancer, which may be treated with rituximab, and can present up to decades before CVID is diagnosed. Thus, evaluating pretreatment immunoglobulin levels may help to identify patients with underlying immunodeficiency and/or humoral dysfunction. Monitoring immunoglobulin levels following rituximab therapy may help to identify patients at risk for severe infections secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia in whom the initiation of IgR may be warranted. Memory B cells have been suggested as a marker of rituximab response, need for IgR, and recovery of cell counts/immunoglobulins.

We hypothesize that in hypogammaglobulinemia after rituximab, there may be 2 subsets of patients: 1 group with normal recovery of immunoglobulin levels/cell counts and another group with long-lasting, symptomatic, hypogammaglobulinemia. In patients with persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, there is likely an increased risk for infection given the humoral dysfunction/deficiency, and these patients may benefit from IgR. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients who received rituximab to improve clinical standards for monitoring across specialties.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent infections in childhood [^50f27954]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Recurrent or persistent infection is the major manifestation of primary immunodeficiency, which also results in atypical infection with opportunistic organisms. Young children are also vulnerable to infection and recurrent infection is common. While most children with recurrent infection have a normal immunity, it is important to recognize the child with an underlying primary immunodeficiency and investigate and treat appropriately and yet not over investigate normal children. Prompt, accurate diagnosis directs the most appropriate treatment, and early and judicious use of prophylactic antibiotics and replacement immunoglobulin can prevent significant end organ damage and improve long-term outlook and quality of life. This paper describes important presenting features of primary immunodeficiency and indicates when further investigation is warranted.

### Viral infection in primary antibody deficiency syndromes [^e663c04b]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with primary antibody deficiency syndromes such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) are at increased risk of severe and invasive infection. Viral infection in these populations has been of increasing interest as evidence mounts that viruses contribute significant morbidity and mortality: this is mediated both directly and via aberrant immune responses. We explain the importance of the humoral immune system in defence against viral pathogens before highlighting several significant viral syndromes in patients with antibody deficiency. We explore historical cases of hepatitis C via contaminated immunoglobulin products, the predisposition to invasive enteroviral infections, prolonged excretion of vaccine-derived poliovirus, the morbidity of chronic norovirus infection, and recent literature revealing the importance of respiratory viral infections. We discuss evidence that herpesviruses may play a role in driving the inflammatory disease seen in a subset of patients. We explore the phenomenon of within-host evolution during chronic viral infection and the potential emergence of new pathogenic strains. We highlight novel and emerging viruses identified via deep sequencing techniques. We describe the treatment strategies that have been attempted in all these scenarios and the urgent outstanding questions for research.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^d7d6a5a2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — definition, evaluation, and referral are clarified: "HG by itself is a laboratory definition (with a cutoff that varies with age and between different laboratories) and does not necessarily indicate a clinically symptomatic syndrome." Because "IgG levels alone do not measure B-cell function, and antibody function and vaccine responses need to be evaluated and taken into consideration," "If SHG is uncovered, referral to a clinical immunologist can be considered to aid in these evaluations (Fig 2)."

### Recurrent sinopulmonary infections in a patient whose HIV masked common variable immunodeficiency [^b21cd5b8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is generally accepted that persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at an increased risk of infection due to direct destruction of CD4 + lymphocytes and subsequently impaired cell-mediated immunity. Typically, HIV infection is associated with immunoglobulin elevations, but quantitative deficiencies in immunoglobulins have also been rarely described. We present an unusual case of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in a HIV-positive patient with recurrent severe respiratory infections. We review epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of primary immunoglobulin deficiency. We also review the relationship between immunoglobulin deficiency and HIV and highlight the importance of recognizing the coexistence of two distinct immunodeficiency syndromes.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — proposed research standardization defines adult hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) as a serum IgG level below 700 mg/dL, with brackets of 400 to 699 mg/dL, 200 to 399 mg/dL, and 0 to 199 mg/dL, and stratifies SHG duration into 3 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and more than 24 months; these criteria are not intended to dictate clinical care but to standardize studies.

Introduction

Individuals with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies are more susceptible for a severe course of infections, because of their underlying disease and the use of immunomodulating medication that compromises immune defense against infection. The spectrum of primary immunodeficiencies is large and includes humoral immune deficiency (such as common variable immunodeficiencies (CVID), cellular and combined immune deficiencies (CID), complement disorders, and (functional) asplenia. Secondary immunodeficiency is often due to immunosuppressive treatment and therefore can occur in a wide spectrum of inflammatory diseases, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but may also be caused by more rare diagnoses including mixed connective tissue disorder (MCTD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as several forms of vasculitis. Prevention of infections is crucial to reduce the number of (intensive care) admissions and mortality of invasive bacterial infections such as (vaccine-preventable) meningococcal and pneumococcal disease. Data on immunogenicity of polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines in medical high-risk groups such as immunocompromised patients remain relatively scarce.

In 2018, a national outbreak of serogroup W invasive meningococcal disease (IMD-W) in the Netherlands urged the implementation of a meningococcal serogroup A, C, W and Y (MenACWY) conjugate vaccination at 14 years of age, next to a catch-up campaign for individuals 14–18 years. We conducted a prospective observational study on antibody levels before and after MenACWY vaccination in a cohort of individuals diagnosed with primary or secondary immunodeficiency aged 14–18 years, with a follow-up of two years.

CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy — secondary hypogammaglobulinemia evaluation and management are guided by expert opinion. Published expert opinion has recommended screening quantitative immunoglobulins and specific antibody titers in response to vaccines before and 3 months after initiation of CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy to risk stratify the need for prophylactic IgG-RT. Management proposals include prophylactic IgG-RT for IgG levels less than 400 mg/dL during the first 3 months after initiation of CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy, with consideration of IgG-RT after the first 3 months for patients with IgG levels less than or equal to 400 mg/dL and serious, persistent, or recurrent bacterial infections. A position paper from Spain has proposed an IgG trough level above 400 mg/dL and IgG-RT in all pediatric patients approximately 1 month after initiation of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, with consideration of increasing the dose if infections persist; vaccination strategies are modeled after HSCT vaccination schedules. This preliminary guidance was made in the absence of specific data regarding the efficacy of prophylactic IgG-RT after CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy, is based on PI, SOT, HSCT, and B cell malignancy literature, and IgG level cutoffs need interpretation alongside other indicators of immune function.
