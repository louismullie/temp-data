## Question

Corneal injury treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about corneal injury treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the corneal injury and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should verify first-line management principles that apply broadly. Next, I will examine pain control strategies, including NSAIDs and the controversial topic of topical anesthetics. After that, I need to check infection prophylaxis and antibiotic choices, including contact lens–related injuries. I will then review when to use bandage contact lenses and whether to patch. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, follow-up and referral triggers, and synthesize a practical algorithm with strength of evidence and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and classification, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Corneal injuries span abrasions, foreign body, chemical burns, ultraviolet keratitis, and penetrating or perforating trauma, and I need to ensure I distinguish simple abrasions from ulcers, erosions, or open globe, using fluorescein staining and a careful slit-lamp exam to define defect size, depth, and presence of infiltrate or infection, while documenting visual acuity and checking for retained foreign material or rust rings that require removal [^117KxVfQ] [^113gidRT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify universal first-line principles that apply across etiologies. Pain control, infection prevention, and promotion of epithelial healing are the pillars, and I need to ensure I tailor therapy to injury type, size, patient risk factors, and access to care, with early treatment of abrasions shown to prevent progression to ulcers and reduce costs and vision loss, especially in resource-limited settings [^113zw9Rs] [^116R5u7H].

> Next, I should review pain control, and I need to be careful about the strength of evidence. Topical NSAIDs reduce pain and decrease the need for oral analgesics in traumatic corneal abrasions, with meta-analytic data showing roughly a 1.3-point reduction on pain scales and fewer rescue analgesics, though the certainty is low to moderate and cost and stinging can be limitations, so I should individualize use and counsel on transient discomfort with drops [^112U9GCf] [^117Jxk2f]. Wait, let me verify the anesthetic question, because practice varies and toxicity concerns are real. Multiple RCTs and Cochrane analyses show no consistent pain benefit for outpatient topical anesthetics versus placebo in traumatic abrasions and suggest a possible increase in non-healing defects, so routine outpatient anesthetic prescribing remains unsupported; however, a recent ACEP consensus allows strictly limited, short-course dispensing with tight safeguards, which I should frame as controversial and evidence-limited rather than standard care [^1128Sczb] [^114yiuCv] [^112vBqST]. I should also confirm that oral acetaminophen or ibuprofen are reasonable adjuncts for the first 24–48 hours when needed, aligning with guideline-based analgesic strategies [^115RT9S7].

> I will now examine infection prophylaxis, and I need to double-check the certainty of evidence. The Cochrane reviews consistently conclude that evidence for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in uncomplicated traumatic corneal abrasions is very low certainty, with no clear reduction in infection and no meaningful effect on healing time, so I should avoid overstating benefit; nonetheless, many guidelines and practice patterns still recommend a short course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic given the low risk and potential benefit, especially in higher-risk contexts or when follow-up is uncertain [^113b32d2] [^116aj8GN]. But wait, what if the abrasion is contact lens–related? In that scenario, the risk of Pseudomonas is higher, so I should recommend a topical fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin rather than a simple aminoglycoside, and I should advise stopping contact lens wear until fully healed with close follow-up [^117YXGr9] [^117KxVfQ].

> Let me consider bandage contact lenses, and I should confirm guideline positions. The AAO PPP states insufficient evidence to support routine bandage contact lens use for corneal abrasions, yet some guidelines allow selective use for large abrasions to improve comfort and potentially facilitate healing, provided there is no retained foreign body, antibiotics are coadministered, and the lens is removed within 24–48 hours with close follow-up; I need to ensure I balance comfort against infection risk and monitor closely if I choose this path [^112gxL6d] [^117D2ENF] [^11785W4r].

> Now, I should confirm the stance on patching, because this is a frequent point of confusion. Multiple high-quality systematic reviews and contemporary guidelines converge on the same message: do not patch simple corneal abrasions, as patching does not improve pain or healing and may delay re-epithelialization and cause loss of binocular vision; I should explicitly counsel against patching in routine cases and reserve it, if at all, for special circumstances after specialist input [^116vTb33] [^1174HynG] [^112kJEFP] [^116f7jY2].

> Next, I should review special scenarios, starting with chemical injuries. Immediate copious irrigation is the time-critical intervention, ideally with sterile saline or lactated Ringer's, continuing until the conjunctival pH normalizes; after that, I should consider advanced therapies such as perfluorodecalin-based oxygenated emulsions in experimental or specialized settings to mitigate hypoxia and inflammation, while arranging urgent ophthalmology referral for grading and ongoing management of limbal stem cell failure risk and scarring [^111oQHL7] [^1142Lqgp] [^1164rCrn]. For ultraviolet keratitis, I should treat supportively with topical antibiotics, cycloplegia, NSAIDs, and frequent lubrication, avoiding patching and emphasizing prevention with UV-protective eyewear; symptoms typically resolve over 24–72 hours, but I need to ensure close follow-up if not improving [^113uYbi1] [^112Fsidq]. For suspected open globe or deep corneal lacerations, I must not patch, avoid pressure, place a rigid shield, keep the patient nil per os, and arrange emergent ophthalmology transfer for surgical repair, using viscoelastic and suture techniques that minimize astigmatism and scarring when indicated [^11587SN4].

> I should confirm follow-up and referral triggers to avoid missed complications. Small, uncomplicated abrasions in reliable patients may not require routine follow-up if symptoms are resolving and vision is normal, but larger defects, contact lens–associated injuries, immunocompromised hosts, or those with persistent pain, photophobia, decreased vision, corneal infiltrate, or ulceration warrant re-evaluation within 24 hours and urgent ophthalmology referral; I need to ensure patients know to return immediately for worsening pain, purulent discharge, or vision changes [^117KxVfQ] [^11785W4r].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned algorithm, and I will double-check each element against guidelines. For any corneal injury, confirm diagnosis with fluorescein and slit-lamp exam, remove foreign bodies or rust rings, and classify severity and etiology. For simple traumatic abrasions, provide topical NSAIDs for pain, consider a short course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic such as erythromycin or chloramphenicol acknowledging low-certainty benefit, avoid patching, use frequent lubrication, and arrange follow-up if large, contact lens–related, or not improving. For contact lens–related abrasions, use a fluoroquinolone and stop lens wear. For large abrasions with marked pain, consider a bandage contact lens with antibiotics and strict 24–48 hour removal with close follow-up. For chemical burns, irrigate immediately and copiously, then manage per burn protocol with urgent ophthalmology. For UV keratitis, treat supportively and prevent recurrence. For suspected open globe, shield, no patch, no pressure, and emergent transfer [^11785W4r] [^116aj8GN] [^117KxVfQ] [^111oQHL7] [^113uYbi1] [^11587SN4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and the strength of evidence, because overstatement can mislead. The evidence base for many corneal abrasion treatments is low to moderate certainty, particularly around antibiotics and some analgesic choices, so shared decision-making, patient preference, and local context matter; I should also emphasize that early treatment of abrasions prevents ulcers and vision loss and is cost-effective, which strengthens the case for timely, guideline-concordant care even when some individual interventions have modest evidence [^113b32d2] [^113zw9Rs] [^116R5u7H].

Corneal injury treatment centers on **prompt pain control** [^112U9GCf], **infection prevention** [^117YXGr9], and **rapid epithelial healing** [^117KxVfQ]. Topical NSAIDs reduce pain and oral analgesics are used as needed [^112U9GCf]; topical antibiotics prevent infection, especially in contact lens wearers or large defects [^117YXGr9] [^116aj8GN]. Do not patch [^116vTb33] because it does not improve healing or pain and may delay recovery [^1174HynG]; instead, use frequent lubrication and consider a bandage contact lens for large abrasions with close follow-up [^11785W4r] [^117D2ENF]. Most abrasions heal in 24–72 hours [^115N6v4o]; refer urgently for vision loss, corneal opacities, or non-healing defects [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Slit-lamp examination**: Confirm the diagnosis and assess defect size, depth, and location [^117KxVfQ].
- **Fluorescein staining**: Identify epithelial defects and guide management [^117KxVfQ].
- **Foreign body assessment**: Remove any retained material to prevent ongoing injury [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Pain management

Pain control is essential for comfort and to reduce reflex blepharospasm that can delay healing [^notfound].

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Effective for pain relief (e.g. ketorolac 0.5% or diclofenac 0.1%) [^112U9GCf] [^117Jxk2f].
- **Oral analgesics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for moderate pain [^115RT9S7].
- **Cycloplegic agents**: Short-acting agents (e.g. cyclopentolate 1%) can reduce ciliary spasm and photophobia [^notfound].

---

## Infection prevention

Preventing infection is critical, particularly in contact lens wearers or large defects [^117YXGr9].

- **Topical antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum agents (e.g. erythromycin ointment or chloramphenicol) are recommended for all abrasions [^116aj8GN] [^11785W4r].
- **Contact lens-related abrasions**: Use fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin) due to Pseudomonas risk [^117KxVfQ].
- **Duration**: Typically 3–5 days, adjusted based on healing and risk factors [^116V2brL].

---

## Promotion of epithelial healing

Facilitating rapid epithelial recovery reduces pain and complications [^113ANvsz].

- **Lubrication**: Frequent preservative-free artificial tears or ointment to maintain moisture and reduce lid friction [^111eGzb1].
- **Bandage contact lens**: Consider for large abrasions (> 10 mm²) or persistent defects, with close follow-up and antibiotic coverage [^117D2ENF] [^11785W4r].
- **Avoid patching**: Patching does not improve healing or pain and may delay recovery [^116vTb33] [^1174HynG].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Most abrasions heal within 24–72 hours [^115N6v1G]; arrange follow-up to ensure resolution and detect complications [^117KxVfQ].

- **Re-evaluation**: Within 24–48 hours for large defects, contact lens wearers, or immunocompromised patients [^117KxVfQ].
- **Referral**: Urgent ophthalmology for vision loss, corneal opacities, or non-healing defects [^117KxVfQ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chemical injuries**: Immediate copious irrigation is critical; refer urgently [^111oQHL7].
- **Recurrent corneal erosion**: May require long-term lubrication or surgical intervention [^113yReJ6].
- **Contact lens wearers**: Emphasize hygiene and avoidance of lens use until fully healed [^117KxVfQ].

---

Corneal injury treatment prioritizes **pain control**, **infection prevention**, and **rapid healing**; most abrasions resolve within 24–72 hours with appropriate care, and complications are minimized by avoiding patching and ensuring close follow-up [^116vTb33] [^117KxVfQ].

### Corneal injury: clinical and molecular aspects [^114QYyno]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Currently, over 10 million people worldwide are affected by corneal blindness. Corneal trauma and disease can cause irreversible distortions to the normal structure and physiology of the cornea often leading to corneal transplantation. However, donors are in short supply and risk of rejection is an ever-present concern. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, the wound healing cascade remains complex and not fully understood. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are currently at the apex of investigation in the pursuit of novel corneal therapeutics. This review uniquely integrates the clinical and cellular aspects of both corneal trauma and disease and provides a comprehensive view of the most recent findings and potential therapeutics aimed at restoring corneal homeostasis.

### Interventions for recurrent corneal erosions [^113yReJ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent corneal erosion is a common cause of disabling ocular symptoms and predisposes the cornea to infection. It may follow corneal trauma. Measures to prevent the development of recurrent corneal erosion following corneal trauma have not been firmly established. Once recurrent corneal erosion develops, simple medical therapy (standard treatment) may lead to resolution of the episode. However, some people continue to suffer when such therapy fails and repeated episodes of erosion develop. A number of treatment and prophylactic options are then available but there is no agreement as to the best option. This review version is an update to the original version published in 2007 and a previous update published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of regimens for the prophylaxis of further recurrent corneal erosion episodes, the treatment of recurrent corneal erosion and prophylaxis of the development of recurrent corneal erosion following trauma.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; MEDLINE; Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the search was 14 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared a prophylactic or treatment regimen with another prophylaxis/treatment or no prophylaxis/treatment for people with recurrent corneal erosion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias. We considered the following outcome measures: resolution of symptoms after treatment; recurrence after complete or partial resolution; symptoms (pain); adverse effects (corneal haze, astigmatism). We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE for the three most clinically relevant comparisons.

Main Results

We included eight randomised and two quasi-randomised controlled trials in the review, encompassing 505 participants. Seven studies were from Europe (Germany, Sweden and the UK), two from East Asia (Hong Kong and Japan) and one from Australia. Nine of the studies examined treatments for episodes of recurrent corneal erosions and one study considered prophylaxis to prevent development of recurrent corneal erosions after injury. Two of the nine treatment studies also enrolled participants in a study of prophylaxis to prevent further episodes of recurrent corneal erosions. The studies were poorly reported; we judged only one study low risk of bias on all domains. Two studies compared therapeutic contact lens with topical lubrication but one of these studies was published over 30 years ago and used a therapeutic contact lens that is no longer in common use. The more recent study was a two-centre UK study with 29 participants. It provided low-certainty evidence on resolution of symptoms after treatment with similar number of participants in both groups experiencing resolution of symptoms at four months (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.53). There was very low-certainty evidence on recurrence after partial or total resolution at seven months' follow-up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.54). There was no evidence of an important difference in pain score (score of 3 in the contact lens group and score of 2 in the topical lubrication group, low-certainty evidence) and no adverse effects were reported. The older study, using a contact lens no longer in common use, found an increased risk of pain and complications with the contact lens compared with hypromellose drops and paraffin ointment at night. A single-centre, Australian study, with 33 participants, provided low-certainty evidence of an increased risk of recurrence with phototherapeutic keratectomy compared with alcohol delamination but with wide confidence intervals, compatible with increased or decreased risk (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.37). Time to recurrence was similar in both groups (6.5 and 6 months, low-certainty evidence). On average people receiving phototherapeutic keratectomy reported less pain but confidence intervals included no difference or greater pain (mean difference (MD) -0.70, 95% CI -2.23 to 0.83, low-certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported. A 48-participant study in Hong Kong found recurrences were less common in people given diamond burr superficial keratectomy after epithelial debridement compared with sham diamond burr treatment after epithelial debridement (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.50, moderate-certainty evidence). The study did not report pain scores but adverse effects such as corneal haze (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.87, low-certainty evidence) and astigmatism (0.88 versus 0.44 dioptres, moderate-certainty evidence) were similar between the groups. A study comparing transepithelial versus subepithelial excimer laser ablation in 100 people found low-certainty evidence of a small increased risk of recurrence of corneal erosion at one-year follow-up in people given the transepithelial compared with subepithelial technique, however, the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with increased or decreased risk (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.48, low-certainty evidence). Other outcomes were not reported. Other treatment comparisons included in this review were only addressed by studies published two decades or more ago. The results of these studies were inconclusive: excimer laser ablation (after epithelial debridement) versus no excimer laser ablation (after epithelial debridement), epithelial debridement versus anterior stromal puncture, anterior stromal puncture versus therapeutic contact lens, oral oxytetracycline and topical prednisolone (in addition to 'standard therapy') versus oral oxytetracycline (in addition to 'standard therapy') versus 'standard therapy'.

Authors' Conclusions

Well-designed, masked, randomised controlled trials using standardised methods are needed to establish the benefits of new and existing prophylactic and treatment regimes for recurrent corneal erosion. Studies included in this review have been of insufficient size and quality to provide firm evidence to inform the development of management guidelines. International consensus is also needed to progress research efforts towards evaluation of the major effective treatments for recurrent corneal erosions.

### Cochrane briefs… [^112ZHLQa]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Patching for Corneal Abrasions. Clinical Question Is patching an effective treatment for simple corneal abrasions. Evidence-Based Answer Patching is not beneficial for the treatment of simple corneal abrasions as measured by time to healing, complete healing rates at 24 to 48 hours, or pain. Practice Pointers Corneal abrasions are superficial defects of the corneal epithelium that most commonly result from mechanical injuries to the cornea. Experts have long recommended patching for the treatment of simple abrasions; however, recent studies have questioned this traditional guidance. 1 Eleven prospective randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were identified that studied the effectiveness of patching as measured by corneal healing in children and adults with corneal abrasion.

All trials had two treatment groups with participants randomized to wear a patch for 24 hours or no patch; both treatment groups received variable dosing regimens of topical medications, including topical antibiotics, steroids, and cycloplegic eye drops. Five trials measured the number of participants with complete healing on each day of follow-up; two trials measured mean time to healing; and six trials measured percentage of healing or abrasion dimension sizes at each day of follow-up. Secondary outcomes measured in the trials included pain scores, analgesia use, treatment compliance, and ability to complete activities of daily living. Three trials mentioned short-term adverse events, and four trials reported long-term complications and follow-up two to seven months after the corneal abrasion.

Overall, the studies were rated as being of poor quality because of uncertain adequacy of randomization, lack of intention-to-treat analyses, and high drop-out rates. Meta-analysis of seven trials reporting complete healing rates on the first day of follow-up showed that more participants in the no-patch group had complete healing. When the two quasi-randomized trials were excluded from the pooled analysis, the difference in complete healing rates between the groups was nonsignificant. Pooled analysis of studies reporting complete healing rates at day 2 and day 3 of follow-up showed no significant difference between the patch and no-patch groups. Analysis of six studies showed no significant difference between the patch and no-patch groups in the mean number of days to healing.

### Wounding the cornea to learn how it heals [^111ivBwm]. Experimental Eye Research (2014). Low credibility.

Corneal wound healing studies have a long history and rich literature that describes the data obtained over the past 70 years using many different species of animals and methods of injury. These studies have lead to reduced suffering and provided clues to treatments that are now helping patients live more productive lives. In spite of the progress made, further research is required since blindness and reduced quality of life due to corneal scarring still happens. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about different types of wound and animal models used to study corneal wound healing. The subject of corneal wound healing is broad and includes chemical and mechanical wound models. This review focuses on mechanical injury models involving debridement and keratectomy wounds to reflect the authors' expertise.

### Navigating the path to corneal healing success and challenges: a comprehensive overview [^1134xsm1]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Corneal wound healing is a multifactorial process. Corneal regeneration success or failure is influenced by various factors. A lack of any factor results in the malfunction of pathways and cells influenced by that factor and causes insufficient regeneration. A clear understanding of these factors and their interactions can help us to develop more effective prevention and treatment modalities.

### Bioactive antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics for corneal wounds and infections [^117YR6x9]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Relevance

While most corneal wounds and abrasions require no intervention, 10%–20% of the 2,000 work-related ocular injuries occurring each day in the United States result in temporary or permanent vision loss according to Prevent Blindness. In individuals with persistent corneal epithelial defects (PCEDs), there is a high risk for infection or further injury that results in permanent vision loss due to corneal scarring, infection, neovascularization, and incomplete wound healing. To effectively resolve the adverse clinical presentation of PCEDs, we discuss the potential therapeutic value of antimicrobial proteins and peptides.

### How the cornea heals: cornea-specific repair mechanisms affecting surgical outcomes [^113cwGpL]. Cornea (2005). Low credibility.

In mammals, penetrating injuries typically heal by deposition of fibrotic "repair tissue" that fills and seals wounds but does not restore normal function. Excessive deposition of fibrotic repair tissue can lead to pathologies involving excessive scarring and contracture. In the cornea, fibrotic repair presents special challenges affecting both clarity and shape of the cornea. With the increasing popularity of surgical techniques that alter corneal refractive errors, understanding of cornea repair mechanisms has acquired new significance. The cornea has unique anatomic, cellular, molecular, and functional features that lead to important mechanistic differences in the process of repair in comparison with what occurs in skin and other organs. Moreover, corneal function calls for special outcomes. This review addresses these features from the viewpoint of the authors' research on factors of importance to understanding and improving surgical outcomes.

### An update on chemical eye burns [^111oQHL7]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Ocular chemical injuries vary in severity, with the more severe end of the spectrum having profound visual consequences and medicolegal implications. Grading of ocular injuries is critical for determining acute treatment and visual prognosis. Poor immediate management results in more challenging treatment of acute disease. Similarly, poorly controlled acute disease results in more treatment-resistant chronic ocular disease. Despite several decades of research and public health initiatives, simple and effective interventions such as wearing protective eyewear and immediate irrigation of eyes remain as key challenges. Education and prevention are therefore important public health messages. Hurdles in the acute management of disease include poor evidence-base for commonly used treatments (e.g. based on experimental animal studies), reduced treatment adherence rates and high clinic non-attendance rates. The evolution of treatment strategies, particularly limbal stem cell transplantation, has revolutionised the visual and cosmetic outcomes in chronic phases of disease. It is therefore increasingly important to consider tertiary referral for patients with limbal stem cell failure or vision-limiting corneal scarring.

### Bioactive antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics for corneal wounds and infections [^111dK3NE]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Given the suboptimal early intervention strategies and drug delivery systems available to slow and/or stop the loss of vision after trauma, there is a need for the development of innovative ways to treat injuries early and effectively. There are currently no marketed products available for the medical need of promoting the healing process of these ocular corneal surface injuries for either military members or civilians. Therefore, the use of specific AMPs that can promote corneal wound healing while killing invading pathogens appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112EQ8jW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal ulcers — recognition and initial wilderness management prioritize emergent care, culture when near expert evaluation, and empiric fluoroquinolone therapy when far from care, with explicit dosing instructions and evacuation. Signs include significant pain, white or gray corneal infiltrate, and an epithelial defect on fluorescein exam; emergent treatment is important, and contact lenses must be discontinued. If the patient is within 1–3 h of an ophthalmologist's evaluation, we recommend the ophthalmologist obtain a culture before initiating treatment; if more than a few hours from expert evaluation, we recommend beginning empiric antibiotic treatment with fourth-generation fluoroquinolone eye drops, such as moxifloxacin 0.5%, loading by instilling 1 drop every 5 min for the first 30 min, then 1 drop every 30 min for 6 h, followed by 1 drop every hour until seen. Oral fluoroquinolones are warranted if nothing else is available (such as moxifloxacin, 400 mg daily for 7 days), and cycloplegic medication (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h) can be given; evacuation should be emergent. Recommendation grades include: Antibiotics, topical — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Antibiotics, systemic — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Cycloplegic — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Evacuation — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Bioactive antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics for corneal wounds and infections [^112XLZhc]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Significance: More than 2 million eye injuries and infections occur each year in the United States that leave civilians and military members with reduced or complete vision loss due to the lack of effective therapeutics. Severe ocular injuries and infections occur in varied settings including the home, workplace, and battlefields. In this review, we discuss the potential of developing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as therapeutics for the treatment of corneal wounds and infections for which the current treatment options are inadequate. Recent Advances: Standard-of-care employs the use of fluorescein dye for the diagnosis of ocular defects and is followed by the use of antibiotics and/or steroids to treat the infection and reduce inflammation. Recent advances for treating corneal wounds include the development of amniotic membrane therapies, wound chambers, and drug-loaded hydrogels. In this review, we will discuss an innovative approach using AMPs with the dual effect of promoting corneal wound healing and clearing infections. Critical Issues: An important aspect of treating ocular injuries is that treatments need to be effective and administered expeditiously. This is especially important for injuries that occur during combat and in individuals who demonstrate delayed wound healing. To overcome gaps in current treatment modalities, bioactive peptides based on naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial proteins are being investigated as new therapeutics. Future Directions: The development of new therapeutics that can treat ocular infections and promote corneal wound healing, including the healing of persistent corneal epithelial defects, would be of great clinical benefit.

### Perioperative corneal abrasion: updated guidelines for prevention and management [^112BU6vo]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasion is the most common ocular complication in surgery. Treatment requires pain control, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and close monitoring. Pain improves significantly after 24 hours and should be resolved by 48 hours. Persistent, worsening, or new symptoms warrant immediate specialist consultation. The authors review the pathophysiology of perioperative corneal abrasion, and propose updated evidence-based guidelines for improved patient care.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion [^113b32d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Corneal abrasion is a condition frequently treated by eye care professionals, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Topical ophthalmic antibiotics are the most common therapy for corneal abrasion. However, there has been no comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence regarding antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion. In this review update, we evaluated the current evidence regarding the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment for this relatively common emergency condition. This is an update of a review published in 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of topical antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase.com, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 28 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antibiotic with another antibiotic or with placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion(s).

Outcomes

Outcomes included the following: risk of any ocular infection up to one month following corneal abrasion, proportion of eyes healed within 48 hours, participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, complications of corneal abrasion, and treatment-related adverse events at the longest follow-up.

Risk Of Bias

Using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2 tool, we assessed the RoB for the three reported outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis by calculating risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes where possible; otherwise, we summarized the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes.

Included Studies

We included four RCTs enrolling a total of 998 participants, ranging from 20 to 437 participants. The included studies were published from 1975 to 1998, and conducted in Denmark (1), the Republic of Korea (1), and the UK (2). The length of follow-up was 24 hours to four weeks, or unspecified in two studies. Two studies had industry support. Participants had a mean age of 35 years (range 5 to 80 years) in one study, while the other three studies reported age ranges from 15 to 64 years. Most participants had traumatic corneal abrasions, commonly following foreign body removal. Two studies compared topical antibiotics with placebo (vehicle ointment or sodium hyaluronic acid drops), while three studies compared chloramphenicol ointment with antibiotics from other classes. One study was a three-arm study that compared two antibiotic regimens and one vehicle control. We judged the risk of bias from one study as raising some concerns about two efficacy outcomes, and three studies as having a high risk of overall bias across three outcomes.

Synthesis Of Results

We classified study interventions into two comparisons: 1) antibiotics versus placebo, and 2) chloramphenicol versus other classes of antibiotics. Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence as very low for all outcomes due to imprecision, indirectness, and risk of bias. Two studies compared antibiotics with placebo. For one study, we combined the data for the sulfacetamide sodium and chloramphenicol ointment groups and compared them with a vehicle control group in a three-arm study. This study suggested that antibiotics may increase the risk of ocular infection (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.70; 1 study, 320 participants). The same study found little to no difference in healing within 48 hours (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). Another study compared tobramycin with sodium hyaluronic acid and reported complete healing in most eyes by 48 hours, with no incidence of infection; however, the study was not included in the meta-analysis because of unit-of-analysis issues. One study reported severe allergic reactions to medication or other adverse events leading to participant withdrawal. The analysis showed no evidence of a difference in treatment-related adverse events between antibiotics and placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.47; 1 study, 437 participants). Another study reported no adverse events in both arms but was not included in the analysis because it was unclear how the outcomes were measured. Three studies compared chloramphenicol with other classes of antibiotics (fusidic acid or sulfacetamide sodium). The pooled analysis showed little to no difference in the risk of ocular infection within one month (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31; 3 studies, 651 participants). One study reported no positive cultures in either group, although minor inflammatory signs (e.g. conjunctival hyperemia) were noted in the chloramphenicol arm. For corneal healing within 48 hours, three studies assessed cure rates within 24 hours using slightly different definitions, but the pooled analysis again showed no clinically meaningful difference between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; 3 studies, 651 participants). Two studies found no evidence of a difference in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.17; 2 studies, 677 participants). Another study reported that one-third of participants in both groups experienced discomfort or itching, although these outcomes were not reported separately by each treatment arm. For both comparisons, none of the included studies reported the following prespecified outcomes: participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 50% or more at 24 hours, loss of one or more lines of best-corrected visual acuity at one month, change in pain interference from baseline to 24 hours, and complications of corneal abrasion up to the longest follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Given that the evidence supporting antibiotic use in corneal abrasion is of very low certainty, we are not able to support a specific antibiotic regimen or draw conclusions about the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing. Future research could explore adequately powered RCTs or alternative approaches, such as target trial emulation, while focusing on high-risk populations and antibiotic formulations.

### Topical hepatocyte growth factor accelerates wound healing and inhibits scarring in experimental corneal injury [^1132gnbw]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Corneal avascularity and clarity are essential for vision. Upon injury or insult resulting from local or systemic pathologies, a complex wound healing response ensues, which broadly involves an inflammatory phase, a cellular migration and proliferation phase, and a tissue remodeling/repair phase. Typically, the wound healing cascade is tightly coordinated by epithelial cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells, as well as by growth factors and mediators secreted by each cell type. The wound healing process can range from days to weeks depending on the extent of corneal damage. There are several challenges that can impede the process, including delayed or incomplete epithelialization, persistent or unbalanced inflammatory responses and infections, and neovascularization, all of which can affect corneal transparency and vision. However, by far, the biggest hurdle remains the potential for fibrosis or scarring during healing, which can lead to clouding of the cornea due to aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^1174HynG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent audits show that corneal abrasion is a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to test the hypothesis that patching an eye following a corneal abrasion improves healing or provides pain relief.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) on The Cochrane Library (2005, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1980 to April 2005), LILACS (13 April 2005), NRR (2005, Issue 2) and SIGLE (December 2004). There were no language or date restrictions in the searches. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for further information regarding quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing of the corneal epithelium and secondary outcomes were related to pain.

Main Results

Eleven trials, which randomised a total of 1014 participants, were included in the review. Meta-analysis of seven studies with dichotomous healing outcomes favoured no patching on the first day of healing (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.99). For days two and three there was no significant difference between the two groups. Of the nine trials that measured pain scores two favoured no patching and none favoured patching. Complication rates were low and no differences were noted in these between the two groups. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics and/or cycloplegics than the patch group which is an important confounding factor.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. In addition, use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. Therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. Further research should focus on large (greater than 10 mm²) abrasions.

Wilderness Medical Society — altitude and the eye notes that "Because the cornea receives most of its oxygen from the ambient air, the cornea becomes hypoxic at altitude and may not function normally". For those with prior intraocular gas, "patients with a history of intraocular gas bubbles should not go to high altitude owing to expansion of the gas bubble at decreasing atmospheric pressure", and "Patients should consult with their ophthalmologist regarding the safety of traveling to altitude". In the context of prior corneal refractive procedures, "Hypoxia at altitude causes edema and thickening of the cornea".

### Perioperative corneal abrasions after nonocular surgery: a systematic review [^116jqats]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review of the international literature evaluating the risk factors, preventative steps, and treatments for perioperative corneal injuries for nonocular surgery.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews databases were searched on April 13, 2018. Two hundred four articles were identified with 16 meeting the inclusion criteria. All studies were evaluated for quality and level of evidence. Two types of studies were included. The first were primary epidemiological studies that looked at the rates of perioperative corneal injuries after nonocular surgery and the second were trials that either studied preventative steps or treatments.

Results

A statistical analysis was completed to reveal trends in perioperative corneal abrasions. Rates ranged from 0.01% to 59% with a cumulative rate of 0.64% (95% confidence interval 0.36%-1.35%). Primary risk factors were identified as longer procedures, general anesthesia, and advanced age. The most commonly associated ocular injuries were found to include chemical injury, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, and conjunctival congestion. Treatment strategies for corneal abrasion in the literature recommended erythromycin ointment and ample ocular lubrication for the fastest recovery. Education interventions alone, as studied in 2 of the 16 articles, demonstrated a significant decrease in the rate of corneal abrasions.

Conclusions

Standardized ocular protection, reporting, and education initiatives were found to maximally decrease rates of perioperative corneal abrasions after nonocular surgery. However, no gold standard currently exists for intraoperative ocular protection. More research needs to be conducted on specific prevention strategies and content of educational initiatives in hopes of standard development across facilities nationwide.

Corneal abrasion — treatment and indications for evacuation: Prompt removal of evident corneal foreign body is recommended, and if open globe is suspected or deep corneal epithelial defects are apparent, then evacuation is emergent. Treatment includes topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 hours), cycloplegics (atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours), and frequent artificial tears. Sunglasses may help photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching. Bandage soft contact lenses should be used only when no retained corneal foreign body is present, they are paired with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 hours. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide diagnostic and acute pain relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal epithelial toxicity. Recommendation categories are Topical antibiotics: 1A; Cycloplegics: 1A; NSAIDs: 1A; Artificial tears: 1C; Sunglasses: 1C.

Treatment — corneal pain and ocular surface management: Close eyes and rest until pain eases, cool gently through the closed eyelid, and use oral analgesics such as paracetamol 1 g, four time a day; if available, administer topical lubricant and apply nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eyedrops such as diclofenac 0.1%. Topical anesthetics slow corneal recovery and should not be used outside emergency situations, and topical antibiotics may be considered in severe cases to prevent infection. Cycloplegic eye-drops (cyclopentolate 1%) may relieve pain but impair vision.

Corneal abrasion — field management emphasizes topical therapy, pain control, and avoiding patching, with graded recommendations provided. Corneal abrasions in the wilderness should be treated with topical antibiotics (such as erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 h), cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h), NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 6 h), and frequent use of artificial tears; sunglasses may help reduce photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching, and bandage soft contact lenses should be used only if there is no retained corneal foreign body, they are used with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 h. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide acute relief but prolonged use should be avoided because they are potentially toxic to the corneal epithelium; a recent randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline for uncomplicated abrasions concluded there was no significant difference in corneal healing with an overall patient perception of improved pain control. Recommendation grades include: Topical antibiotics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Artificial tears — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Sunglasses — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Avoidance of patching — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for open globe or deep epithelial defects — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^114T8LpU]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Corneal ulceration, which is easily countered by early diagnosis and treatment in the Western world, is considered a "silent epidemic" in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). The main cause of corneal ulcers varies with geographical locations: in developed countries it is typically associated with contact lens wear while in developing countries, corneal ulcers are often due to injury which primarily afflicts labourers involved in agriculture, manufacturing and domestic sectors.,

There is a growing body of published literature showing that treatment of early-stage corneal abrasions leads to good clinical results. If treatment is delayed, the abrasion can be infected (by bacteria, fungi, or parasites) and lead to corneal ulceration. Once the cornea is ulcerated, it develops corneal opacity that adversely affects vision. Delayed presentation of corneal ulcers can result in extensive damage to corneas with consequent loss of vision or loss of the eye.

Patients in LMIC face significant barriers in accessing eye care and infections are often treated only after severe delays, with unintended consequences. The health infrastructure is often poor or entirely lacking, and patients resort to using homemade remedies or traditional healers, thereby delaying the appropriate treatment, As a result, simple corneal abrasions rapidly progress into corneal infections. The patients affected suffer from pain, red and watery eyes and are therefore unable to work resulting in huge financial implications due to lost livelihood and treatment costs.

The LVPEI model of eye care comprises of a centre of excellence in Hyderabad located at the apex of a treatment pyramid. The next level has three tertiary eye care centres (TCs), each serving a population of 5m people (Figure 1). The third tier has twenty-two secondary centres (SCs) located in towns and smaller cities (within 350 km of a TC) predominantly providing basic surgical and diagnostic care, each serving a population of approximately 500,000 patients. A fourth layer of the pyramid consists of 217 primary vision centres (VCs) managed by a 'vision technician' and these are located in the village clusters, each serving approximately 50,000 people. These VCs are supported by the fifth layer, a network of 'vision guardians' (trained eye care volunteers who monitor the eye health of their community members).

Conclusions

Early treatment of corneal abrasions is crucial in prevention of ulceration and thereby the cascade of the management of the corneal ulcer in patients and the cost borne by them, as proven by both prospective and retrospective analysis as well as scenario modelling. Increasing awareness with campaigns so that patients will act promptly when they develop corneal abrasions by accessing the local healthcare with early treatment, may help in prevention of ulcerations and improve clinical outcome at low cost and will avoid complex and expensive treatment thus preserving sight and reducing corneal blindness.

### Bioactive antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics for corneal wounds and infections [^111PBzwE]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Scope and Significance

Ithat 2.4 million eye injuries occur each year in the United States. According to Prevent Blindness ®, 90% of these ocular injuries are preventable, but lack of compliance in using protective eyewear makes prevention difficult. The most serious sequelae are encountered as a result of deep or penetrating injuries and when wounds fail to heal appropriately. These injuries may result in vision loss from scarring, secondary infection, require therapeutic intervention, and often result in poor outcomes. We propose the use of dual activity peptides as potential therapeutics to fulfill this unmet medical need.

### Evaluation and management of corneal abrasions [^117KxVfQ]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered in primary care. Patients typically present with a history of trauma and symptoms of foreign body sensation, tearing, and sensitivity to light. History and physical examination should exclude serious causes of eye pain, including penetrating injury, infective keratitis, and corneal ulcers. After fluorescein staining of the cornea, an abrasion will appear yellow under normal light and green in cobalt blue light. Physicians should carefully examine for foreign bodies and remove them, if present. The goals of treatment include pain control, prevention of infection, and healing. Pain relief may be achieved with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics. Evidence does not support the use of topical cycloplegics for uncomplicated corneal abrasions. Patching is not recommended because it does not improve pain and has the potential to delay healing. Although evidence is lacking, topical antibiotics are commonly prescribed to prevent bacterial superinfection. Contact lens-related abrasions should be treated with antipseudomonal topical antibiotics. Follow-up may not be necessary for patients with small (4 mm or less), uncomplicated abrasions; normal vision; and resolving symptoms. All other patients should be reevaluated in 24 hours. Referral is indicated for any patient with symptoms that do not improve or that worsen, a corneal infiltrate or ulcer, significant vision loss, or a penetrating eye injury.

### Snowflake-inspired and blink-driven flexible piezoelectric contact lenses for effective corneal injury repair [^112h12dT]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The eye is a natural open window for the interaction between the human and the outside world, and the cornea is the first barrier to defending against external invasion. The ocular surface location makes the cornea susceptible to infection and injury, and corneal injury is a common ophthalmological disease. Mild corneal injuries can be completely self-restituted. In contrast, moderate or severe corneal injuries will cause irreversible damage, among which corneal alkali burn is a leading cause (7.0–9.9%) of visual dysfunction and blindness –. The treatment purpose of corneal injury is not only the physical wound closure, more importantly, the orderly tissue arrangement, clarity recovery, and vision function restoration. The primary clinical therapeutic modalities for corneal injuries include drug therapy, corneal transplantation, and stem cell therapy. Although some drug treatments can reduce stromal inflammation to achieve high corneal clarity, promoting orderly tissue arrangement and avoiding side effects is challenging. Corneal transplantation is an effective method for treating refractory or severely defective corneal diseases. However, despite the high success rate, increasing demands for donor corneas and graft rejection of severe immune responses are the primary reasons for developing alternatives to this procedure. Cell therapy can avoid rejection reactions and promote corneal repair well, but it is still in the preclinical stage and prolongs the treatment cycle. Therefore, how to repair corneal injury conveniently, orderly, and efficiently is a challenge facing clinical medicine.

Corneal Wound Repair

The cornea is an optical surface and requires special treatment to preserve visual acuity during OGI repairs. Any suture on the cornea has the potential to leave scarring and is ideally minimized. Small corneal lacerations may not require sutures. Instead, the cornea is cleaned and dried at the wound, and minimal fibrin or cyanoacrylate glue is applied to seal the wound before application of a bandage contact lens.

If the anterior chamber is shallow and sutures are required, inject viscoelastic through the corneal wound to deepen the anterior chamber, block bleeding, and protect the iris from sutures. Once the anterior chamber is at least partially formed, a standard paracentesis may be safely performed to facilitate further viscoelastic injection. For any corneoscleral wounds, the limbus should be aligned before beginning any corneal repair (Figure 4A), but after paracentesis. Some ophthalmologists opt for full-thickness sutures on the cornea instead of partial-thickness sutures to minimize corneal edema and distortion at the cost of increasing infection risk. Near the limbus, however, sutures should not be full thickness as they can introduce limbal stem cells into the anterior chamber, increasing risk for epithelial downgrowth. Knots increase distortion of the corneal stroma and should be buried away from the visual axis (Figure 5G).

The nature of the wound will dictate suture spacing to initially gain a "visco-tight" and finally a watertight seal. In general, one 10–0 nylon suture can close 1.0–1.5 mm of a linear wound but only 0.5–1.0 mm of a jagged or irregular wound. However, sutures create tension that flattens the corneal surface and create undesirable refractive errors. If sutures near the visual axis are unavoidable, use short, interrupted, and closely spaced sutures (0.5–1.0 mm). Close peripheral cornea with longer shallower passes and the shorter deeper passes in the mid and apical cornea (Figure 4B). Half-circle needles will help to facilitate these short and deep sutures near the visual axis. This approach will promote the healing cornea to maintain a prolate contour. For lacerations across the visual axis, place sutures in a centripetal, symmetric, and alternating order (Figure 4C) as opposed to serial bisecting sutures, which may introduce astigmatism. If sutures in the central visual axis are unavoidable, 11–0 nylon sutures are preferred.

### Regenerative approaches for the cornea [^112fr3VJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that transmits light to the back of the eye to generate vision. Loss of corneal transparency, if irreversible, leads to severe vision loss or blindness. For decades, corneal transplantation using human donor corneas has been the only option for treating corneal blindness. Despite recent improvement in surgical techniques, donor cornea transplantation remains plagued by risks of suboptimal optical results and visual acuity, immune rejection and eventually graft failure. Furthermore, the demand for suitable donor corneas is increasing faster than the number of donors, leaving thousands of curable patients untreated worldwide. Here, we critically review the state of the art of biomaterials for corneal regeneration. However, the lessons learned from the use of the cornea as a disease model will allow for extension of the biomaterials and techniques for regeneration of more complex organs such as the heart.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^111p4NSs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Corneal ulceration is a disease that begins as a simple minor trauma or abrasion but can finally end up with unnecessary and often prolonged physical and financial suffering and is of concern in the population that has limited resources to take care of this problem. Corneal infection in developing nations is estimated to be 10 times more than in developed nations. This being a major and large unmet global health need, WHO has estimated 1.5–2.0 million new cases of unilateral blindness each year worldwide. Despite the high incidence and the poor outcomes, preventative strategies are not common. Whilst use of eye protection during labour is recommended, it is typically not used in India and LMICs, so early diagnosis and treatment is currently the most effective strategy. The underlying objective is to prevent corneal abrasions becoming ulcers, identifying abrasions and initiating appropriate treatment can prevent infection and further referrals to distant higher centres. Also, liberal use of antibiotics is known to cause the rise of anti-microbial resistance and may make future treatment challenging.

With the extensive patient population managed through the LVPEI pyramidal model which has invested in training of village-based eye care workers then the cost is spread across a large patient population. This improves affordability, whereas the costs would be higher in sparsely populated settings or if the incidence of corneal abrasions were lower. In other words, this model of investing in training of low-skilled technical staff distributed to be village based, developed in response to perceived clinical need, is working both clinically and economically.

The LVPEI pyramidal model suggests that patients being treated at the early abrasion stage minimises the costs and achieves good health outcomes. However, delayed treatment, due to some not seeking health care until abrasions become ulcers, results in substantial financial implications with potentially serious health consequences. As the VCs are equipped with teleconsultations facilities, unnecessary travel and loss of income for patients and their families is prevented. The important role played by vision guardians and community health workers with relatively little training is highlighted in this study. They can also play a crucial role to increase awareness among such patients, where the incidence of corneal abrasions in the population is high, other LMICs can follow the LVPEI model and reach out to patients in their local settings.

### Patching for corneal abrasion [^116vTb33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Published audits have demonstrated that corneal abrasions are a common presenting eye complaint. Eye patches are often recommended for treating corneal abrasions despite the lack of evidence for their use. This systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of the eye patch when used to treat corneal abrasions.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of patching for corneal abrasion on healing and pain relief.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2016), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2016), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey) (January 1995 to May 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 May 2016. We also searched the reference lists of included studies, unpublished 'grey' literature and conference proceedings and contacted pharmaceutical companies for details of unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared patching the eye with no patching to treat simple corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Investigators were contacted for further information regarding the quality of trials. The primary outcome was healing at 24, 48 and 72 hours while secondary outcomes included measures of pain, quality of life and adverse effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 trials which randomised a total of 1080 participants in the review. Four trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, another four in the United States of America, two in Canada, one in Brazil and one in Switzerland. Seven trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains and one trial was judged to be low risk of bias in all domains. The rest were a combination of low risk or unclear. People receiving a patch may be less likely to have a healed corneal abrasion after 24 hours compared to those not receiving a patch (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.00, 7 trials, 531 participants, low certainty evidence). Similar numbers of people in the patch and no-patch groups were healed by 48 hours (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02, 6 trials, 497 participants, moderate certainty evidence) and 72 hours (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05, 4 trials, 430 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Participants receiving a patch took slightly longer to heal but the difference was small and probably unimportant (mean difference (MD) 0.14 days longer, 95% CI 0 to 0.27 days longer, 6 trials, 642 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Ten trials reported pain scores. Most studies reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS). It was not possible to pool the data because it was skewed. In general, similar pain ratings were seen between patch and no-patch groups. Data from two trials reporting presence or absence of pain at 24 hours was inconclusive. There was a higher risk of reported pain in the patch group but wide confidence intervals compatible with higher or lower risk of pain (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.65, 2 trials, 193 participants, low certainty evidence). Five trials compared analgesic use between the patch and no-patch groups. Data from three of these trials could be combined and suggested similar analgesic use in the patch and no-patch groups but with some uncertainty (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32, 256 participants, low certainty evidence). Frequently reported symptoms included photophobia, lacrimation, foreign body sensation and blurred vision but there was little evidence to suggest any difference in these symptoms in people with or without a patch. Activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed in one study involving children. There was little difference in ADL with the exception of walking which was reported to be more difficult with a patch on: VAS 1.7 cm (SD 2.1) versus 0.3 cm (SD 0.7). Complication rates were low across studies and there is uncertainty about the relative effects of patching or not patching with respect to these (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 12.05, 8 trials, 660 participants, low certainty evidence). Three trials reporting rates of compliance to treatment found that 22% of participants did not have their eye patches during follow-up. No-patch groups generally received more adjuvant treatment with antibiotics or cycloplegics, or both, than the patch group. There were limited data on the effect of patching on abrasions greater than 10 mm² in size.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials included in this review suggest that treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch may not improve healing or reduce pain. It must be noted that, in these trials, participants who did not receive a patch were more likely to receive additional treatment, for example with antibiotics. Overall we judged the certainty of evidence to be moderate to low. Further research should focus on designing and implementing better quality trials and examining the effectiveness of patching for large abrasions.

### The evaluation and management of corneal penetrating and perforating injuries during long-duration spaceflight [^112qthxo]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic techniques

Medical management

A penetrating corneal injury enters the cornea, but a perforating corneal injury is a through and through injury with an entrance and exit wound. Crews without a medical doctor will assign a designated medical officer, who undergoes 40 h of paramedic-level training (e.g. administering injections, suturing wounds, eye-washing protocols). In the event of a severe penetrating corneal injury, crewmembers are advised not to disturb the offending object or put any pressure on the globe from rubbing or patching. Rather, they should gently apply a rigid eye shield over the injured eye to avoid accidental contact. It is crucial to obtain a detailed history of precisely how the injury occurred as this may help to determine the degree of injury severity (e.g. Was the injury caused by a high velocity particle originating from a burst mechanism or from floating debris in the cabin?). The trained crew on the ISS can utilize magnified external ocular photography, the onboard portable ocular ultrasound, and Heidelberg Spectralis OCT2 imaging of the anterior and posterior segment to accurately detect the presence, location, and composition of intraocular foreign bodies with high sensitivity and specificity. Remote guidance is available by the crew flight surgeon and subject matter experts at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop a diagnosis and implement vision-saving interventions.

Depending on severity of penetration, microsurgical repair and systemic antibiotics may be indicated. The ISS is equipped with a comprehensive array of medications, comparable to those used in terrestrial management of corneal perforations, capable of minimizing the risk of infection and offering therapeutic relief. Topical anaesthetics (e.g. tetracaine (0.5%, 15 mL)), cycloplegic drops (e.g. cyclopentolate (Cyclogyl) 2%, 15 mL; tropicamide (Mydriacyl) 1%, 15 mL), and anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents (e.g. ketorolac (Toradol) 30 mg/mL, 2 mL; acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325 mg; Aspirin 325 mg; Ibuprofen (Motrin) 400 mg) may provide relief during the painful ocular injury.

### The evaluation and management of corneal penetrating and perforating injuries during long-duration spaceflight [^114beHjy]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors

Corneal penetrating and perforating injuries can result from traumatic impact or conditions that cause corneal melting (e.g. microbial keratitis). Severe or poorly managed corneal abrasions, ulcers, and thermal burns are subject to infections that can progress to corneal perforations. In the setting of microgravity, airborne particulates remain suspended (rather than falling to the floor on Earth) and can enter crewmembers' eyes. With NASA's aim to return to the Moon and to travel to Mars, celestial debris will be an additional risk to ocular health. Lunar and Martian windstorms increase the likelihood of higher-velocity particles causing severe penetrating corneal injuries. Recent literature has described 70 corneal abrasions, 6 chemical burns and 5 ocular infections in a review of NASA Space Shuttle and ISS missions. These were superficial corneal injuries that were successfully treated with topical antibiotics. In contrast, future longer-duration crewed missions to Mars and beyond might require more innovative and novel technology-driven platforms to address the risks for corneal perforation. We review the literature and propose potential countermeasures to prepare for such contingencies for future long term space exploration.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128Sczb]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions, loss of the corneal epithelium, can occur from trauma, ocular surgery, dryness, and exposure. They account for 13% of eye-related emergency department visits in the US, with an annual incidence of 3 per 1000 persons and a higher male prevalence –. Traumatic abrasions present with symptoms like pain, photophobia, redness, and tearing. As the cornea is one of the most highly innervated tissues in the body, corneal nociceptors, especially mechanoreceptors, contribute to intense eye pain until healing occurs. Although most small to medium-sized corneal abrasions heal within a few days, complications like corneal erosions and infection may require medical or surgical intervention. In contrast, post-surgical corneal epithelial defects benefit from a sterile field and controlled wound construction.

In medicine, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anesthetic drugs are used for localized analgesia with limited systemic effects. However, numerous case reports describe ophthalmic complications from use of high concentrations of topical anesthetics, at excessive frequency, or for prolonged periods of time, including corneal infiltrate, stromal keratolysis ("melt"), endothelial injury, and perforation – – all of which can lead to vision loss. Recent emergency department studies have deemed outpatient use of prescribed topical anesthetics as safe and effective for corneal abrasions –. This assessment contrasts with the experience of ophthalmologists –, leading to renewed questions about outpatient anesthetic use. The lack of consensus guidelines may account for variations in practice within and across specialties –.

The main objective of this summary of our Cochrane systematic review is to report the comparative effectiveness and safety of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions of any etiology, based on the best available evidence. The published review protocol served as registration (Available at: 10.1002/14651858.CD015091).

In nine eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) describing 556 participants with corneal abrasions from traumatic or surgical origin, we find insufficient evidence to support outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics compared with placebo for reducing pain, improving re-epithelialization, or reducing complication risk in corneal abrasions.

### Corneal wound healing after laser vision correction [^114oFsib]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Any trauma can trigger a cascade of responses in tissues, with the purpose of safeguarding the integrity of the organ affected by the trauma and of preventing possible damage to nearby organs. Subsequently, the body tries to restore the function of the organ affected. The introduction of the excimer laser for keratorefractive surgery has changed the treatment landscape for correcting refractive errors, such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. In recent years, with the increased understanding of the basic science of refractive errors, higher-order aberrations, biomechanics, and the biology of corneal wound healing, a reduction in the surgical complications of keratorefractive surgery has been achieved. The understanding of the cascade of events involved in the corneal wound healing process and the examination of how corneal wound healing influences corneal biomechanics and optics are crucial to improving the efficacy and safety of laser vision correction.

### Management of corneal bee sting [^111pwey2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Corneal bee sting is an uncommon environmental eye injury that can result in various ocular complications with an etiology of penetrating, immunologic, and toxic effects of the stinger and its injected venom. In this study we present our experience in the management of a middle-aged male with a right-sided deep corneal bee sting. On arrival, the patient was complaining of severe pain, blurry vision with acuity of 160/200, and tearing, which he had experienced soon after the injury. Firstly, we administered conventional drugs for eye injuries, including topical antibiotic, corticosteroid, and cycloplegic agents. After 2 days, corneal stromal infiltration and edema developed around the site of the sting, and visual acuity decreased to 100/200. These conditions led us to remove the stinger surgically. Within 25 days of follow-up, the corneal infiltration decreased gradually, and visual acuity improved to 180/200. We suggest a two-stage management approach for cases of corneal sting. For the first stage, if the stinger is readily accessible or primary dramatic reactions, including infiltration, especially on the visual axis, exist, manual or surgical removal would be indicated. Otherwise, we recommend conventional treatments for eye injuries. Given this situation, patients should be closely monitored for detection of any worsening. If the condition does not resolve or even deteriorates, for the second stage, surgical removal of the stinger under local or generalized anesthesia is indicated.

### Iatrogenic corneal diseases or conditions [^111spTvL]. Experimental Eye Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Any prescribed or self-administered therapy carries inherent risks of secondary adverse events. While the volume of treatments being administered through healthcare systems has been increasing, scientific advancements in our understanding of the mechanisms of pharmaceutical side effects and complications from procedures now allow us to reduce the risk of non-intentional damage to ocular health. This review summarizes the most common and leading causes of iatrogenic visual impairment, corneal diseases, and conditions that present in a general ophthalmologic practice, including a comprehensive analysis of their pathophysiology and recommendations for management and prophylaxis. Iatrogenic corneal diseases and conditions can arise from topical drugs, contact lens use, eye surgeries and procedures, systemic drugs, non-ophthalmological events, and cosmetic procedures. Topical and systemic drugs may disturb tear film homeostasis or result in ocular surface deposits. The use of ill-fitted contact lenses can trigger eye discomfort and poor hygiene conditions that can predispose to severe infections. Procedures to the eye may result in a variety of anatomical and functional complications that ophthalmologists should be aware of how to avoid or at least be prepared to manage if they occur. Even non-ophthalmological events such as non-invasive ventilation, radiation therapies and, immune-based conditions, or cosmetic procedures such as eyelash growth and fillers, can result in unwanted damage to the ocular surface.

### Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for corneal abrasions: meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112U9GCf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in traumatic corneal abrasions.

Methods

This was a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966–2004), EMBASE (1980–2004), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews (first quarter 2004). The structured search strategy included a RCT filter and the terms "cornea", "wounds and injuries", "trauma", "corneal diseases", "eye injuries", "anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal" and specific trade names of topical NSAIDs. In addition, four journals in ophthalmology and emergency medicine were hand searched. Two authors independently reviewed citations from the literature searches. To be included, studies had to be RCTs evaluating topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. Trials were included regardless of language or whether they were unpublished or published. Exclusion criteria were corneal ulcers, nonrandomized studies, animal studies, or perioperative setting. Outcomes were pain scale scores at 24 hours and adverse effects. Two independent reviewers assessed four trial quality components: randomization, double blinding, reporting of withdrawals, and concealment of allocation. Weighted mean difference, using a random effects model, was calculated.

Results

Of the 200 citations identified, 11 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Eight trials were identified from the MEDLINE search, two from the EMBASE search, and one from conference proceedings. Seven trials enrolled fewer than 100 patients, and more than half of the studies were conducted in Europe. Five trials reported suitable data for analysis. The overall weighted mean difference for 459 patients was a reduction in pain by 1.30 points (95% confidence interval = -1.56 to -1.03) on the pain scale. Five of the trials met criteria for good quality. Transient stinging was a commonly noted adverse effect.

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs are effective analgesics for traumatic corneal abrasions.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^116p12Mb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most common ocular injuries in the perioperative period, occurring at an incidence typically between 0.013% and 0.17% of non-ocular surgeries.–Although most are minor and involve only the surface epithelium, they still produce considerable discomfort. Generally, symptoms of CA are recognized between 1 hour and 3 hours following the conclusion of anesthesia, at which point an ophthalmologist is consulted to care for the injury. At community hospitals where ophthalmologists are not readily available, patients have to wait before receiving treatment. Undoubtedly, this prolonged waiting period may lead to unnecessary suffering and dissatisfaction.

For most patients, a combination of eye drops is the most effective method for healing CAs. Given this regimen's simplicity, requiring that patients wait to see a specialist for the care of CAs seems especially unnecessary. Hence, to lessen the time between symptom onset and treatment – and in turn patient suffering and dissatisfaction – an anesthesiology-based protocol for the management of minor CAs identified in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) was developed with input from ophthalmology (Figure 1). This protocol became the standard approach at our institution. The current study sought to assess the effectiveness of this anesthesiology-based protocol, as well as clarify the incidence of CA and examine some of its associated risk factors.

### Management of corneal abrasions [^115N6v4o]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Corneal abrasions result from cutting, scratching, or abrading the thin, protective, clear coat of the exposed anterior portion of the ocular epithelium. These injuries cause pain, tearing, photophobia, foreign body sensation, and a gritty feeling. Symptoms can be worsened by exposure to light, blinking, and rubbing the injured surface against the inside of the eyelid. Visualizing the cornea under cobalt-blue filtered light after the application of fluorescein can confirm the diagnosis. Most corneal abrasions heal in 24 to 72 hours and rarely progress to corneal erosion or infection. Although eye patching traditionally has been recommended in the treatment of corneal abrasions, multiple well-designed studies show that patching does not help and may hinder healing. Topical mydriatics also are not beneficial. Initial treatment should be symptomatic, consisting of foreign body removal and analgesia with topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral analgesics; topical antibiotics also may be used. Corneal abrasions can be avoided through the use of protective eyewear.

Patient education — corneal edema and opacification care should include providing an understanding of balanced expectations for what visual function can realistically be preserved or recovered and the risk of complications. A detailed discussion of the causes of edema or opacity and treatment options is important, and when the disease process or management is complex every effort should be made to counsel the patient to support appropriate expectations and informed decision-making.

Chemical eye injuries — case patterns, potential complications, and treatment stance are summarized with emphasis on cobra venom exposures. Chemical eye injuries in the wilderness are limited to case reports and case series, with the largest collection related to the spitting cobra (genus Naja), primarily found in Africa; other reports include skunk muskling, jellyfish stings, and exploding or spraying of cooking gases. The spitting cobra can eject its venom several meters into the eyes, causing severe chemosis, blepharitis, and corneal irritation, with opacification and neovascularization (the "corneal opacification syndrome") that often leads to blindness and is most often associated with the black cobra (Naja nigricollis). There is some evidence from rabbit studies that tetracycline drops and systemic heparin have a protective effect against corneal opacification syndrome, and currently there is no indication for topical or intravenous antivenom administration following an eye exposure to cobra venom. Overall, prevention of chemical injuries is the most important tenet in this category, as treatment in the wilderness is largely supportive for such injuries.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qSei8]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection and risk of bias

Authors independently extracted the following data from included studies: trial characteristics, methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, and source of funding. Two review authors independently applied the Cochrane's Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2) toolto assess risk of bias in the efficacy outcome (pain control by 48 h) and the safety outcome (complications at the longest follow-up time). We judged each study that reported either outcome to have been at "low risk", "high risk" or raising some concerns for risk of bias. An overall Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment of the certainty level of evidence was performed based on four main criteria: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. We judged the certainty of evidence to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low" for the review outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by discussion within the author team.

Data analysis and synthesis

For the continuous outcome of pain assessment, we estimated the mean difference i (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous outcomes, we estimated the risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. We estimated the risk difference (RD) with 95% CI for trials reporting no events in either treatment group.

To determine whether results could be combined in meta-analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and methodological heterogeneity in trial design, eligibility of trial participants, intervention and comparator differences, and outcome definitions. We evaluated the amount of statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic outlined in the Cochrane Handbook.

Institutional review board approval was not required for this systematic review.

### Emergency management of corneal injuries [^116V2brL]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Corneal injuries account for a significant proportion of the ophthalmic workload of most emergency departments. Although the vast majority of cases are relatively minor, accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are vital to prevent potentially sight-threatening sequelae. We present a survey of corneal injury cases at a general emergency department.

Introduction

Corneal injuries are very common in both the adult and paediatric population and account for a significant proportion of the workload of most emergency departments. This survey assesses management of corneal injury cases at a general emergency department.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective case study was performed of 100 patients consecutively diagnosed with a corneal abrasion by slit lamp examination at the emergency department of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. Each case was assessed to determine documentation of set criteria including visual acuity (VA), treatment and grade of examiner.

Results

The commonest cause of injury was direct minor trauma (64% of cases) with contact lens related problems accounting for 12% of presentations. VA was documented correctly in 85 adult patients (90.4% of adults), incorrectly in 2 cases, and not documented at all in 7 adults (7.4%). VA was not recorded in paediatric cases. All cases were treated with topical chloramphenicol drops although frequency of treatment ranged from 2 to 5 times daily and duration of treatment ranged between 3 and 5 days and for 7 days. 6 cases (6%) were assessed by an emergency nurse practitioner and the remaining number were seen by a casualty officer.

Discussion

VA must be accurately documented in all adult cases and should be documented in children of school age. A pinhole test should be performed in cases where VA is below 6/9. For analgesia, the use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lubricants and bandage contact lens should be considered. Emergency nurse practitioners and general practitioners are ideally placed to follow-up uncomplicated cases.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion [^115hFczy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corneal abrasion is a common disorder frequently faced by ophthalmologists, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Ocular antibiotics are one of the management options for corneal abrasion. A comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis in traumatic corneal abrasion is thus far unavailable, therefore we conducted this review to evaluate the current evidence regarding this important issue.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of topical antibiotic prophylaxis following corneal abrasion. Our objectives were 1) to investigate the incidence of infection with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion; and 2) to investigate time to clinical cure, defined as complete healing (re-epithelialization) of the epithelium, with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic with another antibiotic or placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion due to any cause.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

Our search of the electronic databases yielded 8661 records. We screened 7690 titles and abstracts after removal of duplicates. We retrieved 32 full-text reports for further review. We included two studies that randomized a total of 527 eyes of 527 participants in the review. One study was conducted in Denmark, and one was conducted in India. The two studies did not examine most of our prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. The first study was a parallel-group RCT comparing chloramphenicol ocular ointment with fusidic acid ocular gels (frequency was not clearly reported). This study enrolled 153 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion in Denmark with a one-day follow-up duration. No participants had secondary infection in the fusidic acid group, whereas three (4.1%) participants in the chloramphenicol group had a slight reaction (risk ratio [RR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 2.79; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-one (44.3%) participants in the fusidic acid arm and 34 (46.6%) participants in the chloramphenicol arm were cured (defined as the area of abrasion zero and no infection) at day 1 (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Without providing specific data, the study reported that the degree of pain was not affected by the interventions received. The most common adverse events reported were itching and discomfort of the eye, which occurred in approximately one-third of participants in each group (low certainty evidence). A second multicenter, two-arm RCT conducted in India enrolled 374 participants older than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion who presented within 48 hours after injury. This study investigated the effect of a three-day course of either ocular ointment combinations of chloramphenicol-clotrimazole or chloramphenicol-placebo (all three times daily). At day 3, 169 (100%) participants in the chloramphenicol-clotrimazole arm and 203 (99%) out of 205 participants in the chloramphenicol-placebo arm were cured without any complication, defined as complete epithelialization of the cornea without evidence of infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; 374 participants; very low certainty evidence). Four participants assigned to the chloramphenicol-placebo arm experienced mild adverse events: two participants (1%) had mild chemosis and irritation, and two (1%) had small single sterile corneal infiltrates (low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low to very low certainty of the available evidence, any beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or accelerating epithelial healing following a corneal abrasion remain unclear. Moreover, the current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen being superior to another. There is a need for a well-designed RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of ocular antibiotics in the treatment of corneal abrasion with a particular focus on high-risk populations and formulation of interventions.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine. update: do ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the pain associated with simple corneal abrasion without delaying healing? [^116zYjxq]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some studies have suggested that ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decrease the pain associated with corneal abrasions without impairing healing. This evidence-based emergency medicine (EBEM) critical appraisal reviews the literature, including additional studies appearing since the publication of an earlier EBEM review in 1999.

Methods

The updated search for randomized controlled trials from 1999 to 2002 complemented the previous 1966 to 1999 search. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. Qualitative methods were used to summarize the study results.

Results

The search identified 3 studies not included in the previously published review of ophthalmic NSAIDs, yielding a total of 5 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving NSAIDs for corneal abrasions. The methodologic quality of the new studies was somewhat higher than that of the 2 original studies and was rated as "good" to "strong". The qualitative summary indicates that NSAIDs provide greater pain relief and improvement of other subjective symptoms when compared with placebo. However, whether the reduction of pain, as measured by visual analog pain scales, exceeds the minimal clinically significant difference is equivocal. The use of ophthalmic NSAIDs may decrease the need for sedating analgesics.

Conclusion

Ophthalmic NSAIDs appear to be useful for decreasing pain in patients with corneal abrasions who can afford the medication and who must return to work immediately, particularly where potential opioid-induced sedation is intolerable.

### Bioactive antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics for corneal wounds and infections [^112Jk11C]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Current therapies for ocular injuries

For 6% of military members who sustained ocular injuries in the Global War on Terrorand Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom, the ocular protection available was insufficient to prevent ocular injuries. Most ocular injuries are the result of direct face blast injury, projectiles, explosive devices, lasers, chemicals, and environmental or biological hazards that may lead to long-term vision loss. Fifteen to twenty percent of military patients with facial burns also experience ocular injuries. Through June 2006, up to 13% of the United States military wounded in battle had ocular injuries with 19% of evacuations to Echelon III level combat support hospital in Iraq and Afghanistan due to ocular injury. For military members and civilians alike, these ocular injuries regardless of the cause can lead to permanent vision loss. Immediate treatments of ocular injuries are still rudimentary and involve the topical administration of prophylactic antibiotics and administration of anesthetics or steroids, which can complicate or delay wound healing. In cases of severe ocular infection, including corneal ulcers and bacterial keratitis, current treatments may include antibiotic drops as frequently as every 5 min for the first five doses followed by a drop every 30 min for 6 h. After the first 6 h of the treatment, the dose is decreased and drops are administered hourly. For the nearly 1 million individuals seeking treatments for ocular infections annually in the United States, this type of treatment regimen can be impractical, making patient compliance problematic. For the 71% of soldiers who experience injuries to their extremities, eye drops can be a challenge to administer. In the civilian population alone, ocular chemical burns represent up to 84% of ocular trauma emergency room visits. Chemical burns are treated initially by flushing the eye with at least 1 L of a saline solution and repeatedly testing the pH of the eye. The initial diagnosis of wounds usually involves visualizing sodium fluorescein dye, which binds to the corneal defect or injury and fluoresces bright yellow-green under cobalt blue light, from a slit lamp if one is available. In the case of chemical burns, the sodium fluorescein may not immediately stain the wound nor give an indication of wound depth. In such cases, the first line of treatment is to irrigate the wound with sterile saline or another appropriate ophthalmic solution such as Ringer's lactate. If the cornea is damaged by a foreign body, which account for 35% of the total eye injuries in civilians each year, it may be difficult to determine whether the cornea is perforated. In military members, diagnosis in the field may be especially difficult without the aid of a slit lamp. Furthermore, foreign bodies can leave rust marks in the cornea. It is important that rust marks be removed by an ophthalmologist within days of the injury followed by the administration of antibiotics until the defect has healed. In the case of the war fighter, an experienced ophthalmologist may not always be available. Therefore, the addition of therapeutics to effectively and prophylactically combat infection and minimize ocular damage before perforation occurs is essential.

### Topical hepatocyte growth factor accelerates wound healing and inhibits scarring in experimental corneal injury [^114k1aY3]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Following injury to the cornea, timely wound closure is critical considering the potential risk of infection and stromal opacification. While mice typically heal superficial corneal ulcers/erosions within 48 hours, the depth and extent of the injury can significantly affect the healing process. In our study, we created a deeper injury extending approximately one-third to one-half of the corneal stroma rather than a superficial injury, which contributed to the delayed wound healing observed in PBS-treated eyes. In phase I of our study, where the focus was wound closure and prevention of scar formation, we found that topical treatment of injured mice corneas with mHGF was superior to both mNGF and PBS in terms of wound closure. Eyes treated with mHGF showed faster healing, observable as early as day 3 after injury, with a significantly higher proportion of eyes achieving complete healing by day 4 compared with those treated with mNGF or PBS. By day 7 after injury (termination of phase I), an estimated 88% of eyes treated with mHGF continued to show complete healing compared with that in 60% and 50% of eyes treated with mNGF and PBS, respectively. The slightly lower healing rate with mNGF compared with PBS on day 4 after injury was unexpected given NGF's role in promoting corneal wound healing. However, this trend reversed by day 5, where mNGF treatment showed better healing than PBS treatment. When the potential of mHGF to reduce scar formation following injury was assessed, we found that eyes treated with mHGF showed a near-complete inhibition of scar formation on day 7 after injury compared with both mNGF and PBS treatment. The capacity of mHGF to suppress scar formation may be explained by its ability to promote myofibroblast apoptosis by enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix.

### The utilization of an ocular wound chamber on corneal epithelial wounds [^113ANvsz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Between 7.5% and 27% of patients with facial burns experience some ocular trauma secondary to the initial burn injury such as exposure keratopathy or subsequent infection. Exposure keratopathy, which has been observed in up to 60% of ICU patients, occurs when the ocular surface is exposed to the environment for an extended length of time such as when the eyelids are damaged and unable to close or provide adequate ocular coverage. This exposure may subsequently lead to corneal epithelial damage or PCEDs, defects that fail to heal over a 2-week period. If PCEDs are not effectively treated, corneal ulceration, scarring, and, in more severe cases, partial or complete vision loss can occur. In the presence of even minor defects, intensive treatment including the administration of hourly drops should be initiated. As ophthalmic drops rapidly dissipate after administration, therapies that involve the frequent administration of drops require a high burden of care and patient compliance. Other therapeutic options for patients suffering from exposure keratopathy include bandage or scleral contact lensesand the use of more invasive surgical interventions which are amniotic membrane grafting, or tarsorrhaphy. Current therapies tend to be ineffective thereby prolonging healing time and a patient's impaired visual acuity. Due to the challenges encountered in treating these patients, clinicians require more effective treatment modalities for the management of persistent corneal epithelial defects.

The cornea is comprised of five well-characterized layers from the anterior to the posterior region, respectively: epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descement's membrane, and endothelium. As the outermost layer of the cornea, the epithelium provides an important protective barrier to the rest of the eye against noxious environmental stimuli and inflammatory mediators in the tear film. Furthermore, a smooth epithelial surface is essential for proper light refraction and consequently, proper vision. If the corneal epithelium is compromised, not only is visual acuity impacted, but the cornea is also susceptible to infection. Therefore, increasing the rate of re-epithelialization can decrease the likelihood that patients will develop an ocular infection or other complications such as corneal melting. To this end, ocular therapies often seek to enhance corneal epithelial wound closure by modulating cellular proliferation, migration, and adhesion. As a result of the need for therapies to treat these defects and provide protection to the eye, we have begun exploring therapies to address the clinical challenges associated with treating patients suffering from epithelial defects and/or keratitis infections secondary to corneal trauma. We aim to explore novel ophthalmic treatment modalities to meet the needs of both clinicians and patients.

### Topical ophthalmic anesthetics for corneal abrasions: findings from a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yiuCv]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite potential benefit, outpatient use of topical ophthalmic anesthetics can result in poor healing, infection, scar, and blindness. An unbiased analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is needed to examine their effectiveness and safety compared with placebo or other treatments for corneal abrasions.

Methods

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase.com, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched on February 10, 2023, without restriction on language or publication date. The published review protocol served as registration.

Results

Systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs describing 314 participants with post-traumatic abrasions and 242 participants with post-surgical abrasions, with a median study length of 7 days (interquartile range, 7–14), show no evidence of a difference in pain control between anesthetics and placebo at 24 h in post-trauma cases. Self-reported pain at 24 h is reduced with anesthetics plus topical nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug in post-surgical participants (mean difference [MD], −5.72 on a 10-point scale; 95% CI, −7.35 to −4.09; 1 RCT; 30 participants) and at 48 h with anesthetics alone in post-trauma participants (MD, −5.68; 95% CI, −6.38 to −4.98; 1 RCT; 111 participants). Anesthetics are associated with 37% increased risk of non-healing defects (risk ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78 to 2.42; 3 RCTs; 221 post-trauma participants). All evidence is of very low certainty. Over 50% of trials have an overall high risk of bias.

Conclusions

Available evidence is insufficient to support outpatient use of topical anesthetics for corneal abrasions with respect to pain, re-epithelialization, and complication risk.

### Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia in traumatic corneal abrasions [^117Jxk2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic corneal abrasions are relatively common and there is a lack of consensus about analgesia in their management. It is therefore important to document the clinical efficacy and safety profile of topical ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the management of traumatic corneal abrasions.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of topical NSAIDs with placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions (including corneal abrasions arising from foreign body removal), to reduce pain, and its effects on healing time.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 30 March 2017), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 30 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/); searched 30 March 2017, ZETOC (1993 to 30 March 2017), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch); searched 30 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov); searched 30 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en); searched 30 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We checked the reference lists of identified trials to search for further potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing topical NSAIDs to placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed risks of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria, reporting data on 637 participants. The studies took place in the UK, USA, Israel, Italy, France and Portugal. These studies compared five types of topical NSAIDs (0.1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, 1% indomethacin, 0.1% diclofenac) to control (consisting of standard care and in four studies used placebo eye drops). Overall, the studies were at an unclear or high risk of bias (particularly selection and reporting bias). None of the included studies reported the primary outcome measures of this review, namely participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours. Four trials, that included data on 481 participants receiving NSAIDs or control (placebo/standard care), reported on the use of 'rescue' analgesia at 24 hours as a proxy measure of pain control. Topical NSAIDs were associated with a reduction in the need for oral analgesia compared with control (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.61; low-certainty evidence). Approximately 4 out of 10 people in the control group used rescue analgesia at 24 hours. No data were available on the use of analgesia at 48 or 72 hours. One trial (28 participants) reported on the proportion of abrasions healed after 24 and 48 hours. These outcomes were similar in both arms of the trial. (at 24 hours RR 1.00 (0.81 to 1.23); at 48 hours RR 1.00 (0.88 to 1.14); low-certainty evidence). In the control group nine out of 10 abrasions were healed within 24 hours and all were healed by 48 hours. Complications of corneal abrasions were reported in 6 studies (609 participants) and were infrequently reported (4 complications, 1 in NSAID groups (recurrent corneal erosion) and 3 in control groups (2 recurrent corneal erosions and 1 corneal abscess), very low-certainty evidence). Possible drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in two trials (163 participants), with the number of adverse events low (4 AEs, 3 in NSAID group, including discomfort/photophobia on instillation, conjunctival hyperaemia and urticaria, and 1 in the control group, corneal abscess) very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of the included studies do not provide strong evidence to support the use of topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. This is important, since NSAIDs are associated with a higher cost compared to oral analgesics. None of the trials addressed our primary outcome measure of participant-reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours.

Key messages

There is debate over the best empirical treatment for bacterial keratitis, and there are regional variations in practice patterns of corneal specialists.
This survey demonstrates that practice patterns are influenced by concern over availability and toxicity versus broad spectrum coverage and resistance. Overall, respondents in the USA were more likely to treat with fortified antibiotics than their international peers.
A well-designed clinical trial on the treatment of bacterial ulcers is needed to help clinicians initiate the best treatment and ultimately reduce morbidity.

### Early treatment of corneal abrasions and ulcers-estimating clinical and economic outcomes [^113zw9Rs]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Background

In low-and-middle income countries, corneal abrasions and ulcers are common and not always well managed. Previous studies showed better clinical outcomes with early presentation and treatment of minor abrasions, however, there have been no formal studies estimating the financial impact of early treatment of abrasions and ulcers compared to delayed treatment.

Methods

We used the LV Prasad Eye Institute's (LVPEI's) electronic health record system (eyeSmart) to estimate the impact of early presentation on clinical outcomes associated with abrasions and ulcers. 861 patients with corneal abrasion and 1821 patients with corneal ulcers were studied retrospectively, and 134 patients with corneal abrasion prospectively. A health economic model was constructed based on LVPEI cost data for a range of patient scenarios (from early presentation with abrasion to late presentation with ulcer).

Findings

Our findings suggest that delayed presentation of corneal abrasion results in poor clinical and economic outcomes due to increased risk of ulceration requiring more extensive surgical management, increasing associated costs to patients and the healthcare system. However, excellent results at low cost can be achieved by treatment of patients with early presentation of abrasions at village level health care centres.

Interpretation

Treatment of early minor corneal abrasions, particularly using local delivery of treatment, is effective clinically and economically. Future investment in making patients aware of the need to react promptly to corneal abrasions by accessing local healthcare resources (coupled with a campaign to prevent ulcerations occurring) will continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients at low cost and avoid complex and more expensive treatment to preserve sight.

### Use of topical anesthetics in the management of patients with simple corneal abrasions: consensus guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians [^112vBqST]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of corneal abrasions has largely excluded dispensing topical local anesthetics for home use due to concern for corneal toxicity. We have reviewed and critically appraised the available literature evidence regarding the use of topical anesthetics in patients with simple corneal abrasions. Using sequential Delphi review, we have developed these clinical guidelines. Herein are evidentiary summaries and consensus recommendations for 8 specific relevant questions. Our key observation is that for only simple corneal abrasions, as diagnosed and treated in accordance with the full protocol described herein, it appears safe to prescribe or otherwise provide a commercial topical anesthetic (ie, proparacaine, tetracaine, oxybuprocaine) for use up to every 30 minutes as needed during the first 24 hours after presentation, as long as no more than 1.5 to 2 mL total (an expected 24-hour supply) is dispensed and any remainder is discarded after 24 hours. Importantly, although published findings suggest absent harm for short courses, more rigorous studies with a greater cumulative sample size and ophthalmologic follow-up are needed.

This study outlines the clinical features and comprehensive management of three cases of corneal injury by a bee sting. The stinger removal was attempted, and in two cases, the stinger was successfully removed. In one case, a portion of the stinger broke and was left in situ without inciting any further inflammation. In all the cases, the surrounding infiltrate was scraped, and after microbiological evaluation was found to be negative, topical corticosteroids were started. The management of corneal bee sting injuries should include appropriate surgical intervention along with the judicious use of corticosteroids after infective pathology has been excluded.

### Cochrane corner: topical anaesthetics for pain control following corneal abrasions [^113vgZfN]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Traumatic corneal abrasions, causing a disruption of superficial corneal epithelial integrity, are a common presentation in both general and ophthalmic emergency departments. Corneal epithelial defects can also occur following commonly performed ophthalmic surgical procedures, such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), alcohol delamination and corneal cross-linking. The high density of nociceptors in the cornea means that corneal abrasions are associated with significant pain, which is most intense at initial presentation and during the subsequent 24 to 48 h. The current NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary on corneal superficial injury, providing an evidence-based clinical guideline for UK primary care professionals, recommends simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol, with the addition of lubricating eye drops or ointment for additional pain relief. Whilst established dogma within ophthalmology advocates that topical anaesthetics should not be prescribed for corneal-abrasion-related pain due to safety concerns and the potential for abuse, this view has recently been challenged by emergency physicians. By contrast, surveys of eyecare professionals conducted in the USA reported almost universal opposition to this practice. The publication of the Cochrane Review by Sulewski et al. on 'Topical ophthalmic anaesthetics for corneal abrasions' is, therefore, very timely.

The review, which included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting 556 adult participants investigated the effectiveness and safety of self-administered topical anaesthetics for the relief of pain compared to a non-anaesthetic control group (placebo or other treatment). Four RCTs (314 participants) analysed individuals with traumatic abrasions presenting in an emergency department setting and five trials (242 participants) investigated post-surgical epithelial defects. Participants were supplied with one of the commonly used topical ophthalmic anaesthetics, specifically, tetracaine (used in 5 RCTs), proparacaine (3 trials) or lidocaine (1 RCT). Adjunctive oral analgesia was also used in all but one study, either using a designated dosing regime or 'as required'. Pain intensity was evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS) or numerical scales, where higher scores represented higher pain intensities. The effect of treatment on epithelial healing rates was also evaluated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and the proportion of participants with adverse events was reported at the longest follow up time.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^112HZuKa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

CAs occurring perioperatively can arise from multiple factors, including trauma, chemical injury, and corneal edema. Although there is still debate on the frequency with which patients develop CAs, the American Society of Anesthesiologists closed-claims analysis found that CA was the most common ocular injury, accounting for 35% of all such injuries. At our hospital, the overall incidence of CA over the study period was 0.13%, which falls within the range of that observed in other studies.–Year-to-year incidence over the study period was fairly constant, ranging from 0.12% to 0.15%.

In addition to evaluating the efficacy of an anesthesiology-led protocol for managing perioperative CAs and determining their incidence at our hospital, our study sought to further explore the risk factors associated with these injuries. Consistent with previous studies, we confirmed corneal injury to be associated with advanced age and longer surgeries.

Limitations and future studies

Despite collecting the data on CAs in a prospective fashion, this study is observational and faces all of the same limitations associated with a retrospective design. Consequently, findings from this study do not have the strength of those resulting from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and certain data – such as the specific treatment prescribed and the time to treatment – were unavailable for a handful of patients. Furthermore, the study's retrospective design did not allow for certain data to be readily examined, such as the exact time patients exhibited symptoms of CA. To more accurately determine the time between symptom onset and treatment initiation under an anesthesiology-led protocol for the management of CAs, future studies could document the time patients complain of eye pain prospectively. Having patient complaint serve as the primary mechanism by which perioperative CAs are identified can in itself be somewhat of a limitation, as those patients who do indeed develop CAs but do not experience acute pain in the recovery room will have their treatment delayed. Additionally, because this study was conducted only at one institution without an ophthalmologist readily available, some of its findings may not be generalizable to other sites. Finally, despite the fact that our database included over 90,000 patients, the number of CAs recorded was too small to perform more complex etiology-based analysis.

### Perfluorodecalin-based oxygenated emulsion as a topical treatment for chemical burn to the eye [^1142Lqgp]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Chemical injuries to the eye are emergencies with limited acute treatment options other than prompt irrigation and can cause permanent vision loss. We developed a perfluorodecalin-based supersaturated oxygen emulsion (SSOE) to topically deliver high concentration of oxygen to the eye. SSOE is manufactured in hyperbaric conditions and stored in a ready-to-use canister. Upon dispensation, SSOE rapidly raises partial oxygen pressure 3 times over atmospheric level. SSOE is biocompatible with human corneal cells and safe on mouse eyes in vivo. A single topical application of SSOE to the eye after alkali injury significantly promotes corneal epithelial wound healing, decreases anterior chamber exudation, and reduces optical opacity and cataract formation in mice. SSOE treatment reduces intraocular hypoxia, cell death, leukocyte infiltration, production of inflammatory mediators, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha signaling, thus hastening recovery of normal tissue integrity during the wound healing process. Here, we show that SSOE is an effective topical therapeutic in the acute treatment of ocular chemical injuries.

### Surgical rehabilitation following severe ocular burns [^1164rCrn]. Eye (2009). Low credibility.

Chemical and thermal burns can cause devastating injuries to the anterior segment. The consequences of alkali injuries are notoriously severe due to the rapid penetration of these agents into the ocular tissues. Denaturation of tissue, inflammation, and scarring leads to loss of function. An understanding of the pathogenesis of tissue damage has lead to a rational approach to treatment. Emergency irrigation of the eye is essential and there is a 'window of opportunity' during the first 7–10 days after injury when medical treatment can significantly limit the potentially blinding consequences. The acute injury is followed by early and late reparative phases during which the prognosis can be further improved by surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention is targeted at protecting the ocular surface and encouraging re-epithelisation. Later, surgical treatments are directed at ocular surface reconstruction and restoration of vision. However, before any attempt is made at surface reconstruction, the ocular surface environment must be optimised by division of symblepharon, and correction of lid deformity and trichiasis. If there is conjunctivalisation of the corneal surface, limbal stem cell transplantation can restore a corneal epithelial cell phenotype, and transplantation of in vitroamplified corneal epithelial stem cells has been developed as an alternative to keratolimbal transfer techniques. Keratoplasty and cataract surgery may then be necessary to clear the visual axis. Finally, keratoprosthesis is an option for the most severely damaged eyes.

Eligibility criteria for studies and outcomes of interest

We examined only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials compare topical ophthalmic anesthetics (amide or ester class) with a control group (placebo, non-treatment, or alternative treatment). Trials in which topical anesthetics with an NSAID were compared with a control group were eligible. We considered trials that enrolled participants of all ages with corneal abrasions within 48 h of presentation from accidental trauma or ophthalmic surgery.

The primary review outcomes were (1) mean reduction in self-reported pain on a visual analog scale (VAS), where smaller numbers represent less pain, at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment initiation; (2) the proportion of participants without complete resolution of epithelial defects by 24–72 h; and (3) the proportion of participants with adverse events (e.g. microbial keratitis or stromal infiltration, corneal stromal thinning, corneal perforation, surgical interventions) reported at the longest follow-up time of the study. For secondary outcomes, we considered treatment failure (the proportion of participants who required rescue oral analgesics by 72 h after treatment initiation) and quality of life assessed by a validated instrument at the longest follow-up time of the study. Trials were not excluded on the basis of outcome reporting.

Search methods for identifying studies

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase.com, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify potentially eligible RCTs for this review. We did not impose restrictions on the search date or language of publication. The last date of search was February 10, 2023.

Study selection

Pairs of review authors worked independently to review titles and abstracts as well as full-text records against the eligibility criteria; disagreements were resolved by discussion.

### Recurrent corneal erosion syndrome [^112wBebw]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent corneal erosion syndrome (RCES) is a disorder characterised by a dysfunctional epithelial ecosystem. It often begins after trauma, or in the setting of epithelial basement membrane degeneration or dystrophy. Historically, RCES has been understood as a structural derangement of the anterior corneal architecture. More recently, studies have demonstrated the important role of neuropeptides in corneal homoeostasis. Thus, RCES may also be understood as a disorder of corneal epithelial cell biology. Management of RCES can be challenging, but newer therapies have demonstrated improved efficacy for this condition. This review examines the aetiology and pathogenesis of RCES, and provides an update on current and emerging treatment modalities for the management of this disorder.

### A department-of-anesthesiology-based management protocol for perioperative corneal abrasions [^113ULyjw]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Corneal abrasions (CAs) are the most prevalent ocular injuries in the perioperative period. Previously, patients at our community hospital would wait for an ophthalmologist to be available to manage these minor injuries. To decrease this waiting period – and thereby increase patient satisfaction – we developed an anesthesiology-based protocol to manage minor CAs arising in the recovery room. The current study sought to assess this protocol's efficacy as well as further establish the incidence and some risk factors of CA.

Methods

This was a hospital-based, observational study. As per protocol, anesthesiologists saw and diagnosed any patient exhibiting symptoms of CA, after which they initiated a preestablished treatment regimen. To examine the efficacy of this protocol between March 2007 and December 2011, the number of CAs anesthesiologists managed and time to treatment were recorded. Additionally, the frequency of CAs was established along with some of their risk factors.

Results

Throughout the study period, there were 91,064 surgical cases, with 118 CAs (0.13% incidence). Anesthesiology alone managed 110 (93.22%) of these cases. The median time between the end of anesthesia to the time of prescribed ophthalmic medication was 156 minutes (first–third interquartile range: 108–219). All patients experienced resolution of symptoms by the morning following their complaint. Compared to the general surgical population, CA patients were older (P < 0.01) and underwent longer surgeries (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Minor CAs can be safely and effectively managed using an anesthesiology-based approach. Advanced age and longer surgery are confirmed as risk factors for these injuries.
