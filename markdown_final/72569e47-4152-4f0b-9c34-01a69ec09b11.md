## Question

Beta blocker use with chronic or acute heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use beta-blockers in chronic versus acute heart failure, including indications, contraindications, dosing, titration, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotypes of heart failure and how ejection fraction changes management. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and which beta-blockers are proven beneficial. Next, I will examine initiation and titration in chronic HFrEF, followed by management during acute decompensation. After that, I need to check special populations and comorbidities, and finally I will synthesize a practical algorithm and address common pitfalls and implementation gaps, ensuring each assertion aligns with contemporary guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Heart failure is categorized by ejection fraction into HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, and guideline-directed therapy differs accordingly; beta-blockers are foundational in HFrEF, considered in HFmrEF, and not disease-modifying in HFpEF, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to EF and symptom status before proceeding [^114p8N7W] [^116gQGBL] [^1111XjZc].

> I will now examine the evidence base. Multiple large randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol succinate reduce mortality and hospitalizations in HFrEF, with relative mortality reductions around 30–35% and hospitalization reductions around 40%, and these benefits are not a class effect, so I should confirm that only these three agents are recommended for HF outcomes [^112d2ovU] [^116azjtk] [^1118P7Zm] [^1155oLjF] [^112mBNXd].

> Wait, let me verify agent selection nuances. Some clinicians prefer carvedilol because of alpha-1 blockade and broader receptor effects, and one head-to-head trial suggested carvedilol outperformed immediate-release metoprolol tartrate; however, network meta-analyses indicate broadly similar mortality effects across the three agents when used at target doses, so I should avoid overcommitting to a single agent and instead choose based on patient profile and tolerability while aiming for target doses [^1155oLjF] [^115WnJKk] [^113f76QV].

> Next, I should review initiation in chronic HFrEF. I need to ensure the patient is clinically stable and euvolemic before starting, begin at very low doses, and titrate every 2 weeks toward trial-based targets if tolerated, recognizing that early worsening symptoms can occur transiently and that abrupt withdrawal is harmful; MERIT-HF supports metoprolol succinate starting at 12.5–25 mg daily with a target of 200 mg daily, and similar structured titration applies to bisoprolol and carvedilol [^116UWrdx] [^111WJHYY] [^112d2ovU] [^113roJAv].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing relative to other GDMT. Historically, ACE inhibitors were started first, but CIBIS-III showed that starting with bisoprolol was noninferior to starting with enalapril, and contemporary guidance allows initiation of beta-blockers once stabilized even if ACEi/ARB/ARNI are not yet at full dose, so I should not delay beta-blocker therapy unnecessarily if the patient is ready [^117MG1BU] [^113roJAv] [^111H2g8y].

> I need to check monitoring and dose optimization. During titration, I should monitor heart rate, blood pressure, weight, and symptoms, anticipate early hypotension or fatigue that often abates with continued dosing, and persist toward target doses because underdosing is common and associated with worse outcomes; nurse-led titration programs can accelerate target attainment and improve outcomes, and I should double-check that we are not stopping prematurely for modest bradycardia or hypotension if the patient is otherwise stable [^113Pdmji] [^114p8N7W] [^116kGUKk] [^117BvGR2].

> Now, let me consider acute decompensated heart failure. My first instinct is to stop beta-blockers when patients present with congestion or low output, but wait, I should verify whether continuation is safe; multiple observational analyses and a randomized trial suggest that continuing preexisting beta-blockers during ADHF is safe and may be associated with lower in-hospital mortality, whereas withdrawal is linked to worse outcomes, so I should avoid routine discontinuation if hemodynamics allow [^114BD7HT] [^113SFknR] [^115i9h2J] [^116TmR4n].

> But wait, what if the patient is in shock or requires inotropes. I should confirm that beta-blockers are not initiated in patients with cardiogenic shock, marked hypotension, or those requiring IV inotropes, and if beta-blockade is contributing to low output in a patient already on therapy, a vasodilating inotrope such as levosimendan may be preferable because it is less beta-receptor dependent; in such cases, I need to reassess and reinitiate beta-blockers promptly after stabilization to preserve long-term benefit [^1166nxHy] [^111oLQ2M] [^113roJAv].

> Let me think about discharge planning. If the patient is not on a beta-blocker at admission, I should initiate one after decongestion and stabilization before discharge, as this improves long-term use and dose optimization; I should also counsel that early tolerability may be suboptimal for 48–72 hours and set a clear titration plan to reach target doses in follow-up [^113roJAv] [^113Pdmji] [^1139ezCt] [^1147u2vm].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, age alone is not a barrier to beta-blocker initiation or titration, though comorbidities and frailty may influence tolerability; in COPD or asthma, cardioselective agents at low doses are generally acceptable with careful monitoring; in atrial fibrillation, beta-blockers remain first-line for rate control, but I should avoid overly aggressive rate targets given concerns for bradyarrhythmias and reassess dose if heart rate is excessively low [^116TgMg2] [^116Fx8qe] [^115rsruh] [^115Wmqtv].

> I should confirm the approach in HFmrEF and HFpEF. In HFmrEF, evidence-based beta-blockers may be considered, particularly when LVEF is on the lower end of the spectrum, whereas in HFpEF, beta-blockers are not disease-modifying and should be used primarily for comorbidity-driven indications such as ischemia, hypertension, or atrial fibrillation rather than for HF per se [^116gQGBL] [^115RZVLw] [^1111XjZc].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For chronic HFrEF, start one of the three proven beta-blockers at a low dose once euvolemic and stable, titrate every 2 weeks toward target doses, monitor vitals and symptoms, and avoid abrupt withdrawal; for acute decompensation, continue the beta-blocker if hemodynamically tolerated, do not initiate new beta-blockade in shock or inotrope-dependent states, and initiate or reinitiate after stabilization prior to discharge with a clear titration plan [^113roJAv] [^113Pdmji] [^112Kg3GV].

> Hold on, I should verify common pitfalls. Underdosing remains widespread, with many patients receiving less than half of target doses and minimal uptitration after discharge; clinicians often stop therapy for modest bradycardia or hypotension despite trial protocols allowing continued titration when perfusion is adequate; and failure to restart after hospitalization is a major cause of discontinuation, so I need to ensure medication reconciliation and proactive reinitiation at discharge and early follow-up [^1119ia2u] [^117BvGR2] [^113x1YBd] [^115JBXRV].

> Finally, I should double-check that my recommendations align with high-quality guidance. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC guidelines uniformly endorse one of the three proven beta-blockers for symptomatic HFrEF, emphasize initiation after stabilization in acute settings, and call for structured titration to target or maximally tolerated doses, which reinforces the approach I have outlined here [^113roJAv] [^115Emj6D] [^116UWrdx].

Beta-blockers are **indicated for chronic HFrEF** [^112mBNXd] to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and should be titrated to target doses when tolerated [^114p8N7W]. In acute heart failure, **continue beta-blockers** if the patient is stable and hemodynamically tolerated; avoid initiation or up-titration during acute decompensation, and start or resume only after stabilization [^112Kg3GV]. Beta-blockers are not routinely indicated for HFpEF but may be used for comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation or ischemic heart disease [^113H9m2z]. Use carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol succinate [^1155oLjF]; avoid bucindolol and short-acting metoprolol tartrate [^1155oLjF].

## Indications for beta-blockers in chronic heart failure

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)

- **Indication**: Strongly recommended for all patients with chronic HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) with current or prior symptoms [^112mBNXd], unless contraindicated [^114p8N7W].

- **Mortality benefit**: Reduces mortality, hospitalizations, and improves LVEF [^113roJAv] [^115WnJKk].

- **Recommended agents**: Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate [^1155oLjF] are the only beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit in HFrEF [^113roJAv].

- **Initiation and titration**: Start at low doses and titrate every 2 weeks to target or maximally tolerated doses [^111WJHYY] [^116UWrdx].

| **Beta-blocker** | **Initial dose** | **Target dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Carvedilol | 3.125 mg BID | 25–50 mg BID |
| Bisoprolol | 1.25 mg daily | 10 mg daily |
| Metoprolol succinate | 12.5–25 mg daily | 200 mg daily |

---

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)

In HFpEF, **routine use** is not recommended; consider beta-blockers for comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation or ischemic heart disease [^113H9m2z].

---

## Indications for beta-blockers in acute heart failure

### Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)

- **Continuation**: Continue beta-blockers if the patient is hemodynamically stable and tolerating therapy [^113SFknR].

- **Initiation**: Avoid initiating or up-titrating beta-blockers during acute decompensation [^112Kg3GV].

- **Post-stabilization**: Initiate or resume beta-blockers after stabilization, ideally before discharge [^113roJAv].

---

## Clinical benefits of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure

- **Mortality reduction**: ~30–35% relative risk reduction in mortality [^112d2ovU] [^115WnJKk].

- **Hospitalization reduction**: ~40% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations [^1118P7Zm].

- **Reverse remodeling**: Improves LVEF and delays disease progression [^115WnJKk] [^113roJAv].

---

## Risks and contraindications of beta-blockers in heart failure

### Risks

- **Hypotension**: Especially with vasodilatory beta-blockers (e.g. carvedilol) [^1152RZQW].

- **Bradycardia**: Monitor for excessive heart rate reduction [^116UWrdx].

- **Worsening fluid retention**: May require diuretic adjustment [^113Pdmji].

---

### Contraindications

Contraindications include **severe bradycardia**, second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, and **severe asthma** or reactive airway disease. Use caution in **severe hepatic impairment** and avoid abrupt withdrawal, which can worsen heart failure [^113Raxrx].

---

## Special considerations

### Beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

In COPD, **cardioselective beta-blockers** (e.g. bisoprolol, metoprolol) are generally well tolerated, even in moderate-to-severe disease. Initiate at low doses and titrate cautiously [^112gDe4p].

---

### Beta-blockers in elderly patients

In elderly patients, **tolerability** is generally good, though start low and go slow. Comorbidities may necessitate dose adjustments [^116TgMg2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Beta-blocker use** | **Recommended agents** |
|-|-|-|
| Chronic HFrEF | Strongly recommended | Carvedilol, bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate |
| HFpEF | Not routinely recommended; use for comorbidities | Any beta-blocker |
| Acute heart failure | Continue if stable; initiate after stabilization | Carvedilol, bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate |

---

Beta-blockers are **essential for chronic HFrEF** [^112mBNXd], reducing mortality and hospitalizations; in acute heart failure, continue if stable and initiate after stabilization. They are not routinely indicated for HFpEF but may be used for comorbidities.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Current role of β-adrenergic blockers in the management of chronic heart failure [^112wsod4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system exerts adverse biologic effects that are mediated through alpha(1), beta(1) and beta(2) receptors and that contribute importantly to the progression of heart failure. As a result, beta blockers are no longer considered to be contraindicated for use in these patients but instead now play a critical role in the successful management of chronic heart failure. Beta blockers have been evaluated in > 15,000 patients with heart failure who have participated in placebo-controlled trials. The results of these studies indicate that, like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, long-term treatment with beta blockers can lessen symptoms and improve clinical status and can reduce the risk of death as well as the combined risk of death or hospitalization. The database supporting the use of beta blockers is now as persuasive (and arguably more persuasive) than the database supporting the use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure (which comprises about 7,000 patients). Yet, the benefits of beta blockers are seen in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, suggesting that combined blockade of two neurohormonal systems (renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system) can produce additive effects.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — initiation and maintenance in chronic heart failure (HF) states that treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated, and patients should be monitored closely for changes in vital signs and symptoms during this uptitration period; physicians should ask patients to weigh themselves daily and to manage any increase in weight by immediately increasing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretic until weight is restored to pretreatment levels, and planned increments in the dose of a beta-blocker should be delayed until any side effects observed with lower doses have disappeared; most patients (approximately 85%) enrolled in clinical trials were able to tolerate short- and long-term treatment and achieve the maximum planned trial dose, beta-blockers can be safely started before discharge in patients hospitalized for HF provided they do not require intravenous therapy for HF, clinical responses are generally delayed and may require 2 to 3 months to become apparent, and abrupt withdrawal can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular events — acute MI and history of MI with normal LVEF: In patients with an acute MI, the infusion of a fibrinolytic agent or the use of percutaneous coronary intervention can decrease the risk of developing HF, and patients also benefit from both a beta-blocker and either an ACEI or ARB, which can decrease the risk of reinfarction or death when initiated within days after the ischemic event; combined neurohormonal blockade produces additive benefits. In patients with a history of MI but normal LVEF, both hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously, patients with a recent MI should also receive ACEIs and beta-blockers to reduce death risk, and evidence from 2 large-scale studies indicates that prolonged ACEI therapy can reduce major cardiovascular events even when started months or years after MI.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Achieving a maximally tolerated β-blocker dose in heart failure patients: is there room for Improvement? [^113K7KqK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Proposed mechanisms include neurohormonal blockade and heart rate reduction. A new therapeutic agent now exists to target further heart rate lowering in patients who have been stable on a "maximally tolerated β-blocker dose", but this definition and how to achieve it are incompletely understood. In this review, the authors summarize published reports on the mechanisms by which β-blockers improve clinical outcomes. The authors describe differences in doses achieved in landmark clinical trials and those observed in routine clinical practice. They further discuss reasons for intolerance and the evidence behind using β-blocker dose and heart rate as therapeutic targets. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for clinicians actively initiating and up-titrating β-blockers that may aid in achieving maximally tolerated doses.

### Influence of β-blockers on mortality in chronic heart failure [^115HCxUD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly discuss the pathophysiology of heart failure and the rationale for the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Key morbidity reduction trials are briefly mentioned, and recent mortality reduction trials are reviewed. General recommendations regarding the use of beta-blockers in heart failure are also included to guide clinical practice.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses evaluating mortality reduction with beta-blockers in the treatment of heart failure were identified using a MEDLINE search from January 1993 to March 2000. Abstracts and presented results from recent scientific meetings were also considered.

Data Synthesis

Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease hospitalization for worsening heart failure, decrease the need for heart transplant, improve New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and increase left-ventricular ejection fraction. A mortality benefit has recently been demonstrated for patients with chronic heart failure. Carvedilol, bisoprolol, and controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol decreased the risk of dying by 65%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in patients with primarily NYHA functional class II or III and systolic dysfunction. The benefit of these agents in patients with class IV heart failure or determining whether one agent has an advantage over another is being investigated in ongoing clinical trials.

Conclusions

Several beta-blockers have demonstrated mortality reduction in the treatment of patients with NYHA functional class II or III heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers should be considered in these patients when they are clinically stable and taking the current standard therapy of a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or other vasodilator agent.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

Patients with chronic reduction of LVEF but no symptoms — pharmacologic prevention: Long-term treatment with an ACEI has been shown to delay the onset of HF symptoms and decrease the risk of death and hospitalization for HF in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although there are no studies that specifically addressed use of ARBs in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, ARBs may be an appropriate alternative, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate an ACEI. Furthermore, although controlled clinical trials are lacking, the use of beta-blockers in patients with a low EF and no symptoms (especially those with coronary artery disease) is also recommended, and the same beta-blockers should be used that were employed in the large HF trials.

Beta-blocker–related hypotension — timing and management state that beta-blockers, especially those that also block alpha-1-receptors, can produce hypotension, and for beta-blockers that also block alpha-receptors, such as carvedilol, these vasodilatory side effects are generally seen within 24 to 48 hours of the first dose or the first increase in dose and usually subside with repeated dosing without any change in dose. Physicians may minimize the risk of hypotension by administering the beta-blocker and ACEI at different times during the day, and if this is ineffective, the occurrence of hypotension may require a temporary reduction in the dose of the ACEI. Hypotensive symptoms may also resolve after a decrease in the dose of diuretics in patients who are volume depleted, and if hypotension is accompanied by other clinical evidence of hypoperfusion, beta-blocker therapy should be decreased or discontinued pending further patient evaluation.

### Beneficial association of β-blocker therapy on recovery from severe acute heart failure treatment: data from the survival of patients with acute heart failure in need of intravenous inotropic support trial [^111V1U7V]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta-blocker therapy is recommended for most patients with chronic heart failure, although such therapy may be discontinued or reduced during hospitalizations. The aim is to determine whether β-blocker use at study entry and/or at discharge has an impact on 31- and 180-day survival.

Design

Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study.

Setting

Multinational.

Patients

A total of 1,327 critically ill patients hospitalized with low-output heart failure in need of inotropic therapy.

Intervention

Levosimendan versus dobutamine.

Measurements

All-cause mortality at 31 and 180 days in patients who survived initial hospitalization with/without β-blocker use at entry and/or at discharge.

Results

Patients on β-blockers at entry and at discharge had significantly lower 31-day (p < .0001) and 180-day (p < .0001) mortality compared to patients without β-blockers use at both time points. The association was robust when adjusted for age and co-morbidities (p = .006 at 31 days; p = .003 at 180 days).

Conclusions

Those results strongly suggest, in severe acutely decompensated heart failure patients, admitted on β-blockers, to continue on them at discharge.

Chronic heart failure — beta-blockers with proven mortality benefit and agent selection is summarized as follows: Three beta-blockers have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic heart failure (HF): bisoprolol, sustained-release metoprolol (succinate), and carvedilol; positive findings with these 3 agents should not be considered a class effect, and patients who have Stage C HF should be treated with 1 of these 3 beta-blockers. In one head-to-head trial, carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) versus immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose 50 mg twice daily) was associated with a significantly reduced mortality, and there have been no trials to explore whether the survival benefits of carvedilol are greater than those of sustained-release metoprolol when both are used at the target doses.

Stage C heart failure (HF) with reduced LVEF — Class I recommendations: Measures listed as Class I recommendations for patients in stages A and B are also appropriate for patients in Stage C (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate). Diuretics and salt restriction are indicated in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who have evidence of fluid retention (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated (Level of Evidence: A). Beta-blockers (using 1 of the 3 proven to reduce mortality, i.e., bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained release metoprolol succinate) are recommended for all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated (Level of Evidence: A). Angiotensin II receptor blockers approved for the treatment of HF are recommended in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who are ACEI-intolerant (Level of Evidence: A). Drugs known to adversely affect the clinical status of patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2016, there were no specific recommendations for any disease‐modifying treatment in HFmrEF or HFpEF. Still, a vast majority of patients in HF III received ACEi/ARB and beta‐blockers. It is unknown if indications have been primarily HF or some comorbidity such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease or diabetic kidney disease. Post‐hoc analyses of randomized HFpEF trials, and the 2021 guidelinessuggest that use in HFmrEF may be reasonable, whereas in HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%) there appears to be no benefit at all from ARBs or beta‐blockers.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure: scientific review [^1118P7Zm]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Care of patients with heart failure has been revolutionized throughout the past decade. A paradigm shift in the strategy for treating heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is in progress. Despite the initial perception about beta-blockers' safety, they are now the most extensively studied class of agents in the treatment of heart failure and have emerged as an important intervention to improve the clinical outcomes of heart failure patients.

Objective

To provide scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers for patients with heart failure.

Data Sources

All English-language articles of large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the mortality benefits of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure were identified to provide the scientific rationale for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure. Basic science studies were reviewed to provide an overview of the potential physiologic role of beta-blockers in heart failure. Finally, clinical guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure were assessed to determine current recommendations for the use of these agents.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled clinical trials of beta-blockers that included more than 300 subjects and assessed mortality as a primary end point.

Data Synthesis

Of the 4 beta-blockers tested in large randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with heart failure, 3 are available in the United States, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, beta-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with class II and III heart failure.

Conclusions

Tested in more than 10,000 patients, beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, beta-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. The science supporting beta-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

Digoxin in acute decompensation and conduction disease — contraindications and cautions specify that digoxin is not indicated as primary therapy for the stabilization of patients with an acute exacerbation of HF symptoms, including fluid retention or hypotension, and such patients should first receive appropriate treatment for HF (usually with intravenous medications); therapy with digoxin may be initiated after stabilization as part of an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. Patients should not be given digoxin if they have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been addressed with a permanent pacemaker, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients taking other drugs that can depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function or affect digoxin levels (e.g., amiodarone or a beta-blocker).

### Clinical outcomes in patients on β-blocker therapy admitted with worsening chronic heart failure [^111bhEwQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure without evidence of overt congestion. No data are available describing outcomes of patients admitted with exacerbated chronic heart failure who are receiving beta blockade at the time of admission. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients from the Outcomes of the Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study who were prescribed beta blockers on admission compared with patients who were not prescribed beta blockers at admission. In all, 212 patients were treated with beta blockers at admission and 737 patients were not. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except that patients prescribed beta blockers on admission had slightly higher ejection fractions, fewer New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, and lower heart rates. There was no difference in clinical events between patients who were treated with beta blockers at the time of admission and those who were not. Exploratory analyses suggested that patients whose beta-blocker therapy was discontinued had a higher risk of adverse outcomes, particularly in the subset of patients randomized to milrinone. The data from this nonrandom comparison suggest that continuation of pre-existing beta-blocker therapy is not associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in patients admitted with worsening heart failure. These results also suggest that caution should be taken when withdrawing beta blockade in this population.

### Why do patients fail to receive β-blockers for chronic heart failure over time? A "real-world" single-center, 2-year follow-up experience of β-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure [^113x1YBd]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use in a heart-failure practice setting has not been explored. Previous studies have not specifically addressed the use of beta-blockers over time to determine the rate of use and reasons for discontinuation. The long-term compliance rate for beta-blocker drugs outside the context of a clinical trial has not been established.

Methods

We prospectively followed a cohort of 500 consecutive patients between March and May 2001, with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure seen in a specialized heart failure clinic and determined the longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.

Results

The final cohort consists of 340 patients with a complete 2-year follow-up data (mean age 61 ± 14 years, 69% men, 53% with ischemic etiology, mean ejection fraction 27.6 ± 15%). At 6, 12, and 24 months, beta-blocker utilization rates were maintained in 69%, 70%, and 74% of patients, respectively. Of the 120 confirmed initial non-beta-blocker users, 28 (23%) were subsequently started on beta-blocker, despite suspected relative contraindications in 53% of patients. Over a period of 2 years, the discontinuation rate was 10%, with failure to restart a beta-blocker after hospitalization as the most common reason for beta-blocker discontinuation.

Conclusion

Utilization rates of beta-blockers in our heart failure clinic have remained constant at approximately 70% throughout a 2-year follow-up. Of those who discontinued beta-blockers (10%), the most common documented cause was failure to restart beta-blockers after hospitalization.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^116TmR4n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers are guideline‐directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Previous large clinical trials have consistently shown that beta‐blockers reduce mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in patients with chronic HFrEF. One of the beneficial effects of beta‐blockers is reverse remodeling and subsequent improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Beta‐blockers also reduce sudden cardiac death (SCD). The discontinuation of beta‐blockers in patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has been reported to be associated with significantly increased in‐hospital and short‐term mortality, possibly due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system by abrupt discontinuation of beta‐blockers.

However, there is a scarcity of data on the effects of beta‐blocker use at admission for ADHF on in‐hospital outcomes. In ADHF settings, there is a concern about using beta‐blockers at hospitalization for their negative inotropic effect to disrupt the compensation of the heart. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of beta‐blocker use at admission for ADHF on in‐hospital outcomes in patients with ADHF.

### The new heart failure guidelines: strategies for implementation [^115b6ubi]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Several life-prolonging therapies are available for the treatment of heart failure, yet they are underutilized in many patients. A treatment gap exists between patients who are eligible for a therapy and the number of patients who actually receive them. Suboptimal prescribing rates for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have been reported. Strategies are needed to increase the proportion of patients who are receiving evidence-based therapies. Predischarge initiation of evidence-based therapies has effectively increased utilization in the acute coronary syndrome population. Predischarge initiation of beta-blockade in patients hospitalized for heart failure has also been shown to be safe and effective for improving beta-blocker use at 60 days. Larger registry initiatives have demonstrated improved use of evidence-based therapies associated with implementation of a performance improvement process system. The mortality and morbidity associated with heart failure is strikingly high, and it is critical that proven therapies are prescribed to all eligible patients so that clinical outcomes can be improved. Systematic processes are effective approaches to ensuring appropriate evidence-based therapies are prescribed in most patients.

### Beta-blockers in left ventricular systolic dysfunction – from evidence to practice [^1166T66W]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

Five percent of all hospital medical admissions are patients with heart failure. The incidence is about one new case per 1000 of the general population per year, increasing to > 10 per 1000 in those aged ≥ 85 years. Although the evidence that beta-blockers reduce mortality by about 36% when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is overwhelming, clinicians are still reluctant to use beta-blockers in heart failure, especially in older patients. Here, we examine the evidence for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure in older people and explore the practicalities of their use.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy — initiation, monitoring, titration, and combination risks — should include reassessment of blood pressure, renal function, and potassium "within 1 to 2 weeks" after starting, with closer follow-up after dose changes; patients with "systolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg" warrant particular surveillance. Titration "is generally achieved by doubling doses", and "for stable patients, it is reasonable to add therapy with beta-blocking agents before full target doses of either ACEIs or ARBs are reached". Risks of "hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia are greater when combined with another inhibitor of this axis, such as ACEIs or aldosterone antagonists".

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — patients with pulmonary disease and heart failure: Because dyspnea is a key symptom in both conditions, distinguishing the two and quantifying cardiac versus pulmonary contributions is important, and exercise testing with simultaneous gas exchange or blood gas measurements may be helpful, particularly when used with right heart catheterization. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can cause a persistent nonproductive cough that may be mistaken for respiratory disease and conversely may be stopped inappropriately; physicians should seek a pulmonary cause in all patients with HF who complain of cough, attribute cough to ACEI only if respiratory disorders are excluded and it disappears after cessation and recurs after reinstitution, and many patients can be encouraged to tolerate ACEI-related cough in view of ACEI benefits. Beta-blockers can aggravate bronchospastic symptoms in asthma, yet many with asymptomatic or mild reactive airway disease tolerate beta-blockers well, most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remain reasonable candidates for beta-blockade, and both metoprolol tartrate and bisoprolol lose beta-1 selectivity when prescribed in doses associated with an improvement in survival in patients with HF.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction — ICD implantation recommendations state that consideration of ICD implantation is recommended in patients with EF less than or equal to 30% with mild to moderate symptoms and anticipated survival with good functional capacity beyond 1 year; documentation of sustained EF reduction despite beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should precede consideration. ICDs are not warranted in refractory HF symptoms (Stage D) or when comorbid illnesses would independently limit life expectancy. Management of patients with EF between 30% and 35% remains controversial; for coronary artery disease, risk stratification may include programmed electrical stimulation to demonstrate inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT). In idiopathic cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% to 35%, the physician might want to continue intensive medical therapy before giving consideration to ICD implantation.

### Beta-blocker treatment of chronic systolic heart failure improves prognosis even in patients meeting one or more exclusion criteria of the MERIT-HF study [^115V5Ccz]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Improved prognosis of patients with chronic systolic heart failure by treatment with beta-blockers has been shown in several randomized controlled multicentre trials. However, in clinical practice only a part of heart failure patients meet the inclusion criteria of these trials. The present study evaluates whether reduction of mortality by beta-blockers also can be achieved in patients presenting one or more exclusion criteria of the MERIT-HF trial.

Methods and Results

From the Ludwigshafen Heart Failure Registry 675 patients with chronic systolic heart failure consecutively enrolled between January 1995 and June 2004 were divided in two groups either meeting the inclusion criteria of the MERIT-HF trial ('trial patients': n = 278, 60% treated with beta-blockers) or not ('non-trial patients': n = 397; 51% treated with beta-blockers). The distribution of the MERIT-HF exclusion criteria in the group of 'non-trial patients' was as follows: acute myocardial infarction 9.6%; systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg 7.5%; chronic obstructive lung disease 33.2%; other serious diseases potentially limiting prognosis 16.9%; acutely performed or planned ICD, bypass surgery, PCI, heart transplantation: 17.1, 15.9, 7.8, and 4.8%, respectively. Median follow-up was 31.3 months (upper/lower quartile 16.3/50.0 months). All-cause mortality was significantly reduced by beta-blocker treatment not only in 'trial patients' (adjusted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.38–0.86) but also in 'non-trial patients' (adjusted hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.53–0.97).

Conclusion

In clinical practice only the smaller part of the population to be treated for chronic systolic heart failure meets the inclusion criteria of the MERIT-HF study. However, beta-blocker treatment is associated with a significantly reduced long-term mortality even in patients meeting one or more exclusion criteria of the MERIT-HF study.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

### Beta-blocker benefit according to severity of heart failure [^116tHBU9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Beta-blockers are an established treatment for chronic heart failure. However, the relationship between their benefit and the severity of the disease remains to be determined.

Methods and Results

We studied the relationship between amplitude of benefit of beta-blockers and severity of chronic heart failure, based on data for mortality and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, complementary subgroup analyses and analysis of individual data from the CIBIS II trial. In the meta-analysis, mortality was reduced by 22% (95%CI: 16 to 28) and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 24% (95%CI: 20 to 29). Benefit was similar with metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. After exclusion of bucindolol trials, due to the heterogeneity of results for mortality, the reduction in mortality was similar according to the severity of heart failure, assessed either by left ventricular ejection fraction or by New York Heart Association classification. In CIBIS II, beta-blockers induced a significant reduction in mortality of 45% (95%CI: 9 to 66), 41% (95%CI: 17 to 59) and 23% (95%CI: 1 to 40) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. Hospitalizations were reduced by 35% (95%CI: 2 to 57), 41% (95%CI: 18 to 58) and 23% (95%CI: 0 to 41), there was no significant difference between the three score groups.

Conclusion

We conclude that the amplitude of benefit of the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol on mortality and morbidity is similar, regardless of the severity of chronic heart failure.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^116nF8vS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy

A key objective of HF III is assessment of quality of care and adherence to the ESC HF guidelines. Patients were enrolled in 2018–2020, during which time the 2016 ESC HF guidelines were applicable, with class I recommendations for ACEi/ARB/ARNi, beta‐blockers and MRAs. In the present analysis, we provide detailed data on these three fundamental drug categories. SGLT2/1i were emerging as beneficial in reducing HF events in patients with diabetes but not yet indicated specifically for HF.

In HFrEF, use of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and beta‐blockers was highly variable depending on EF, pre‐existing versus de novo HF, and acute versus outpatient setting. However, after enrolment in HF III and optimization during the baseline encounter (whether in‐hospital or as outpatient), use of these drug classes reached nearly 90% at discharge from an AHF event and over 90% after an outpatient visit. Use of ARNi in HFrEF was far less than one third prior to enrolment, and was initiated in about 10% at the baseline encounter, resulting in about 30% use after an outpatient encounter and 10–20% use after an AHF encounter. The 29% use of ARNi was relatively modest, despite several years having passed since the pivotal PARADIGM‐HF trial and the 2016 guidelines recommending ARNi in HFrEF. The present study was conducted in 2018–2020 and cannot meaningfully assess SGLT2i use, but very recent data suggest that SGLT2i implementation, has been more rapid than ARNi in the present HF III as well as in other cohorts and registries. There are several potential explanations. Traditional HFrEF treatments such as ACEi and beta‐blockers were also slow to be implemented. The design of PARADIGM‐HF and recommendations in ensuing guidelines was to first treat with ACEi and then switch to ARNi, which may delay initiation of ARNi. ARNi is also more expensive than ACEi/ARB. In contrast, before they were shown effective in dedicated HF trials, SGLT2i had already received attention for their dramatic and unexpected effects on HF outcomes in CV outcome trials, and both the HF and primary care communities were primed for rapid implementation of SGLT2i once the HF trials were published. MRA use in HFrEF was higher, with more than 70% regardless of the type of encounter, which is considerably higher than that reported in other registries, and may reflect a greater comfort with medication side effects, among the HF III providers as compared to those in other more general settings.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1175CZA9]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^114HuVy5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study were as follows: (1) factors independently associated with beta‐blocker use at admission were previous HF hospitalization, history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, use of pimobendan, history of myocardial infarction, use of ACEI or ARB, history of atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m²; and (2) the lower in‐hospital mortality risk of patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission relative to those not receiving beta‐blockers at admission was significant, regardless of ischemic etiology and LVEF.

Few studies have reported the role of beta‐blockers at admission in patients with ADHF. In the post hoc analysis of the ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness) trial, which assessed pulmonary artery catheter use among 432 patients admitted with ADHF, in‐hospital mortality was 1.5% on admission beta‐blocker therapy compared with 2.4% patients not on beta‐blocker therapy (P = 0.48). In the post hoc analysis of the OPTIME‐CHF (Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure), which randomized 949 patients to milrinone or placebo, in‐hospital mortality was 2.4% in patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission compared with 3.3% in patients not receiving beta‐blockers (P = 0.49). These 2 studies enrolled a small number of patients with extremely low LVEF (around 25%). Therefore, they might not have enough statistical power and generalizability.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

### Effects of beta-blocker withdrawal in acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BD7HT]. JACC: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effects of beta-blocker withdrawal in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

Background

Published reports showed trends for either no harm or increased risk of in-hospital mortality, short-term mortality, and rehospitalization rates in patients admitted for ADHF that discontinued beta-blockers; however, a comprehensive analysis has not been conducted.

Methods

Relevant studies from January 2000 through January 2015 were identified in the PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE electronic databases. Where appropriate data were available, weighted relative risks were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis techniques.

Results

Five observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial (n = 2,704 patients who continued beta-blocker therapy and n = 439 patients who discontinued beta-blocker therapy) that reported the short-term effects of beta-blocker withdrawal in ADHF were included in the analyses. In 2 studies, beta-blocker withdrawal significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (risk ratio: 3.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51 to 9.14). Short-term mortality (relative risk: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.49; 4 studies) and combined short-term rehospitalization or death (relative risk: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.45; 4 studies) were also significantly increased.

Conclusions

Discontinuation of beta-blockers in patients admitted with ADHF was associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality, short-term mortality, and the combined endpoint of short-term rehospitalization or mortality. These data suggest beta-blockers should be continued in ADHF patients if their clinical picture allows.

### Practical guidelines to optimize effectiveness of β-blockade in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure [^114UL57Z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Antiadrenergic therapy reduces the risks of death and major morbidity in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure. Despite the common perception, these benefits are not attributable to a class effect, and clinical trials reveal evidence of specific agents that provide clinical advantages. To optimize patient outcome in the postinfarction setting, propranolol or timolol should be used in the setting of preserved ventricular function, and carvedilol should be used in patients with impaired ventricular function, with or without clinical evidence of heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure are at lower risk of death when treated with carvedilol, which is also associated with a lower incidence of developing diabetes mellitus-related adverse events. This article reviews the scientific evidence for the hierarchy of antiadrenergic agents and addresses practical issues associated with initiation of therapy and long-term management.

### B-CONVINCED: beta-blocker CONtinuation vs. INterruption in patients with congestive heart failure hospitalizED for a decompensation episode [^113SFknR]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Whether or not beta-blocker therapy should be stopped during acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is unsure.

Methods and Results

In a randomized, controlled, open labelled, non-inferiority trial, we compared beta-blockade continuation vs. discontinuation during ADHF in patients with LVEF below 40% previously receiving stable beta-blocker therapy. 169 patients were included, among which 147 were evaluable. Mean age was 72 ± 12 years, 65% were males. After 3 days, 92.8% of patients pursuing beta-blockade improved for both dyspnoea and general well-being according to a physician blinded for therapy vs. 92.3% of patients stopping beta-blocker. This was the main endpoint and the upper limit for unilateral 95% CI (6.6%) is lower that of the predefined upper limit (12.5%), indicating non-inferiority. Similar findings were obtained at 8 days and when evaluation was made by the patient. Plasma BNP at Day 3, length of hospital stay, re-hospitalization rate, and death rate after 3 months were also similar. Beta-blocker therapy at 3 months was given to 90% of patients vs. 76% (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In conclusion, during ADHF, continuation of beta-blocker therapy is not associated with delayed or lesser improvement, but with a higher rate of chronic prescription of beta-blocker therapy after 3 months, the benefit of which is well established.

### Pharmacological treatment following myocardial infarction: how large is the gap between guideline recommendations and routine clinical care? [^116E1yWU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is a clear class IA guideline recommendation the definite reasons for the rather low prescription rates or withholding from so many patients need to be investigated urgently. The most common reasons to withhold MRA treatment from patients with advanced systolic heart failure are potential hyperkalemia, chronic kidney disease, and arterial hypotension, which may further provoke the development of the cardiorenal syndrome. In particular, the risk of hyperkalemia‐related death due to MRA therapy reflects the major concern why many clinicians withheld MRA from patients with heart failure. In contrast, it has to be outlined, that hyperkalemia‐related death in patients treated with MRA is more common in nonrandomized registries, which also include patients with contraindications for MRA treatment as well as those with inappropriate MRA dosages. Albert et al reported a high variability regarding treatment with MRA in the United States ranging from 0% to 100% (median 28%, interquartile range 18%–40%), which may be related to poor pharmaceutical company‐sponsored drug marketing and education to physicians. Poor adherence to guidelines may be increased by the large amount of randomized studies in the field of beta blockers and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and a contrastively smaller number of MRA studies.MRA are usually initiated after up‐titration of beta blockers and ACEI/ARB, which is also outlined in the current European guidelines for acute and chronic heart failure, although MRA are recommended in symptomatic patients treated with beta blockers plus ACEI/ARB. However, the fear of severe hypotension with consecutive low output and acute renal failure is often overestimated. A substudy of the EPHESUS trial reported hypotension in only 2.6% of patients with early eplerenone therapy. The subordinate role of MRA in comparison to beta blockers and ACEI/ARB is supported by the European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Long‐Term Registry (ie, at least 92% with chronic heart failure treated with beta blockers and ACEI/ARB versus 67% with MRA). The present study by Wong et al therefore underlines the necessity to further improve the clinical education of medical staff regarding indications and optimal use of MRA alongside with continuous and appropriate monitoring of renal function and serum potassium levels. Especially important subgroups of patients (ie, obese diabetics with advanced symptoms as identified by Cohen et al) may benefit from routine MRA administration. Further studies in the field of MRA to prove the impact of an early MRA initiation in patients with heart failure nowadays are necessary to improve poor guideline adherence. Although specific heart failure units have been more frequently established in maximum care hospitals in developed countries, the optimal pharmacotherapies of all necessary heart failure drugs including MRA should at last be a standard for all physicians worldwide even more than 10 years after publication of the EPHESUS trial.

### ACCF and AHA release guidelines on the management of heart failure [^114NksvT]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of ACE inhibitors — selection, co-therapy, and cautions: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with HF due to LV systolic dysfunction with reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or have been shown to be unable to tolerate these drugs, and treatment with an ACEI should not be delayed until resistance to other drugs is demonstrated. In general, ACEIs are used together with a beta-blocker, and ACEIs should not be prescribed without diuretics in patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention. ACEIs are often preferred over ARBs or direct-acting vasodilators because of the greater experience and weight of evidence in support of their effectiveness. Patients should not be given an ACEI if they have experienced life-threatening adverse reactions (angioedema or anuric renal failure) during previous exposure or if they are pregnant. ACEIs should be taken with caution when very low systemic blood pressure is present (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), when serum creatinine is markedly increased (greater than 3 mg per dL), with bilateral renal artery stenosis, or when serum potassium is elevated (greater than 5.5 mmol per liter). Treatment with an ACEI should not be initiated in hypotensive patients who are at immediate risk of cardiogenic shock; such patients should first receive other forms of treatment for HF and then be re-evaluated for ACE inhibition once stability has been achieved.

Evidence‐Based Beta Blocker

Use of beta blockers at discharge was associated with its use at 12 months (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, 12.0–18.1]), whereas atrial fibrillation or flutter and site excess readmission rate ≥ 1 were associated with nonuse at 12 months (Table 2). Use at discharge was associated with achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months (OR, 9.01 [95% CI, 7.62–10.6]), although older age, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and a history of chronic HF were associated with not achieving this target at 12 months (Table 3). Atrial fibrillation or flutter was associated with a reduced rate of escalation and an increased rate of deescalation (Tables S5, S6).

Angiotensin‐Converting Enzyme Inhibitor/AngiotensinReceptor Blocker/Angiotensin Receptor‐Neprilysin Inhibitor

Use of ACEi/ARB/ARNI at discharge (OR, 6.65 [95% CI, 5.60–7.90]) was associated with its use at 12 months, whereas older age and chronic kidney disease were associated with nonuse at 12 months (Table 2). Use at discharge (OR, 4.02 [95% CI, 3.07–5.26]) and higher systolic blood pressure were associated with achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months, whereas older age, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, ischemic cause, and ≥ 2 HF admissions in the past 1 year were associated with not achieving this target at 12 months (Table 3). Lower LVEF was associated with an increased rate of escalation, whereas older age and chronic kidney disease were associated with a reduced rate of escalation (Tables S5, S6).

Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist

Use of MRA at discharge (OR, 11.2 [95% CI, 9.14–13.8]), lower LVEF, and a history of HF were associated with its use at 12 months, whereas higher creatinine was associated with nonuse at 12 months (Table 2). Increased age, diabetes, higher LVEF, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher creatinine were associated with a reduced rate of escalation. A history of chronic HF was associated with an increased rate of escalation. Increased age and creatinine were associated with an increased risk of deescalation (Tables S5, S6).

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Management strategies for stage-D patients with acute heart failure [^111Yf3Wq]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart Failure (HF) accounted for 3.4 million ambulatory visits in 2000. Current guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, the Heart Failure Society of America, and the International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation recommend aggressive pharmacologic interventions for patients with HF. This may include a combination of diuretics, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and digoxin. Nitrates and hydralazine are also indicated as part of standard therapy in addition to beta-blockers and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, especially but not exclusively, for African Americans with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. For those with acute decompensated HF, additional treatment options include recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide, and in the future possible newer agents not yet approved for use in the U.S., such as Levosimendan. Medical devices for use in patients with advanced HF include LV assist devices, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. For refractory patients, heart transplantation, the gold-standard surgical intervention for the treatment of refractory HF, may be considered. Newer surgical options such as surgical ventricular restoration may be considered in select patients.

The study MERIT-HF was published by MERIT-HF Study Group. and colleagues in 1999 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the MERIT-HF study, the trial question was: is conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily superior to conventional therapy alone in patients with HF, a LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms? In the MERIT-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MERIT-HF study, the population was: 3991 patients (898 female, 3093 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF, an LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms. The key exclusion criteria were acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 28 days before randomization; indication or contraindication for treatment with beta blockers, HF secondary to systemic disease or alcohol abuse; or AV block of the second and third degree. In the MERIT-HF study, the interventions were: n = 1990 conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily (12.5 mg for NYHA III-IV or 25.0 mg once daily for NYHA II, target dose 200 mg once daily plus optimum standard therapy) n = 2001 placebo (conventional therapy alone). In the MERIT-HF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in all-cause death (7.2% vs. 11%; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81). In the MERIT-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in SCD (0.19% vs. 0.132%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.9) Significant decrease in worsening HF (0.3% vs. 0.58%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79). In the MERIT-HF study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF, an LVEF ≤ 40%, and NYHA class II-IV symptoms, conventional therapy plus metoprolol CR/XR once daily was superior to placebo with respect to a all-cause death.

- evidence-based β-blockers for HFrEF

- ARNis

- ACEis

- ARBs

- mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1139ezCt]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Pillar 3: Antagonism of the sympathetic system with selected beta-blockers

Sympathetic overactivity is a hallmark of HFrEF. Increased peripheral vasoconstriction and elevated heart rates attempt to maintain cardiac output and vital organ perfusion but are ultimately maladaptive. It may worsen myocardial ischaemia, and high catecholamine levels may increase myocyte automaticity, increasing the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia. The use of selected βB is, therefore, recommended for HFrEF (table 5) and results in a relative mortality reduction of 35% when compared with placebo.

Table 5
Beta-blockers indicated in HFrEF

The use of βB may worsen acute heart failure and so clinical assessment is required to ensure that the patient with HFrEF is not decompensated at the time of βB initiation. Patients may often feel less well for 48–72 hours following initiation of βB or dose escalation and they should be warned of this to improve compliance with life-saving therapy. Where patients with HFrEF have decompensated on stable doses of βB, they should be continued at the same dose, while managing the decompensation. Dose titration should be to the maximum tolerated (starting at low dose) with a target resting heart rate of 60–70 bpm in sinus rhythm. Use of βB in patients with HFrEF with AF is recommended, although prognostic benefits are less well proven and aggressive rate control does not appear to provide any significant benefits when compared with more modest rate control. Some patients may not tolerate βB at higher doses and where the heart rate remains above 70 bpm then the I f channel blocker, Ivabradine, may be used to slow the sinus rate and improve symptoms and mortality.

### Levosimendan in the light of the results of the recent randomized controlled trials: an expert opinion paper [^111oLQ2M]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Potential non-routine (niche) indications for levosimendan (Fig. 1)

Levosimendan for heart failure patients receiving beta-blockers

Patients receiving beta-blockers (BB) in an acute or chronic setting have an altered beta-adrenergic receptor function and are therefore unlikely to respond optimally to catecholamines. The relevant clinical contexts are as follows: (i) patients with acute myocardial infarction given BB prophylactically who subsequently develop cardiogenic shock and require inotropic support, (ii) patients with chronic heart failure who are under chronic BB therapy and have acute on chronic cardiac decompensation, and (iii) patients with accidental/intentional BB intoxication. When beta-adrenergic receptors number and/or function are decreased, levosimendan appears as the drug of choice because its mechanisms of action are independent of this receptor. This is supported by a few experimental and clinical studies. In an animal model of acute intoxication with propranolol, Leppikangas et al. demonstrated that levosimendan, but not dobutamine or placebo, was able to increase stroke volume, inotropism, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure. This was associated with a 100% survival of animals with levosimendan, as compared to 20% with dobutamine or placebo. In a small number (n = 52) of patients with acute or chronic heart failure and treated with beta-blockers, a prospective randomized double-blind international study found that levosimendan, as opposed to dobutamine, increased cardiac index and decreased pulmonary capillary wedged pressure, but failed to improve clinical symptoms and mixed venous oxygen saturation. In addition, exploratory findings in favor of levosimendan were also reported from subgroup analyses of the LIDO and SURVIVE studies, comparing patients receiving beta-blockers versus those not receiving these drugs. Based on these possible beneficial hemodynamic effects, levosimendan is now considered the first-choice drug in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and on beta-blockers, if beta-blockade is thought to be contributing to hypotension with subsequent hypoperfusion (class IIb, evidence level C).

### Heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the quandary of beta-blockers and beta-agonists [^112gDe4p]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents many therapeutic challenges. The cornerstones of therapy are beta-blockers and beta-agonists, respectively. Their pharmacological effects are diametrically opposed, and each is purported to adversely affect the alternative condition. The tolerability of beta-blockade in patients with mild and fixed airflow obstruction likely extends to those with more severe disease. However, the evidence is rudimentary. The long-term influence of beta-blockade on pulmonary function, symptoms, and quality of life is unclear. Low-dose initiation and gradual up-titration of cardioselective beta-blockers is currently recommended. Robust clinical trials are needed to provide the answers that may finally allay physicians' mistrust of beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Beta-agonists are associated with incident heart failure in patients with pulmonary disease and with increased mortality and hospitalization in those with existing heart failure. These purported adverse effects require further investigation. In the meantime, clinicians should consider carefully the etiology of dyspnea and obtain objective evidence of airflow obstruction before prescribing beta-agonists to patients with heart failure.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Class IIa–III recommendations for asymptomatic patients and device therapy — angiotensin system blockers, ICDs, and therapies to avoid: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs can be beneficial in patients with hypertension and LVH and no symptoms of HF (Level of Evidence B). Angiotensin II receptor blockers can be beneficial in patients with low EF and no symptoms of HF who are intolerant of ACEIs (Level of Evidence: C). Placement of an ICD is reasonable in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF of 30% or less, are NYHA functional class I on chronic optimal medical therapy, and have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: B). Placement of an ICD might be considered in patients without HF who have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and an LVEF less than or equal to 30% who are in NYHA functional class I with chronic optimal medical therapy and have a reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin should not be used in patients with low EF, sinus rhythm, and no history of HF symptoms, because the risk of harm is not balanced by any known benefit (Level of Evidence: C). Use of nutritional supplements to treat structural heart disease or to prevent the development of symptoms of HF is not recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF and no symptoms of HF after MI (Level of Evidence: C).

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^115WnJKk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To clarify whether any particular β blocker is superior in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction or whether the benefits of these agents are mainly due to a class effect.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of efficacy of different β blockers in heart failure.

Data Sources

CINAHL(1982–2011), Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials (-2011), Embase (1980–2011), Medline/PubMed (1966–2011), and Web of Science (1965–2011).

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing β blockers with other β blockers or other treatments.

Data Extraction

The primary endpoint was all cause death at the longest available follow-up, assessed with odds ratios and Bayesian random effect 95% credible intervals, with independent extraction by observers.

Results

21 trials were included, focusing on atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. As expected, in the overall analysis, β blockers provided credible mortality benefits in comparison with placebo or standard treatment after a median of 12 months (odds ratio 0.69, 0.56 to 0.80). However, no obvious differences were found when comparing the different β blockers head to head for the risk of death, sudden cardiac death, death due to pump failure, or drug discontinuation. Accordingly, improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also similar irrespective of the individual study drug.

Conclusion

The benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction seem to be mainly due to a class effect, as no statistical evidence from current trials supports the superiority of any single agent over the others.

### Bisoprolol for the treatment of chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis on individual data of two placebo-controlled studies – CIBIS and CIBIS II. cardiac insufficiency bisoprolol study [^116azjtk]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the available evidence from randomized clinical trials, beta-blockers are often not used optimally in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). This meta-analysis aims at providing a precise and quantitative estimate of the benefit and risks of long-term bisoprolol on major clinical events in patients with CHF, both overall and in selected subgroups. This may help clinicians in their decisions as to whether to prescribe bisoprolol for their individual patients.

Methods

Meta-analysis was performed of results from the 2 randomized, controlled clinical studies in which bisoprolol was compared with placebo (Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study [CIBIS and CIBIS II]), which included 3288 patients with proven CHF. The main outcomes were total death, cardiovascular death, sudden death, hospitalization for heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

Results

A highly significant 29.3% relative reduction of death (17%, 40%; p = 0.00003) was observed, as well as significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death and sudden death in favor of bisoprolol. Also, a highly significant relative reduction of 18.4% (25%, 11%; p = 0.00001) in hospital admission or death was observed. A similar relative reduction of death was consistently observed in selected subgroups of patients.

Conclusions

Bisoprolol prevents major cardiovascular events in patients with CHF with a high benefit-to-risk ratio and can be recommended for these patients.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Kg3GV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway (ECDP) on patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) — focused update key changes — emphasizes SGLT inhibitor therapy throughout hospitalization regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and greater emphasis on initiating other pillars for HFrEF after stabilization; states that hospital admission from the ED is generally indicated for a new diagnosis of HF with rapidly progressive symptoms, severe congestion, or higher complexity, though some low-risk patients may receive care in an observation unit or Hospital at Home (HaH); notes typical routes to HF admission include newly diagnosed HF, chronic HF with previous therapy, or advanced HF with chronic Class IV symptoms despite previous recommended therapies; advises that daily review of the hospital trajectory often shows progress toward decongestion and stabilization for initiation of guideline-directed neurohormonal therapies but may also show stalling, failure to respond, or worsening HF warranting adjunctive diuretic therapies, reconsideration of etiology, physiology and comorbidities, possible escalation to other therapies, and re-evaluation of goals of care; specifies that SGLT inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists have little effect to reduce blood pressure and, absent contraindications, can be initiated at any time during hospitalization and continued at discharge if feasible; indicates that optimization strategies for guideline-directed neurohormonal therapies of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and ARNI/ACE inhibitor/ARB should consider previous tolerance, current hemodynamics, and kidney function; indicates that selection of ARNI/ACE inhibitor/ARB or switch from ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI are indicated for HFrEF and, with beta-blockers, can generally be initiated after clinical stabilization to optimal volume status with careful titration to avoid hypotension or kidney dysfunction during hospitalization and early after discharge; recommends providing detailed information regarding diagnoses, discharge regimen and plans to patients and referring providers for use during follow-up phone calls and first postdischarge visits, including telehealth; and highlights the increasingly important role of palliative care, with benefits from referral tools and consultation to increase completion of advance directives and reduce hospital readmission rates. These points are presented as "the 10 key changes to the 2019 ECDP in this focused update".

### Prevention and management of chronic heart failure in management of asymptomatic patients [^111sdVqN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Symptomatic heart failure is preceded by a somewhat prolonged asymptomatic stage in many patients. The number of patients with asymptomatic heart dysfunction is about 4-fold greater than the number of patients with clinically overt heart failure. Pharmacologic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (in particular carvedilol) of asymptomatic patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can prevent or delay the occurrence of symptoms and reduce mortality in the long term. Thus, it would be of utmost importance to recognize and appropriately treat these patients before they develop heart failure symptoms. The cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic heart dysfunction in the general population and in cohorts at risk has not been extensively evaluated. A normal electrocardiogram has a high negative predictive value in patients at risk. Echocardiography is the best tool for diagnosis and characterization of heart dysfunction, but extensive use is limited by availability and cost. Natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) are very sensitive markers of heart dysfunction and volume overload, and their measurement has been proposed as a first-line test to select patients who need echocardiography. The definition of the etiology of LV dysfunction — in particular, of the ischemic etiology — has prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition to revascularization, pharmacologic treatment with antiplatelets and statins is helpful in preventing new ischemic events and the development of heart failure. The prevention, or at least the delay, of clinical manifestations of heart failure is strongly related to an effective approach to the asymptomatic stage. Therefore, it is important to educate the entire medical community, particularly physicians in the primary care setting, about recognition and treatment of these patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renin-angiotensin system inhibition is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. The clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients is recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. In an RCT comparing valsartan/sacubitril with enalapril, the ARNI reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization significantly, by 20%. The use of ARNI is associated with the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency and may lead to angioedema, as well.

### A trial of the β-blocker bucindolol in patients with advanced chronic heart failure [^112aVLdh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonists reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic heart failure, their effect on survival in patients with more advanced heart failure is unknown.

Methods

A total of 2708 patients with heart failure designated as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III (in 92 percent of the patients) or IV (in 8 percent) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent or lower were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either bucindolol (1354 patients) or placebo (1354 patients) and followed for the primary end point of death from any cause.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial after the seventh interim analysis. At that time, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (unadjusted P = 0.16). The results presented here are based on complete follow-up at the time of study termination (average, 2.0 years). There were a total of 449 deaths in the placebo group (33 percent) and 411 deaths in the bucindolol group (30 percent; adjusted P = 0.13). The risk of the secondary end point of death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the bucindolol group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99), as was the risk of heart transplantation or death (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.99).

Conclusions

In a demographically diverse group of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure, bucindolol resulted in no significant overall survival benefit.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a commonly seen clinical entity in the family physician's practice. This clinical review focuses on the pharmacologic management of chronic HFrEF. Special attention is paid to the classification of heart failure and the newest recommendations from the American Heart Association concerning the use of guideline-directed medical therapy. β blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are discussed in detail. The new emphasis on sacubitril-valsartan and SGLT2i's as therapies for HFrEF are reviewed, followed by a brief discussion of more advanced therapies and comorbidity management.

### Role of high-dose beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and elevated heart rate [^115TTY93]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers in high target doses are recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but not for preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Treatment benefits are often more pronounced in high-risk subgroups, and patients with HFpEF with heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute have emerged as such a high-risk subgroup. We examined the associations of high-dose beta-blocker use with outcomes in these patients.

Methods

Of the 8462 hospitalized patients with heart failure with ejection fraction ≥ 50% in the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, 5422 had a discharge heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute. Of these, 4537 had no contraindications to beta-blocker use, of which 2797 (2592 with dose data) received prescriptions for beta-blockers. Of the 2592, 730 received high-dose beta-blockers, defined as atenolol ≥ 100 mg/day, carvedilol ≥ 50 mg/day, metoprolol tartrate or succinate ≥ 200 mg/day, or bisoprolol ≥ 10 mg/day, and 1740 received no beta-blockers. Using propensity scores for the receipt of high-dose beta-blockers, we assembled a matched cohort of 1280 patients, balanced on 58 characteristics.

Results

All-cause mortality occurred in 63% and 68% of matched patients receiving high-dose beta-blocker vs no beta-blocker, respectively, during 6 years (median, 2.8) of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.98; p = 0.027). The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause readmission and the combined endpoint of all-cause readmission or all-cause mortality associated with high-dose beta-blocker use were 0.90 (0.81–1.02) and 0.89 (0.80–1.00), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with HFpEF and heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute, high-dose beta-blocker use was associated with a significantly lower risk of death. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to examine this association.

### Prevention and management of chronic heart failure in patients at risk [^112YgW4V]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence and incidence of chronic heart failure (HF) have now reached epidemic proportions. However, the issue of the prevention of HF has been raised only recently. New US guidelines have introduced a new classification system that includes 4 categories: patients at risk, patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, patients with symptomatic HF, and those with refractory HF. Because coronary artery disease is the major cause of HF, its risk factors are also those of HF. Hypertension favors the development of HF through accelerated atherosclerosis and increased left ventricular wall stress and hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy is also a powerful risk factor for HF, independent of blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics are the antihypertensive agents that have been associated with favorable effects in patients with overt HF. Therefore, they may be preferred in the prevention of this syndrome. Diabetes is the most frequent noncardiac comorbidity of HF and is independently associated with an increased risk. Normalization of glycemic and glycosylated hemoglobin levels is a desirable goal of treatment. However, no direct evidence exists in the prevention of HF. A greater control of the other risk factors (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) is, on the other hand, particularly important. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have both been shown to have favorable effects across all spectrums of severity of HF. The ACE inhibitor ramipril has also been shown to prevent the development of HF in patients at risk without left ventricular dysfunction. The role of antiplatelet agents, warfarin, and statins is clear in the prevention of the coronary artery disease. However, it has not been adequately assessed in patients with HF and awaits the results of ongoing trials.

### Age is not a significant risk factor for failed trial of β-blocker therapy in older patients with chronic heart failure [^116TgMg2]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate how well older heart failure patients tolerate beta-blockers in everyday clinical practice.

Design

Retrospective casenote analysis.

Setting

Specialist heart failure clinic in a large teaching hospital.

Participants

226 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure and evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Measurements

Data on age, sex, comorbid illness, other medications, duration of beta-blocker therapy, side-effects and reasons for discontinuation.

Results

Patients aged 75 years and over had a higher level of comorbid disease and worse New York Heart Association status. Despite this, 60.4% of those aged 75 or over had been tried on a beta-blocker (versus 69% of those aged < 75), and of those tried, 80% of those aged 75 or over were still taking a beta-blocker at the time of survey (versus 86% of those aged < 75). Forty-seven percent of those aged 75 or over had at least one side-effect recorded (versus 48% of those aged < 75). Significant risk factors for failing a trial of beta-blocker therapy were worse New York Heart Association status and worse left ventricular function, but importantly not age.

Conclusions

A high proportion of older heart failure patients tolerate beta-blockers. Side-effects and failure rates are comparable to younger patients. Left ventricular function and worse New York Heart Association class, rather than age, predict low tolerability of therapy. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether frail patients with heart failure can improve their quality of life by taking beta-blockers.

Focus on heart failure after first appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy — In patients with heart failure who have not previously had a life-threatening arrhythmia, the first event identifies them as being at higher risk than before for both sudden death and death due to heart failure, with the majority of patients surviving less than 2 years, and they should trigger reevaluation of treatable causes of heart failure and of the medical regimen. Particular care should be paid to the titration of beta-adrenergic blockers, because up titration can lead to heart failure exacerbation and must be attempted in small dose increments, many patients with symptomatic heart failure cannot tolerate "target doses" of beta-adrenergic blockers, and it is crucial that the management team evaluate the heart failure profile, review the medical regimen, and plan for ongoing care.

### Effect on survival and hospitalization of initiating treatment for chronic heart failure with bisoprolol followed by enalapril, as compared with the opposite sequence: results of the randomized cardiac insufficiency bisoprolol study (CIBIS) III [^117MG1BU]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), a beta-blocker is generally added to a regimen containing an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is unknown whether beta-blockade as initial therapy may be as useful.

Methods and Results

We randomized 1010 patients with mild to moderate CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, who were not receiving ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, to open-label monotherapy with either bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg QD; n = 505) or enalapril (target dose 10 mg BID; n = 505) for 6 months, followed by their combination for 6 to 24 months. The 2 strategies were blindly compared with regard to the combined primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and with regard to each of these end point components individually. Bisoprolol-first treatment was noninferior to enalapril-first treatment if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the absolute between-group difference was < 5%, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17. In the intention-to-treat sample, the primary end point occurred in 178 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment versus 186 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -1.6%, 95% CI -7.6 to 4.4%, HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.16). In the per-protocol sample, 163 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment had a primary end point, versus 165 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -0.7%, 95% CI -6.6 to 5.1%, HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21). With bisoprolol-first treatment, 65 patients died, versus 73 with enalapril-first treatment (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22), and 151 versus 157 patients were hospitalized (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.19).

Conclusions

Although noninferiority of bisoprolol-first versus enalapril-first treatment was not proven in the per-protocol analysis, our results indicate that it may be as safe and efficacious to initiate treatment for CHF with bisoprolol as with enalapril.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice (Table 1, Fig. 5). In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI at the expense of higher rates of incident HF, with no effect on mortality. In patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality, but they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved LVEF. In perioperative patients, although beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, although beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, they were inferior to RAS antagonists and CCB. These findings highlight the importance of an individualised assessment of indication, comorbidity and understanding of the goal of therapy before routine commencement of beta-blockers.

### A randomized trial of β-blockade in heart failure. the cardiac insufficiency bisoprolol study (CIBIS). CIBIS investigators and committees [^114mTDy6]. Circulation (1994). Low credibility.

The study CIBIS was published by CIBIS Investigators. and colleagues in 1994 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the CIBIS study, the trial question was: what is the role of β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol in patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and a LVEF of < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy? In the CIBIS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CIBIS study, the population was: 641 patients (112 female, 529 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and an LVEF < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy. The key exclusion criteria were LV diastolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease awaiting bypass surgery or a recent history of myocardial infarction < 3 months, insulin-dependent diabetes, asthma, renal insufficiency hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, or malignant disease. In the CIBIS study, the interventions were: n = 320 β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol (recommended dose increment or at one of the dose levels of 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, or 5 mg/d) n = 321 placebo (matching placebo). In the CIBIS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death (16.6% vs. 20.9%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.15). In the CIBIS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for cardiac decompensation (19.1% vs. 28%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.2) Significant increase in reduction by at least one NYHA functional class (21.3% vs. 15%; RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.78). In the CIBIS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in premature treatment withdrawals. In the CIBIS study, the conclusion was: in patients with chronic HF of various etiologies and an LVEF < 40% on diuretic and vasodilator therapy, β-blockade therapy with bisoprolol was not superior to placebo with respect to death.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117BvGR2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Third, physicians may be unaware of the directions that were provided to investigators in clinical trials regarding the uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists. In these trials, physicians were required to increase the dose of the study medication to the specified target dose in a standardized manner, and to make an ongoing and concerted effort to achieve and maintain the target dose, even if patients experienced unwanted changes in blood pressure, renal function, or electrolytes. Reaching values for systolic blood pressure or heart rate in the 'normal range' was not considered a valid reason for interruption of the forced‐titration strategy. For example, many physicians mistakenly believe that systolic blood pressures of 100–120 mmHg are sufficiently low to prevent further dose uptitration. 41 However, in the landmark clinical trials, physicians were typically advised to continue uptitration as long as the systolic blood pressure was > 85–90 mmHg, if patients were not experiencing recurrent symptoms related to hypotension. Similarly, in trials of beta‐blockers, investigators were required to uptitrate to target doses even if the heart rate on a subtarget dose declined to 65 bpm. These strategies are contrary to commonly‐held beliefs that patients with chronic heart failure require certain levels of perfusion pressure or that they need a heart rate of 70–80 bpm to maintain cardiac output.

### Insufficient reduction in heart rate during hospitalization despite β-blocker treatment in acute decompensated heart failure: insights from the ASCEND-HF trial [^116q5kLs]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Heart failure (HF) can be associated with a higher resting heart rate (HR), and an elevated HR is associated with adverse long-term events. However, the mechanistic and causal role of HR in HF is unclear. This study aimed to investigate changes in HR during hospitalization, and the association between discharge HR and clinical outcomes as well as an interaction with beta-blocker therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF).

Methods and Results

We studied 2906 patients with an LVEF ≤ 35%, without AF, who were enrolled in the ASCEND-HF trial. A total of 2492 (85.8%) patients had a HR ≥ 70 b.p.m. at baseline and 1580 (54.4%) patients were on beta-blocker treatment. Although HR was gradually reduced from baseline to discharge (85.5 ± 15.9 b.p.m. at baseline, 81.7 ± 14.1 b.p.m. at 24h from treatment initiation, and 79.1 ± 12.2 b.p.m. at discharge), 80.2% of the patients still had a HR ≥ 70 b.p.m. at discharge. Patients with a HR ≥ 70 b.p.m. at discharge had significantly lower survival rates than those with a HR < 70 b.p.m. (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.04, P = 0.002). Moreover, HR at discharge had a curvilinear association with mortality, and had no significant interaction effect with beta-blocker therapy at discharge (P = 0.82).

Conclusions

Despite current beta-blocker therapy, many patients with hospitalized ADHF with reduced LVEF have relatively high discharge HR, and discharge HR is associated with higher mortality. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal strategy for HR control to improve outcomes.

### Dosing of β-blocker therapy before, during, and after hospitalization for heart failure (from organized program to initiate lifesaving treatment in hospitalized patients with heart failure) [^1119ia2u]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started. The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was < 1/2 the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 ± 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 ± 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during the HF hospitalization. More than 2/3 of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively. In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less that the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines. In the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge, little up-titration in beta-blocker dosing occurs. Further efforts are needed to help understand and overcome this beta-blocker titration gap.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116p4DEi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — pharmacologic recommendations: In patients with HFmrEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Among patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 41%–49%), use of evidence-based beta blockers for HFrEF, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^115i9h2J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unclear whether beta‐blocker use at hospital admission is associated with better in‐hospital outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the factors independently associated with beta‐blocker use at admission, and the effect of beta‐blocker use at admission on in‐hospital mortality in 3817 patients with acute decompensated heart failure enrolled in the Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure registry. There were 1512 patients (39.7%) receiving, and 2305 patients (60.3%) not receiving beta‐blockers at admission for the index acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization. Factors independently associated with beta‐blocker use at admission were previous heart failure hospitalization, history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m². Factors independently associated with no beta‐blocker use were asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, dementia, older age, and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. Patients on beta‐blockers had significantly lower in‐hospital mortality rates (4.4% versus 7.6%, P < 0.001). Even after adjusting for confounders, beta‐blocker use at admission remained significantly associated with lower in‐hospital mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.60, P < 0.001). Furthermore, beta‐blocker use at admission was significantly associated with both lower cardiovascular mortality risk and lower noncardiovascular mortality risk. The association of beta‐blocker use with lower in‐hospital mortality risk was relatively more prominent in patients receiving high dose beta‐blockers. The magnitude of the effect of beta‐blocker use was greater in patients with previous heart failure hospitalization than in patients without (P for interaction 0.04).

Conclusions

Beta‐blocker use at admission was associated with lower in‐hospital mortality in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Medication use and medication decisions and changes for combinations of ejection fraction categories, acute heart failure versus outpatient heart failure, and de novo versus pre‐existing heart failure. Bars show treatment at presentation (before acute heart failure event and before outpatient heart failure clinic visit), treatment decisions, and treatment at discharge for acute heart failure and after the clinic visit for outpatient heart failure. The sum of the bars is the percentage treated after the encounter, reflecting treatment decisions and implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy in Europe. ACE‐I, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNi, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2/1i, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2/1 inhibitor.

As an example, among patients enrolled with de novo AHF, beta‐blockers were used at presentation and continued in 38% in HFrEF, 42% in HFmrEF, and 48% in HFpEF, started in 53%, 36%, and 32%, respectively, and stopped in 0.2%, 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively. ARNi was used after the visit in 9.1–38% of HFrEF, depending on whether pre‐existing or not and whether AHF or outpatient HF. The equivalent for SGLT2/1i over the entire EF spectrum was 0.7–8.4% (enrolment occurred in 2018–2020) and for MRAs in HFrEF 69–79%. The key percentages reflecting quality of care were use of EF‐specific GDMT after the encounter, and these were in HFrEF: RASi 89%, ARNi 29%, beta‐blocker 92%, MRA 78%, and oral loop diuretics 85%; HFmrEF oral loop diuretics 81%, and HFpEF oral loop diuretics 80%.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^112mRG8e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Abi Khalil et al reported the results of an extensive HF registry of the middle east, which enrolled 8066 patients admitted with ADHF in a single center. In this registry, the in‐hospital mortality rate in patients treated with beta‐blockers at admission was significantly lower than that in patients not treated with beta‐blockers at admission (3.6% versus 14.4%). After adjusting for confounders, the odds ratio of patients with versus without beta‐blockers at admission was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.23–0.61, P = 0.001) for in‐hospital death. However, it was an old and long‐lasting registry starting in 1991 and included when beta‐blocker therapy was not widely implemented. Therefore, the conclusion might not apply to current patients. Furthermore, one‐third of the patients were accompanied by ACS, and the benefit of beta‐blockers might be through the reduction of acute ischemia in patients with ACS. Another report from the Italian Survey on Acute Heart Failure revealed the beneficial role of beta‐blockers in patients admitted for worsening HF. In‐hospital mortality was 2.8% in 362 patients receiving beta‐blockers at admission and continuing during hospitalization compared with 10.1% in 811 patients not receiving beta‐blockers at admission and not starting during hospitalization. The association between beta‐blocker use and lower in‐hospital mortality was significant after adjusting for clinical, hemodynamic, and therapeutic variables. Although it was a registry in a real‐world setting like the present study, it was performed in 2003 and the enrolled patients were relatively younger. In recent years, HF patients in developed countries have become older with a high prevalence of HF with preserved ejection fraction. Therefore, more studies are needed to evaluate the role of beta‐blocker use at admission in the more current population of ADHF.

### Comparison of treatment initiation with bisoprolol vs. enalapril in chronic heart failure patients: rationale and design of CIBIS-III [^1147v4mq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers are standard therapy for chronic heart failure (CHF). beta-blockers are recommended to be initiated after ACE-inhibitors, but this order is not evidence based. The initiation order may be important since many, especially elderly CHF patients cannot tolerate target doses of both. Data suggest that beta-blockers may be more important to CHF patients than ACE-inhibitors, especially in early stages of CHF.

Aims

To compare the effect on combined death or hospitalisation of initial monotherapy with either bisoprolol or enalapril, followed by combination therapy.

Methods

One-thousand CHF patients without ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker or angiotensin-receptor-blocker therapy will be randomised 1:1 to monotherapy with either enalapril or bisoprolol for 6 months, followed by combined therapy for 6–18 months. The primary objective is to show non-inferiority for bisoprolol-first vs. enalapril-first regarding combined death or hospitalisation. If that is shown, superiority for bisoprolol-first will be tested.

Conclusions

If the trial shows non-inferiority for bisoprolol-first vs. enalapril-first, the first CHF therapy may be chosen based on individual judgement in each patient. If bisoprolol-first is superior to enalapril-first, a beta-blocker should be given prior to an ACE-inhibitor in CHF, and the paradigm of testing CHF compounds against a background of ACE-inhibitor therapy will be challenged.

### Β-blockers in hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction: a review of the literature [^113xLvwx]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Carvedilol

Several major trials have established the CV benefits of carvedilol over traditional non-vasodilating BBs in patients with HF. A meta-analysis of 19 placebo-controlled RCTs tested the efficacy of carvedilol versus metoprolol in terms of LVEF in patients with chronic HF. Carvedilol significantly increased LVEF when compared with metoprolol (placebo-corrected increases of +0.065 vs +0.038, p = 0.0002) as well as in the four active-controlled trials which directly compared carvedilol versus metoprolol (+0.084 vs +0.057, p = 0.009), and these benefits were derived in both patients with and without CHD.

A randomised trial of 51 patients with HF with a mean LVEF of 37% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were treated with carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol, and subsequently returned to their original BB treatment. N -terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, which are elevated in HF and have been shown to be a better predictor of major CV events than C reactive protein, were measured. Carvedilol reduced NT-proBNP levels significantly better than did either metoprolol or bisoprolol (mean NT-proBNP level were: 1001, 1371, 1349 ng/L, respectively (p < 0.01).

### Evidence… [^1119FcqR]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The first compelling survival evidence supporting the use of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure came from the carvedilol research program, which was conducted in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and predominantly mild to moderate impairment of exercise tolerance. 1–5 In these studies, carvedilol, which is a nonselective beta blocker with alpha 1-blocker vasodilating properties, reduced mortality by 65 percent and hospitalizations by 29 percent. Carvedilol therapy also resulted in significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and sense of well-being. In the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II, 6 treatment with bisoprolol, a beta 1-selective blocker, resulted in a 34 percent reduction of mortality in patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure and systolic dysfunction. The reduction in all-cause hospitalizations was approximately 20 percent.

These three trials, 1, 6, 7 along with a series of smaller controlled studies, enrolled more than 10, 000 patients and conclusively demonstrated a remarkable reduction in the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure who were treated with one of several beta-adrenergic blockers. Patients Without Systolic Dysfunction. Beta blockers have not been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure but normal systolic function. These patients, who probably account for more than 30 percent of all patients with chronic heart failure, are often elderly and have hypertension, coronary artery disease or diabetes. Although these patients often tolerate beta blockers and might benefit from their anti-ischemic and blood pressure–lowering effects, they should not receive beta blocker therapy for the primary treatment of heart failure.

CHOICE OF BETA BLOCKER Carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate have all been shown to be beneficial in patients with chronic heart failure. At present, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration has labeled only carvedilol for use in slowing the progression of chronic heart failure. Carvedilol is also the only beta blocker that is available in the requisite low starting dose. No studies to date have compared the effects of carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol succinate on clinical outcomes.

### Beta-blocker therapy for chronic heart failure… [^111cxbbT]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have become standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction. Kukin reviewed clinical efficacy and mortality trials of beta blockers, as well as factors to consider when prescribing these drugs. Treatment with beta blockers should be initiated in patients who are stable and euvolemic and do not have a contraindication to their use. These drugs should be titrated slowly to the target dosage or the maximum tolerated dosage. If patients cannot tolerate titration, low-dose beta-blocker therapy should be continued because clinical benefits occur even with smaller amounts. Adverse effects of beta blockers include hypotension, fluid retention, bradycardia, and heart block. Hypotension typically is short-lived; one solution to this problem is short-term dosage reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients who also use those medications. Fluid retention may require an increased dosage of diuretic.

Most patients with bradycardia or heart block are asymptomatic; however, dosage reduction or discontinuation of beta blockers is required if second- or third-degree heart block develops. Tapering the dosage is important because abrupt discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy may elicit coronary insufficiency. The recommended starting dosage of carvedilol is 3. 125 mg twice daily. The mortality benefits of metoprolol have been proved only for the extended-release form. The theoretic benefits of nonselective agents such as carvedilol have not translated into a mortality benefit over beta 1-selective agents in currently available trials. A number of major trials have evaluated the mortality benefits of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure. While there may be individual benefits with either drug, to date, no large-scale studies have directly compared mortality with the use of extended-release metoprolol succinate versus carvedilol.

The author concluded that no data support the choice of one agent over the other. editor's note: The mortality benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure is clear. Studies continue to show less than ideal use of these medications in patients with chronic heart failure. Current expert guidelines recommend the use of beta blockers in all stable patients who have evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, unless there is a contraindication to their use. A European trial comparing metoprolol and carvedilol is nearing completion, but it does not compare the extended-release form of metoprolol with carvedilol. — c. c.

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^1161D2Bs]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, β-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients. with class II and III heart failure. Conclusions Tested in more than 10 000 patients, β-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in class II through IV heart failure. Along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, β-blockers have strengthened the armamentarium to improve clinical outcomes of heart failure patients. hypertension or AMI excluded patients with heart failure. Until recently, national guidelines, 17–20 the US Food and Drug Administration, and package inserts stated that β-blockers were contraindicated in patients with heart failure.

In 1973, Finn Waagstein et al, 21 convinced that the heart-rate–lowering properties of β-blockers could provide. in survival and functional status in patients with moderate heart failure and already receiving diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Although patients treated with bisoprolol had marked improvements in functional class and reduced readmissions, the observed difference in mortality between groups did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.22; relative risk, 0. 80;. In practical terms, however, the observed 23% reduction in mortality represents a clinically important outcome. With the emergence of strong new evidence demonstrating that β-blockers decrease morbidity and mortality in a broad range of patients with heart failure, guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, 12 the European Society of Cardiology, 11 and the Heart Failure Society of America10 all strongly support the use of β-blockers in. patients with heart failure.

The recently published, revised heart failure guidelines of the American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association12 and the European Society of Cardiology clinical practice guidelines11 recommend use of β-blockers in a broader range of heart failure patients, including those with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction and those with severe symptomatic disease. The science supporting β-blockers must be translated into practice safely and rationally if the agents are to achieve their full potential.

### Adverse effects of β-blocker therapy for patients with heart failure… [^113Raxrx]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background β-Blockers substantially improve survival in patients with chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but concerns about cardiovascular adverse effects may deter physicians from prescribing this therapy. We performed an overview of randomized β-blocker trials in patients with HF to quantify the risks of these adverse effects. Methods Heart failure trials of β-blockers were identified by electronic searches of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 2002. The random-effects model was used to combine results from individual trials and calculate estimates of risks associated with therapy. Although the use of β-blocker therapy was once thought to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure with systolic dysfunction, studies have shown that it reduces mortality and hospitalizations in this population.

1–4 Systematic overviews of β-blocker trials in patients with HF have demonstrated reductions in mortality of approximately 30%, 5 and recently published clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend the use of β-blockers. 6, 7 The same clinical guidelines, however, highlight common cardiovascular adverse effects associated with β-blocker therapy including HF deterioration, hypotension, dizziness, bradycardia, and fatigue. Similarly, β-blocker therapy was associated with a significant 27% relative reduction in all-cause mortality and an absolute risk reduction of 34 deaths per 1000 patients per year, equivalent to 29 patients treated with β-blockers for 1 year to prevent 1 death. For worsening HF, β-blocker therapy was also associated with a significant 17% RR reduction and an absolute risk reduction of 52 per 1000 patients per year, equivalent to 19 patients treated for 1 year to avoid 1 additional case of worsening HF. In conclusion, β-blocker therapy in patients with HF was well tolerated and associated with fewer overall withdrawals and less HF deterioration than placebo. β-Blocker therapy was associated with small absolute increased risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia but not of fatigue. Our findings should alleviate concerns of physicians who are reluctant to prescribe β-blockers because of their cardiovascular adverse effects and support the implementation of this lifesaving therapy to appropriate candidates with HF.

### Β-blockers in heart failure… [^113AvaYc]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Previous guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association 14 and current guidelines from the Heart Failure Society of America11 have recommended β-blockers for certain patients with mild to moderate heart failure according to New York Heart Association functional classification. 4, 6, 7 Prompted by new evidence, 5, 10 the most recent ACC–AHA guidelines13 have introduced a broader disease-progression staging. system that ranges from patients without structural heart disease but at risk for heart failure to severely ill patients with a need for specialized interventions. The ACC–AHA guidelines endorse the use of β-blockers for all patients with heart failure or those at risk for heart failure, except.

Medications should include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor Evidence is best for patients with a risk for worsened heart failure caused by concurrent hypertension, coronary artery disease, or another cause Structural Heart Disease With Prior or Current Symptoms of Heart Failure Dyspnea on mild to moderate exertion or dyspnea at rest if otherwise. Guidelines also recommend β-blockers for certain patients at risk for developing heart failure caused by hypertension or coronary artery disease. Patients with severe symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations should be evaluated by a physician experienced in treating heart failure. stable fluid status. On the other hand, β-blockers should not be used in patients who require the intensive care unit, intravenous vasodilators, or intravenous positive inotropic agents.

13 Patients with symptomatic bradycardia should not receive a β-blocker until the cause of bradycardia is ascertained and treated. The recent ACC–AHA13 and Heart Failure Society of America guidelines11 do not recommend a specific heart-rate threshold. This patient is an example of a patient with ACC–AHA stage D heart failure. Evidence is limited regarding the general use of β-blockers in such patients, so patients must be individually evaluated to determine the balance of risk and benefit. Given this patient's complexity, β-blockers perhaps should not have been initiated until his condition was somewhat better.
