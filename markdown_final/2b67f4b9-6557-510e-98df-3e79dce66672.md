## Question

What did SADHART show about the cardiac safety of starting sertraline after an acute MI or unstable angina?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the SADHART trial showed about the cardiac safety of starting sertraline after an acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and population to ensure we're interpreting the right evidence. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary safety outcomes and their statistical significance. Next, I will examine arrhythmia and ECG endpoints, including QTc and ventricular ectopy. After that, I should review clinical cardiovascular events and mortality. I will then consider mechanistic safety signals like platelet and autonomic markers. Finally, I will integrate guideline and meta-analytic context to synthesize a practical, clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the study framework so I don't jump to conclusions. SADHART was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline versus placebo for 24 weeks in 369 patients with major depressive disorder within 30 days of hospitalization for acute MI or unstable angina, with a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in and flexible dosing of 50–200 mg/day, which establishes high internal validity for safety inference in this exact population [^111FvkhR] [^112qRpRE].

> I need to check the primary safety endpoint and its results. The prespecified primary safety outcome was change in left ventricular ejection fraction at 16 weeks; sertraline showed no significant effect on LVEF compared with placebo, with mean changes that were essentially flat in both groups, indicating no detrimental impact on systolic function in the early post-ACS window [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

> Next, I should review arrhythmia and ECG safety signals carefully. Wait, let me verify the QTc data and ventricular ectopy. Sertraline did not increase the rate of QTc greater than 450 ms at endpoint and did not increase treatment-emergent ventricular premature complex runs, supporting a lack of proarrhythmic signal on these measures in this population and dosing context [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE]. Hold on, I should also confirm heart rate variability findings; a dedicated HRV substudy showed sertraline was associated with improved ultra-low frequency power and a trajectory of HRV recovery that paralleled nondepressed post-MI patients, whereas placebo-treated depressed patients showed declining HRV, suggesting favorable autonomic modulation without excess arrhythmia risk [^111thUxc].

> I will now examine hard clinical cardiovascular events and mortality. Severe cardiovascular adverse events occurred in 14.5% with sertraline versus 22.4% with placebo, a difference that did not reach statistical significance but is directionally favorable. Deaths during the 24-week treatment period were numerically lower with sertraline (1.1% vs 2.7%), again not statistically significant, reinforcing safety without clear mortality benefit in this short-term trial [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

> Let me consider mechanistic safety signals that might explain clinical neutrality. A platelet/endothelial biomarker substudy showed sertraline significantly reduced platelet activation markers such as beta-thromboglobulin and P-selectin despite concomitant aspirin and clopidogrel, supporting an antiplatelet effect that could theoretically reduce thrombotic risk, although this did not translate into a significant reduction in clinical events within the trial's timeframe and power [^1165w4yZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability. I should confirm how guidelines and broader evidence position this. Contemporary reviews and guidelines consistently cite SADHART as establishing the cardiovascular safety of sertraline in post-ACS depression, and SSRIs are generally preferred over tricyclics in cardiac patients given the latter's arrhythmogenic risk; meta-analytic data in post-ACS cohorts also suggest SSRIs are safe and may reduce all-cause rehospitalizations, though mortality benefits are not firmly established across all trials [^1171k3WK] [^112JTibZ] [^1153upYS].

> But wait, what if there are important exceptions or timing considerations. I should double-check that SADHART excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, recent bypass surgery, severe bradycardia, or nonatherosclerotic etiologies, so safety is established in medically stabilized, appropriately selected post-ACS patients with MDD; in patients with decompensated heart failure or high arrhythmic risk, evidence is less definitive, and while sertraline appears safe in HF trials, efficacy for depression is limited and cardiac outcome benefits have not been demonstrated in that population [^111FvkhR] [^114MYyQM].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. SADHART demonstrated that starting sertraline within 30 days of acute MI or unstable angina in patients with major depressive disorder is cardiovasculary safe: there was no adverse effect on LVEF, no increase in QTc or ventricular ectopy, and no excess of severe cardiovascular adverse events or mortality during 24 weeks, with a favorable antiplatelet signal and possible autonomic benefit; clinically, sertraline is a reasonable first-line antidepressant choice for post-ACS depression when patients are medically stabilized and carefully selected [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE] [^1165w4yZ] [^111thUxc].

SADHART showed that **sertraline is safe** for patients with depression after acute MI or unstable angina, with **no significant effect on LVEF**, no excess arrhythmias, and no increase in major adverse cardiac events versus placebo [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE]. The trial did not demonstrate a significant reduction in depression scores overall, but **benefit was seen in patients with recurrent depression** or more severe baseline depression [^111FvkhR] [^113iR26P]. Sertraline is appropriate for depression after ACS when cardiac function is stable, with monitoring for GI side effects and drug interactions [^111FvkhR] [^112GqV6g].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
- **Population**: 369 patients with MDD within 30 days of hospitalization for acute MI or unstable angina.
- **Intervention**: Sertraline 50–200 mg/day (mean 69 mg/day) vs placebo for 24 weeks.
- **Primary outcome**: Change in LVEF at 16 weeks; secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events, arrhythmias, and depression response [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

---

## Cardiac safety outcomes

### Primary safety outcome: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)

Sertraline showed **no significant effect on LVEF** at 16 weeks (mean change: sertraline 0.0% vs placebo +1.0%; P = 0.74), indicating no adverse impact on systolic function [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

---

### Secondary safety outcomes

- **Arrhythmias**: No significant difference in ventricular premature complex runs or other arrhythmias.
- **QTc prolongation**: No significant difference in QTc > 450 ms at endpoint (12% sertraline vs 13% placebo).
- **Major adverse cardiac events**: No significant difference in death or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (17.2% sertraline vs 22.4% placebo; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51–1.16) [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

---

## Clinical efficacy outcomes

Overall, **HAM-D scores did not differ significantly** between sertraline and placebo in the total sample (P = 0.14) [^111FvkhR]. However, in patients with recurrent depression or more severe baseline depression, sertraline produced significantly greater improvement in depression symptoms and clinical global impression scores [^111FvkhR] [^113iR26P].

---

## Adverse effects and tolerability

Sertraline was generally well tolerated; **gastrointestinal side effects** (nausea, diarrhea) were more frequent than with placebo but rarely led to discontinuation [^111FvkhR]. No significant differences were observed in cardiovascular adverse events, including blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG parameters [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Safety**: Sertraline is safe for depression after acute MI or unstable angina, with no adverse cardiac effects.
- **Efficacy**: Consider sertraline especially in patients with recurrent or severe depression after ACS.
- **Monitoring**: Routine cardiac monitoring is not required beyond standard care; monitor for GI side effects and drug interactions [^111FvkhR] [^112GqV6g].

---

## Limitations of the study

The trial was **underpowered to detect differences** in rare cardiovascular events or mortality. In addition, the 24-week treatment period limits assessment of long-term cardiac outcomes [^111FvkhR].

---

SADHART demonstrates that **sertraline is safe** for depression after acute MI or unstable angina, with no adverse cardiac effects and potential benefit in recurrent or severe depression, supporting its use in this population [^111FvkhR] [^116w3iaE].

The study SADHART was published by Glassman AH and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Unstable angina and Major depressive disorder. In the SADHART study, the trial question was: what is the role of sertraline treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina? In the SADHART study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SADHART study, the population was: 369 patients (133 female, 236 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions who have major depressive disorder. The key exclusion criteria were uncontrolled hypertension, MI or unstable angina of nonatherosclerotic etiology, alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in past 6 months, history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, organic brain syndrome, or dementia. In the SADHART study, the interventions were: n = 186 sertraline (in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d for 24 weeks) n = 183 placebo (matching placebo for 24 weeks). In the SADHART study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in LVEF at week 16 (11% vs. 13%; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0 to 1.7). In the SADHART study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in CGI-I in group with at least 1 prior episode of depression (72% vs. 51%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.34) No significant difference in death and urgent cardiovascular rehospitalizations (17.2% vs. 22.4%; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.16) No significant difference in the rate of death during the 24-week course (1.1% vs. 2.7%; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.39). In the SADHART study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex runs or other cardiac measures. significant differences in nausea (19.9% vs. 10.9%), diarrhea (18.8% vs. 7.7%). In the SADHART study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions who have major depressive disorder, sertraline was not superior to placebo with respect to LVEF at week 16.

### Safety and efficacy of sertraline for depression in patients with CHF (SADHART-CHF): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline for major depression with congestive heart failure [^112pJNcV]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sertraline, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, has demonstrated substantial mood improvement in patients with post myocardial infarction or with unstable angina. The impact of sertraline on the prognosis and depression of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown.

Method

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of MDD in patients with HF. The study is designed also to examine the effects of treating depression on cardiac events and morbidity/mortality in patients with HF. Approximately 500 men and women who are ≥ 45 years of age with current MDD and chronic systolic HF, characterized by left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% and New York Heart Association class ≥ II, comprise the study population. Eligible participants are randomized to either sertraline or placebo for a 12-week acute treatment phase. All patients, regardless of acute treatment phase completion, are followed routinely until the last subject completes 6-month follow-up. Quality of life and certain physiologic parameters, as well as pro-inflammatory and HF biomarkers, that may reflect the impact of sertraline in this particular population are measured at baseline and at the end of the acute treatment phase.

Conclusion

Because of the high prevalence of depression and its significant adverse impact on prognosis of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and HF, the Safety and Efficacy of Sertraline for Depression in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure (SADHART-CHF) trial aims to assess the effects of sertraline on response of depression as well as on the cardiac prognosis of patients with HF.

### Sertraline treatment of major depression in patients with acute MI or unstable angina [^111FvkhR]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in 15% to 23% of patients with acute coronary syndromes and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, no published evidence exists that antidepressant drugs are safe or efficacious in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment of MDD in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina and free of other life-threatening medical conditions.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 40 outpatient cardiology centers and psychiatry clinics in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Enrollment began in April 1997 and follow-up ended in April 2001.

Patients

A total of 369 patients with MDD (64% male; mean age, 57.1 years; mean 17-item Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] score, 19.6; MI, 74%; unstable angina, 26%).

Intervention

After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomly assigned to receive sertraline in flexible dosages of 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 186) or placebo (n = 183) for 24 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary (safety) outcome measure was change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); secondary measures included surrogate cardiac measures and cardiovascular adverse events, as well as scores on the HAM-D scale and Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) in the total randomized sample, in a group with any prior history of MDD, and in a more severe MDD subgroup defined a priori by a HAM-D score of at least 18 and history of 2 or more prior episodes of MDD.

Results

Sertraline had no significant effect on mean (SD) LVEF (sertraline: baseline, 54% [10%]; week 16, 54% [11%]; placebo: baseline, 52% [13%]; week 16, 53% [13%]), treatment-emergent increase in ventricular premature complex (VPC) runs (sertraline: 13.1%; placebo: 12.9%), QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds at end point (sertraline: 12%; placebo: 13%), or other cardiac measures. All comparisons were statistically nonsignificant (P ≥ .05). The incidence of severe cardiovascular adverse events was 14.5% with sertraline and 22.4% with placebo. In the total randomized sample, the CGI-I (P = 0.049), but not the HAM-D (P = 0.14), favored sertraline. The CGI-I responder rates for sertraline were significantly higher than for placebo in the total sample (67% vs 53%; P = 0.01), in the group with at least 1 prior episode of depression (72% vs 51%; P = 0.003), and in the more severe MDD group (78% vs 45%; P = 0.001). In the latter 2 groups, both CGI-I and HAM-D measures were significantly better in those assigned to sertraline.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that sertraline is a safe and effective treatment for recurrent depression in patients with recent MI or unstable angina and without other life-threatening medical conditions.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^112GqV6g]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness –Clinical experience with Sertraline hydrochloride in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using sertraline hydrochloride in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses.

Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarket testing. However, the electrocardiograms of 774 patients who received Sertraline hydrochloride in double-blind trials were evaluated and the data indicate that sertraline hydrochloride is not associated with the development of significant ECG abnormalities.

Sertraline hydrochloride administered in a flexible dose range of 50 to 200 mg/day (mean dose of 89 mg/day) was evaluated in a post-marketing, placebo-controlled trial of 372 randomized subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder and recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization. Exclusions from this trial included, among others, patients with uncontrolled hypertension, need for cardiac surgery, history of CABG within 3 months of index event, severe or symptomatic bradycardia, non-atherosclerotic cause of angina, clinically significant renal impairment (creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl), and clinically significant hepatic dysfunction. Sertraline hydrochloride treatment initiated during the acute phase of recovery (within 30 days post-MI or post-hospitalization for unstable angina) was indistinguishable from placebo in this study on the following week 16 treatment endpoints: left ventricular ejection fraction, total cardiovascular events (angina, chest pain, edema, palpitations, syncope, postural dizziness, CHF, MI, tachycardia, bradycardia, and changes in BP), and major cardiovascular events involving death or requiring hospitalization (for MI, CHF, stroke, or angina).

Treatment research

Two complementary goals have motivated research on the treatment of depression in patients with CHD. One is to identify treatments that are both safe and effective for depression in this patient population, and the other is to determine whether effective treatment of depression improves cardiac outcomes. The latter goal has pragmatic implications for clinical care, but it also important with respect to the question of whether depression plays a causal role in adverse cardiac outcomes.

Cardiac patients were seldom treated for depression prior to the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), because (among other reasons) the only antidepressants that were available at the time were cardiotoxic. Most of the recent studies of antidepressant medications for depression in cardiac patients have evaluated SSRIs such as sertraline or citalopram. The weight of the available evidence indicates that these agents are relatively safe for patients with CHD but that their efficacy is less than impressive.

The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART) was one of the largest and most rigorous studies in this area. A total of 369 patients with major depression were enrolled within 1 month of an acute coronary event and randomly assigned to receive sertraline or placebo for 24 weeks. The safety results were favorable, but post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) did not differ between the groups. There were significant differences on the HRSD within the subgroup of patients with severe depression, as defined by a HRSD score of 18 or higher at baseline, but not in the patients with less severe major depression. Even in the severe subgroup, the post-treatment HRSD scores of the sertraline and placebo groups differed by less than 3 points.

### Pharmacoeconomic analysis of sertraline treatment of depression in patients with unstable angina or a recent myocardial infarction [^1134TP39]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of major depressive disorder in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) is high and associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes and higher health care costs. Sertraline is the only treatment for major depressive disorder studied in a placebo-controlled trial of patients with ACS and found to be safe and effective. The cost implications of providing antidepressant treatment in this population have not yet been examined. The objective was to evaluate from a payer perspective the potential reduction in costs and psychiatric and cardiovascular events and procedures following sertraline versus placebo treatment of major depressive disorder in patients hospitalized for ACS.

Method

Data were analyzed from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week trial (Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial) of sertraline treatment for major depressive disorder in patients hospitalized for ACS. Main outcome measures included frequency and costs (derived from Medicare diagnosis-related group fee schedules) of psychiatric and cardiovascular events occurring during the treatment period.

Results

There was a trend toward significantly fewer psychiatric or cardiovascular hospitalizations in the sertraline compared with the placebo group (55/186 vs. 76/183; p = .054). The mean per patient cost associated with psychiatric and medical events over the course of treatment was 2733 US dollars for sertraline and 3326 US dollars for placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = .32). After including the costs of the sertra-line (360 US dollars over 24 weeks), there was no increase in treatment costs for sertraline compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Sertraline treatment of major depressive disorder following hospitalization for a recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina appears to be a cost-effective strategy.

SSRIs in Patients With CAD

Details of included studies are outlined in Table 1. Initial placebo‐controlled trials of SSRIs aimed at evaluating depressive symptoms found these agents to be safe and largely effective in the treatment of MDD in patients with recent ACS 25, 27, 62, 63 and stable CAD. 30 Glassman and colleagues evaluated sertraline in the treatment of MDD in 369 patients post‐ACS in the SADHART (Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial) RCT. They found sertraline to have higher clinical global improvement scores and depression response rates, but there were no between‐group differences on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM‐D). They did, however, find greater response rates and significant improvement on HAM‐D in patients with previous depressive episodes and more severe MDD. 25 Pizzi and associates also compared sertraline and placebo among 100 patients with CAD and depressive symptoms, and found significant improvement in depression scores compared with placebo after 20 weeks. 26 Escitalopram likewise was also found superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in 300 recent patients with ACS with depression at 24 weeks and 1‐year follow‐up in the EsDEPACS (Escitalopram for Depression in ACS) trial. 27 Finally, in a smaller trial, fluoxetine was found to have greater depression response rates but no significant differences in depression symptoms in 54 patients with depression with recent myocardial infarction. 62

Along with these placebo‐controlled trials, SSRIs have also been compared with other interventions for the treatment of depression in patients with stable and unstable CAD. In the UPBEAT (Understanding Prognostic Benefits of Exercise and Antidepressant Therapy for Persons with Depression and Heart Disease) study, sertraline was compared with aerobic exercise and placebo in a 3‐arm trial in 101 patients with CAD and elevated depressive symptoms. The sertraline and exercise groups achieved larger reductions in depressive symptoms compared with placebo, with no significant differences between exercise and sertraline. 29 The CREATE (Canadian Cardiac Randomized Evaluation of Antidepressant and Psychotherapy Efficacy) trial used a factorial design to compare citalopram with placebo, interpersonal therapy, and clinical management in 284 patients with CAD and MDD. 30 They found citalopram to be superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms.

Finally, the MIND‐IT (Myocardial Infarction and Depression‐Intervention Trial) was a flexible depression management trial offering pharmacological (mirtazapine or citalopram) and nonpharmacological therapy (at the discretion of the study psychiatrist) for 331 patients with depression with myocardial infarction (MI); patients in the usual‐care group were allowed to seek treatment for depression outside the study. There were no between‐group differences in depression scores at the end of the intervention. 31

Regarding the effects of SSRIs on cardiac outcomes, some, 17, 64 but not all, 65, 66 observational studies have observed associations between SSRI prescriptions and cardiovascular benefits. None of the above RCTs were designed or powered to measure effects on cardiac outcomes/markers at initial follow‐up time points. However, some of them had co‐primary cardiac outcomes or extended follow‐up assessments to further explore the effects of SSRIs on cardiac‐related outcomes. The SADHART trial, for example, found no adverse effect of sertraline on left ventricular ejection fraction or other surrogate cardiac markers including electrocardiographic changes, and no differences in rates of cardiovascular events. 25 Pizzi and associates observed mixed but largely negative effects of SSRIs on cardiac markers in the UPBEAT study, with nearly significant increases in heart rate variability with sertraline compared with exercise or placebo in the 3‐arm trial, but no change in other markers of inflammation, endothelial and platelet function, or baroreflex sensitivity. 29

Treatment-resistant depression and cardiac prognosis

Another subtype of depression that is related to cardiac disease is treatment-resistant depression, which is particularly associated with the risk of poor cardiovascular outcomes. In the Montreal Heart Attack Readjustment Trial (M-Hart), the effects of a psychosocial nursing intervention on psychological distress, mortality and new cardiovascular events were evaluated in 1,376 post-MI patients. Patients who showed persisting or worsening psychological distress despite the intervention had an increased risk of dying or of cardiac hospital readmissions within the subsequent year. Milani et al. evaluated the effects of a cardiac rehabilitation program with exercise training on depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality in CHD patients. They found patients with persisting or increasing depressive symptoms during the rehabilitation program had higher all-cause mortality rates than patients with decreasing or constantly low levels of depressive symptoms. More recently, this finding was replicated in CHD patients with additional heart failure. The Myocardial Infarction and Depression Intervention Trial (MIND-IT) evaluated the effects of the antidepressants mirtazapine and citalopram on depression and risk of new cardiac events in depressed MI patients. Patients who did not respond to the treatment significantly more often had a new cardiac event (25.6% vs. 7.4%) compared with those who did respond. The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Trial (SADHART) included depressed acute coronary syndrome patients in a six-month randomized treatment trial of sertraline vs. placebo. Patients with treatment-resistant depression were at increased risk of all-cause mortality up until eight years after treatment initiation, and this increased risk was also found for patients with persisting depression who were treated with placebo. Similar results were found in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) trial, which evaluated the effects of six months' treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy supplemented with sertraline on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in depressed MI-patients. Patients in whom the depressive symptoms did not improve had increased mortality rates compared to those whose depressive symptoms did improve. Recently, the investigators showed that this increased risk was due to the persistence of somatic/affective depressive symptoms, but not to cognitive/affective depressive symptoms.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^1151Ew7s]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

A major strength of the traditional pharmacoepidemiological approach is its focus on "hard" end points of greatest clinical concern; in contrast, QT interval is a strong but imperfect predictor of torsades risk. Conversely, QT changes may be more sensitive to subtle drug effects (those which modestly increase risk), and a previous report suggested that clinical databases may have limited sensitivity for arrhythmias that do not occur in the inpatient setting. The use of medical records data also allows further adjustment for potentially confounding clinical variables, which may explain why we detected dose-response effects when prior investigation did not.

A key limitation of our study, which must be considered in interpreting these results, is the lack of random assignment of treatment and dose, which increases risk for confounding. In particular, clinicians may make treatment decisions based on factors not assessed here, and these factors may confound the observed effects on electrocardiographic parameters. For example, if clinicians tended to prescribe sertraline to patients who had experienced myocardial infarction on the basis of the SADHART or SADHART-CHF trials, a spurious association between sertraline and QT prolongation might be observed. However, we note that this effect was not observed, that we adjusted for history of myocardial infarction, and that this limitation is also present in traditional postmarketing surveillance studies. Our analyses also relied on data collected before dissemination of the FDA warning for citalopram, which should preclude any impact on citalopram prescribing.

### Platelet / endothelial biomarkers in depressed patients treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline after acute coronary events: the sertraline antiDepressant heart attack randomized trial (SADHART) platelet substudy [^1165w4yZ]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression after acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) has been identified as an independent risk factor for subsequent cardiac death. Enhanced platelet activation has been hypothesized to represent 1 of the mechanisms underlying this association. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to inhibit platelet activity. Whether treatment of depressed post-ACS patients with SSRIs alters platelet function was not known. Accordingly, we serially assessed the release of established platelet/endothelial biomarkers in patients treated with sertraline vs placebo in the Sertraline AntiDepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART).

Methods and Results

Plasma samples (baseline, week 6, and week 16) were collected from patients randomized to sertraline (n = 28) or placebo (n = 36). Anticoagulants, aspirin, and ADP-receptor inhibitors were permitted in this study. Platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG), platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, P-selectin, thromboxane B2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1a, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin were measured by ELISA. Treatment with sertraline was associated with substantially less release of platelet/endothelial biomarkers than was treatment with placebo. These differences attained statistical significance for betaTG (P = 0.03) at weeks 6 and 16 and for P-selectin (P = 0.04) at week 16. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant advantage for sertraline vs placebo for diminishing E-selectin and betaTG concentrations across the entire treatment period.

Conclusions

Treatment with sertraline in depressed post-ACS patients is associated with reductions in platelet/endothelial activation despite coadministration of widespread antiplatelet regimens including aspirin and clopidogrel. The antiplatelet and endothelium-protective properties of SSRIs might represent an attractive additional advantage in patients with depression and comorbid coronary artery and/or cerebrovascular disease.

### Acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina and non-ST elevation… [^1167pT4t]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is characterized by episodes of chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion that are increasing in frequency or severity, often with dynamic electrocardiography changes. Aspirin reduces the risk of death, MI, and stroke compared with placebo in persons with acute coronary syndrome at dosages up to 325 mg daily. Higher dosages of aspirin are no more effective and increase the risk of complications. Unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin plus aspirin may reduce death or MI at one week, but longer-term benefits are unclear. Low-molecular-weight heparin may reduce MI compared with unfractionated heparin. Direct thrombin inhibitors may reduce death or MI compared with unfractionated heparin.

The distinguishing feature between unstable angina and non-STEMI is the presence of elevated cardiac markers, such as troponin, which implies myocardial damage. Patient history alone is insufficient to make a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The clinical dilemma of distinguishing between cardiac and noncardiac pain requires a combination of patient history, ECG, and biomarkers. Several risk factors may indicate poor prognosis and include severity of presentation; medical history, other clinical parameters, ECG changes, biomarkers, and change in clinical status.

However, several key prognostic indicators associated with adverse outcomes may be used to aid clinical decision making. Variables, including age 65 years or older, at least three risk factors for coronary artery disease, known significant coronary stenosis, degree of ST segment deviation, recurrent anginal symptoms in 24 hours, use of aspirin in past seven days, and elevated cardiac biomarkers, can be used to generate a scoring system to identify high-risk patients who may experience true ischemic cardiac events and death. The more of these factors that are present, the greater the likelihood of adverse ischemic events. This helps stratify patients according to risk and identify high-risk patients.

### Psychiatric and psychological interventions for depression in patients with heart disease: a scoping review [^1171k3WK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our review of randomized intervention trials for depression in patients with cardiac disease has revealed several themes. First, antidepressants, psychotherapy, and care management have all been proven safe and largely — though not universally — effective in treating and improving mood symptoms among patients with elevated depressive symptoms or MDD in CAD or ACS. In HF, however, antidepressant efficacy has not been demonstrated, while psychotherapy and care management generally have been more effective.

Regarding antidepressants, overall, based on existing evidence, SSRIs should be considered a first‐line therapy in patients with cardiac disease who merit treatment based on a diagnosis of MDD, especially those with CAD. SSRIs are the most studied agents in populations with cardiac disease, with efficacy in treating depression in most studies. Sertraline has been the most studied SSRI, and may be preferred because it does not (in contrast to citalopram and escitalopram) prolong the QT interval. 79 Among patients with CAD/outcomes, observational evidence points to possible cardiovascular benefits of SSRIs, 16 and nonresponse of mood symptoms to antidepressants is associated with adverse cardiac outcomes, including an elevated risk of mortality, in patients with cardiac disease. 11, 80 However, at this stage there have been few definitive prospective trials that have found SSRIs to prevent cardiac events, readmissions, or mortality. The EsDEPACS trial did show reduction in major adverse cardiac events and all‐cause mortality over 8‐year follow‐up when escitalopram was used in patients with ACS, 28 showing potential promise in using SSRIs to improve cardiac outcomes, but substantial further study is needed.

As noted, antidepressants have been less effective in HF, with similar response rates in antidepressant and placebo groups. It is possible that "elevated depressive symptoms" measured by depression scales may simply be measuring somatic symptoms common in this chronic disease rather than true depression, that the mechanism of depression differs in patients with HF, or more powerful or individualized interventions are needed in this chronic disease. Study design may also play a role. For example, the SADHART‐CHF trial provided weekly nursing support, which may have improved mood symptoms sufficiently to mask any sertraline‐specific effects. 54 Fortunately, SSRIs do appear to be safe in patients with HF, which still makes them a potentially reasonable approach for individuals when other treatments are not readily available or as an inexpensive complement to psychotherapeutic or care management supportive interventions.

Other Antidepressants

Other antidepressants have been less studied in patients with heart disease. Mirtazapine, a 5‐hydroxytryptamine‐2 and α‐2 receptor antagonist antidepressant, was found to improve depressive symptoms in a nested RCT of the MIND‐IT trial in post‐MI patients, 33 though this agent has been linked to weight gain and hypercholesterolemia, making it potentially problematic for patients with heart disease. 67, 68 When the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline was compared with paroxetine in 41 patients with depression with CAD, nortriptyline had significantly more side effects, including sinus tachycardia, severe angina associated with ST changes, and increase in ventricular ectopy, which led to premature discontinuation, 34 consistent with a larger literature suggesting that tricyclic antidepressants are suboptimal for this population. 69 There have not been RCTs of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, venlafaxine or duloxetine), nor have there been RCTs on other antidepressant classes such as dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, bupropion), for depression in patients with cardiac disease, though bupropion has been safely prescribed for post‐ACS patients for smoking cessation. 70

Finally, omega‐3‐fatty acids have been tested as antidepressant monotherapy or as adjuncts to SSRIs in a pair of RCTs. In these trials, these agents were not associated with significant benefits on mood symptoms or cardiac outcomes in patients with CAD 35 or HF. 57

Cost‐Effectiveness

The SADHART trial was the only trial that reported data on costs and found no significant increase in overall medical care costs for sertraline compared with placebo after including the costs of medication 71 (Table 3).

Cost Effectiveness Data of Interventions

Psychotherapy

A number of studies have examined the use of psychotherapy to manage depression in patients with heart disease. CBT has been the most studied psychotherapy among those with heart disease. CBT is an umbrella term for therapies that focus on recognizing and restructuring cognitive distortions, modifying problematic behaviors, and regulation of emotions, 75 and it is effective in the treatment of depression in patients without cardiac disease. 76

### Safety and efficacy of sertraline for depression in patients with heart failure: results of the SADHART-CHF (sertraline against depression and heart disease in chronic heart failure) trial [^114MYyQM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to test the hypothesis that heart failure (HF) patients treated with sertraline will have lower depression scores and fewer cardiovascular events compared with placebo.

Background

Depression is common among HF patients. It is associated with increased hospitalization and mortality.

Methods

The SADHART-CHF (Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day versus matching placebo for 12 weeks. All participants also received nurse-facilitated support. Eligible patients were age 45 years or older with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) and clinical depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria for current major depressive disorder). Those with significant cognitive impairment, psychosis, recent alcohol or drug dependence, bipolar or severe personality disorder, active suicidal ideation, and current antipsychotic or antidepressant medications were excluded. Primary end points were change in depression severity (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score) and composite cardiovascular status at 12 weeks.

Results

A total of 469 patients were randomized (n = 234 sertraline, n = 235 placebo). The mean ± SE change from baseline to 12 weeks in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score was -7.1 ± 0.5 (sertraline) and -6.8 ± 0.5 (placebo) (p < 0.001 from baseline, p = 0.89 between groups, mean change between groups -0.4; 95% confidence interval: -1.7 to 0.92). The proportions whose composite cardiovascular score worsened, improved, or was unchanged were 29.9%, 40.6%, and 29.5%, respectively, in the sertraline group and 31.1%, 43.8%, and 25.1%, respectively, in the placebo group (p = 0.78).

Conclusions

Sertraline was safe in patients with significant HF. However, treatment with sertraline compared with placebo did not provide greater reduction in depression or improved cardiovascular status among patients with HF and depression.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors provide significant lower re-hospitalization rates in patients recovering from acute coronary syndromes: evidence from a meta-analysis [^1153upYS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Depression is an independent negative prognostic factor in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), yet it is unclear if its treatment is beneficial after ACS. We sought to compare, through a meta-analytic process, antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus control treatment in patients with recent ACS. BioMedCentral, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, PsycInfo, and PubMed were searched for pertinent studies (November 2008). We selected studies with randomized allocation to antidepressant drug versus control in patients with acute or recent ACS reported as intention-to-treat. Exclusion criteria were: duplicate publication, regimen of antidepressant drug < 4 weeks, follow-up < 6 weeks or incomplete follow up, or a lack of clear/reproducible results. Changes from the baseline to the follow-up in depression score, major adverse cardiac events (MACE - including death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization), and hospitalizations were pooled with random or fixed-effect methods. Five randomized trials (801 patients) were included. Fifteen studies were excluded because they were unpublished, ongoing, or duplicates. Subjects treated with antidepressant medications did not show, after a median of six months, a significant improvement in depression symptoms, although there was a trend for a reduction in depression scores. Besides, subjects treated with antidepressant medications showed a significantly lower rate of re-hospitalizations from all causes (risk difference (RD) = 14% (95% confidence interval: 5–23%), p = 0.001). Therapy with antidepressants was notably safe, with similar rates of adverse events, including MACE, death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization (all p > 0.05). Treatment with SSRIs in patients recovering from ACS is associated with significant lower re-hospitalization rates. These data suggest that antidepressant therapy with SSRIs, given its efficacy and safety, should be routinely considered in patients with a recent ACS and depression symptoms.

### Psychiatric and psychological interventions for depression in patients with heart disease: a scoping review [^115wtaoW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Three studies have examined longer‐term effects on major cardiac events. Follow‐up from the EsDEPACS trial found those assigned to the escitalopram group to have lower rates of major adverse cardiac events at 8 years compared with those who had received placebo, 28 but the MIND‐IT trial found no effects on cardiac events at the end of the intervention, 31 or at 8‐year follow‐up, and no effect on all‐cause mortality. However, patients in that study who received any depression treatment (pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy/counseling) had reduced all‐cause mortality compared with those who did not, regardless of randomization status. 32

Finally, the ENRICHD (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease) study was a psychotherapy intervention trial (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] versus usual care) in 2481 post‐MI patients with MDD in which some participants in the CBT arm (those with severe or persistent depression) were offered supplemental sertraline, and those in the treatment as usual group were sometimes provided SSRIs by their primary clinicians. Among the patients with depression in either condition, risk of death or recurrent MI and all‐cause mortality was significantly reduced in patients prescribed SSRIs, compared with patients who were not (effects of the primary intervention on depression is discussed below, under Psychotherapy). 16

SSRIs for HF

Interventions for patients with HF are outlined in Table 2. Sertraline was studied against placebo in 469 patients with HF in the SADHART‐CHF (Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Congestive Heart Failure) trial. This trial examined sertraline compared with enhanced usual care that included a nurse‐facilitated support intervention. The investigators found no between‐group differences in depression reduction in depression at 12 weeks. 54 Escitalopram was also explored in the MOOD‐HF (Effects of Selective Serotonin Re‐Uptake Inhibition on Morbidity, Mortality, and Mood in Depressed Heart Failure Patients) trial on 372 patients with depression with HF and likewise found no differences in depression scores. 55 In a smaller study, Fraguas and associates studied citalopram in 37 elderly patients with HF with depression, where they found nonsignificant superiority of citalopram over placebo. 56 Regarding cardiac outcomes, the SADHART‐CHF found no effect on cardiovascular events or surrogate markers at 12 weeks 54 and the MOOD‐HF trial found no reduction in all‐cause mortality or hospitalization after 18 months. 55

### Should selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors be prescribed to all patients with ischemic heart disease? [^115smTKn]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Recent studies have uncovered more and more evidence demonstrating the adverse relationship between depression and ischemic heart disease. One of the most significant mechanisms that may explain the adverse relationship is the increased platelet activity, otherwise known as aggregation, observed to occur in patients with depression or ischemic heart disease. Platelet activity is further elevated in patients with depression and ischemic heart disease. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are antidepressants and also act like platelet inhibitors. The results of large-scale clinical trials suggest that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce cardiac events in post-myocardial infarction patients or in those with unstable angina that may be related to the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on platelet aggregation.

### Clinical trials update from the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Heart Association meetings in 2008: SADHART-CHF, COMPARE, MOMENTUM, thyroid hormone analogue study, HF-ACTION, I-PRESERVE, β-interferon study, BACH, and ATHENA [^114VV22q]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

This article provides information and a commentary on trials relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of heart failure presented at the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Heart Association meetings in 2008. Unpublished reports should be considered as preliminary, as analyses may change in the final publication. (i) SADHART-CHF showed no difference in outcome for heart failure patients with depression treated with sertraline compared with placebo. (ii) A controlled release carvedilol formulation showed similar LV haemodynamic effects to the standard carvedilol formulation in the COMPARE study. (iii) A post hoc analysis of the MOMENTUM study suggested that patients with less severe heart failure may be more likely to benefit from a continuous aortic flow augmentation device. (iv) A thyroid hormone analogue was poorly tolerated in patients with heart failure. (v) HF-ACTION showed that exercise training is safe and offers modest clinical benefits in patients with heart failure. (vi) Irbesartan failed to improve outcomes in patients with preserved ejection fraction in the I-PRESERVE study. (vii) A phase II study of beta-interferon administration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed encouraging results. (viii) The BACH study showed that mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin was more accurate than BNP or NT-proBNP at predicting outcome at 90 days in patients with acute heart failure. (ix) A secondary analysis from ATHENA showed a reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations and strokes for patients with atrial fibrillation receiving dronedarone compared with placebo.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112JTibZ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants — tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): TCAs have numerous documented cardiovascular side effects, including sinus tachycardia and postural hypotension; they also prolong the duration of the QRS interval and QTc interval, and second- and third-degree heart block can develop. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a very low rate of adverse cardiovascular effects, and in prospective studies of patients with HF, post-MI, or unstable angina, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine had minimal to no effect on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indices of cardiac function. However, in 2011 the FDA issued a safety announcement that citalopram should not exceed 40 mg/d because of the risk of dose-dependent QTc prolongation that could lead to TdP, and the FDA recommended avoiding use in patients with decompensated HF.

### Long term effect of depression care management on mortality in older adults: follow-up of cluster randomized clinical trial in primary care [^112awbkC]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

PROSPECT and other studies show that treatment of major depression in primary care reduces symptoms of depression, induces remission, improves quality of life, and reduces functional impairment, but they have not reported the effect of the intervention on mortality risk. Our study contributes the finding that practice based care management of major depression reduces mortality risk after nine years and six months of follow-up. In a report of 231 community dwelling older adults in Italy with depressive symptoms, self reported use of psychoactive drugs was associated with reduced five year mortality risk, but the study is difficult to interpret because the investigation did not include clinical assessments of depression, did not randomize patients to treatment, and relied on self report of use of drugs. Our findings deserve attention because practices were randomized to a practice based intervention, in contrast to observational studies without randomization. Patients without depression were included in the follow-up, providing a strong comparison group exposed to the same practices.

Several intervention studies in specialty medical settings have examined mortality as an outcome, often linked with hospital admission or myocardial infarction into a single combined outcome. ENRICHD (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease) did not show any benefit on mortality risk over a 40 month follow-up interval.SADHART (Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial) reported a statistically non-significant beneficial trend for combined cardiovascular outcomes that included death at 24 weeks.MIND-IT (Myocardial INfarction and Depression — Intervention Trial) reported only seven deaths after 18 months of follow-up. In ENRICHD, taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor was associated with reduction in the risk of all cause mortality, as was participation in group plus individual therapy, but these secondary analyses ignored randomization. Interventions that do not specifically treat depression (such as preventive medical services, exercise for heart failure, or reduction of cardiovascular risk factors for diabetes) do not affect mortality.

### Escitalopram treatment for depressive disorder following acute coronary syndrome: a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114gQben]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Depression is common after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has adverse effects on prognosis. There are few evidence-based interventions for treating depression in ACS. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in treating depressive disorders identified 2–14 weeks after a confirmed ACS episode.

Method

A total of 217 patients with DSM-IV depressive disorders (121 major and 96 minor) and ACS were randomly assigned to receive escitalopram in flexible doses of 5–20 mg/d (n = 108) or placebo (n = 109) for 24 weeks. The study was conducted from 2007 to 2013. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S), Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule-12. Cardiovascular safety outcomes included echocardiography, electrocardiography, laboratory test, body weight, and blood pressure results.

Results

Escitalopram was superior to placebo in reducing HDRS scores (mean difference = 2.3, P = 0.016, effect size = 0.38). Escitalopram was also superior to placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms evaluated by the MADRS, BDI, and CGI-S and in improving SOFAS functioning level. Escitalopram was not associated with any harmful changes in cardiovascular safety measures. Dizziness was significantly more frequently reported in the escitalopram group (P = 0.018), but there were no significant differences in any other adverse events.

Conclusions

These results indicate that escitalopram has clinically meaningful antidepressant effects with no evidence of reduced cardiovascular safety in depressive disorder following ACS.

### Influence of depression and effect of treatment with sertraline on quality of life after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome [^117QT5d6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorders complicate recovery from acute coronary syndrome in approximately 1 in 5 patients, and have been found to be associated with significant impairments of quality of life and functioning. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of sertraline in improving quality of life and functioning in patients diagnosed with major depression who had recently been hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome. Three hundred sixty-nine patients hospitalized in the previous month for acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, 74%; unstable angina, 26%) who also met criteria for major depressive disorder were randomized to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with sertraline (50 to 200 mg/day) or placebo. Quality-of-life and functional status were assessed using the Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction scale (Q-LES-Q) and the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36. Data from the total sample, and the recurrent depression subgroup, were analyzed. Severe baseline impairment was found in the Q-LES-Q and all subscales of the SF-36. A multivariate regression analysis identified depression as the strongest predictor of baseline quality-of-life impairment (partial r, -0.37, p = 0.001). In the recurrent depression group, treatment with sertraline resulted in significantly greater improvement than placebo in the Q-LES-Q total score and SF-36 mental component summary score, as well as the SF-36 role limitations, emotional, and mental health factors. Depression has a substantial negative impact on quality of life and functioning in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome. Sertraline was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in multiple quality-of-life domains in patients with acute coronary syndrome and recurrent depression.

### Effect of sertraline on the recovery rate of cardiac autonomic function in depressed patients after acute myocardial infarction [^115PfmuL]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Brain serotonin is known to possess sympathoinhibitory properties. The aim of this clinical physiologic study was to determine whether sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, facilitates the rate of recovery of cardiac autonomic function after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with depression.

Methods and Results

Thirty-eight post-MI depressed patients were randomized to receive either sertraline 50 mg per day or placebo for 6 months. Depression was defined as a score > 15 on the standardized Inventory to Diagnose Depression questionnaire taken at prehospital discharge and again within 2 weeks of the acute infarct. Eleven stable post-MI nondepressed patients served as a nonrandomized reference group during follow-up. Twenty-seven patients completed the randomization. All 3 groups were followed up closely in a multidisciplinary post-MI clinic where they underwent serial testing for both time and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV) indices at baseline (1–2 weeks after MI) and at 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 weeks. The rate of recovery of HRV was determined by use of a growth curve model based on repeated-measures analysis of variance. There was a linear rate of increase in the SD of 24-hour N-N intervals (SDNN) in the sertraline-treated group that paralleled that of the nondepressed reference group. This contrasted with a modest but significant decline in SDNN in the placebo group from 2 to 22 weeks (t = 2.10, P < .05). However, the short-term power spectral indices, while trending toward a more rapid rate of recovery in the treated group, did not reach statistical significance compared with the placebo group.

Conclusion

In depressed patients who have survived the acute phase of an MI sertraline facilitates the rate of recovery of SDNN, a recognized predictor of clinical outcome.

### Treatment of depression after myocardial infarction and the effects on cardiac prognosis and quality of life: rationale and outline of the myocardial INfarction and depression-intervention trial (MIND-IT) [^1122fT9N]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a depressive disorder after myocardial infarction (MI) have a significantly increased risk of major cardiac events. The Myocardial INfarction and Depression-Intervention Trial (MIND-IT) investigates whether antidepressive treatment can improve the cardiac prognosis for these patients. The rationale and outline of the study are described.

Methods

In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, 2140 patients admitted for MI are screened for depressive symptoms with a questionnaire 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after MI. Patients with symptoms undergo a standardized psychiatric interview. Those with a post-MI depressive episode are randomized to intervention (ie, antidepressive treatment; n = 190) or care-as-usual (CAU; n = 130). In the intervention arm, the research diagnosis is to be confirmed by a psychiatrist. First-choice treatment consists of placebo-controlled treatment with mirtazapine. In case of refusal or nonresponse, alternative open treatment with citalopram is offered. In the CAU arm, the patient is not informed about the research diagnosis. Psychiatric treatment outside the study is recorded, but no treatment is offered. Both arms are followed for end points (cardiac death or hospital admission for MI, unstable angina, heart failure, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia) during an average period of 27 months. Analysis is on an intention-to-treat basis.

Conclusion

The MIND-IT study will show whether treatment of post-MI depression can improve cardiac prognosis.

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the DEPACS study [^1176JsP1]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The nested randomised controlled trial: EsDEPACS study

Of the 501 screen-positive participants, 55 had no depressive disorder. Of the remaining 446 patients with a diagnosis of major (N = 202) or minor (N = 244) depressive disorder, 300 who met the eligibility criteria and agreed to participate were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of escitalopram, the EsDEPACS study (ClinicalTrial.gov registry number: NCT00419471). Higher participation rates were noted in those with more severe depressive symptoms, resulting in major depressive disorder prevalences of 57.0% (85/149) in escitalopram-allocated and 55.6% (84/151) in placebo-allocated participants, compared to 22.6% (33/146) in the remaining patients with the depressive disorder who were not randomised. The first patient was enrolled in May 2007, and the last patient completed follow-up evaluation in March 2013. Examinations were scheduled at baseline, and in weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 thereafter. The dose of the study drug was 10 mg/day initially and could be changed (from 5 to 20 mg/day) according to the investigators' clinical decision, taking into account response and tolerability after the second evaluation. The mean doses at the last visit were 7.6 (3.7) mg for the escitalopram group and 8.5 (3.9) mg for the placebo group. Adherence was checked by pill counts at every visit, and was defined as acceptable if at least 75%. Adherence to medications was 93.3% and 95.4% in patients receiving escitalopram and placebo, respectively. Depression treatment, including antidepressant use other than study drugs, was not allowed during the study period. With respect to the ethics of the use of placebo in patients with depressive symptoms, the following considerations should be noted: (i) because of the lack of evidence for the effect of depression treatment shortly following ACS at the time the study was designed, the EsDEPACS trial was judged both by funders and an independent ethics review panel to be addressing an issue of clinical equipoise (Kim et al.); (ii) besides providing study drugs, research psychiatrists met with the patients for at least 30 min at every visit and evaluated their psychological symptoms using simple support and reassurance after cardiology treatment; (iii) participants could withdraw from the trial at any point and for any reason; (iv) for participants without remission after the trial, further treatment was facilitated when requested; (v) all participants were approached for the evaluation of psychiatric outcomes 1 year after baseline evaluation (Kim et al.). The details and main results of this trial have been published previously (Kim et al.), in which escitalopram was superior to placebo in treating depression without significant difference in adverse events. The remaining 146 participants who did not meet the eligibility criteria or declined participation in the trial received conventional medical treatment for ACS only (MTO). The MTO and screen-positive but had no depressive disorder participants were recommended treating depressive symptoms wherever possible.

### Effect of escitalopram vs placebo treatment for depression on long-term cardiac outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^1151vSLF]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Depression has been associated with poorer medical outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but there are few data on the effects of antidepressant treatment on long-term prognosis.

Objective

To investigate the effect on long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of escitalopram treatment of depression in patients with recent ACS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 300 patients with recent ACS and depression enrolled from May 2007 to March 2013, with follow-up completed in June 2017, at Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either escitalopram in flexible dosages of 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/d (n = 149) or matched placebo (n = 151) for 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Four secondary outcomes were the individual MACE components of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and PCI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the escitalopram and placebo groups by time to first MACE.

Results

Among 300 randomized patients (mean age, 60 years; 119 women [39.3%]), 100% completed a median of 8.1 (interquartile range, 7.5–9.0) years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 61 patients (40.9%) receiving escitalopram and in 81 (53.6%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.96; P = 0.03). Comparing individual MACE outcomes between the escitalopram and placebo groups, respectively, incidences for all-cause mortality were 20.8% vs 24.5% (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51–1.33; P = 0.43), for cardiac death, 10.7% vs 13.2% (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.41–1.52; P = 0.48); for MI, 8.7% vs 15.2% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27–0.96; P = 0.04), and for PCI, 12.8% vs 19.9% (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.04; P = 0.07).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with depression following recent acute coronary syndrome, 24-week treatment with escitalopram compared with placebo resulted in a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events after a median of 8.1 years. Further research is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings.

Background

The efficacy of statin drugs after an acute coronary event is now well established, but the evidence for statin use in the early treatment of acute coronary events remains unclear.

Methods

We tested the effects of administering pravastatin within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms in patients with unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patient recruitment of 10,000 with 1200 end points was planned, but the trial was stopped early. A total of 3408 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with pravastatin (1710 patients) or matching placebo (1698 patients). Treatment was continued for 4 weeks. The primary end point of the study was a composite of death, recurrence of myocardial infarction, or readmission to hospital for unstable angina within 30 days of random assignment.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 199 of patients allocated to pravastatin (11.6%) and in 211 patients allocated to placebo (12.4%). A relative risk reduction of 6.4% favored allocation to pravastatin but was not statistically significant (95% CI, -13.2% to 27.6%). No adverse effects were seen.

Conclusions

We conclude that 20 to 40 mg of pravastatin can be safely administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an acute coronary event, with a favorable but not significant trend in outcome at 30 days compared with placebo.

### Cardiac dysfunction in the sigma 1 receptor knockout mouse associated with impaired mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics [^115ejXSb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Sigmar1 −/− mice were reported to develop multiple neuronal phenotypes — locomotor defects, 75 significant nerve denervation, 49 loss of motor neurons, 49 age‐dependent motor phenotype and to show a depressive‐like behavior. 48, 86 Sigmar1 −/− mice also showed disruption of intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, reduction in Ca 2+ flux into the mitochondria, and lower ATP content in neuronal cells. 9, 49, 75 Despite all these studies, there are no data dealing with the cardiac phenotype of Sigmar1 −/− mice. The present study highlights the structure‐function relationships concerning Sigmar1's role in maintaining healthy cardiac function. Ours are the first in vivo data that bear on the structural and functional implications of the physiological functions of Sigmar1 in the heart. A significant limitation of our study is the use of global knockout mice in which we cannot rule out a cardiac impact of loss of Sigmar1 in other organs. We also do not know whether decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics underlies the morphological changes or is the result of deranged dynamics. Future studies are required to recapitulate these data using a cardiomyocyte‐specific knockout mouse. However, significant alterations in dynamics regulatory protein expression and suppression of mitochondrial respiration as early as 3 months in the Sigmar1 −/− mouse hearts suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction led to cardiac dysfunction.

Sigmar1 has a significant therapeutic potential for cardiovascular disease as reflected by two Sigmar1 ligands already appear in clinical trials: cutamesine (SA4503) for ischemic stroke (phase 2) 87 and SADHART‐CHF (Sertraline for Depression in Patients with Heart Failure). 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96 The SADHART‐CHF study demonstrated that depression remission by sertraline may improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure 95, 96 but ignored sertraline's direct effect on cardiac Sigmar1 (if any). Moreover, a secondary analysis of the ENRICHD (Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease) clinical trial showed that antidepressant treatment with the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline (having Sigmar1 agonist activity in the nanomolar range) was associated with > 40% reduction in the relative adjusted risk of death and reinfarction. 14 Therefore, the present results may encourage clinical research to evaluate the potential role of Sigmar1 in cardiovascular disease.

### Depression as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in coronary heart disease [^1163Q5gu]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Trials that have tested psychotherapeutic interventions, or combinations of psychotherapy and medication, have also produced mixed results. The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) study is the largest trial to date in this area. A total of 2,481 patients were recruited within 1 month of an acute MI and met the study's criteria for depression (n = 978), low perceived social support (n = 647), or both (n = 856). (Low perceived social support was an eligibility criterion for ENRICHD because, like depression, it increases the risk of adverse cardiac outcomes). The participants were randomly assigned to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or to usual care (UC). Some patients in the intervention arm received sertraline in addition to CBT. The intervention was superior to usual care for depression among the depressed participants, but the effect was modest; on average, the groups differed by less than 2 points on the HRSD and less than 3 points on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The intervention also had statistically significant but small effects on social support among the participants who had low perceived social support at enrollment.

There was no difference between the treatment and control groups in cardiac event-free survival. However, ENRICHD provided a weak test of the causal risk factor hypothesis because the ENRICHD intervention had weak effects on depression and social support. It will not be possible to conduct a much stronger test of this hypothesis until more effective interventions for depression are developed. There has been some progress toward this objective, but we may have to wait a few more years for a rigorous, randomized, controlled test of the hypothesis that depression is a modifiable, causal risk factor for adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD.

Several trials that have produced disappointing primary results have turned out to be very informative in an unexpected way. Secondary analyses of these trials have revealed that patients who remain depressed despite aggressive treatment are at significantly higher risk for adverse cardiac outcomes than are patients who do respond to treatment. Treatment-resistant depression appears to be a particularly high-risk form of depression in patients with CHD, and a more robust predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes than other subtypes, such as depression with salient somatic symptoms.

### The impact of changes in depression on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease [^113aFtKP]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Post-MI patients with depression have reduced compliance with low-fat diets, regular exercise, and medication adherence. So, adverse behavioral and lifestyle practices among those with persistent or increasing depression in this cohort could partially explain adverse CV outcomes in this group. Rieckmann et al. revealed subsequent improvements in medication adherence with decreasing depressive symptoms. These results and previous literature contextualize the benefit of serial depression screening and emphasize the need for these screenings in preventive cardiac care — sentiments previously expressed by the American Heart Association. Regular screening could lead to timely recognition and intervention of increasing or persistent depression among those with CHD, thereby mitigating risky lifestyle practices and promoting healthy behaviors that reduce MACE in these individuals.

The impact of non–lifestyle therapies that mitigate worsening or persistent depression on CV health needs further clarification. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to decrease depression in patients and improve HDL levels in patients with CHD. Trials examining antidepressant medications' impact on CV outcomes in post-ACS patients have produced mixed results. Sweda and colleagues' meta-analysis failed to show mortality or MI benefit of antidepressant therapy in post-ACS patients; however, it included trials, such as MIND-IT and SADHART, with treatment-resistant depression and studies with patients without depression — rendering the results controversial. When restricted to trials that included post-ACS patients with concomitant depression, those treated with antidepressants had less incidence of recurrent MI than those without therapy. Furthermore, in recent trials and secondary analyses, antidepressants reduced MACE in post-MI patients with treatment-responsive depression compared to their counterparts with treatment-refractory depression or placebo. Thus, there may be cardiac benefit of antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy in select at-risk individuals with persistent depression, similar to our cohort. More clinical trials that elucidate the impact of these therapies on CV health in those with CHD are warranted.

### Long-term outcomes of enhanced depression treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^111sSjSe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The Coronary Psychosocial Evaluation Studies trial demonstrated promising results for enhanced depression treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk of patients with acute coronary syndrome and comorbid depression, but the long-term effectiveness of this intervention is unclear.

Methods

A total of 157 participants with persistent depression after hospitalization for acute coronary syndromes were enrolled in the Coronary Psychosocial Evaluation Studies trial. A total of 80 participants were allocated to 6 months of enhanced depression treatment, and 77 participants were allocated to usual care. We report on an additional 12 months of observational follow-up for the composite outcome of death or first hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Results

Although the intervention was previously shown to have favorable cardiovascular effects during the treatment period, we observed a significant time-by-treatment group interaction during extended follow-up (P = 0.008). Specifically, during the 6-month treatment period, death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction/unstable angina occurred in 3 participants (4%) in the treatment group compared with 11 participants (14%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.90; P = 0.03). In contrast, during 12 months of additional observational follow-up, 11 participants (14%) in the treatment group experienced the composite outcome of death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction/unstable angina compared with 3 participants (4%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–10.56; P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Enhanced depression treatment was associated with a reduced risk of death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction/unstable angina during active treatment, but this effect did not persist after treatment ceased. Future research is needed to confirm our findings and to determine the optimal duration of depression treatment in patients with depression after acute coronary syndromes.

### Sotalol [^115TeezP]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Figure 2 and Tables 3 and 4 show the results of the trial. There was a longer time to ECG-documented recurrence of AFIB and a reduced risk of recurrence at 6 months compared to placebo.

Figure 2

Study 2 - Time to First ECG-Documented Recurrence of Symptomatic

Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease

In a multicenter double-blind randomized study reported by D. Julian et al, the effect of sotalol 320 mg once daily was compared with that of placebo in 1456 patients (randomized 3:2, sotalol to placebo) surviving an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Treatment was started 5 to 14 days after infarction. Patients were followed for 12 months. The mortality rate was 7.3% in the sotalol group and 8.9% in the placebo group, not a statistically significant difference. Although the results do not show evidence of a benefit of sotalol in this population, they do not show an added risk in post MI patients receiving sotalol.

### Acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina and non-ST elevation MI) [^115b9ujm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) the incidence of serious adverse outcomes (such as death, acute myocardial infarction [MI], or refractory angina requiring emergency revascularisation) is 5–10% within the first 7 days and about 15% at 30 days. Between 5–14% of people with acute coronary syndrome die in the year after diagnosis, with about half of these deaths occurring within 4 weeks of diagnosis.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: antiplatelet; antithrombin; anti-ischaemic; lipid-lowering; and invasive treatments? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 32 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: aspirin, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, clopidogrel, direct thrombin inhibitors, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (oral or intravenous), heparin (low molecular weight, unfractionated), nitrates, routine early cardiac catheterisation and revascularisation, statins, and warfarin.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1155Dfoj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

SGAs versus exercise — monotherapy with sertraline was associated with increased risk for discontinuation due to adverse effects compared with exercise across two trials, although both studies showed no difference in serious adverse events; one trial of combination therapy showed no difference in overall discontinuation or discontinuation due to adverse events for sertraline alone versus sertraline plus exercise.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — bupropion hydrochloride — XL [^111tqYHW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the 3 trials of bupropion HCl extended-release in seasonal affective disorder, there were significant elevations in blood pressure. Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction for 2% of the bupropion group (11/537) and none in the placebo group (0/511). In the SAD trials, 2 patients treated with bupropion discontinued from the study because they developed hypertension. None of the placebo group discontinued because of hypertension. The mean increase in systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mmHg in the bupropion group and 0.1 mmHg in the placebo group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.013). The mean increase in diastolic blood pressure was 0.8 mmHg in the bupropion group and 0.1 mmHg in the placebo group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.075). In the SAD trials, 82% of patients were treated with 300 mg per day, and 18% were treated with 150 mg per day. The mean daily dose was 270 mg per day. The mean duration of bupropion exposure was 126 days.

In a clinical trial of bupropion immediate-release in MDD subjects with stable congestive heart failure (CHF) (N = 36), bupropion was associated with an exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension in 2 subjects, leading to discontinuation of bupropion treatment. There are no controlled studies assessing the safety of bupropion in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiac disease.

5.5 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic manic episode. The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating bupropion hydrochloride (XL), screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression). Bupropion hydrochloride (XL) is not approved for the treatment of bipolar depression.

5.6 Psychosis and Other Neuropsychiatric Reactions

Depressed patients treated with bupropion have had a variety of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, concentration disturbance, paranoia, and confusion. Some of these patients had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In some cases, these symptoms abated upon dose reduction and/or withdrawal of treatment. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride (XL) if these reactions occur.

### Effects of ranolazine on recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: the MERLIN-TIMI 36 randomized trial [^115N2T67]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Ranolazine is a novel antianginal agent that reduces ischemia in patients with chronic angina but has not been studied in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of ranolazine during long-term treatment of patients with non-ST-elevation ACS.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial of 6560 patients within 48 hours of ischemic symptoms who were treated with ranolazine (initiated intravenously and followed by oral ranolazine extended-release 1000 mg twice daily, n = 3279) or matching placebo (n = 3281), and followed up for a median of 348 days in the Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes (MERLIN)-TIMI 36 trial between October 8, 2004, and February 14, 2007.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or recurrent ischemia through the end of study. The major safety end points were death from any cause and symptomatic documented arrhythmia.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 696 patients (21.8%) in the ranolazine group and 753 patients (23.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83–1.02; P = 0.11). The major secondary end point (cardiovascular death, MI, or severe recurrent ischemia) occurred in 602 patients (18.7%) in the ranolazine group and 625 (19.2%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86–1.08; P = 0.50). Cardiovascular death or MI occurred in 338 patients (10.4%) allocated to ranolazine and 343 patients (10.5%) allocated to placebo (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85–1.15; P = 0.87). Recurrent ischemia was reduced in the ranolazine group (430 [13.9%]) compared with the placebo group (494 [16.1%]; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76–0.99; P = 0.03). QTc prolongation requiring a reduction in the dose of intravenous drug occurred in 31 patients (0.9%) receiving ranolazine compared with 10 patients (0.3%) receiving placebo. Symptomatic documented arrhythmias did not differ between the ranolazine (99 [3.0%]) and placebo (102 [3.1%]) groups (P = 0.84). No difference in total mortality was observed with ranolazine compared with placebo (172 vs 175; HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.80–1.22; P = 0.91).

Conclusions

The addition of ranolazine to standard treatment for ACS was not effective in reducing major cardiovascular events. Ranolazine did not adversely affect the risk of all-cause death or symptomatic documented arrhythmia. Our findings provide support for the safety and efficacy of ranolazine as antianginal therapy.

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the DEPACS study [^111VBTb8]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Long-term cardiac outcomes

Comprehensive evaluations for cardiac outcomes were conducted for data on hospital admissions, deaths, recurrent MI and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To enable non-hierarchic endpoint analyses, all patients were followed for the evaluation point of interest or until death. The primary endpoint was a MACE, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, MI and PCI (excluding non-emergent PCIs). Secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, cardiac death (defined as sudden death when no other explanation was available, death from arrhythmias or after MI or heart failure, or death caused by heart surgery or endocarditis), MI and PCI. An independent endpoint committee composed of study cardiologists adjudicated all potential events, blind to participants' depression status.

Statistical analysis

According to the depression screening, diagnosis and treatment status at baseline, participants were divided into five groups: 651 screening negative, 55 screening positive but not found to have a depressive disorder, 149 with depressive disorder randomised to escitalopram, 151 with depressive disorder randomised to placebo and 146 with depressive disorder receiving MTO. Demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline were compared between the five groups using analysis of variance or χ² tests with post-hoc Scheffe's tests, or using individual pairwise post-hoc comparisons between the five groups as appropriate. Characteristics significantly associated with group status (p < 0.05) and/or with potential effects on MACE were used as covariates a priori in further adjusted analyses. For investigating the effects of depression screening and diagnosis on long-term MACE in ACS, Kaplan–Meier curves were constructed and the cumulative proportion of MACE by negative v. positive screening status (and further by screening positive with v. without depressive disorder status) at baseline was compared using the log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the time to MACE after adjustment for the potential covariates described above. For investigating subsequent depression treatment effects according to treatment allocations, the same Cox proportional hazards models were used among the four depressive screening-positive groups with individual pairwise post-hoc comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were carried out excluding patients taking antidepressants at the 1-year post-ACS examination to exclude the possible medication effects on long-term cardiac outcomes. To adjust for an overall type I error rate of p < 0.05 for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni corrections were conducted (five comparisons: a primary and four secondary endpoints; 0.05/5 = 0.01) in the long-term cardiac outcome analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 21.0 software.

### A comparison of the risk of QT prolongation among SSRIs [^114utU3K]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report QT prolongation potential in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in order to advise clinicians on safe use of SSRIs other than citalopram in light of citalopram warnings.

Data Sources

Primary literature and case reports were identified through a systematic search. Data from drug manufacturers, package inserts, and the ArizonaCERT database were also utilized.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and case reports were included.

Data Synthesis

Studies demonstrate possible dose-related clinically significant QT prolongation with escitalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline at traditional doses demonstrate a lack of clinically significant increases in QTc in the majority of studies. Further, paroxetine monotherapy shows a lack of clinically significant QTc prolongation in all studies. However, case reports or reporting tools still link these SSRIs with QTc prolongation. Fluoxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline used in post-acute coronary syndrome patients did not demonstrate risk of QTc prolongation.

Conclusion

For clinicians who choose not to use citalopram due to recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, other antidepressants within this class may be considered. When citalopram is not utilized based on risk factors for TdP, use of escitalopram is not likely the safest alternative. Based on current literature, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline appear to have similar, low risk for QT prolongation, and paroxetine appears to have the lowest risk. However, there are significant limitations in interpreting the studies, including varying definitions of significant QT prolongation. Therefore, choice of an alternative SSRI should be based on individual risk factors for arrhythmias and other patient-specific factors.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^112DEibv]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that includes unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels as well as a review of past medical history. Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, and HmG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

### Nonresponse to treatment for depression following myocardial infarction: association with subsequent cardiac events [^115XokkC]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Depression following myocardial infarction is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, but attempts to alter cardiovascular prognosis by providing antidepressive treatment have not been successful. This may be because of the limited effects of antidepressive treatment on depression itself. The authors assessed whether nonresponse to treatment of post-myocardial infarction depression is associated with new cardiac events.

Method

The authors made a subgroup analysis of a multicenter randomized, clinical trial on the effects of antidepressant treatment for post-myocardial infarction depression. Patients were enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment with mirtazapine (30 mg/day) and, in the case of insufficient treatment response after 8 weeks, open treatment with citalopram. Patients were classified as responders to antidepressants (at least 50% reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating scale [HAM-D] score or HAM-D score < 9 at 24 weeks) (N = 43) or as nonresponders (N = 27) and compared to untreated control subjects (N = 98) on cardiac events (cardiac mortality or cardiac-related hospital admission) after 24 weeks post-random assignment and within 18 months after index infarction.

Results

The event rate was 25.6% among nonresponders, 11.2% among untreated control subjects, and 7.4% among responders. In relation to untreated comparison subjects, nonresponders had a hazard ratio of 2.66 for new cardiovascular events, which remained after the authors controlled for potential confounders (hazard ratio = 2.92).

Conclusions

This study provides further preliminary evidence that nonresponse to treatment of post-myocardial infarction depression may be associated with cardiac events. Efforts should be dedicated to developing more effective treatments for depressed patients with myocardial infarction.

### Sertraline treatment of major depression in patients with acute MI or unstable angina… [^116w3iaE]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

2 groups, both CGI-I and HAM-D measures were significantly better in those assigned to sertraline. Conclusion Our results suggest that sertraline is a safe and effective treatment for recurrent depression in patients with recent MI or unstable angina and without other life-threatening medical conditions. Although a connection between mood and the heart has been a part of. 1 mm within 12 hours of an episode of chest pain; or were hospitalized for symptoms of unstable angina and had known coronary artery disease with a documented history of a prior MI, had undergone a prior revascularization procedure, or had documented coronary artery stenosis greater than 75% in. unstable angina developed less than 3 months after coronary artery bypass graft procedure; resting heart rate of less than 40/min; MI or unstable angina of nonatherosclerotic etiology;. treatment.

Scans were read by the core laboratory at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Secondary safety variables consisted of heart rate, blood pressure, standard ECG, runs of ventricular premature complexes and heart rate variability, and the occurrence of cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, severe angina, congestive heart failure, and death. status using the standard criteria of CGI-I score of 1 or 2 was achieved at end point by significantly more patients treated with sertraline than with placebo. Responder rates for placebo-treated patients decreased as criteria for severity of the subgroup increased. Our study was designed primarily to evaluate the cardiovascular safety. of sertraline in patients with MDD after hospitalization for MI or unstable angina. We found no evidence of harm: sertraline was indistinguishable from placebo across all surrogate measures of cardiovascular safety.

Treatment was not associated with any change in LVEF, blood pressure, heart rate, arrhythmias. or SDNN on 24-hour ambulatory ECGs, with QTc prolongation, or with any other ECG parameters. Furthermore, though not statistically significant, the incidence of severe cardiac events, the gold standard for cardiac safety, was numerically lower among patients receiving sertraline than among those receiving placebo.

### Does eptifibatide confer a greater benefit to patients with unstable angina than with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction? Insights from the PURSUIT trial [^112jFTZw]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the differential effects of eptifibatide therapy on unstable angina vs non-ST elevation myocardial infarction at enrollment, since the separate impact on these two major diagnostic subsets of acute coronary syndrome patients has not been fully investigated.

Methods and Results

We examined the 9461 patients in the PURSUIT trial (conducted between 1995 and 1997) to compare the effects of eptifibatide on unstable angina and myocardial infarction. The study showed greater and more consistent effects of eptifibatide therapy on unstable angina than non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in reducing 30-day death/(re)infarction (from the unadjusted rate of 13.0% to 11.2%, P = 0.059 for unstable angina; and 18.9% to 17.9%, P = 0.387 for myocardial infarction), especially among patients who underwent early percutaneous coronary intervention (odds ratios = 0.49 and 0.86, 95% confidence intervals = 0.30–0.80 and 0.53–1.42, respectively, for unstable angina and myocardial infarction). The only subgroup for whom the benefit of eptifibatide was not evident was female myocardial infarction patients who did not undergo early percutaneous coronary intervention.

Conclusions

These data suggest that eptifibatide benefited unstable angina patients more than myocardial infarction patients, especially among those who underwent early percutaneous coronary intervention, and support its use as concomitant therapy with early percutaneous coronary intervention especially in female myocardial infarction patients.

### Efficacy of ranolazine in patients with chronic angina observations from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (metabolic efficiency with ranolazine for less ischemia in non-ST-Segment elevation acute coronary syndromes) 36 trial [^111sk4pX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in a larger and more diverse group of patients with angina than previously studied.

Background

Ranolazine is an antianginal shown to reduce angina and improve exercise performance in selected patients with early-positive exercise testing and those with frequent angina.

Methods

We investigated the antianginal effects of ranolazine in the subgroup of patients with prior chronic angina (n = 3,565, 54%) enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) 36 trial of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Follow-up was a median of 350 days.

Results

Patients with prior angina received evidence-based therapy (95% aspirin, 78% statins, 89% beta-blockers, average 2.9 antianginal agents). The primary end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia) was less frequent with ranolazine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.97; p = 0.017), due entirely to a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.91; p = 0.002). Ranolazine also reduced worsening angina (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.00; p = 0.048) and intensification of antianginal therapy (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.92, p = 0.005). Exercise duration at 8 months was greater with ranolazine (514 s vs. 482 s, p = 0.002). Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction did not differ between treatment groups (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.16; p = 0.71). Symptomatic documented arrhythmias (2.9% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.92) and total mortality (6.2% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.96) were similar with ranolazine or placebo.

### Characteristics of depression remission and its relation with cardiovascular outcome among patients with chronic heart failure (from the SADHART-CHF study) [^116AGXGN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Depression is prevalent in patients with heart failure and is associated with a significant increase in hospitalizations and death. Primary results of the Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure (SADHART-CHF) trial revealed that sertraline and placebo had comparable effects on depression and cardiovascular outcomes. In this study, we explored whether remission from depression was associated with better survival and aimed to characterize participants who remitted during the trial. Based on depression response during the 12-week treatment phase, SADHART-CHF participants were divided into 2 groups: (1) remission, defined as participants whose last measured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score was < 8, and (2) nonremission, defined as participants whose last measured HDRS score was ≥ 8. Patients who dropped out before having any repeat HDRS were not included. Baseline characteristics and survival differences up to 5 years were evaluated between the remission and nonremission groups. Of the 469 SADHART-CHF participants, 208 (44.3%) achieved remission, 194 (41.4%) remained depressed, and 67 (14.3%) dropped out or died without any repeat HDRS assessment. Patients in the remission group had significantly fewer cardiovascular events than those in the nonremission group (1.34 ± 1.86 vs 1.93 ± 2.71, adjusted p = 0.01). Men patients were more likely to remit than women patients (56.5 vs 44.8%, p = 0.02). The remission group had milder depressive symptoms at baseline compared to the nonremission group (HDRS 17.0 ± 5.4 vs 19.6 ± 5.5, Beck Depression Inventory scale 17.9 ± 6.5 vs 20.3 ± 7.2, p < 0.001 for the 2 comparisons). In conclusion, this study indicates that remission from depression may improve the cardiovascular outcome of patients with heart failure.

Other Clinical Events

There were 367 readmission episodes during the follow-up, including first-time and recurrent events (Table). Readmissions for noncardiac causes were more common. Figure 4 shows the differences in RMST for all secondary end points. There were no differences between invasive and conservative treatment for the composite secondary end points. Similarly, there were no significant differences for the individual components of the secondary end points considering recurrent events (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The invasive treatment was associated with a numerically lower but nonsignificant risk of readmission for unstable angina and other cardiac reasons and a higher risk for bleeding.

### Health status and depression remission in patients with chronic heart failure: patient-reported outcomes from the SADHART-CHF trial [^116ovGAN]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a common comorbidity in heart failure and is strongly associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and reduced health status. Whether depression treatment may result in improvement of health status in heart failure patients with comorbid depression remains unknown.

Methods and Results

The Sertraline Against Depression and Heart Disease in Chronic Heart Failure study randomized 469 participants with chronic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction 45% and New York Heart Association class II) and major depressive disorder based on Diagnostic Statistics Manual fourth edition criteria to sertraline or placebo for 12 weeks. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and 6-minute walk test were used to assess health status. Health status changes between treatment arms and remission status were evaluated adjusting for baseline variables and treatment assignment. The final Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were 3.50 ± 2.08 and 12.97 ± 4.33 in the remission and nonremission groups, respectively (P value = 0.0001). Of 469 total participants, 378 (80.6%) completed the 6-minute walk test and 285 (70.1%) completed Kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire and 36-item short-form health survey, at baseline and at week 12. Depression remission was significantly associated with higher improvements in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire subscale scores (P < 0.001) except on the Self-Efficacy (P = 0.18) and Symptom Stability (P = 0.91). On the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, depression remission was associated with significant improvement in subscales of the physical and mental component summary except the Pain Index (P = 0.34). The 6-minute walk test improved more in depression remission compared with nonremission group (difference from baseline: 63.51 ± 238.78 versus 16.24 ± 115.70 m, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure whose depressive symptoms remitted had significantly greater improvement in physical function, social function, and quality of life.

### Short-TErm psychotherapy IN acute myocardial infarction (STEP-IN-AMI) trial: final results [^116QyG6J]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this research was to assess whether short-term psychotherapy enhances long-term clinical outcomes in patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Methods

Patients ≤ 70 years old were randomized within 1 week of their AMI to short-term ontopsychological psychotherapy plus routine medical therapy vs routine medical therapy only. The primary composite outcome was defined as the combined incidence of new cardiovascular events (re-infarction, death, stroke, revascularization, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and the recurrence of clinically significant angina) and clinically significant new comorbidities. Secondary outcome measures were: rates for individual components of the primary composite outcome; the rate of re-hospitalization for cardiovascular problems; and New York Heart Association functional class.

Results

Ninety-four patients were analyzed, translating into 425 patient-years. The 2 treatment groups were similar across baseline characteristics. At 5-year follow-up, psychotherapy patients had a lower incidence of primary outcome, relative to controls (77/223 vs 98/202 patient-years, respectively; P = 0.035; absolute risk reduction = 19%, number needed to treat = 8); this benefit was attributable to the lower incidence of new comorbidities and clinically significant angina in the psychotherapy group. Gains in the primary outcome, relative to controls, among psychotherapy patients occurred in the first year and subsequently remained stable over the following 4 years.

Conclusions

Adding short-term ontopsychological psychotherapy to routine secondary prevention of myocardial infarction improves clinical outcomes overall up to 5 years post AMI. Studying time trends may aid in better targeting of psychological interventions during follow-up. Larger studies remain necessary to confirm these results.

### Management of persistent angina after myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the TRANSLATE-ACS study [^117Qc5jW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

More than 1.5 million Americans have myocardial infarctions (MI) each year, and many of these patients continue to have angina symptoms with important implications for patient quality of life and healthcare utilization. 1, 2 Patients with angina are more likely to report limited physical function and depression, and are more likely to be rehospitalized within 1 year of their index MI. 3, 4, 5, 6

The principal treatment goal for these patients is control of angina symptoms, and 4 classes of medications are approved for the treatment of angina in the United States — β‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and ranolazine. 7 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is also indicated for management of angina symptoms that cannot be controlled with optimal medical therapy. 8, 9 β‐Blockers reduce mortality in patients with acute MI, and are thus recommended as first‐line therapy for patients with angina. For patients with angina despite β‐blocker treatment, guidelines recommend adding additional non–β‐blocker antianginal medications in a stepwise manner before proceeding to PCI for refractory angina. 9 The prevalence of non–β‐blocker antianginal medication use among patients with post‐MI angina has not been well described, and it is unclear whether providers adhere to these guidelines.

In TRANSLATE‐ACS (Treatment With Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome), investigators collected longitudinal information on patient‐reported angina and antianginal medication use for patients initially hospitalized with an acute MI that was treated with PCI. This offered a unique opportunity to describe the prevalence and longitudinal patterns of post‐MI angina as well as antianginal medication(s) used in its treatment.

Statistical Analysis

A sample size of 50 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 8.0 g infarct mass as assessed by MRI (the difference between a Group 1 mean, μ 1, of 40.0 g, and a Group 2 mean, μ 2, of 32.0 g), assuming that the common SD is 14.0 g infarct mass 38 using a 2‐group t test with a 0.05 2‐sided significance level. However, we anticipate that about 10% of patients in the control group will have LVEF ≤ 40%, in which case they will receive the trial treatment as a matter of standard care. To allow for this dilution of the treatment effect, we have increased the sample size in each group to 62. If we further assume an attrition rate of approximately 15%, then 75 patients per group will be needed, for a total trial size of 150 patients.

Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Inc. Cary, NC). The Fisher exact test will be used to compare categorical variables. Continuous variables will be compared with a mixed‐effects model to account for repeated measures. Primary data analysis will be performed in the intention‐to‐treat population, regardless of the treatment that was actually received. The results of as‐treated analyses for primary and secondary endpoints will also be calculated. Time‐to‐event analyses (secondary clinical endpoints), based on all available follow‐up data, will be performed with the use of Kaplan‐Meier estimates and be compared between groups with the use of the log‐rank test. A generalized linear model will be used to calculate risk ratios in the subgroup analyses and to test for interactions. After 75 patients have completed the trial, an interim analysis will be performed by the study statistician for safety reasons. The results will be evaluated by the data‐monitoring committee.

Data Management, Funding and Logistics

University College London is the sponsor of the trial. Data will be collected by a paper case report form and entered onto the Web‐based electronic RedCap database. An independent data‐monitoring committee (IDMC) will be installed to monitor the progress of the study as well as any safety concerns. All expected or unexpected adverse events will be reviewed continuously by the investigators, the sponsor and the IDMC according to the sponsor's regulations. The MINIMISE‐STEMI trial is funded by the Rosetrees Trust and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network.

Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease

In a multicenter double-blind randomized study reported by D. Julian et al, the effect of sotalol 320 mg once daily was compared with that of placebo in 1456 patients (randomized 3:2, sotalol to placebo) surviving an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Treatment was started 5 to 14 days after infarction. Patients were followed for 12 months. The mortality rate was 7.3% in the sotalol group and 8.9% in the placebo group, not a statistically significant difference. Although the results do not show evidence of a benefit of sotalol in this population, they do not show an added risk in post MI patients receiving sotalol.

### Beta-blockers after PCI for stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [^114jPkD8]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Another recent study, the REDUCE-AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, showed no reduction in all-cause mortality or MI with beta-blocker therapy over a median follow-up of 3.5 years. These recent studies and our report collectively suggest that in the era of modern revascularization and medical therapy, the role of beta-blockers needs careful re-evaluation, especially in patients with preserved LVEF after PCI.

The observed increase in all-cause mortality could be attributed to several factors inherent to patients with stable CAD and preserved LVEF, where the pathophysiological benefits of reduced myocardial oxygen demand and HR control may not outweigh the risks of adverse inotropic effects and potential for hypotension. Moreover, the absence of left ventricular dysfunction might reduce the necessity and effectiveness of beta-adrenergic blockade in this subgroup, as the primary mechanisms of sudden cardiac death and myocardial ischemia differ from those with compromised cardiac function. Furthermore, in patients undergoing revascularization, beta-blockers are unlikely to provide further benefits after revascularization with normal LVEF, mainly when the patients are compliant with guideline-directed therapies. In a meta-analysis of 60 trials (102,003 patients), beta-blockers significantly reduced mortality and angina beyond 1 year in trials conducted in the pre-reperfusion era. However, during the reperfusion era, trials demonstrated beta-blocker benefits were limited to reducing MI and angina at 30 days, with notable increases in HF, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation within the first year.

The strength of the current study lies in adopting an incident user design and target trial emulation approach that may minimize several biases. Second, the TriNetX database, with many sites, geographical range, and diversity, allowed us to adjust to a wide range of potential confounders. While our study uniquely tracked continuous beta-blocker prescription status after discharge, a factor not considered in previous studies, patients' actual adherence to treatment regimens remains uncertain. However, the observed patterns mirror the adherence patterns in clinical trials and real-world settings. Finally, our conclusions are supported by the consistency of the results across multiple sensitivity analyses, coupled with a thorough evaluation of efficacy and safety profiles of the beta-blocker initiation strategy.

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the DEPACS study [^113N6pam]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is common in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina. Comorbid depression has been robustly associated with poor prognosis of ACS including increased mortality and non-fatal events (Nicholson, Kuper, & Hemingway). Since ACS and depression are two leading causes of disability (Mathers, Fat, & Boerma,), their comorbidity may generate a high disease burden. Accordingly, the screening and treatment of depression have been considered as potentially important, although there has been no consensus on applying this procedure to real clinical practice for patients with ACS.

In 2008, the American Heart Association (AHA) Science Advisory recommended routine screening for depression in patients with ACS considering the deleterious effects of depression on ACS prognosis (Lichtman et al.). However, shortly afterward, a systematic review found no evidence for or against the recommendations that depression should be evaluated or that screening for depression should be considered as part of standard care in patients with ACS (Thombs et al.). This argument was strongly influenced by the lack of evidence for significant beneficial effects of antidepressant or cognitive behavioural treatment for depression on long-term cardiac outcomes in patients with ACS (Berkman et al; Glassman, Bigger, & Gaffney; van Melle et al.). On the one hand, the need for appropriate screening guidelines has been highlighted because depression is an important cardiac risk marker, is a treatable condition, and its presence warrants more aggressive cardiac care and secondary prevention efforts regardless of whether treating depression can improve cardiac outcomes (Carney, Freedland, & Jaffe). On the other hand, there have been additional calls for reassessing AHA recommendations for routine screening of depression because of the extra time and cost involved (Thombs et al; Ziegelstein, Thombs, Coyne, & de Jonge,), particularly given the pressing need for treatment of ACS in its acute phase (Anderson et al.), and the high costs associated with ACS (Benjamin et al.).

### Depression as a risk factor for adverse outcomes in coronary heart disease [^1165QuSh]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Time factors

Coronary atherosclerosis usually starts to develop long before it produces any clinical manifestations or requires intervention. Its initial clinical presentation is often lethal, and relatively little is known about the role of depression in these cases. Thus, most of what we know about the effect of depression on cardiac outcomes is based on studies of patients who have survived the clinical onset of CHD. Whether the strength of the effect of depression differs between patients who survive the onset of CHD and those who do not is very difficult to study.

Initial, non-lethal presentations of coronary disease come in a variety of forms, including discovery via routine testing, exertional angina, unstable angina, acute MI, and others, and they may or may not require coronary revascularization via percutaneous intervention (PCI) or CABG surgery. Some depression studies enroll patients after a particular kind of initial presentation, such as after an acute MI. Other studies are more inclusive and enroll patients who began their cardiac careers in a variety of different ways. In some studies, depression is assessed shortly (for example, within 1 month) after one of these initial cardiac events. In other studies, the first assessment of depression occurs long after (for example, 3 to 6 months) the initial cardiac event. In still other studies, the first assessment of depression may not follow the initial cardiac event, at least not in every case. For example, in a study of depression in patients with 'stable CHD', some of the patients may have no history of acute MI, others may have had only one MI, and still others may have had multiple MIs.

Time-dependent risk after clinical events shows that the risk of SCD is not linear over time, with the most rapid attrition during the first 6 to 18 mo after the index event. Curves of this type have been generated in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, new onset of heart failure, unstable angina, and high-risk patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI), and benefits from controlled trials may diverge early with post-MI beta-blockers and clopidogrel in ACSs or later with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. Mortality is highest in the first month after acute MI in patients with ejection fraction (EF) of less than 30%.

Psychological interventions after coronary revascularization — In patients who have undergone coronary revascularization who have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress, treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological counseling, and/or pharmacological interventions is beneficial to improve quality of life and cardiac outcomes; in patients who have undergone coronary revascularization, it may be reasonable to screen for depression and refer or treat when it is indicated to improve quality of life and recovery. Presurgery estimates of depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) range from 14% to 43%, and about 20% of patients who undergo CABG remain depressed postoperatively. In the EsDEPACS trial, escitalopram was superior to placebo in reducing depression during the 24-week trial, and long-term follow-up showed that escitalopram resulted in a significantly lower risk of MACE and MI but not death; in ENRICHD, therapy was associated with improved depression but not event-free survival after 24 months of follow-up, with a subgroup analysis finding a 42% lower risk of death or MI in patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The Bypassing the Blues trial randomized depressed patients undergoing CABG to 8 months of collaborative care or usual care and demonstrated a 50% reduction in depression scores and improved quality of life in the collaborative care group, and a meta-analysis of these trials reported a reduction in cardiovascular deaths but not overall deaths, MI, or revascularization with psychological interventions. In the CODIACS-QoL trial evaluating 1500 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without a history of depression, universal depression screening with clinician notification did not alter quality of life, depression-free days, depressive symptoms, mortality rate, or patient-reported harms in patients with ACS.

### Benefits of immediate initiation of statin therapy following successful coronary stent implantation in patients with stable and unstable angina pectoris and Q-wave acute myocardial infarction [^1133gvpM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces clinical events in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Recent data indicate that the beneficial effects of statin therapy may also extend to patients experiencing an acute ischemic coronary event. However, the potential role of statins to further modify clinical outcome in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation has not been addressed. Therefore, we investigated whether the initiation of statin therapy immediately after successful coronary stent implantation improves short-term clinical outcome in 704 patients (335 patients with stable angina pectoris [AP], 224 patients with unstable AP, and 145 patients with Q-wave acute myocardial infarction [AMI]). Compared with the lowest risk group (patients with stable AP receiving statin therapy), patients with unstable AP (RR 6.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 31, p = 0.004) and patients with Q-wave AMI (RR 7.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 37, p = 0.004) experienced an increased risk for the occurrence of the primary combined end point of cardiac death and AMI. Importantly, initiation of statin therapy abrogated the increased risk in patients with unstable AP to the level of patients with stable AP receiving statin therapy (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.2 to 11, p = 0.7). In contrast, statin therapy did not affect the RR in patients with Q-wave AMI during 6-month follow-up (RR 7.9, 95% CI 1.6 to 39 vs RR 7.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 37, p = NS). The beneficial effects of statin therapy after successful coronary stent implantation in unstable AP were most prominent during the first 4 weeks after the ischemic episode. Statins appear to contribute to the rapid transformation of unstable coronary artery disease into a stable condition with a very low event rate over the forthcoming 6 months in patients with unstable AP undergoing successful coronary stent implantation.

### Depression is a risk factor for mortality after myocardial infarction: fact or artifact? [^116sfEtS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the long-term impact of depression on cardiac mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) and to assess whether the timing of depression influences the findings.

Background

Previous studies have shown that depression increases the risk of cardiac death after MI, although some studies with robust methodology have failed to show this effect. Clinical trials of depression treatments have failed to improve mortality. Until the relationship between depression and post-MI mortality is understood fully, clinical trials aimed at reducing mortality by treating depression remain premature.

Methods

We recruited 588 subjects after MI and followed up their cases for up to 8 years. Patients underwent detailed assessments of cardiac status, conventional cardiac risk factors, and noncardiac illness at baseline. Depression was assessed for the period immediately preceding MI and at 12 months after MI, using a standardized questionnaire and a research interview. At follow-up, the mortality status, cause, and date of death were recorded for 587 subjects using population records.

Results

Multivariate predictors of cardiac death included older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, p = 0.007), previous angina (HR = 1.8, p = 0.03), previous MIs (HR = 1.6, p = 0.004), Killip class (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005), beta-blockers (HR = 0.5, p = 0.023), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR = 0.6, p = 0.047) prescribed on discharge. Depression was not associated with cardiac mortality, whether detected immediately before MI (p = 0.48), 12 months after MI (p = 0.27), or at both time points (p = 0.97).

Conclusions

The association between depression and post-MI mortality is complex, possibly being limited to depression immediately after MI. Defining the window when intervention for depression might benefit survival is crucial for the design of future trials.

### Rizatriptan benzoate (Maxalt-mlt) [^112YRcEX]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following use of 5-HT agonists. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).

Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: Adverse experiences to rizatriptan were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 patients who received single or multiple doses of MAXALT Tablets. The most common adverse events during treatment with MAXALT were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These events appeared to be dose related. In long term extension studies where patients were allowed to treat multiple attacks for up to 1 year, 4% (59 out of 1525 patients) withdrew because of adverse experiences.

Table 3 lists the adverse events regardless of drug relationship (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of MAXALT. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.

### Heart rate variability in acute coronary syndrome patients with major depression… [^111thUxc]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Heart rate variability recovery following myocardial infarction in the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Randomized Trial and studies by Jokinen et al37 and McFarlane et al. 29 Comparison A contrasts 2 samples of acute coronary syndrome patients who were not depressed with the depressed patients given placebo after ACS from the current study and that by McFarlane et al. 29 Patients who were not depressed after ACS showed substantial HRV recovery, while HRV in depressed ACS patients given placebo actually decreased from baseline. Results At baseline, prior episodes of MDD were associated with lower HRV. Sertraline significantly increased ultra low–frequency power, while improvement in mood was associated with higher low-frequency power independent of treatment. However, the expected recovery in HRV following ACS was not observed in patients with MDD.

Higher ultra low–frequency during sertraline treatment and higher low-frequency power in patients whose mood improved resulted primarily from these measures decreasing in their comparison groups. of sertraline treatment in 369 acute coronary syndrome patients and observed a reduction in death and recurrent myocardial infarction similar to that seen in ENRICHD. 22 Although randomized and controlled, SADHART was not powered to detect an effect on mortality and, as would be expected, the observed effect was not statistically significant. Heart rate variability measures from 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram recordings were obtained at baseline from 290 of the 369 patients enrolled in SADHART. Paired baseline and week 16 recordings were available in 258 cases. Randomization was stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction and depression severity.

Patients in the sertraline group received a mean dosage of 69 mg/d. Pill counts assessed compliance. Measures of HRV are stable in both medically healthy, depressed patients and depressed patients with stable heart disease. Patients treated with sertraline in SADHART experienced a 9% increase in ultra low–frequency power, far less than previously observed in large, unselected post–myocardial infarction samples. 25, 37 Statistical significance occurred because ultra low–frequency power decreased 10% in MDD patients given placebo. Although McFarlane et al29 did not emphasize it, placebo cases also decreased 9% from their baseline values.

### Β eta blocker interruption after uncomplicated myocardial infarction: rationale and design of the randomized ABYSS trial [^112gjUfB]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term use of β-blocker after myocardial infarction (MI) when global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is preserved has not been studied in the era of modern myocardial reperfusion and secondary prevention therapies. It is unknown whether β-blockers are useful in stable post-MI patients without reduced LVEF and without heart failure.

Methods

The Assessment of β-blocker interruption 1 Year after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization (ABYSS) Trial enrolled in 49 centers in France, 3,700 patients with a prior (> 6 months) history of MI and a LVEF > 40%, chronically treated with a β-blocker and without any major cardiovascular event (MACE) in the past 6 months. These patients were randomized to interruption or continuation of their β-blocker therapy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the noninferiority of interruption vs continuation of the β-blocker therapy on the primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, MI, hospitalization for any cardiovascular reason at the end of follow-up (accrual follow-up) with a one-year minimum follow-up for the last randomized patient. Secondary objectives will focus on patient reported outcomes with the evaluation of the quality of life before and after randomization with the EQ5D-5L questionnaire. Enrolment has been completed.

Conclusion

The ABYSS trial evaluates the cardiovascular safety of β-blocker interruption in stabilized post-MI patients without heart failure nor reduced LVEF. ABYSS trial is a reappraisal of β-blockers life-long therapy in stable post-MI patients without reduced LVEF.

### Treatment of depression in cardiovascular disease [^1139C5Uo]. Depression and Anxiety (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Depression in patients with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is extremely common, with a prevalence of 17–47%, and is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Treatment of depression has been hypothesized to reduce cardiac mortality. Pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions have been studied and appear to be safe and in some studies effective in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with cardiac disease. The impact on cardiac outcomes remains unclear. This review briefly focuses on the prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, the physiological links between depression and CVD, and largely is concerned with the clinical trials that seek to demonstrate efficacy and safety of antidepressant medications and psychotherapy in this patient population.

Methods

PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched through July 2012. Publications were included if they were in English, a review article, or a clinical trial in the CVD population with comorbid depression. The search was completed with key words of antidepressants, CVD, coronary artery syndrome, SSRIs, depression, treatment of depression, post-MI (where MI is myocardial infarction), major depression, and cardiac disease. Trials were included if the patients were above the age of 18, both male and female genders, and had cardiac comorbidity. No trials were excluded.

Results

A total of 61 articles and/or book chapters were included. The majority were from North America and Europe. There were 7 clinical trials of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), one of TCAs and bupropion, and 10 trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We also evaluated five trials involving psychotherapeutic techniques and/or collaborative care.

Conclusions

There is considerable evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials that antidepressants, especially SSRIs, are safe in the treatment of major depression in patients with CVD. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in some, but not all, trials for both antidepressants and certain psychotherapies, large, well-powered trials are urgently needed. There are virtually no data available on predictors of antidepressant response in depressed patients with CVD. Whether successful treatment of depression is associated with a reduction in cardiac morbidity and mortality remains unknown.

### Long-term cardiac outcomes of depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome: the DEPACS study [^1141ozwt]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this median 8.4-year follow-up of patients with recent ACS, screening positive for depression on the BDI was associated with worse long-term cardiac outcomes, even in the cases who did not fulfil diagnostic criteria for depressive disorder. Of patients in this screen-positive group, those randomised to 24 weeks of escitalopram treatment experienced better cardiac outcomes than those randomised to placebo and those with the diagnosed depressive disorder who were not randomised and received MTO instead. This latter MTO group had worse outcomes than those receiving placebo, despite having significantly milder depressive symptoms at baseline.

In this study, worse long-term cardiac outcomes in the screen-positive group were largely consistent with previous reports using depressive symptom scales for categorising depression (Lesperance, Frasure-Smith, Talajic, & Bourassa). A meta-analysis of 26 studies of various heart diseases, cardiac outcomes and follow-up duration, using depressive symptom scales estimated the hazards ratio associated with depressive symptoms to be 1.92 (Nicholson et al.). The equivalent hazards ratio in the cohort described here was 2.15, and thus higher than the meta-analysed pooled result. The cohort in our study was a homogeneous diagnostic group with comprehensive cardiac outcomes and longer follow-up, all of which are recommended in cardiac outcome studies (Galløe et al.).

Acute myocardial infarction — early post-MI ICD implantation trials show no mortality reduction. In the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT), 674 patients randomized between 6 to 40 days after MI with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 0.35 and impaired cardiac autonomic function had no mortality benefit at a mean 30 months (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.76–1.55; P = 0.66). In the Immediate Risk-Stratification Improves Survival (IRIS) trial, 998 patients randomized 5 to 31 days after MI, enrolled for either an LVEF ≤ 0.40 with an initial sinus rate > 90 bpm or NSVT (> 3 beats at a rate > 150 bpm), were not associated with a significant reduction in mortality at a mean 37 months (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.81–1.35; P = 0.78).

symptomatic heart failure. [See Boxed Warning.]

Patients experiencing acute coronary syndromes have not been studied in
controlled clinical trials. In view of the potential for development of heart
failure in patients having an acute coronary event, initiation of AVANDIA is not
recommended for patients experiencing an acute coronary event, and
discontinuation of AVANDIA during this acute phase should be considered.

Patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status (with or without CHF) have
not been studied in controlled clinical trials. AVANDIA is not recommended in
patients with NYHA Class III and IV cardiac status.

Myocardial
Ischemia

Meta-Analysis of Myocardial Ischemia in a
Group of 42 Clinical Trials

A meta-analysis was conducted retrospectively to assess cardiovascular
adverse events reported across 42 double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical
trials (mean duration 6 months).1These studies had been
conducted to assess glucose-lowering efficacy in type 2 diabetes, and
prospectively planned adjudication of cardiovascular events had not occurred in
the trials. Some trials were placebo-controlled and some used active oral
antidiabetic drugs as controls. Placebo-controlled studies included monotherapy
trials (monotherapy with AVANDIA versus placebo monotherapy) and add-on trials
(AVANDIA or placebo, added to sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin). Active
control studies included monotherapy trials (monotherapy with AVANDIA versus
sulfonylurea or metformin monotherapy) and add-on trials (AVANDIA plus
sulfonylurea or AVANDIA plus metformin, versus sulfonylurea plus metformin). A
total of 14,237 patients were included (8,604 in treatment groups containing
AVANDIA, 5,633 in comparator groups), with 4,143 patient-years of exposure to
AVANDIA and 2,675 patient-years of exposure to comparator. Myocardial ischemic
events included angina pectoris, angina pectoris aggravated, unstable angina,
cardiac arrest, chest pain, coronary artery occlusion, dyspnea, myocardial
infarction, coronary thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, coronary artery disease.
and coronary artery disorder. In this analysis, an increased risk of myocardial
ischemia with AVANDIA versus pooled comparators was observed (2% AVANDIA versus

1.5% comparators, odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 1.8). An
increased risk of myocardial ischemic events with AVANDIA was observed in the
placebo-controlled studies, but not in the active-controlled studies. (See

### Antidepressant use and risk of cardiovascular outcomes in people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database [^115Z2XDV]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication in 2011, stating that citalopram should not be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day, based on findings of QT interval prolongation in a study of 119 participants who received different doses of citalopram. The European Medicines Agency issued a similar safety warning in 2011. Further studies have reported QT interval prolongation with citalopram and also with some other antidepressants such as escitalopram and amitriptyline.QT interval prolongation can lead to arrhythmias including potentially fatal torsades de pointes, but few studies have specifically assessed risk of arrhythmia for different antidepressant drugs. A cohort study in predominantly older men of two different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants found significantly lower risks of arrhythmia for doses of citalopram over 40 mg/day compared with doses of 1–20 mg/day, with similar findings for sertraline. A cohort study based on claims data in the United States found no significant differences in risk of ventricular arrhythmia/sudden death for 20 types of antidepressant drug compared with paroxetine, except for a higher risk in mirtazapine users.

Few observational studies of cardiovascular effects have examined associations with individual drugs, so evidence for specific commonly prescribed antidepressants is lacking, especially in younger people, as is evidence in relation to duration and dose. We therefore carried out a cohort study in people aged 20 to 64 to investigate the associations between different antidepressant drugs and the risk of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and stroke/transient ischaemic attack and also examined both dose and duration of use.

### The tiotropium safety and performance in respimat trial (TIOSPIR), a large scale, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial-design and rationale [^113DtJGv]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the organizational and logistic challenges of such a large trial, accrual of participants was faster than expected. This reflected the broad inclusion criteria that were designed to enroll patients who might be encountered in routine clinical practice. Patients with a medical history including MI, cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiac failure were generally included and only excluded if MI occurred within 6 months or less, if cardiac arrhythmia was unstable or life threatening, requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy during the past year, or if cardiac failure of New York Heart Association Class III or IV led to hospitalization during the past year. Moreover, all participants were assigned to an active treatment arm and were permitted to continue other background medications that did not interfere with study participation, and could participate in their usual care routine. One of the challenges in training the large number of investigators, many of whom were community practitioners, was to emphasize the statistical underpinnings of the trial, and the need for high levels of follow up whether or not patients remained on study drug. The study organization and oversight is similar to that used in other large multicenter trials and is designed to provide continuing monitoring and review of the data integrity and patient safety at several levels. This includes an SSC, a DMC, and a MAC that represent the international scope of the trial.

### Statins for acute coronary syndrome [^113GV8UK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The early period following the onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a critical stage of coronary heart disease, with a high risk of recurrent events and deaths. The short-term effects of early treatment with statins on patient-relevant outcomes in patients suffering from ACS are unclear. This is an update of a review previously published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of early administered statins in patients with ACS, in terms of mortality and cardiovascular events.

Search Methods

We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to April Week 1 2013), EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2013 Week 14), and CINAHL (EBSCO) (1938 to 2013) on 12 April 2013. We applied no language restrictions. We supplemented the search by contacting experts in the field, by reviewing the reference lists of reviews and editorials on the topic, and by searching trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statins with placebo or usual care, with initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following the onset of ACS, follow-up of at least 30 days, and reporting at least one clinical outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for all outcomes in the treatment and control groups and pooled data using random-effects models.

Main Results

Eighteen studies (14,303 patients) compared early statin treatment versus placebo or no treatment in patients with ACS. The new search did not identify any new studies for inclusion. There were some concerns about risk of bias and imprecision of summary estimates. Based on moderate quality evidence, early statin therapy did not decrease the combined primary outcome of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke at one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08) or four months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06) of follow-up when compared to placebo or no treatment. There were no statistically significant risk reductions from statins for total death, total myocardial infarction, total stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization procedures, and acute heart failure at one month or at four months, although there were favorable trends related to statin use for each of these endpoints. Moderate quality evidence suggests that the incidence of unstable angina was significantly reduced at four months following ACS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96). There were nine individuals with myopathy (elevated creatinine kinase levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal) in statin-treated patients (0.13%) versus one (0.015%) in the control groups. Serious muscle toxicity was mostly limited to patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate quality evidence, due to concerns about risk of bias and imprecision, initiation of statin therapy within 14 days following ACS does not reduce death, myocardial infarction, or stroke up to four months, but reduces the occurrence of unstable angina at four months following ACS. Serious side effects were rare.

### Prophylactic lidocaine for myocardial infarction [^111N4sBA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery disease is a major public health problem affecting both developed and developing countries. Acute coronary syndromes include unstable angina and myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation (electrocardiogram sector is higher than baseline). Ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction is associated with high risk of mortality. The evidence is out of date, and considerable uncertainty remains about the effects of prophylactic use of lidocaine on all-cause mortality, in particular, in patients with suspected myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic lidocaine in preventing death among people with myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 13 April 2015), EMBASE (1947 to 13 April 2015) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1986 to 13 April 2015). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 13 April 2013) and handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of prophylactic lidocaine for myocardial infarction. We considered all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and overall survival at 30 days after myocardial infarction as primary outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and measured statistical heterogeneity using I(2). We used a random-effects model and conducted trial sequential analysis.

Main Results

We identified 37 randomised controlled trials involving 11,948 participants. These trials compared lidocaine versus placebo or no intervention, disopyramide, mexiletine, tocainide, propafenone, amiodarone, dimethylammonium chloride, aprindine and pirmenol. Overall, trials were underpowered and had high risk of bias. Ninety-seven per cent of trials (36/37) were conducted without an a priori sample size estimation. Ten trials were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Trials were conducted in 17 countries, and intravenous intervention was the most frequent route of administration. In trials involving participants with proven or non-proven acute myocardial infarction, lidocaine versus placebo or no intervention showed no significant differences regarding all-cause mortality (213/5879 (3.62%) vs 199/5848 (3.40%); RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.27; participants = 11727; studies = 18; I² = 15%); low-quality evidence), cardiac mortality (69/4184 (1.65%) vs 62/4093 (1.51%); RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.50; participants = 8277; studies = 12; I² = 12%; low-quality evidence) and prophylaxis of ventricular fibrillation (76/5128 (1.48%) vs 103/4987 (2.01%); RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; participants = 10115; studies = 16; I² = 18%; low-quality evidence). In terms of sinus bradycardia, lidocaine effect is imprecise compared with effects of placebo or no intervention (55/1346 (4.08%) vs 49/1203 (4.07%); RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.80; participants = 2549; studies = 8; I² = 21%; very low-quality evidence). In trials involving only participants with proven acute myocardial infarction, lidocaine versus placebo or no intervention showed no significant differences in all-cause mortality (148/2747 (5.39%) vs 135/2506 (5.39%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.30; participants = 5253; studies = 16; I² = 9%; low-quality evidence). No significant differences were noted between lidocaine and any other antiarrhythmic drug in terms of all-cause mortality and ventricular fibrillation. Data on overall survival 30 days after myocardial infarction were not reported. Lidocaine compared with placebo or no intervention increased risk of asystole (35/3393 (1.03%) vs 14/3443 (0.41%); RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.26; participants = 6826; studies = 4; I(2) = 0%; very low-quality evidence) and dizziness/drowsiness (74/1259 (5.88%) vs 16/1274 (1.26%); RR 3.85, 95% CI 2.29 to 6.47; participants = 2533; studies = 6; I(2) = 0%; low-quality evidence). Overall, safety data were poorly reported and adverse events may have been underestimated. Trial sequential analyses suggest that additional trials may not be needed for reliable conclusions to be drawn regarding these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane review found evidence of low quality to suggest that prophylactic lidocaine has very little or no effect on mortality or ventricular fibrillation in people with acute myocardial infarction. The safety profile is unclear. This conclusion is based on randomised controlled trials with high risk of bias. However (disregarding the risk of bias), trial sequential analysis suggests that additional trials may not be needed to disprove an intervention effect of 20% relative risk reduction. Smaller risk reductions might require additional higher trials.

### Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes [^1143zpfb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

The study PROVE IT-TIMI 22 was published by Cannon CP and colleagues in 2004 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Unstable angina. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the trial question was: what is the role of intensive therapy in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days? In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the population was: 4162 patients (911 female, 3251 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days. The key exclusion criteria were current statin therapy at a dose of 80 mg/day, or current lipid lowering therapy with fibric acid derivatives or niacin, obstructive hepatobiliary disease or other serious hepatic disease. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the interventions were: n = 2099 intensive statin therapy (80 mg of atorvastatin daily) n = 2063 standard statin therapy (40 mg of pravastatin daily). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or major cardiovascular events at 2 years (22.4% vs. 26.3%; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.26). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 2 years (19.7% vs. 22.3%; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27) Borderline significant decrease in death from any cause (2.2% vs. 3.2%; RR 0.28, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.58). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events (22.8% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.30). significant differences in liver enzyme elevation (3.3% vs. 1.1%, p < 0.001). In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study, the conclusion was: in patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days, intensive statin therapy was superior to standard statin therapy with respect to death or major cardiovascular events at 2 years.

### Ranolazine for stable angina pectoris [^116SvUwE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Stable angina pectoris is a chronic medical condition with significant impact on mortality and quality of life; it can be macrovascular or microvascular in origin. Ranolazine is a second-line anti-anginal drug approved for use in people with stable angina. However, the effects of ranolazine for people with angina are considered to be modest, with uncertain clinical relevance.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ranolazine on cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, quality of life, acute myocardial infarction incidence, angina episodes frequency and adverse events incidence in stable angina patients, used either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy, and compared to placebo or any other anti-anginal agent.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science in February 2016, as well as regional databases and trials registers. We also screened reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which directly compared the effects of ranolazine versus placebo or other anti-anginals in people with stable angina pectoris were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Estimates of treatment effects were calculated using risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Where we found statistically significant heterogeneity (Chi² P < 0.10), we used a random-effects model for pooling estimates. Meta-analysis was not performed where we found considerable heterogeneity (I² ≥ 75%). We used GRADE criteria to assess evidence quality and the GRADE profiler (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 to create 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs (9975 participants, mean age 63.3 years). We found very limited (or no) data to inform most planned comparisons. Summary data were used to inform comparison of ranolazine versus placebo. Overall, risk of bias was assessed as unclear. For add-on ranolazine compared to placebo, no data were available to estimate cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. We found uncertainty about the effect of ranolazine on: all-cause mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.71; 3 studies, 2053 participants; low quality evidence); quality of life (any dose, SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.52; 4 studies, 1563 participants; I² = 73%; moderate quality evidence); and incidence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (1000mg twice daily, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1509 participants; low quality evidence). Add-on ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily reduced the fervour of angina episodes (MD -0.66, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.35; 3 studies, 2004 participants; I² = 39%; moderate quality evidence) but increased the risk of non-serious adverse events (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40; 3 studies, 2053 participants; moderate quality evidence). For ranolazine as monotherapy compared to placebo, we found uncertain effect on cardiovascular mortality (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.88; 1 study, 2604 participants; low quality evidence). No data were available to estimate non-cardiovascular mortality. We also found an uncertain effect on all-cause mortality for ranolazine (1000 mg twice daily, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25; 3 studies, 6249 participants; low quality evidence), quality of life (1000 mg twice daily, MD 0.28, 95% CI -1.57 to 2.13; 3 studies, 2254 participants; moderate quality evidence), non-fatal AMI incidence (any dose, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 3 studies, 2983 participants; I² = 50%; low quality evidence), and frequency of angina episodes (any dose, MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.85 to 1.01; 2 studies, 402 participants; low quality evidence). We found an increased risk for non-serious adverse events associated with ranolazine (any dose, RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.00; 3 studies, 947 participants; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low quality evidence showing that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as monotherapy had increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo. We found low quality evidence indicating that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (for ranolazine given as monotherapy), all-cause death and non-fatal AMI, and the frequency of angina episodes (for ranolazine given as monotherapy) compared to those given placebo. Moderate quality evidence indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine showed uncertain effect on quality of life compared with people who received placebo. Moderate quality evidence also indicated that people with stable angina who received ranolazine as add-on therapy had fewer angina episodes but increased risk of presenting non-serious adverse events compared to those given placebo.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist pretreatment to MINIMISE reperfusion injury after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (the MINIMISE STEMI trial): rationale and study design [^116Ca3tm]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The MINIMISE‐STEMI trial is designed to investigate whether MRA therapy using spironolactone initiated prior to reperfusion and continued for 3 months can reduce MI size and prevent adverse LV remodeling at 3 months in STEMI patients treated by PPCI, when compared with placebo control. The Eplerenone Post‐AMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival (EPHESUS) study demonstrated a 15% relative risk reduction in death at 16 months in AMI patients with LVEF < 40% and HF signs administered oral eplerenone therapy (initiated 3–14 days post‐MI) when compared with matching placebo. 19 The beneficial effects of oral MRA therapy have been confirmed in subsequent clinical trials. 20, 21, 39 The American 27 and European 29 guidelines now recommend eplerenone for all patients presenting with an AMI, LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 40%), and HF symptoms or DM. Therefore, it is anticipated that about 10% of the trial participants will meet these criteria and will go on open‐label MRA therapy, and this has been taken into account in the sample‐size calculation.

### Ramipril [^1149iBwy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

Ramipril was studied in the AIRE trial. This was a multinational (mainly European) 161-center, 2006-patient, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing ramipril to placebo in stable patients, 2 to 9 days after an acute myocardial infarction, who had shown clinical signs of congestive heart failure at any time after the myocardial infarction. Patients in severe (NYHA class IV) heart failure, patients with unstable angina, patients with heart failure of congenital or valvular etiology, and patients with contraindications to ACE inhibitors were all excluded. The majority of patients had received thrombolytic therapy at the time of the index infarction, and the average time between infarction and initiation of treatment was 5 days.

Patients randomized to ramipril treatment were given an initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If the initial regimen caused undue hypotension, the dose was reduced to 1.25 mg, but in either event doses were titrated upward (as tolerated) to a target regimen (achieved in 77% of patients randomized to ramipril) of 5 mg twice daily. Patients were then followed for an average of 15 months, with the range of follow-up between 6 and 46 months.

The use of ramipril was associated with a 27% reduction (p = 0.002) in the risk of death from any cause; about 90% of the deaths that occurred were cardiovascular, mainly sudden death. The risks of progression to severe heart failure and of congestive heart failure-related hospitalization were also reduced, by 23% (p = 0.017) and 26% (p = 0.011), respectively. The benefits of ramipril therapy were seen in both genders, and they were not affected by the exact timing of the initiation of therapy, but older patients may have had a greater benefit than those under 65. The benefits were seen in patients on (and not on) various concomitant medications. At the time of randomization these included aspirin (about 80% of patients), diuretics (about 60%), organic nitrates (about 55%), beta-blockers (about 20%), calcium channel blockers (about 15%), and digoxin (about 12%).

### Effects of coping skills training and sertraline in patients with non-cardiac chest pain: a randomized controlled study [^115QRd8U]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a common and distressing condition. Prior studies suggest that psychotropic medication or pain coping skills training (CST) may benefit NCCP patients. To our knowledge, no clinical trials have examined the separate and combined effects of CST and psychotropic medication in the management of NCCP. This randomized clinical trial examined the separate and combined effects of CST and antidepressant medication (sertraline) in participants with non-cardiac chest pain. A sample of individuals diagnosed with NCCP was randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) CST plus sertraline (CST+sertraline), (2) CST plus placebo (CST+placebo), (3) sertraline alone, or (4) placebo alone. Assessments of pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, depression, and physical disability were collected prior to treatment, and at 10- and 34-weeks following randomization. Data analyses revealed that CST and sertraline either alone or in combination significantly reduced pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. The combination of CST plus sertraline may have the greatest promise in that, when compared to placebo alone, it not only significantly reduced pain but also pain catastrophizing and anxiety. Overall, these findings support the importance of further research on the effects of CST and sertraline for non-cardiac chest pain.

### An ischemia-guided approach for risk stratification in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^1159EoEz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

The optimal management approach for patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes continues to be an issue of debate. An ischemia-guided strategy appears to be effective as an alternative to either a very conservative "wait-and-see" approach or a very aggressive routine revascularization approach. The need for another approach is supported by the lack of conclusive evidence-based results favoring an early routine invasive treatment strategy. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIIB trial, there were no differences in the incidence of death or myocardial infarction (MI) between patients treated with an early invasive approach and those treated with a conservative approach to treatment. Significantly worse outcomes were shown in patients assigned to an early invasive strategy in the Veterans Affairs Non-Q-Wave Infarction Strategies in Hospital (VANQWISH) trial at 1-year follow-up (111 clinical events in the invasive group vs 85 in the conservative group; p = 0.05). Registry information, including that from the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes (OASIS), which included approximately 8,000 patients with unstable angina or suspected MI, has even suggested an excess hazard with a routine invasive approach. Patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI observed in the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes (GUSTO)-IIB and Platelet IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trials also fared better with an ischemia-guided strategy. Even the recent FRagmin and Fast Revascularization during InStability in Coronary artery disease (FRISC II) trial investigators had to be very selective relative to eliminating high-risk patients in the first week and treating with intense anti-ischemic therapy and 5–7 days of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy to show an advantage for assigned revascularization. A careful clinical evaluation with attention to early risk stratification is essential in the ischemia-guided approach. The Braunwald classification for unstable angina helps identify independent clinical predictors of a poor outcome; high risk is clearly associated with Braunwald class III and type C. Electrocardiographic and biochemical markers for myocardial necrosis (cardiac troponin T or I) are important tools for assessing the presence and degree of ischemia and associated risk for adverse outcome. Noninvasive evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction is essential for identifying those at high risk due to impaired contractile function. When these conventional markers do not provide conclusive information, noninvasive stress testing is most helpful to further identify those at highest risk for revascularization.

### Cardiac safety of tiotropium in patients with cardiac events: a retrospective analysis of the UPLIFT® trial [^115ZoL8L]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The UPLIFT® study confirmed the CV safety of tiotropium over 4 years for the population included. The extensive, long-term patient data generated from the UPLIFT® study have allowed us to investigate retrospectively the potential impact of tiotropium versus placebo on the safety of patients experiencing the types of cardiac events during the study that would have led to exclusion at baseline. The analysis of SAEs or FAEs, including cardiac deaths and death for unknown reasons, in patients after experiencing cardiac arrhythmia, MI or cardiac failure during the conduct of UPLIFT® does not indicate any increase in total or cardiac SAEs or mortality with tiotropium HandiHaler® treatment compared with placebo.

The findings should ameliorate the concerns raised by Walker and colleagues regarding the generalisability of the results of the UPLIFT® trial, based on their analysis of a hospitalised population of patients with COPD in New Zealand. Although patients with unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute MI or severe heart failure requiring hospitalisation were excluded from UPLIFT® (in line with most long-term COPD trials designed to evaluate chronic benefit to risk of pharmacotherapy), but they were not required to withdraw from the study if such an event occurred. The majority of these patients remained in the trial, even though approximately 60% had an SAE and 20% had a cardiac SAE, with similar incidences in the tiotropium and placebo arms. Through the analysis of outcomes in these patients, we are able to show that tiotropium does not increase the risk of total or cardiac SAEs or mortality compared with placebo in patients who have previously experienced serious cardiac events.

Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

The TRIP-PCI trial was a prospective, multicenter randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, intravenous infusion of PZ-128 at 2 dose levels (0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg) in adults with CAD/ACS undergoing nonemergent cardiac catheterization ± PCI. The TRIP-PCI trial was conducted at 3 clinical sites in the United States.

Institutional review board approval was obtained before study initiation at each clinical site. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization E6 guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable US Food and Drug Administration regulations. All of the study patients provided written informed consent, including US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996) authorization, before participation in the study.

Participant Eligibility

Eligible patients included men and women (18 years or older) with stable CAD (stable angina), no angina with abnormal stress test/imaging (other), unstable angina (negative or unknown cardiac biomarker status), or non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI; positive cardiac biomarker) according to the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Associationwho were scheduled to undergo nonemergent coronary angiography with the intention to perform PCI if clinically indicated. Patients with any history of stroke or transient ischemic attack were excluded. A comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the.

### Death and myocardial infarction following initial revascularization versus optimal medical therapy in chronic coronary syndromes with myocardial ischemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of contemporary randomized controlled trials [^116W1Ndu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Ischemic heart disease, which includes the acute coronary syndromes and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), is the leading cause of death and years of lost life in adults worldwide. 1, 2 Annually, ≈1 in 30 patients with CCS, also referred to as stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or stable ischemic heart disease, will experience cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (MI), 3 generally caused by the transition to an acute coronary syndrome, in particular ST‐segment–elevation MI. 4 A primary goal of treatment of CCS is to prevent death and MI.

Ischemia in CCS may occur in the presence or absence of obstructive CAD involving the epicardial coronary arteries. 5 Because of the strong association of ischemia on stress testing with an increased risk of death or MI, the presence of myocardial ischemia in patients found to have obstructive CAD, even in the absence of angina, often triggers referral for elective revascularization, 6, 7, 8, 9 with the theoretical goal of preventing MI and reducing downstream mortality. However, contemporary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of initial percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–based revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) versus OMT alone have never demonstrated a reduction in death or MI in patients assigned to PCI. One explanation for the lack of benefit from PCI in earlier trials is that not all patients in those trials had documented ischemia or its surrogate, an abnormal fractional flow reserve (FFR). In theory, the absence of a requirement for documented ischemia might have allowed enrollment of patients at too low risk to benefit from PCI. However, in a prior meta‐analysis of 5 clinical trials enrolling a total of 5286 patients with CCS and myocardial ischemia, determined by stress testing or FFR, PCI in combination with OMT did not demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality or nonfatal MI compared with OMT alone, suggesting that the association between ischemia and death or nonfatal MI is not causal. 10 However, that meta‐analysis did not include RCTs of patients with ischemia who were randomized to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in combination with OMT versus OMT alone. CABG is an important revascularization modality for which improved survival and reductions in new MI have been consistently demonstrated in CCS. 11 It also included studies in which the angiographic anatomical features were defined before enrollment, which may have resulted in patients with high‐risk anatomical features not being enrolled. The recently published ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial 12 randomized 5179 CCS patients with moderate to severe ischemia to an invasive strategy consisting of PCI, CABG, or no revascularization, as indicated, with OMT versus OMT alone after left main CAD was ruled out and obstructive epicardial disease was demonstrated on coronary computed tomography angiography. Its design addressed potential shortcomings of earlier studies in that enrollment required moderate to severe ischemia on stress testing, randomization was performed before coronary angiography, and complete revascularization was the goal with either PCI or CABG. Nevertheless, the study was underpowered to assess the impact of an invasive strategy on death or nonfatal MI. Given this important new study, we performed an updated, study‐level meta‐analysis that included the ISCHEMIA trial as well as other studies that included revascularization using PCI or CABG to determine the long‐term impact of revascularization on death and nonfatal MI in patients with CCS, obstructive CAD, exclusive of left main CAD, and myocardial ischemia.

### Protective effects of aspirin against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina. results of a veterans administration cooperative study [^115uGnk1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1983). Excellent credibility.

The study VA Cooperative Study was published by Lewis HD Jr and colleagues in 1983 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Unstable angina. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in male patients with unstable angina? In the VA Cooperative Study study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the population was: 1266 male patients. The inclusion criteria were male patients with unstable angina. The key exclusion criteria were congestive HF NYHA IV, tachyarrhythmia, anemia, contraindications to aspirin, bleeding tendency, myocardial infarction within 6 weeks, or other illness that might limit 1 year survival. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the interventions were: n = 625 aspirin (324 mg in buffered solution daily for 12 weeks) n = 641 placebo (matching placebo daily for 24 weeks). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or acute MI (5% vs. 10.1%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.76). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.4% vs. 6.9%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.83) Borderline significant decrease in death (1.6% vs. 3.3%; RR 0.48, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.97). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of blood loss. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the conclusion was: in male patients with unstable angina, aspirin was superior to placebo with respect to death or acute MI.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^116ttC4t]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Statistical analyses

When originally devised, the primary aim of the PANDA trial was to investigate the severity and duration of depressive symptoms associated with a clinically important response to sertraline, as stated in the protocol paperand on. However, towards the later stages of designing the trial and when formulating the detailed(uploaded before any analyses were done to UCL Discovery and approved by the trial steering committee), it became apparent that we would have insufficient statistical power to estimate plausible interaction effects that would allow us to investigate those aims. Therefore, our power calculationand primary analysis (as stated in the analysis plan) are based on a primary aim to examine the clinical effectiveness of sertraline versus placebo. Interactions between severity and duration at baseline and treatment allocation were planned as exploratory. Our protocol paper has described the power calculation in detail. Assuming a two-sided α of 5%, power of 90%, and 10% attrition, 547 participants were required to detect an 11% (relative) difference in scores between sertraline and placebo.

Analyses and reporting were in line with CONSORT guidelines. Primary and secondary outcomes were described in the approved protocol before the study started (appendix pp 59). The measure of self-reported improvement was added as a secondary outcome after the study started but before any analyses were done (appendix pp 25). When the study was registered on ISCRTN, the primary outcome was listed. Secondary outcomes were added later and were described and approved in the study protocol. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). We compared the proportion of patients in each group who were categorised as adherent with Pearson's χ² test. Physical symptoms that could be SSRI side-effects were compared by group with independent t -tests. Analyses of adherence and physical symptoms were done at each follow-up visit. We report serious adverse events during the trial according to treatment allocation.

### Effect of escitalopram on mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia: results of the REMIT trial [^111vaxDR]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Mental stress can induce myocardial ischemia and also has been implicated in triggering cardiac events. However, pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) have not been well studied.

Objective

To examine the effects of 6 weeks of escitalopram treatment vs placebo on MSIMI and other psychological stress-related biophysiological and emotional parameters.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The REMIT (Responses of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia to Escitalopram Treatment) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with clinically stable coronary heart disease and laboratory-diagnosed MSIMI. Enrollment occurred from July 24, 2007, through August 24, 2011, at a tertiary medical center.

Interventions

Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive escitalopram (dose began at 5 mg/d, with titration to 20 mg/d in 3 weeks) or placebo over 6 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Occurrence of MSIMI, defined as development or worsening of regional wall motion abnormality; left ventricular ejection fraction reduction of 8% or more; and/or horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in 2 or more leads, lasting for 3 or more consecutive beats, during 1 or more of 3 mental stressor tasks.

Results

Of 127 participants randomized to receive escitalopram (n = 64) or placebo (n = 63), 112 (88.2%) completed end point assessments (n = 56 in each group). At the end of 6 weeks, more patients taking escitalopram (34.2% [95% CI, 25.4%-43.0%]) had absence of MSIMI during the 3 mental stressor tasks compared with patients taking placebo (17.5% [95% CI, 10.4%-24.5%]), based on the unadjusted multiple imputation model for intention-to-treat analysis. A significant difference favoring escitalopram was observed (odds ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.06–6.44]). Rates of exercise-induced ischemia were slightly lower at 6 weeks in the escitalopram group (45.8% [95% CI, 36.6%-55.0%]) than in patients receiving placebo (52.5% [95% CI, 43.3%-61.8%]), but this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio; 1.24 [95% CI, 0.60–2.58]; P = 0.56).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with stable coronary heart disease and baseline MSIMI, 6 weeks of escitalopram, compared with placebo, resulted in a lower rate of MSIMI. There was no statistically significant difference in exercise-induced ischemia. Replication of these results in multicenter settings and investigations of other medications for reducing MSIMI are needed.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 and sertraline in depressed patients with or at risk for coronary heart disease [^111hL4jq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies of depressed psychiatric patients have suggested that antidepressant efficacy can be increased by adding eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), one of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oils. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of EPA improves the response to sertraline in depressed patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

Between May 2014 and June 2018, 144 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder seen at the Washington University School of Medicine with or at high risk for CHD were randomized to receive either 50 mg/d of sertraline and 2 g/d of EPA or 50 mg/d of sertraline and corn oil placebo capsules for 10 weeks. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was the primary outcome measure.

Results

After 10 weeks of treatment, there were no differences between the arms on the mean baseline-adjusted BDI-II (placebo, 10.3; EPA, 12.1; P = 0.22), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (placebo, 7.2; EPA, 8.0; P = 0.40), or the 10-week remission rate (BDI-II score ≤ 8: placebo, 50.6%; EPA, 46.7%; odds ratio = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.68; P = 0.63).

Conclusions

Augmentation of sertraline with 2 g/d of EPA for 10 weeks did not result in greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared to sertraline and corn oil placebo in patients with major depressive disorder and CHD or CHD risk factors. Identifying the characteristics of cardiac patients whose depression may benefit from omega-3 and clarifying the pathways linking omega-3 to improvement in depression symptoms are important directions for future research.
