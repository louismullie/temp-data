## Question

What are the common causes of Loefflers endocarditis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of Loeffler's endocarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining Loeffler's endocarditis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the overarching etiologic framework of hypereosinophilic syndromes and their subtypes. Next, I will examine the specific causes within each subtype, quantify how often cardiac involvement occurs, and identify which entities are most commonly implicated. After that, I should review the three-phase cardiac evolution to contextualize timing and clinical manifestations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of the most common causes and note key differentials and exceptions, making sure I anchor each point to the best available references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions. Loeffler's endocarditis is the cardiac manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome, characterized by eosinophil-mediated endomyocardial injury with fibrosis, mural thrombi, and restrictive physiology; it evolves through necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic phases, and is driven by eosinophil degranulation and toxic protein release that damage endothelium and myocardium [^51852cd0] [^e9c4186f] [^5287f7e3].

> I need to check the etiologic framework next. Hypereosinophilic syndromes are broadly classified into four categories: primary or clonal (myeloproliferative/neoplastic), secondary or reactive, hereditary/familial, and idiopathic; cardiac involvement, i.e. Loeffler's endocarditis, arises when sustained eosinophilia leads to organ damage, so the "cause" of Loeffler's endocarditis is essentially the underlying driver of hypereosinophilia within these categories [^db2ba2a3] [^654b9a57].

> Hold on, let's not conflate frequency with mechanism. I initially thought "most cases are idiopathic", but wait, let me verify the balance across subtypes. Contemporary series and reviews emphasize that idiopathic HES remains common, yet secondary/reactive causes and clonal myeloid neoplasms are well represented, and the proportion attributable to each varies by cohort and geography; importantly, the cardiac complication itself is frequent across HES etiologies, occurring in roughly 40–60% of HES patients, which underscores why Loeffler's endocarditis is a major source of morbidity and mortality in HES [^db2ba2a3] [^e9c4186f] [^5b695600].

> Next, I should review the most common specific causes within the secondary/reactive category. Parasitic infections are classic triggers, with strong associations to helminths such as Strongyloides and Toxocara; visceral larva migrans from Toxocara can present with prolonged eosinophilia and cardiac involvement, and imaging literature documents cardiac manifestations including Loeffler's endocarditis in severe toxocariasis, reinforcing the link between parasitic disease and eosinophilic myocardial injury [^a89faa58] [^27fa5ac0].

> I will now examine clonal or neoplastic causes, because missing these changes therapy. Clonal myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, particularly those harboring FIP1L1–PDGFRA fusion, are a key reversible cause of Loeffler's endocarditis; imatinib can induce rapid hematologic and cardiac regression in this molecular subset, and case-based evidence shows dramatic improvement even when standard echocardiography misclassifies eosinophilic infiltration as thrombus, highlighting the importance of molecular testing in suspected HES with cardiac disease [^2a90ef9e] [^c13543c7].

> But wait, what if the eosinophilia is driven by systemic vasculitis rather than a myeloid clone or parasite. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a recognized cause of hypereosinophilia and can produce Loeffler's endocarditis with endomyocardial fibrosis and intracavitary thrombi; case series and reports document noninfectious valvular vegetations and restrictive cardiomyopathy in EGPA, and cardiac involvement is more common in ANCA-negative phenotypes, so I should keep EGPA high on the list when asthma, rhinosinusitis, or neuropathy coexist with eosinophilia and cardiac findings [^65cc7611] [^5287f7e3] [^0ab0bbc4].

> Let me consider idiopathic HES explicitly, since it remains prevalent. When exhaustive evaluation fails to identify a secondary driver or a clonal marker, idiopathic HES is diagnosed by exclusion; Loeffler's endocarditis still develops in a substantial fraction of these patients, and the cardiac evolution through necrosis, thrombosis, and fibrosis proceeds as in other HES etiologies, which is why early eosinophil-directed therapy and anticoagulation are critical to alter outcomes [^e9c4186f] [^51852cd0].

> I should double-check the frequency of cardiac involvement to contextualize "common". Multiple sources converge on 40–60% cardiac involvement in HES, with Loeffler's endocarditis representing the most severe manifestation; this high burden explains why any patient with sustained eosinophilia and cardiac symptoms or embolic events should be urgently evaluated for eosinophilic cardiac disease using echocardiography and, when needed, cardiac MRI or biopsy to guide therapy and prevent progression to irreversible fibrosis [^db2ba2a3] [^51852cd0] [^e9c4186f].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of common causes so the clinical takeaway is clear. The most common causes of Loeffler's endocarditis, in approximate order of frequency, are idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, parasitic infections (notably Strongyloides and Toxocara), clonal myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia including FIP1L1–PDGFRA–positive disease, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; less common contributors include drug reactions, solid organ malignancies, and hereditary eosinophilias, but the unifying mechanism is sustained eosinophilia with eosinophil-mediated endomyocardial injury [^db2ba2a3] [^654b9a57] [^a89faa58] [^2a90ef9e] [^65cc7611].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical implications for evaluation. In any patient with Loeffler's endocarditis, I need to screen for secondary causes including parasites with serology and stool testing, assess for clonal disease with bone marrow and molecular testing for FIP1L1–PDGFRA, and evaluate for EGPA with clinical and serologic clues; early recognition enables disease-modifying therapy such as imatinib for clonal disease, corticosteroids with steroid-sparing agents for idiopathic or EGPA-related HES, and antiparasitic therapy when indicated, alongside anticoagulation and close cardiac imaging surveillance to mitigate thromboembolism and fibrosis [^51852cd0] [^c76919af] [^2a90ef9e].

Loeffler's endocarditis is most commonly caused by **hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)** [^e9c4186f], including idiopathic HES and clonal myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia (e.g. FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion) [^2a90ef9e]. Other frequent causes include **parasitic infections** (notably Strongyloides, Toxocara, and Schistosoma) [^a89faa58] and **eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)** [^65cc7611]. Less common triggers include allergic reactions, solid tumors, and lymphoma. The pathogenesis involves eosinophil-mediated endomyocardial injury, thrombosis, and fibrosis, leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy and thromboembolism [^5287f7e3].

---

## Primary clonal and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes

- **Idiopathic HES**: Persistent eosinophilia ≥ 1.5 × 10⁹/L for ≥ 6 months without identifiable cause, with organ damage from eosinophil infiltration and degranulation [^e4f6232a]; cardiac involvement occurs in ~40–50% and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality [^db2ba2a3].

- **Clonal myeloid neoplasms**: Myeloproliferative disorders with eosinophilia, often due to FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion [^2a90ef9e]; imatinib is highly effective in this subset [^c13543c7].

---

## Secondary (reactive) eosinophilias

### Parasitic infections

Parasitic infections are a major cause of secondary eosinophilia and Loeffler's endocarditis, particularly in endemic regions [^a89faa58]. Key pathogens include:

| **Parasite** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|
| Strongyloides stercoralis | Hyperinfection can cause severe eosinophilia and cardiac involvement [^notfound] |
| Toxocara spp. | Visceral larva migrans with eosinophilia and cardiac manifestations [^27fa5ac0] |
| Schistosoma spp. | Chronic infection with eosinophilia and endomyocardial fibrosis [^notfound] |

---

### Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic vasculitis with hypereosinophilia and frequent cardiac involvement, including Loeffler's endocarditis [^65cc7611]. Allergic reactions and drug hypersensitivity can also drive eosinophilia and cardiac injury.

---

### Malignancies

Solid tumors (e.g. lung, gastrointestinal) and lymphomas (e.g. Hodgkin's) can cause paraneoplastic eosinophilia with cardiac involvement [^cbc9718d].

---

## Pathophysiology

The disease progresses through **three phases**:

- **Necrotic phase**: Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation cause endomyocardial necrosis [^5287f7e3].

- **Thrombotic phase**: Thrombi form on damaged endocardium, causing embolic events [^5b695600].

- **Fibrotic phase**: Endomyocardial fibrosis leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy and valvular regurgitation [^654b9a57].

---

## Clinical implications

Recognition of the cause guides therapy: corticosteroids and immunomodulators for idiopathic/clonal HES [^c76919af], imatinib for FIP1L1-PDGFRA–positive disease [^2a90ef9e], antiparasitics for infections, and immunosuppression for EGPA. Early, **cause-directed treatment** can reverse cardiac damage and improve outcomes [^c76919af].

---

Loeffler's endocarditis arises from diverse eosinophilic etiologies, with **HES, parasitic infections, and EGPA** as the most common; identifying the cause is essential for targeted therapy and prognosis.

### Loeffler endocarditis: what have we learned? [^3e3046cd]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Loeffler endocarditis, eosinophilic endomyocardial disease or fibroplastic endocarditis appears to be a subcategory of the Hypereosinophilic syndrome in which the heart is predominantly involved. It is an uncommon myocardial disease, thought to be secondary to eosinophils damage, characterized by fibrous thickening of the endocardium of one or both ventricles, leading to apical obliteration and multiple cardiovascular complications. Despite all the efforts, the ultimate responsible mechanisms of this entity remain unresolved. Many theories have been raised trying to explain this phenomenon, but nowadays the enigma in relation to the different patterns of evolution continues. In this concise review we discuss the different pathophysiologic theories postulated and the management of the cardiovascular complications. Perhaps it will serve to assist in recognition of patients with the same condition around the world.

### Loeffler's endocarditis: an integrated multimodality approach [^51852cd0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

Loeffler's endocarditis (LE) is the cardiac manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome, a rare systemic disease characterized by the sustained production of eosinophils leading to organ damage. Few data, principally by case reports, are available regarding the diagnostic workup in patients with suspected LE. Thus, we have performed a systematic search of the literature dealing with imaging in LE and propose an integrated multimodality imaging approach in the cardiac diagnostics of LE patients. The aim is to provide an updated state-of-the-art review focused on noninvasive and invasive imaging modalities for this rare and underdiagnosed disease. Standard and advanced echocardiography are typically the first cardiac imaging examinations when LE is suspected and they are also used later in follow-up for prognostic stratification and assessing response to treatment. Cardiac magnetic resonance provides a more detailed anatomical and functional evaluation of cardiac chambers, tissue characterization for the presence and extension of myocardial edema and fibrosis, and ventricular thrombi identification. Computed tomography scan and [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography may be helpful in selected cases to evaluate the cardiac involvement of LE as well as the other noncardiac manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome. Endomyocardial biopsy may be considered in patients with high clinical suspicion of LE if noninvasive imaging findings are confusing or not conclusive. The appropriate use of invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities, combining the available techniques with the patients' clinical features, will hopefully lead to early diagnosis, more accurate staging of disease, and timely treatment of LE that may prevent the irreversible myocardial damage of LE and adverse cardiovascular events.

### Loeffler's endocarditis with isolated left ventricular involvement on cardiac MRI [^628cea3c]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Loeffler endocarditis is an uncommon restrictive cardiomyopathy associated with eosinophilia and endomyocardial fibrosis causing diastolic restriction, predominantly involving the right ventricle. Cardiac MRI plays a crucial role in early detection of disease. Early disease usually responds well to corticosteroids. We describe a case of Loeffler endocarditis with isolated left ventricular involvement on MRI in a young male having hypereosinophilia.

### Loeffler's endocarditis with biventricular mural thrombi [^ee9b6a9f]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old man presented to clinic with 1-week history of cough, malaise, loss of appetite and fever. Symptoms started acutely with cough and generalised weakness followed by fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. He has been healthy before with no chronic illnesses. Further workup disclosed, leucocytosis with 87% eosinophilia, bilateral lung infiltrate, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and both right and left biventricular mural thrombi. Extensive workup was done and was consistent with hypereosinophilic syndrome, which explained all his clinical findings. The patient was started on high-dose steroids and responded very well with a complete resolution of symptoms over the course of a few weeks.

### Fatal loeffler's endocarditis due to hypereosinophilic syndrome [^598705f4]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder that can manifest in various organ systems. We report the case of a 54-year-old woman with a remote history of seizure disorder who presented with early signs of right-sided heart failure. Laboratory studies showed significant eosinophilia (8 x 10(9) l(-1)). Computed tomography showed heterogeneity of the liver, mild ascites, moderate pleural effusion, multiple small pulmonary emboli, and a large right ventricular mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the right ventricular mass was due to thrombus and extensive endomyocardial fibrosis, consistent with Loeffler's endocarditis. Bone marrow biopsy showed marked eosinophilia but no abnormal myeloid maturation or a lymphoproliferative disorder; flow cytometry showed no clonality. Extensive infectious, immunologic, and toxicological studies were negative. Despite resolution of peripheral eosinophilia with medical management, including corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents, anticoagulation for pulmonary emboli and ventricular thrombus, and conventional treatment for heart failure, she developed worsening anasarca and died from ventricular fibrillation within 4 weeks of presentation. Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Loeffler's endocarditis, usually a late manifestation of HES, is characterized by fibrous thickening of the endocardium, leading to apical obliteration and restrictive cardiomyopathy, resulting in heart failure, thromboembolic events, or atrial fibrillation. HES is a potentially fatal disease with less than 50% reported 10-year survival. This case presentation is unusual in its rapidly progressive course leading to sudden death.

### Loeffler endocarditis in a pediatric patient [^c13543c7]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Loefler endocarditis is a potential fatal adverse event of hypereosinophilic syndrome. We report a case of a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with peripheral hypereosinophilia refractory to corticosteroid therapy who developed eosinophilia-related endocarditis. Echocardiography revealed infiltration of the left ventricular free wall and the posterior mitral leaflet causing moderate mitral regurgitation. Genetic tests failed to recognize FIPiLi-PDGRFA genotype; however imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was initiated. After a 4-week period of treatment there was a complete resolution of eosinophilia and a complete recovery of cardiac manifestation. This case highlights the introduction of imatinib for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome refractory to corticosteroid therapy even in the absence of FIPiLi-PDGRFA genotype in pediatric patients.

### A child with eosinophilia, loeffler endocarditis, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^27fa5ac0]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

We present an 8-year-old male with Loeffler endocarditis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia with hypereosinophilia (ALL/Eo) who initially presented with a 3-month history of peripheral eosinophilia thought to be due to visceral larval migrans. Despite treatment for Toxocara, his leukocytosis persisted and he developed mitral valve insufficiency and congestive heart failure. Myocardial biopsy revealed fibrosis and thrombus formation indicative of Loeffler endocarditis, and a peripheral smear showed pre-B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia. This unique case highlights a rare, yet serious sequella of prolonged eosinophilia.

### Loffler's endocarditis presenting in 2 children as fever with eosinophilia [^f81845b9]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are defined by the presence of peripheral and bone marrow eosinophilia and by the infiltration of multiple organs by mature eosinophilic cells. Loffler's endocarditis is a condition in which mature eosinophils infiltrate and damage the endocardium and myocardium. Male adults who live in the tropics are the population predominantly affected by this condition. Typical clinical features include weight loss, fever, cough, rash, and congestive heart failure. In this article, we report the typical presentation of an unusual illness that occurred in 2 pediatric patients in different geographic locations. In addition, we believe that these are the youngest patients with Loffler's endocarditis reported.

### When multimodality cardiac imaging saves the day: rare cause of embolic strokes [^5b695600]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of tissues. Myocardial infiltration occurs in 50%-60% of HES and leads to a condition called Loeffler's endocarditis. This can lead to endomyocardial injury with resultant superimposed thrombus formation and embolic stroke. We describe the case of a 57-year-old female patient presenting with neurological symptoms who was found to have multiple embolic strokes on a background of long-standing eosinophilia. Following a series of investigations, including transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiographies and cardiovascular MRI, she was confirmed to have Loeffler's endocarditis with left ventricular thrombus. She was treated successfully with steroids and anticoagulation. We describe the pathophysiology of HES and Loeffler's endocarditis and stress the crucial role of multimodality cardiac imaging in establishing its diagnosis and treatment monitoring.

### Rapid reversion of loeffler's endocarditis by imatinib in early stage clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome [^2a90ef9e]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

Endomyocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) is the main cause of poor outcome in Hyper Eosinophilic Syndrome (HES) and Eosinophilic Leukemia (EL). Reversion of the cardiac damage has been seldom reported, and thrombi can superimpose on infiltrated walls, originating oembolic complications. The tyrosine kynase inhibitor imatinib has been recently employed in patients affected by HES or EL, with impressive results. We have treated with imatinib a young patient affected by Loeffler's endocarditis during EL. Loeffler's endocarditis was studied by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography with and without the contrast agent SonoVue. Cytogenetics, FISH and molecular analysis showed the presence of the FIP1L1/PDGFRA fusion gene, recently detected in a majority of HES patients. Standard echocardiography revealed a large infiltration of the apical region, with apparently pedunculate corpora floating in the LV chamber; after SonoVue injection, a thick endo-myocardial infiltration involving papillary muscles and tendinous chords appeared, which simulated mobile thrombi at standard echography. Treatment with low dose imatinib caused rapid regression of both eosinophilic proliferation and endomyocardiopathy. The fusion gene FIP1L1-PDGFRA was found significantly decreased after a few months of treatment. Using a contrast echocardiographic approach, we demonstrated the non-thrombotic origin of the "in plus" image in our patient and its rapid resolution following imatinib treatment. Imatinib is an excellent candidate for first line treatment of Loeffler's endocarditis, especially when the FIP1L1/PDGFA fusion gene is detected.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with ulcerative colitis presenting with recurrent loeffler's endocarditis and left ventricular thrombus treated successfully with immune suppressive therapy and anticoagulation [^56cde6f0]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We reported a case of a 28-year-old Caucasian woman with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) associated with ulcerative colitis who presented on separate occasions with Loeffler's endocarditis. She was admitted in 2008 with fever, headache, confusion and visual loss. Diagnostic workup uncovered an eosinophilia of 3.1×10⁹/L and major ECG abnormalities. Subsequent echocardiography revealed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with mural thrombus. MRI brain scan showed multiple white matter lesions consistent with acute infarcts. She recovered rapidly with corticosteroids and anticoagulation. Four years later she re-presented with headache, fatigue and an eosinophilia of 13.4×10⁹/L. This occurred 3 months after cessation of immunosuppression and within 12 months of total colectomy for fulminant ulcerative colitis. Echocardiography was suggestive of hypereosinophilic endomyocardial fibrosis with left ventricular thrombus. Anticoagulation and corticosteroids were resumed with good effect. This report highlights the findings, treatment and outcome of ulcerative colitis-associated HES manifesting as recurrent Loeffler's endocarditis.

### Löffler endocarditis: a rare cause of acute cardiac failure [^134d7989]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To diagnose HES and Löffler endocarditis, echocardiography enables sufficient detection of thickened endocardium and intraventricular thrombus. Nevertheless, acute necrotic stage can come along with absolute normal echocardiographic findings. Endomyocardial thickening is seen in 68% of patients on echocardiography and is progressive. Apical thrombus in the presence of normal apical contraction is one of the main clues in suspected Löffler's endomyocarditis. There are three primary goals for the management of HES: 1) reduction of peripheral and tissue levels of eosinophils; 2) prevention of end-organ damage; and 3) prevention of thrombo-embolic events in patients at risk. Patients without progressive organ system dysfunction typically do not require specific treatment, however, these patients should be monitored closely. Corticosteroids were initially the mainstay of HES treatment and are currently recommended as first-line therapy. Cytotoxic agents like hydroxyurea are indicated in HES subsets with corticosteroid resistance or when corticosteroid tapering is necessary. Interferon-alpha is an immunomodulator that reduces Th2-mediated IL-5 production, synthesis of GM-CSF and release of eosinophil-specific neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein and indirectly inhibits eosinophil differentiation. It is recommended for use in HES patients with organ damage and corticosteroid/cytotoxic treatment failure. Allogenic stem cell transplantation has also been reported to be a potentially curative therapy. It is the ultimate therapeutic measure in case of therapeutic refractoriness or intolerance to available therapies or in patients who present with progressive life-threatening end-organ damage. The optimal preparative regime is not well established and it is associated with major morbidity and even mortality. Several therapies are currently under investigation as potential HES therapies, like Mepolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal IgG anti-IL5 antibody. The secondary treatment should be directed at cardiac complications, e.g. heart failure and the presence of intracardial thrombus. In the view of subclinical progression of the cardiac involvement, especially in the primary stage of HES, our case suggests very early and aggressive anticoagulation, regardless of the initial (negative) cardiac evaluation. Occasionally, surgical therapies are needed for cardiovascular complications. Surgical experience of patients with valvular dysfunction secondary to HES is limited. Valve replacement is most often performed but the choice between a mechanical or biological prosthesis in this setting poses a difficult problem. Mechanical valves have a high incidence of recurrent obstructive thrombosis and therefor a bioprosthesis is recommended despite associated restrictive cardiomyopathy.

### Hyepereosiniphilic syndrome and COVID-19: 2 case reports [^f9586d3b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is defined as a high peripheral eosinophil count (> 1.5 × 10 9 /L), along with evidence of eosinophil-related organ damage. The etiology can be neoplastic (primary), reactive to conditions like parasitic infection or lymphoma (secondary), and, more commonly, idiopathic. Cardiac involvement, known as "Loeffler's Endocarditis", consists of three phases: acute necrotic asymptomatic phase, thrombotic phase with possible embolic events, and fibrotic phase with restrictive cardiomyopathy and symptoms of heart failure. Nearly half of the patients have cardiovascular involvement, a major cause of mortality in HES.

Over the past two years, millions have been affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although upper respiratory tract symptoms are the most common manifestation, myocardial injury can occur in many patients, ranging from myocarditis to acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Cardiac involvement negatively affects the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19, especially in patients with pre-existing heart disease. COVID-19 also exacerbates the compensated pre-existing cardiac diseases or increases complications. Herein, we describe two patients with HES complicated by COVID-19 and discuss the coagulation status and treatment strategies in such patients.

Conclusions

Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare cause of cardiac failure resulting in cardiogenic shock due to endomyocardial thickening and thrombus formation. Both may impede left ventricular in- and outflow tract. The risk increases when the duration of hypereosinophilia is more than ten months. Besides first line therapy (corticosteroids), early aggressive anticoagulation therapy is warranted. In more severe cases acute surgical intervention is necessary.

Discussion

Acquired eosinophilia can be classified into secondary (cytokine-driven reactive phenomenon), clonal (presence of a bone marrow histological, cytogenetic or molecular marker of a myeloid malignancy) and idiopathic (neither secondary nor clonal) categories. In 1975 Chusid et al. described diagnostic criteria for idiopathic HES that remain in use today. These are blood eosinophilia of > 1500 cells per microliter for more than six consecutive months, absence of an underlying cause of hypereosinophilia despite extensive diagnostic evaluation, and organ damage or dysfunction as a result of local release of the toxic contents of eosinophils. HES affects mostly men between 20 and 50 years of age, with a peak in the 4 th decade of life. There are no published data regarding its incidence/prevalence, although the syndrome is considered rare in adults and very rare in children.

The exact etiology of HES is unknown; however, the process probably involves a dysregulation of IL-3, IL-5 and/or GM-CSF, which are all eosinophil growth factors.

Clinical manifestations of HES are markedly heterogeneous as the disease can either be completely asymptomatic or involve multiple organs. In essence, any organ is vulnerable to eosinophilia-associated tissue damage. Thromboembolic disease involving the cardiac chambers and/or both the venous and arterial vessels is not infrequent. Cardiac involvement occurs in more than 75% of patients with HES and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HES usually follows three stages. The first is an acute necrotic stage. This stage is usually neither recognized clinically nor diagnosed, like in our case. In this stage there is damage to the endocardium and infiltration of the myocardium with eosinophils and lymphocytes with histopathological evidence of myocardial necrosis and eosinophil degranulation and eosinophil micro abscesses. The second stage concerns thrombosis with formation of thrombi along the damaged endocardium of either one or both ventricles and occasionally in the atrium. Outflow tracts near the aortic and pulmonic valves are usually spared, although rarely thrombus may involve these valves and thrombus may form on atrioventricular valve leaflets. This stage is found in those with a mean 10-month duration of eosinophilia. In the third late fibrotic stage progressive scarring may lead to entrapment of chordae tendineae resulting in mitral and/or tricuspid valve regurgitation and endomyocardial fibrosis producing a restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Case report

A 37-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with one month of fatigue and five days of progressive dyspnoea and fever. Three months earlier he had been diagnosed with idiopathic hypereosinophilia. Extensive diagnostic evaluation at that time revealed neither a cause for secondary eosinophilia nor any cardiac abnormalities. Oral prednisone was given for two months, but was gradually tapered since there was no decline in eosinophil count.

On admission we saw an acutely ill-looking man, temperature 38.1°C, blood pressure 80/47 mmHg, heart rate 137 beats/min and a saturation of 90% with 15 liters per minute of oxygen therapy by a non-rebreathing mask. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs; diffuse inspiratory crackles were heard during ausculation of the lungs. No other abnormalities were found. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 96.8 × 10 9 /L, of which 84.2 × 10 9 /l were eosinophils (87%), hemoglobin 8.6 mmol/l, thrombocytes 238 × 10 9 /L, C-reactive protein 122 mg/L, creatinine 141 umol/L, lactate dehydrogenase 426 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 28 U/L and creatine phosphokinase 45 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.46, pCO2 4.3 kPa, pO2 8.5 kPa and bicarbonate 23 mmol/L. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary congestion. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia, a QS complex in V1 and V2, 2 mm. ST-elevations in V1-V3 and ST-depressions in II, III, AVF, V5 and V6 (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large mass in the left ventricle (LV) attached to the posterolateral wall with severe inflow- and outflow tract obstruction; echo Doppler maximal LV outflow tract velocity was 6 m/s (Figure 2 A and B). The posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) was completely embedded in the mass. The left and right ventricular function was however fully normal. Because of progressive respiratory failure, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated. A CT-scan of the thorax confirmed the large (thrombus) mass in the left ventricle, left and right atrial dilatation, pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed endomyocardial fibrosis and necrosis and a large thrombus in the left ventricle with obstruction of the left ventricle outflow tract. A diagnosis of Löffler endocarditis was made. Pharmacological therapy was initiated with diuretics, high dose beta-blockers, methylprednisolone (1000 mg a day for three days) and anti-coagulation along with antiplatelet agents acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. Mechanical ventilation was necessary for twelve days. After this period weaning and extubation was successfully. Because of severe diastolic dysfunction with an inflow and outflow tract obstruction of the left ventricle due to the thrombus, inotropics were not helpful and patient received only on the first day norepinephrine. Initially there was a marked decline in his eosinophil count (white blood cell count of 32 × 10 9 /L with 17 × 10 9 /L eosinophils (53%) however this was of short duration. Therefore we started therapy with interferon alpha and hydroxycarbamide resulting in a gradual decline of the eosinophil count (white blood cell count of 6.6 × 10 9 /L, of which 2.28 × 10 9 /L (34.5%) were eosinophils). Signs of bone marrow depression with anemia and thrombocytopenia complicated this therapy. Interferon alpha therefore was stopped.

### Right-sided infective endocarditis 2020: challenges and updates in diagnosis and treatment [^6131ee4e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) involves native or prosthetic valves, any intracardiac devices within the heart, and more rarely nonfunctional embryonic remnants that are present in the right atrium (RA). It is caused by the seeding of any of these structures by bacterial or, less commonly, fungal organisms. 1 Despite advances in diagnostic capabilities and treatment options, IE continues to be a growing health concern with a 1‐year mortality rate of 30%, which has remained unchanged over several decades. 2

The overall incidence of IE in the United States is steadily increasing. Between 2000 and 2011, IE incidence has grown from 11 to 15 cases per 100 000 people per year, despite updates in IE prophylaxis guidelines. 3 Men constitute a higher proportion of IE cases; however, the incidence of IE in women is increasing. 4, 5 In recent decades, there has been a shift in the patient population: the proportion of patients with IE and underlying rheumatic heart disease has decreased whereas the proportion of patients with prosthetic valves and implanted heart devices has increased. 6 The increasing incidence of IE has also been attributed to longer survival of patients with risk factors for IE such as congenital heart disease, HIV, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive therapy, and end‐stage renal disease requiring dialysis. 7, 8, 9

The diagnosis of IE is based on clinical, imaging, and laboratory criteria. The Duke major criteria, the mainstay of IE diagnosis, were developed to facilitate the diagnosis of IE and consist of positive blood cultures of typical microorganisms (commonly staphylococci or streptococci) and the presence of valvular vegetations detected by echocardiography. 10

IE can be further classified according to the cardiac structures and chambers involved. Endocarditis affecting the right heart chambers and valves has typical etiologies and epidemiology as well as unique diagnostic and therapeutic options. Compared with the extensive data on left‐sided IE, much less information has been published on the features and management of right‐sided IE.

In this review we provide an up‐to‐date overview on the etiology, diagnosis, imaging, management, and prognosis of right‐sided IE as well as new therapeutic options and representative cases from our experience.

### Löffler endocarditis: a rare cause of acute cardiac failure [^3e83e840]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) are a heterogenous group of disorders marked by the sustained overproduction of eosinophils. It is a rare condition with an unknown prevalence. Diagnosis is based on three criteria: (1) an eosinophil count of more than 1500 cells per microliter for at least 6 months, (2) no other evident cause for eosinophilia, including allergic diseases and parasitic infection and (3) sign or symptoms of organ involvement by eosinophilic infiltration. Cardiac involvement is common in HES and eosinophilic myocarditis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with HES. Mitral valve involvement may lead to acute cardiac failure. We present a patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and severe cardiac involvement, so-called Löffler endocarditis.

### Parasitic diseases as a cause of acute abdominal pain: imaging findings [^a89faa58]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinically, most of the patients are asymptomatic. Heavy infection can cause fever, abdominal pain, general weakness, weight loss, and pulmonary and neurological symptoms. Liver involvement appears as small, oval, multiple hypoechoic lesions on US. On CT, the most common imaging finding of the hepatic toxocariasis is multiple, ill-defined, oval or sometimes angular or trapezoid in shape, low-attenuating nodules along the portal vein branches that are measured less than 2 cm, best seen on the portal venous phase. An enhancing rim may be seen on arterial phase images. When the infection becomes severe, the small lesions fuse to form large lesions, some of which are crossed by portal vein branches (Fig. 12). Toxocariasis appears as single or multiple lesions with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Portal phase images after intravenous (IV) gadolinium administration are the most helpful method to demonstrate poorly defined low-signal intensity lesions. Concomitant lung lesions may also be seen in severe infection. Cardiac involvement including myocarditis, pericarditis, and Loeffler's endocarditis may be encountered in rare cases with Toxocariasis.

### Clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of infective endocarditis in the 21st century… [^60886d88]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Recent health care exposure was found in one-quarter of patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. The mitral and aortic valves were infected most commonly. The following complications were common: stroke, embolization other than stroke, heart failure, and intracardiac abscess.), S aureus infection, coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection, mitral valve vegetation, and paravalvular. Predisposing conditions were common in patients with definite IE. Although intravenous drug use remains important, the most common predisposing conditions were related to valvular heart disease. Degenerative valve disease was the most frequent native valve predisposing factor.

Our findings reveal that, in much of the world, IE is no longer a subacute or chronic disease occurring primarily in younger patients with rheumatic valvular abnormalities. In contrast, most patients in this investigation presented early and demonstrated few of the classic clinical findings traditionally associated with IE. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, Osler nodes were recorded in 11% to 23% and splenomegaly in 20% to 44% of patients with IE. 9, 10, 25, 26 In our study, predisposing valvular conditions were common but were primarily owing to the presence of degenerative valve disease or a prosthetic valve rather than rheumatic heart disease. Another observation arising from this investigation is the shift in the microbiologic characteristics of IE. Staphylococcus aureus is now the most common cause of IE in much of the world, confirming several recent investigations5, 16, 31 and the earlier findings of the ICE-PCS.

23 This shift is due in part to the global presence of risk factors for S aureus–associated IE. Given the growing antimicrobial resistance of S aureus, 32 including to vancomycin, 33–35 the importance of this pathogen as a potentially lethal infection is cause for concern.

### Löffler endocarditis: a rare cause of acute cardiac failure [^5e100795]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a patient with acute cardiogenic shock due to cardiac involvement in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (Löffler endocarditis). At the echocardiography, there was a huge mass in the left ventricular cavity, resulting in inflow- and outflow tract obstruction. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve apparatus was completely embedded in a big (organized) thrombus mass. The patient was treated with high dose corticosteroids, however without effect. Partial remission was achieved after treatment with hydroxycarbamide. He was also treated with anticoagulants and high dose beta-blockers. The patient's condition improved remarkably after correction of the mitral valve insufficiency by a mitral valve bioprosthesis.

### Association between acute ischemic stroke etiology and macroscopic aspect of retrieved clots: is a clot's color a warning light for underlying pathologies? [^f1955942]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Few case reports have considered the chromatic aspect of retrieved clots and the possible association with their underlying etiology.

Objective

The aim of our study was to analyze the frequency of the TOAST ischemic stroke typical (atrial fibrillation, dissection, atheroma) and atypical (infective endocarditis, cancer-related, valve-related thrombi) etiologies depending on the chromatic aspect of retrieved clots.

Methods

A total of 255 anonymized and standardized clot photos of consecutive patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke were included. A double-blind evaluation was performed by two senior interventional neuroradiologists, who classified the visual aspects of the clots into two main patterns: red/black or white. Main patient characteristics, distribution of underlying stroke etiologies, and outcomes were compared between the two study groups.

Results

The inter-reader agreement for clot colors was excellent (k = 0.78). Two hundred and thirty-three patients were classified as having red/black clots and 22 as having white clots. A statistically significant association (p = 0.001) between atypical etiologies and white clots was observed.

Conclusions

White clots were significantly associated with atypical etiologies in this cohort, in particular, with infectious endocarditis.

Endocarditis

Endocarditis is a common complication after prosthetic valve implantation. Complications of active inflammation include dehiscence of the valve, paravalvular leaks and abscesses. MRI allows direct visualisation of the valve, identification and quantification of regurgitations, and may spot separation of the aortic valve from the aortic annulus. Of note, artefacts arising particularly from mechanical valves may have a severe impact on image quality and diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to MRI, 18 F-FDG PET allows the direct assessment of the predominant site and acuity of inflammation and may also be utilised to monitor therapy response after start of antimicrobial treatment. An important prerequisite to increase specificity of 18 F-FDG PET is the effective suppression of physiologic, myocardial 18 F-FDG uptake. Different patient preparation protocols (including prolonged fasting, high-fat low-carbohydrate diet and pre-injection of heparin before 18 F-FDG administration) have been proposed. Furthermore, review of non-attenuated PET images is obligatory as metal extinction artefacts on MRI translate into the attenuation correction map and cause underestimation of the 18 F-FDG uptake on attenuation-corrected PET images (in contrast to metal artefacts in CT, which cause an overestimation of tracer uptake on attenuation-corrected PET images). So far, to the best of our knowledge, no literature exists on the use of integrated PET/MRI in infectious endocarditis. One case report describes the successful use of 18 F-FDG PET/MRI in a patient suffering from Loeffler endocarditis.

### Infective endocarditis [^7451e94b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infective endocarditis:

- **Definition**: IE is a disease characterized by infection and inflammation of the endocardium, the layer of endothelial cells that lines the chambers and valves of the heart.
- **Pathophysiology**: IE is most commonly caused by Streptococci and Staphylococci (80% cases), with S. aureus being the most common pathogen. Risk factors include the presence of cardiac prosthetic material (prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices) or abnormal valvular tissue (non-repaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases, chronic rheumatic heart disease, age-related degenerative valvular lesions), as well as intravenous drug use, and relative immunosuppression (including age ≥ 65 years, hemodialysis, diabetes, and HIV infection).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of IE is approximately 15 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US.
- **Disease course**: The altered cardiac valve surface produces a suitable site for bacteria in the bloodstream to attach and proliferate, creating vegetations that can detach and disseminate. Septic emboli from vegetations result in clinical manifestations of ischemic stroke, mycotic aneurysms, infarcts, and abscesses at various sites. Pulmonary, splenic, neurovascular, renal, and cardiac manifestations can ultimately lead to death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: IE is associated with 15–22% in-hospital mortality and 40% 5-year mortality in developed countries. The estimated risk of recurrence of IE is 1.3% per year.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^db2ba2a3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) characterized by persistent eosinophilia and damage to multiple organs caused by allergies, parasites, autoimmune diseases, infections, and cancer with low morbidity and high mortality, which mainly affects men aged between 20 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestation is multi-system eosinophil infiltration, especially the skin, heart, and nervous system. Diagnosis requires an eosinophil (EO) count of at least 1.5 × 10 9 /L twice (interval of more than 1 month) and/or bone marrow nucleated cell count with EO ratio ≥ 20%, and/or pathology confirmed extensive EO infiltration and/or significant deposition of eosinophilic granulocyte protein and evidence of organ damage except for other diseases that may be the primary cause of organ damage. HES can be classified into four subtypes based on etiology as follows: hereditary (familial) HE, secondary (reactive) HE, primary (clonal/neoplastic) HE, and idiopathic HE. Heart involvement is the most serious complication and the main cause of death in HES, with complication rates of 40–50%. Eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis, a serious heart complication of HES, results in damage to the endocardium or myocardium through eosinophil infiltration, leading to myocardial necrosis, thrombogenesis, and fibrosis. Eosinophilic endocarditis is also known as Löffler myocarditis (LE). Patients may lack specific symptoms but often experience dyspnea and a high risk of death. Acute cases can be severe, with systemic thrombo-embolic events, worsening cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Patients with eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (EGPA) and allergies complicated with LE face significantly higher 120-day mortality of 23.3% and 46.3%, respectively, compared to those without LE. Early recognition and treatment of LE can improve prognosis. In this article, four cases diagnosed with LE were screened based on patients who visited our hospital over the past five years, and retrospective analysis on their diagnosis and treatment will be given. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature review of the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis was conducted, aiming to establish a foundation for further research and to provide detailed insights for the clinical management of eosinophilic endocarditis.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^e9c4186f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Endomyocardial fibrosis and hypereosinophilic syndrome (Löffler endocarditis) — Definition and clinical spectrum are outlined: Eosinophilic myocarditis occurs when overproduction of eosinophils leads to myocardial damage through infiltration and release of inflammatory cytokines, and Löffler endocarditis is characterized by eosinophilia, myocardial fibrosis, systemic thromboembolism, and acute HF and likely represents late stages of eosinophilic myocarditis. Endomyocardial fibrosis primarily presents as restrictive cardiomyopathy and is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. Multiple organ systems are involved, including cutaneous (69%), pulmonary (44%), gastrointestinal (38%), and cardiac (20%), and eosinophilic myocarditis is the primary manifestation of the disease only 5% of the time. Eosinophilic myocarditis progresses in 3 stages (necrotic, thrombotic, and fibrotic), with the initial necrotic stage often subclinical but potentially presenting as fulminant myocarditis.

### Multimodal imaging of the tricuspid valve: normal appearance and pathological entities [^acf3e0b6]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation

Trace tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is seen in 80–90% of healthy individuals. The most common cause (75%) of pathological regurgitation is functional, due to dilation of the annulus and valvular tenting, seen either due to RV dysfunction (left heart disease, ischemia, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia [ARVD], systemic RV in transposition of the great arteries [TGA)]), RV overload (pulmonary hypertension, systemic RV in TGA) or other causes (physiologic, atrial fibrillation, tumours). Left heart failure is the most common cause of TR. Structural TR is seen in 25% and can either be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include Ebstein's anomaly, dysplasia, hypoplasia, cleft, prolapse, double orifice or bicuspid valve, whereas acquired causes include rheumatic fever, infective endocarditis, carcinoid, Loeffler endocarditis, trauma, tumours, or iatrogenic causes. Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of primary TR and is seen in 38% of those with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, with the valve appearing thickened and a with hockey stick-shaped appearance.

Echocardiography is the most commonly used modality in the evaluation of TR. The echocardiographic grades of TR are listed in Table 2 (Fig. 7). CT features of TR are dilated RA, RV, hepatic veins and IVC with systolic reflux of contrast into dilated hepatic veins and IVC. On MRI, a low signal regurgitant jet is seen extending through the tricuspid valve into the RA during systole. Visualization of the jet in the SSFP sequence may be difficult due to low shear and turbulence, but is appreciated in phase contrast velocity-encoded imaging. The jet can be qualitatively graded as mild, moderate and severe (Fig. 8) based on the extent of the jet posteriorly in the RA, jet area and jet area/left atrial area. Direct quantification of TR can be performed by performing the velocity-encoded sequence in the true short-axis plane of the tricuspid valve (Fig. 9a), but this is technically challenging due to extensive annular movement during the cardiac cycle. TR can be indirectly quantified using stroke volumes obtained from RV volumetric analysis and pulmonary flow obtained from phase-contrast imaging. Tricuspid regurgitant fraction = (RV stroke volume − PA forward flow/RV stroke volume) x 100% (Fig. 9b). Alternatively, (RV stroke volume − LV stroke volume)/RV stroke volume x 100%. The accuracy of this technique is lower with arrhythmias

Q fever — clinical features of acute and chronic illness emphasize symptom timing, asymptomatic infection frequency, and endocarditis findings. Acute Q fever typically is characterized by a nonspecific febrile illness, hepatitis, or pneumonia, and asymptomatic infections have been reported in up to 60% of cases; onset of symptoms usually occurs within 2–3 weeks of exposure and symptomatic patients might be ill for weeks or months if untreated. Chronic Q fever can manifest within a few months or several years after acute infection and can follow symptomatic or asymptomatic infections; chronic disease is rare (< 5% of patients with acute infection) and is typically characterized by endocarditis in patients with preexisting risk factors such as valvular or vascular defects. Unlike acute Q fever, which has a low mortality rate (< 2%), chronic Q fever endocarditis is always fatal if untreated; routine blood cultures are negative, and vegetative lesions are visualized by echocardiography in approximately 12% of patients.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of vasculitis characterised by atopic manifestations, inflammation of small-sized to medium-sized arteries and veins, hypereosinophilia and tissue infiltration with eosinophils. Cardiac complications occur most commonly in the absence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Cardiac complications include coronary arteritis (rare), pericarditis, myocarditis, endocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) and intracavitary thrombosis of the left or right ventricle. This is the first reported case of large non-infectious valvular vegetations associated with EGPA.

Infective endocarditis — diagnostic challenges and complications include that in the 10% of patients with culture-negative endocarditis, serological testing or advanced laboratory diagnostics may be helpful to identify the etiologic agent; the Modified Duke Criteria have been well validated by comparison with surgical or autopsy findings and clinical outcomes; about three-fourths of patients with IE are diagnosed within 30 days of the onset of infection, and the diagnosis of IE can still be difficult and is frequently delayed with risk of progressive and potentially irreparable structural damage. Complications remain common, including stroke (16.9%), embolization other than stroke (22.6%), HF (32.3%), intracardiac abscess (14.4%), and the need for surgical therapy (48.2%); patients with suspected IE are most optimally managed in an environment coordinating relevant specialists.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^5287f7e3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Endocardial involvement in patients with EGPA is similar to that of other hypereosinophilic syndromes (idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and its variants, tropical endomyocardial fibrosis). The pathological lesion most commonly associated with hypereosinophilic syndromes is referred to as Loeffler's endocarditis. Loeffler's endocarditis occurs less commonly with EGPA than with other hypereosinophilic syndromes. It evolves in three stages. The first stage is characterised by endomyocardial infiltration with eosinophils and lymphocytes. Degranulation of eosinophils results in the release of cationic protein, eosinophil major protein, eosinophil myeloperoxidase and Charcot–Leyden crystal protein. These substances are cytotoxic and are thought to produce endomyocardial necrosis. The second stage is characterised by thrombus formation in areas of endomyocardial damage (the left and right ventricular apex are most commonly affected). The third stage is characterised by endocardial fibrosis which may be local or diffuse and may result in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Endocardial fibrosis is recognised by late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI. Valvular function in Loeffler's endocarditis may be affected by fibrotic tethering of chordae tendineae or fibroinflammatory involvement of valvular endothelium. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are the most commonly reported forms of valve dysfunction in patients with EGPA, but are infrequently observed. Large valvular vegetations have been described in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and with vasculitides such as Wegener's granulomatosis. To our knowledge this case is the first description of non-infectious valvular vegetations in a patient with EGPA. In the absence of myocardial tissue from biopsy or autopsy, we are uncertain as to the cause of this patient's decline in LV systolic function after surgery. Eosinophilic infiltration of myocardium is a possibility, but cardiac MRI showed no evidence of myocarditis or endocardial fibrosis. Severing of the chordae tendineae to facilitate mitral valve replacement is also a possible explanation.

Hypereosinophilic syndromes are rare diseases; however, cardiac involvement is frequently seen. When diagnosed promptly, the prognosis is relatively good; however, a final diagnosis is made by ruling out many conditions leading to secondary eosinophilia. We present a case of Loeffler's endomyocarditis primarily misdiagnosed as an acute coronary syndrome, complicated by low output heart failure and cardiac arrest. After hypereosinophilic syndrome was confirmed and treatment with prednisone initiated, the patient responded well to therapy, and her further recovery was complete and uneventful.

### Non-infectious aortic and mitral valve vegetations in a patient with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^0ab0bbc4]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Current recommendations for the treatment of EGPA include therapy with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone, followed by administrations of an immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine. A systematic review of treatment of EGPA by Bosch et al suggested that azathioprine and possibly methotrexate may be useful in maintaining remission. In 2017, the humanised monoclonal antibody mepolizumab was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in EGPA. Our patient was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, but did not receive cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, leflunomide, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange. Failure to initiate one or more of these therapies probably occurred due to the delay in confirming the diagnosis of EGPA, which occurred shortly before death, and because the patient declined further therapy once the diagnosis of EGPA was confirmed. It is possible that earlier diagnosis and more aggressive pharmacotherapy might have changed the course of this patient's illness. Mepolizumab was not available prior to the patient's demise.

In conclusion, non-infectious valvular vegetations should be added to the list of cardiovascular complications of EGPA.

Learning points

Previously described cardiac complications of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) include coronary arteritis (rare), pericarditis, myocarditis, endocardial fibrosis (Loeffler's endocarditis) and thrombus formation in the left or right ventricle.
Cardiac complications occur in 50%–62% of patients with EGPA, mainly in those who are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody negative.
Large non-infectious valvular vegetations may occur in patients with EGPA.

Endomyocardial disorders

Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) are characterized by diffuse thickening of the LV endocardium secondary to the proteotoxic damage produced by eosinophils and the ensuing proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue. The LV is invariably involved, often together with the mitral and aortic valves. Isolated right ventricular involvement may rarely occur. Endomyocardial fibrosis is commonly seen in equatorial countries and accounts for ∼20% of HF cases and 15% of cardiac deaths in equatorial Africa. A combination of dietary, environmental, and infectious factors may elicit an inflammatory process leading to progressive endomyocardial damage and scarring. The natural history of EMF includes an active phase with inflammation and eosinophilia that progresses to restrictive heart disease. Hypereosinophilic syndrome affecting the heart, formerly known as Loeffler's endocarditis, is a very rare condition caused by the release of highly active biological substances that damage the endothelium and myocardium. Most patients are diagnosed between 20 and 50 years of age. Mechanisms of eosinophilia include helminthic and parasitic infections, malignancies, eosinophilic leukaemia, allergic drug reactions, hypersensitivity, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The fibrotic stage results in RCM due to extensive endomyocardial fibrosis and resembles EMF.

Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is characterized by diffuse thickening of the LV endocardium secondary to proliferation of fibrous and elastic tissue. Two forms have been described: a dilated form (DCM phenotype), in which the LV is enlarged, and a 'contracted' form (RCM phenotype), in which the LV cavity is small. A familial pattern is seen in the majority, with presentation commonly occuring during infancy. Mitral and aortic valves are frequently involved. Isolated RV involvement may rarely occur. The 'contracted' form produces restrictive haemodynamics and a clinical picture of left-sided obstructive disease, particularly if the mitral valve is involved. Endocardial fibroelastosis is extremely rare and may respond to surgery. Medical management of the fibrotic stage may include diuretics and aspirin or anticoagulation to prevent intracardiac thrombosis. Anticoagulation can promote the reabsorption of thrombosis even in non-acute phases of the disease. The fibrotic stage may occasionally require surgical therapy, which may include resection of endocardial scar as well as subchordal repair and/or valve repair or replacement. Surgical resection of subendocardial fibrosis is rarely curative, even in centres of expertise. and cardiac transplantation is an option in advanced cases.

### Sign of the times: updating infective endocarditis diagnostic criteria to recognize Enterococcus faecalis as a typical endocarditis bacterium [^d6618d01]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The modified Duke criteria requires that Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia must be both community-acquired and without known focus in order to be considered a microbiological "Major" diagnostic criterion in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. We believe that the microbiological diagnostic criteria should be updated to regard E. faecalis as a "typical" endocarditis bacterium as is currently the case, for example, viridans group streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Using data from a prospective study of 344 patients with E. faecalis bacteremia evaluated with echocardiography, we demonstrate that designating E. faecalis as a "typical" endocarditis pathogen, regardless the place of acquisition or the portal of entry, improved the sensitivity to correctly identify definite endocarditis from 70% (modified Duke criteria) to 96% (enterococcal adjusted Duke criteria).

Infective endocarditis — etiology, prognosis, and epidemiology: Infective endocarditis may be subacute or acute; the subacute form is "most often related to infections with streptococcal species and less commonly with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and fastidious Haemophilus sp", typically developing on abnormal valves after asymptomatic bacteremias. Acute endocarditis is more often related to S. aureus, group A hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, or gonococci and "can develop on normal valves". "Untreated endocarditis is almost always fatal". Prosthetic valve endocarditis forms a substantial proportion of cases; although incidence "has not changed over the past 3 decades", the age at presentation has increased. Right‑sided disease is often related to intravenous drug abuse, and aortic/mitral valve endocarditis "has been associated with rapid death" due to acute valvular disruption, coronary emboli, or ring/septal abscesses.

### Microbiological etiology in prosthetic valve endocarditis: a nationwide registry study [^43ff53fe]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that patients with mechanical valve prostheses have a higher risk of having S. aureus as the cause for PVE compared to patients with bioprosthetic valve PVE. On the contrary, patients with bioprosthetic valves are more likely to have α‐hemolytic streptococci as the cause for PVE. This finding is novel and potentially important to direct initial investigations and therapy in cases of suspected PVE. Specifically, S. aureus was more than twice as common in PVE in patients with mechanical valves compared to biological ones. This finding contrasts with a smaller previous study, which reported that the risk of PVE caused by S. aureus was not significantly different in patients with mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. Our finding may be explained by the properties of S. aureus that perhaps make these bacteria more likely to adhere to mechanical surfaces compared to the other IE pathogens. However, patients who receive mechanical valves are typically younger, and S. aureus infections are more common in younger persons. We made an age‐stratified analysis and found that the association between S. aureus and mechanical valves was stable across all age groups. In the multivariable analysis, age was not independently associated with S. aureus as the cause, whereas the presence of a mechanical valve prosthesis was an independent predictor of S. aureus etiology. Importantly, the association between mechanical valves and S. aureus remained if the IVDU population, which is typically younger, was excluded from the analysis. This indicates that the apparent predilection of S. aureus for mechanical valve prostheses might reflect a true difference in bacterial adhesion and valve colonization. Bioprostheses may have better protection from S. aureus adhesion and colonization through the partial endothelialization that occurs in bioprostheses over time. On the other hand, mechanical valves are generally covered in pyrolytic carbon, and they do not mimic the biological and elastomeric properties of native valves. Moreover, the leaflets of mechanical valves are not in direct contact with endothelium, which prevents cell migration.

### Large apical thrombus in a patient with persistent heart failure and hypereosinophilia: Löffler endocarditis [^72d56b90]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an uncommon leukoproliferative systemic disorder characterized by the overproduction of eosinophils and poor prognosis. A major source of morbidity and mortality of this syndrome is the associated cardiac involvement represented by endocardial thickening and mural thrombi. We report a 64-year-old woman with persistent symptoms of heart failure despite standard medical therapy. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular filling due to a large apical mass; an abnormal diastolic filling pattern was also noticed. Complete blood count revealed remarkable hypereosinophilia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an apical thrombus and intense linear enhancement of the endocardium, which were compatible with Löffler endocarditis. Medical therapy, including corticosteroids and anticoagulation, was initiated promptly. The symptoms improved as the peripheral hypereosinophilia resolved in 15 days. The patient was asymptomatic at the 1-year follow-up visit with complete regression of the apical thrombus and no evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report this case to draw attention to this particularly rare condition with poor prognosis since quick and accurate diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy may improve symptoms and survival.

### Malassezia restricta: an underdiagnosed causative agent of blood culture-negative infective endocarditis [^024aba20]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe disease requiring microbial identification to successfully adapt its treatment. Currently, identification of its etiological microorganism remains unresolved in 5.2% of cases. We aimed to improve IE diagnosis using an ultra-sensitive molecular technique on cardiac samples in microbiologically nondocumented (culture and conventional polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) IE (NDIE) cases.

Methods

Cardiac samples explanted in a tertiary hospital in Lyon, France, from patients with definite IE over a 5-year period were retrospectively analyzed. NDIE was defined as Duke definite-IE associated with negative explorations including cardiac samples culture, bacterial amplification, and serologies. Ultrasensitive molecular diagnosis was achieved using the Universal Microbe Detection kit (Molzym®). Fungal identification was confirmed using 26S-rDNA and internal transcribed spacer amplifications. Fungal infection was confirmed using Grocott-Gromori staining, auto-immunohistochemistry on cardiac samples, and mannan serologies.

Results

Among 88 included patients, microbial DNA was detected in all 16 NDIE cases. Bacterial taxa typical of IE etiologies were detected in 13/16 cases and Malassezia restricta in the 3 other cases. In these 3 cases, histological examination confirmed the presence of fungi pathognomonic of Malassezia that reacted with patient sera in an auto-immunohistochemistry assay and cross-reacted with Candida albicans in an indirect immunofluorescent assay.

Conclusions

M. restricta appears to be an underestimated causative agent of NDIE. Importantly, serological cross-reaction of M. restricta with C. albicans may lead to its misdiagnosis. This is of major concern since M. restricta is intrinsically resistant to echinocandins; the reference treatment for Candida-fungal IE.

### Four challenging cases of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis with literature review [^c76919af]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of eosinophilic endocarditis or myocarditis depends on a comprehensive assessment of the condition and an accurate etiological diagnosis. For cases with identified or suspected causes, initial treatment should target these specific causes. In cases of parasitic infections, antiparasitic agents are administered. Allergen avoidance is recommended for allergy-related LE. In cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)-related LE, treatment may include steroids or the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide. Imatinib may be used for the treatment of LE associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Imatinib can achieve complete hematologic and molecular remission within weeks to months, but cannot eliminate the FLP1L1-PDGFRA clone in most patients. Corticosteroids, which inhibit eosinophil degranulation, are proposed as a first-line treatment for LE. Consequently, early initiation of treatment in LE may potentially reverse the disease progression. For patients who do not respond well to steroids, treatment options may involve cytotoxic drugs (such as hydroxyurea, azathioprine) or immunomodulator tyrosine kinase inhibitor of eosinophils (such as imatinib), or anti-tumor target (such as merizumab). In these patients, interferon and hydroxyurea are second-line therapeutic agents. For patients unresponsive to both first-line and second-line treatments, high-dose imatinib is the treatment of choice. These treatment guidelines ensure a tailored approach based on individual patient response and specific disease etiology. For patients with ventricular thrombi, it is imperative to administer prompt thrombolysis to prevent thrombo-embolic events. For patients with LE myocardial fibrosis, some of them respond well to corticosteroid therapy. If medical treatment is ineffective, surgical endocardial decortication may be considered, which generally improves symptoms in most patients postoperatively. When valvular regurgitation is severe, valve replacement surgery may be indicated. Due to the risk of thrombotic complications from mechanical valve replacements, bioprosthetic valves are recommended as the preferred option. If all the above treatments are still ineffective, heart transplantation may be considered. Initial treatment should involve a medical regimen to reduce eosinophil counts, with surgical interventions as a secondary consideration. After corticosteroid therapy, the four patients of this article showed continuous decrease in EO levels. Subsequently, myocardial wall thickness and cardiac function gradually normalized. The diagnosis and treatment procedures of the 4 patients are shown in Table 1.

### Cumulative incidence of infective endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease: a nationwide, case-control study over nine decades [^098a1e41]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study did not identify a change in IE risk related to birth year in patients with CHD. On the contrary, a similar incidence rate by age group was seen in CHD patients born before and after 1970, which was also the case in controls. If this is a correct finding remains unproven but to some extent the case-control design of the present study accounts for possible bias.

Nearly all studies of IE include more men than women although a few population-based studies have an even sex distribution. CHD, however, occurs in a similar proportion in male and female individuals but with variations between different types of cardiac lesions. In our study, we identified a similar number of male and female patients with CHD, but male patients constituted two-thirds of IE cases. The reason for this uneven sex distribution in IE is unclear, but the data are in accordance with other studies.

The bacterial etiology of endocarditis has changed in Western countries over the past decades with S. aureus now being the most commonly reported cause, usually presenting with an acute sepsis-like illness. However, among patients with predisposing cardiac conditions, this etiological switch has not been seen. In our cohort, bacterial etiology was not coded in ICD-8 and 9; however, in the subgroup analyses of IE episodes in the ICD-10, streptococcal etiology was more common in patients with CHD and IE, and S. aureus was more common in controls with IE. A significantly lower proportion of IE episodes among patients with CHD had a bacteria code, but our data did not allow for further exploration. Tentative explanations may be owing to construction of the Duke modified endocarditis criteria, where CHD, as an important risk factor for IE, is a minor criterion itself. Hence, there is greater likelihood that a CHD patient who has fever and suggestive echocardiographic findings will be diagnosed with IE, also in the absence of documented bacteremia, than will patients who do not have CHD. Additionally, patients with CHD who have bacteremia with streptococci, S. aureus, or enterococci will be diagnosed with IE, even in the absence of endocarditis lesions visualized by echocardiography, corresponding to possible IE in the modified Duke criteria. This reflects the complex anatomy influencing the echocardiographic characteristics of patients with CHD. Vegetations and other findings considered typical echocardiographic features of IE can be more difficult to visualize in patients with CHD, and the need for specialized approaches to echocardiography in adults with CHD is well recognized.

A TEE is most useful in specific scenarios: to reduce the possibility of NVE where an unacceptably high posttest probability remains after a negative TTE and where eliminating the diagnosis will change patient treatment; in the evaluation of PVE where TTE has a lower sensitivity; and/or to facilitate surgical planning or to evaluate for specific complications. In general, a combination of vancomycin or daptomycin and a β-lactam like ceftriaxone.

### Management of bacterial endocarditis… [^a9968726]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

While virtually any bacterial organism can cause bacterial endocarditis, the vast majority of infections are caused by gram-positive cocci. The viridans group of streptococci is the most common cause of endocarditis involving native heart valves in patients with congenital heart disease and in patients who are not injection drug users. 5 Coagulase-positive staphylococci commonly cause bacterial endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valves and in injection drug users. 6 Presence of these organisms is also a common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis in persons whose heart valves were previously normal. 7 Infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. is a relatively common cause of bacterial endocarditis in patients with valvular prostheses. 8 Enterococci are causative agents in approximately 5 to 10 percent of bacterial endocarditis cases reported in several series.

5 Streptococcus bovis occasionally causes bacterial endocarditis in patients with an underlying colon malignancy or other intestinal disorder. Clinical manifestations of bacterial endocarditis are highly variable and frequently non-specific. Some degree of fever is common. Patients may present acutely ill with high fever and marked systemic toxicity, or they may present with vague, nonspecific symptoms lasting weeks to months. STAPHYLOCOCCI S. aureus is a common cause of bacterial endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valves and in injection drug users. This organism is also the most common cause of acute bacterial endocarditis in patients with previously normal cardiac valves. In this situation, the organisms frequently seed the blood stream from localized staphylococcal infections such as abscesses, cellulitis and osteomyelitis.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is increasingly identified as a cause of bacterial endocarditis, particularly in patients with prosthetic valves, right-sided endocarditis secondary to intravenous drug use, and nosocomial endocarditis. 8 These organisms are also resistant to cephalosporins. Patients with native valve endocarditis due to MRSA should be treated with vancomycin for four to six weeks. 12 Coagulase-negative staphylococci are a relatively common cause of infection of prosthetic valves.

Minor criteria updates — proposals and elimination of a prior minor echocardiographic criterion: Proposed additions to the minor criteria include "elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, the presence of newly diagnosed clubbing, splenomegaly, and microscopic hematuria", which in "a study of 100 consecutive cases… resulted in a 10% increase in the frequency of cases being deemed clinically definite", but "have not been formally integrated into the modified Duke criteria". The former minor criterion "echocardiogram consistent with IE but not meeting major criterion" was re-evaluated, and in a database with " > 800 cases" it "was used in only 5% of cases… Therefore, this minor criterion was eliminated in the modified Duke criteria".

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering high-dose penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin in patients with IE caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae without meningitis. Consider administering high-dose cefotaxime or ceftriaxone in the presence of meningitis.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (antibiotic therapy, MSSA), ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer (flu)cloxacillin or cefazolin with rifampin for at least 6 weeks and gentamicin for 2 weeks using the following doses in pediatric patients with PVE caused by methicillin-susceptible staphylococci:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|(flu)cloxacillin|- 200–300 mg/kg/day IV in 4–6 doses|
|Cefazolin|- 6 g/day IV in 3 doses|
|Rifampin|- 20 mg/kg/day IV or PO in 3 equally divided doses|
|Gentamicin|- 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 1 (preferred) or 2 doses.|

### Q fever in Thailand [^7a76fd91]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Coxiella burnetii, a strict intracellular bacterium, is the etiologic agent of Q fever, a worldwide zoonosis. Humans are infected by inhaling contaminated aerosols from amniotic fluid or placenta or handling contaminated wool. The bacterium is highly infectious by the aerosol route. Two forms of the disease are typical: acute and chronic. Acute Q fever is the primary infection and in specific hosts may become chronic. The major clinical manifestations of acute Q fever are pneumonia and hepatitis. Less common clinical manifestations are aseptic meningitis and/or encephalitis, pancreatitis, lymphadenopathy that mimics lymphoma, erythrema nodosum, bone marrow necrosis, hemolytic anemia, and splenic rupture. The main clinical manifestation of the chronic form is culture-negative endocarditis, but infection of vascular grafts or aneurysms, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, and prolonged fever have also been described. Fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline are active against C. burnetii in vitro, and ceftriaxone has been shown to have a bacteriostatic effect and could be effective in the phagolysosome of C. burnetii –infected cells. However, the treatment of choice for Q fever is doxycycline.

Q fever — Chronic clinical features and risk groups highlight that persons who are at high risk for development of chronic Q fever include persons with preexisting valvular heart disease, vascular grafts, or arterial aneurysms. Infection during pregnancy and immunosuppression (e.g., from chemotherapy) are both conditions that have been linked to chronic Q fever development. Endocarditis and infections of aneurysms or vascular prostheses are the most common forms of chronic Q fever and generally are fatal if untreated. Chronic Q fever is rarely reported in children, and in contrast with adults, osteomyelitis is one of the most common findings in children with chronic Q fever.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^05b504ad]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis — initial echocardiography and embolic risk — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed in all cases of suspected infective endocarditis (IE) (Class I; Level of Evidence B). The greatest risk of embolic complications appears to occur with large (≥ 10 mm) vegetations on the anterior mitral leaflet, and vegetation size and mobility may be taken into account when considering early surgery to avoid embolization, although mobility characteristics alone should not be the principal driver as a surgical indication.

Causative Microorganisms and Discordant Results

The overall distribution of causative microorganisms and their identification, depending on the diagnostic tools used, are displayed in Table 2. An etiologic agent could not be determined for 10 (13%) of definite cases and 28 (76%) of possible cases. For the 2 patients with recurring infective endocarditis, the cause for the first episode was different than that of the second episode. One patient had endocarditis caused by Streptococcus oralis, and 1 year later, endocarditis caused by K. kingae developed. For the other patient, no etiologic diagnosis was established for the first episode, during which a valve removal was necessary. Four months after cardiac surgery, the patient had endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Nine discrepant results were also observed and are summarized in Table 4.
