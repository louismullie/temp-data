## Question

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 2 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. Eight months ago, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treatment with risperidone was begun. Her parents report that she is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76 kg (168 lb); BMI is 26.9 kg/m². Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:\nProlactin 14 ng/mL\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 5 mIU/mL\nLuteinizing hormone 5.2 mIU/mL\nProgesterone 0.9 ng/mL (follicular N < 3; luteal N > 3–5)\nTestosterone 2.7 nmol/L (N < 3.5)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?'
A. Primary ovarian insufficiency
B. Anovulatory cycles
C. Uterine leiomyomas
D. Adverse effect of medication

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best explains secondary amenorrhea in a 15-year-old girl with a history of risperidone use, and to choose among primary ovarian insufficiency, anovulatory cycles, uterine leiomyomas, or medication adverse effect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming secondary amenorrhea and excluding pregnancy. Then, I should verify the medication history and its mechanistic plausibility for disrupting menses. Next, I will interpret the hormone profile against expected patterns for hyperprolactinemia, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, primary ovarian insufficiency, and PCOS. After that, I need to consider age-related anovulation and structural causes like fibroids. Finally, I will weigh the competing options and select the most likely diagnosis with a concise rationale and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and rule out pregnancy, because secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular cycles, and pregnancy must always be excluded first. Here, the patient has 2 months of amenorrhea following irregular cycles, so she meets criteria for evaluation of secondary amenorrhea, and the negative urine pregnancy test is reassuring but I should remember that a serum hCG can be more sensitive in select scenarios, which supports proceeding with the endocrine workup [^046be0d1] [^18e81a57] [^cdc233ed].

> Wait, let me verify the medication history and mechanism. Risperidone is a potent dopamine D2 antagonist that disinhibits pituitary lactotrophs, frequently causing hyperprolactinemia, which can suppress GnRH pulsatility, reduce LH/FSH, lower estradiol, and lead to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. This pharmacologic effect is well documented, with risperidone among the antipsychotics most strongly associated with prolactin elevation and menstrual disturbances, and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to these effects, so the temporal correlation since risperidone initiation is mechanistically coherent and clinically concerning [^a2885d63] [^30540808] [^18efbe73] [^7b9945b1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the hormone profile against expected patterns. The prolactin of 14 ng/mL is actually normal for most laboratories, which at first glance seems to argue against risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia. But wait, I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting a single value, because risperidone can still cause menstrual irregularities via hypothalamic effects even when prolactin is not markedly elevated, and adolescents may show clinical effects at lower thresholds. Importantly, the FSH and LH are low-normal rather than high, which argues against primary ovarian insufficiency, and the progesterone of 0.9 ng/mL indicates no luteal activity, consistent with anovulation rather than a luteal-phase defect [^b5205e3b] [^6fe54d18] [^8cd622a1] [^cdc233ed].

> I will now examine the differential systematically. Primary ovarian insufficiency would typically show elevated gonadotropins with low estradiol, which we do not see here, making POI unlikely. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea remains possible given stress and body image concerns, but the timing with risperidone and the absence of low gonadotropins make that less compelling as the primary driver. PCOS is a consideration given irregular menses and mild elevation in testosterone, but the BMI is only borderline and there is no clear biochemical hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovarian morphology on exam, so PCOS is possible but not definitive. Uterine leiomyomas are exceedingly rare in adolescents and would not explain the hormonal pattern, so they are unlikely. Thus, medication effect remains the most parsimonious explanation despite the normal prolactin, especially given risperidone's known impact on the HPO axis and the temporal relationship [^8cd622a1] [^6fe54d18] [^4cfb3a76] [^957e963c].

> But wait, what if the normal prolactin is misleading? I should confirm that drug-induced menstrual disturbance can occur without frank hyperprolactinemia. Indeed, antipsychotics can alter hypothalamic regulation and cause anovulation even when prolactin is not dramatically elevated, and adolescents may manifest clinical effects at lower prolactin levels. Given the clear temporal onset after risperidone and the exclusion of other major etiologies, a medication adverse effect remains the most likely diagnosis despite the normal prolactin value [^6fe54d18] [^7b9945b1] [^18efbe73].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps and management implications. I need to check for galactorrhea on exam, repeat prolactin to ensure stability, assess thyroid function, and consider a pelvic ultrasound if symptoms persist or to evaluate endometrial thickness. Management should include discussing the reproductive risks of continued risperidone, considering switching to a prolactin-sparing agent such as aripiprazole if clinically feasible, and monitoring for bone health given hypoestrogenism risk with chronic anovulation. If medication adjustment is not possible, short-term cyclic progestin therapy can be used to induce withdrawal bleeding and protect the endometrium while the underlying cause is addressed [^18e81a57] [^e0d430fd] [^ac63c7d8] [^d08b14e5].

> Final answer: D. Adverse effect of medication. Risperidone is the most likely cause of secondary amenorrhea here, mediated by hypothalamic-pituitary effects that can suppress ovulation even when prolactin is not markedly elevated, with the timing and exclusion of alternative etiologies supporting this conclusion [^6fe54d18] [^30540808] [^18efbe73].

---

The most likely cause of this adolescent's secondary amenorrhea is **risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia** [^a2885d63], which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and causes anovulation and amenorrhea [^3b916120]. Although her prolactin is 14 ng/mL (within some labs' "normal"), risperidone commonly causes **prolactin-related menstrual disturbances** even at modest elevations, and adolescents are especially vulnerable [^7b9945b1] [^50f1d5c4]. The normal FSH/LH and low progesterone exclude primary ovarian insufficiency and support anovulation from medication effects [^8cd622a1]. Uterine leiomyomas are rare in adolescents and not supported by the exam. The best next step is to **repeat prolactin**, check TSH, and consider switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic if symptoms persist [^18e81a57] [^ac63c7d8].

## Analysis of hormonal profile

| **Hormone** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Prolactin | 14 ng/mL | < 20 ng/mL | Mild elevation; risperidone-associated |
| FSH | 5 mIU/mL | 2–10 mIU/mL | Normal |
| LH | 5.2 mIU/mL | 2–10 mIU/mL | Normal |
| Progesterone | 0.9 ng/mL | Follicular < 3 ng/mL; luteal > 3–5 ng/mL | Low; indicates anovulation |
| Testosterone | 2.7 nmol/L | < 3.5 nmol/L | Normal |

---

The normal FSH and LH **exclude primary ovarian insufficiency** [^8cd622a1], and the low progesterone confirms anovulation [^cdc233ed]. The mild prolactin elevation, while not frankly high, is clinically significant in the context of risperidone use [^a2885d63].

---

## Mechanism of risperidone-induced amenorrhea

Risperidone blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the hypothalamus, removing inhibition of pituitary lactotrophs and **raising prolactin** [^a2885d63]. Elevated prolactin suppresses GnRH, lowers LH/FSH, and causes anovulation and amenorrhea [^3b916120]. Adolescents are especially susceptible to these effects [^7b9945b1].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting risperidone-induced menstrual disturbances

Multiple studies and guidelines document risperidone-associated menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea, even with modest prolactin rises [^a2885d63] [^50f1d5c4]. The Endocrine Society notes antipsychotics, including risperidone, are a **common cause of drug-induced hyperprolactinemia** and menstrual dysfunction [^a2885d63].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other causes

- **Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)**: Excluded by normal FSH/LH and age [^8cd622a1].
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Less likely without biochemical/clinical hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries [^a91b3326].
- **Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Possible, but risperidone effect is more parsimonious [^6fe54d18].
- **Uterine leiomyomas**: Rare in adolescents and not supported by exam [^notfound].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Repeat prolactin**: Confirm persistence and assess trend [^bd04b4c6].
- **Check TSH**: Rule out thyroid disease as a contributor [^e0d430fd].
- **Consider switching antipsychotic**: Aripiprazole or quetiapine are prolactin-sparing options [^ac63c7d8].
- **Monitor menstrual recovery**: After medication change, cycles often normalize within months [^a12f85fa].

---

The most likely cause is **risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia** leading to anovulation and amenorrhea, despite a prolactin of 14 ng/mL, because risperidone commonly causes menstrual disturbances even with modest prolactin elevations, especially in adolescents [^a2885d63] [^7b9945b1].

Treating women with bipolar disorder during the reproductive years requires special consideration because of the reproductive risks associated with specific psychotropic drugs and drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives. Some psychotropic drugs can disrupt the menstrual cycle, alter pregnancy potential, and increase the risk for chronic conditions associated with hormone changes, such as prolactin elevation and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Valproate has been associated with an increased risk of PCOS features. Typical antipsychotics and risperidone can increase prolactin production, which may also disrupt the menstrual cycle. When the menstrual cycle is altered, fertility is reduced, and medical conditions such as osteoporosis and endometrial hyperplasia can result. This article advises establishing the regularity of menstrual cycles and discussing the potential reproductive impact of specific psychotropic medications before initiating treatment in women with bipolar disorder who are of reproductive age.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — psychiatric comorbidity and medication confounders are emphasized as follows: In the case of a DSM-5 diagnosis, we recommend referral to appropriate psychiatric care. It is important to recognize that medications such as antipsychotics, certain antidepressants, contraceptive agents, and opioids commonly alter menses and we should not confuse the consequent amenorrhea or irregular menses with FHA; in a study of 50 patients on antipsychotic medications, 90% reported eumenorrhea prior to the initiation of their treatment, whereas 54% and 12% reported menstrual abnormalities and amenorrhea, respectively, during antipsychotic usage.

Amenorrhea evaluation — prolactin and macroprolactin: Circulating levels in the range of 15–20 ng/mL will exclude hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea, and macroprolactinemia (molecular weight > 100 kDa) must be considered as a mechanism for persistently elevated prolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly MRI imaging, and because macroprolactin is biologically inert, macroprolactinemia is unlikely to be a cause of secondary amenorrhea.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — lifestyle, diet, energy availability, and medications in history: Clinicians should ask patients about recent exercise and dietary habits (and potential changes therein), including a history of binging and purging, current or recent weight changes, and stressors, and clinicians should also consider energy availability, which is defined as the energy remaining for normal body functioning after subtracting exercise energy expenditure from the energy ingested; there is no clear exercise threshold that leads to an energy deficit and eventual amenorrhea, and medications, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, contraceptive agents, and opioids, can alter menses, while chronic illicit drug use is often a marker of stress and undernutrition, and conditions associated with inappropriate HPA axis activation can suppress GnRH drive and might require management with medication.

Secondary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes first excluding pregnancy and then using a stepwise workup: The possibility of pregnancy must be at the forefront of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea, and once pregnancy has been ruled out, a stepwise approach to evaluation is recommended, as outlined in Figure 2; in contrast to primary amenorrhea, the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone is less; a thorough history and reproductive hormone profile constitute the backbone of diagnostic evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound, if accessible and available, can help streamline evaluation early in the process; in many cases, only a few of the tests listed in Figure 2 are necessary, and the temporal pattern of menses since the onset of menarche is informative.

### Amenorrhea: a systematic approach to diagnosis and management [^59506ca4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Menstrual patterns can be an indicator of overall health and self-perception of well-being. Primary amenorrhea, defined as the lifelong absence of menses, requires evaluation if menarche has not occurred by 15 years of age or three years post-thelarche. Secondary amenorrhea is characterized by cessation of previously regular menses for three months or previously irregular menses for six months and warrants evaluation. Clinicians may consider etiologies of amenorrhea categorically as outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. The history should include menstrual onset and patterns, eating and exercise habits, presence of psychosocial stressors, body weight changes, medication use, galactorrhea, and chronic illness. Additional questions may target neurologic, vasomotor, hyperandrogenic, or thyroid-related symptoms. The physical examination should identify anthropometric and pubertal development trends. All patients should be offered a pregnancy test and assessment of serum follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Additional testing, including karyotyping, serum androgen evaluation, and pelvic or brain imaging, should be individualized. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovary function and may require hormone replacement therapy, contraception, or infertility services. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may indicate disordered eating and low bone density. Treatment should address the underlying cause. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should undergo screening and intervention to attenuate metabolic disease and endometrial cancer risk. Amenorrhea can be associated with clinically challenging pathology and may require lifelong treatment. Patients will benefit from ample time with the clinician, sensitivity, and emotional support.

### Menstrual management for adolescents with disabilities [^7af3ec9e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Puberty and menstrual characteristics in adolescents with disabilities — scope and contributors: Disabilities in children are common, with 2.8 million or 5.2% of US children and adolescents 5 through 17 years of age affected in 2010. Approximately 3% of the general population has a significant intellectual disability, and 1.2 million of those affected are teenagers with varying levels of cognitive abilities (80% have mild disability, 12% have moderate disability, and 8% have severe intellectual disabilities). All teenagers may have irregular cycles initially, but by the third year after menarche, 60% to 80% of girls have cycles from 21 to 34 days long, consistent with those of adults. However, there are some circumstances that can cause teenagers with disabilities to have more menstrual irregularities related to medical comorbidities and medication adverse effects, including medications that affect the dopaminergic system causing high prolactin concentrations with subsequent anovulation and amenorrhea; anovulation is more common in adolescents with obesity and in teenagers with seizure disorders and polycystic ovary syndrome, and valproic acid can cause hormonal aberrations like those in polycystic ovary syndrome; and medications that can cause elevated prolactin concentrations include risperidone, phenothiazines, amitriptyline, cimetidine, prostaglandins, methyldopa, benzodiazepines, haloperidol, cocaine, and metoclopramide. Premenarcheal suppression is not recommended for most teenagers with intellectual disabilities, and precocious puberty should be addressed in the usual manner. Irregular bleeding can prompt medical intervention, especially in teenagers with intellectual and physical disabilities, and the impact of menses ranges from inability to attend school because of heavy menses and inadequate assistance to severe pre- and perimenstrual behavioral changes prohibiting normal activities and causing additional management challenges.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^f9f3088b]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — initial differential and physical findings: When new onset secondary amenorrhea follows previously predictable menses, disorders of mental and metabolic wellness and exogenous exposures should be considered; with hyperandrogenism symptoms, PCOS is an obvious consideration, and when the duration of symptoms is short and deterioration is rapid, androgen-secreting tumors must be ruled out. Anatomical causes must be considered when cessation of menses follows uterine instrumentation such as surgical termination of pregnancy, dilatation and curettage for retained products of conception or placenta, hysteroscopic resection of submucous myoma, endometrial ablation, or pelvic vessel embolization. History of postpartum hemorrhage suggests Sheehan syndrome as a mechanism, and infectious endometrial scarring (such as genital tuberculosis) merits vigilance in select populations. If blood pressure is elevated, purple striae and a dorsal cervical fat pad should be looked for and Cushing syndrome or disease be considered; galactorrhea would point toward hyperprolactinemia. Evidence of central adiposity and acanthosis nigricans should prompt consideration for insulin resistance as a mechanism for a PCOS-like phenotype and for HPO dysfunction.

### Amenorrhea: an approach to diagnosis and management [^fd1d765a]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea may result from a number of different conditions, a systematic evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment of selected serum hormone levels can usually identify the underlying cause. Primary amenorrhea, which by definition is failure to reach menarche, is often the result of chromosomal irregularities leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (e.g. Turner syndrome) or anatomic abnormalities (e.g. Müllerian agenesis). Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for three months or the cessation of irregular menses for six months. Most cases of secondary amenorrhea can be attributed to polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic amenorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, or primary ovarian insufficiency. Pregnancy should be excluded in all cases. Initial workup of primary and secondary amenorrhea includes a pregnancy test and serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients with primary ovarian insufficiency can maintain unpredictable ovarian function and should not be presumed infertile. Patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea should be evaluated for eating disorders and are at risk for decreased bone density. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are at risk for glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and other aspects of metabolic syndrome. Patients with Turner syndrome (or variant) should be treated by a physician familiar with the appropriate screening and treatment measures. Treatment goals for patients with amenorrhea may vary considerably, and depend on the patient and the specific diagnosis.

### Neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea – an update [^51088891]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Secondary amenorrhea — the absence of menses for three consecutive cycles — affects approximately 3–4% of reproductive age women, and infertility — the failure to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse — affects approximately 6–10%. Neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea and infertility, including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and hyperprolactinemia, constitute a majority of these cases.

Objective

In this review, we discuss the physiologic, pathologic, and iatrogenic causes of amenorrhea and infertility arising from perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, including potential genetic causes. We focus extensively on the hormonal mechanisms involved in disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

Conclusions

A thorough understanding of the neuroendocrine causes of amenorrhea and infertility is critical for properly assessing patients presenting with these complaints. Prompt evaluation and treatment are essential to prevent loss of bone mass due to hypoestrogenemia and/or to achieve the time-sensitive treatment goal of conception.

### Effect of hyperprolactinemia during development in children and adolescents [^a12f85fa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Increased levels of prolactin associated with some antipsychotic treatment can potentially lead to serious adverse events including gynecomastia, galactorrhea, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, and pituitary tumors. Clinicians may need to employ pharmacotherapeutic interventions such as reducing dosage, switching antipsychotics, or prescribing adjunctive agents to minimize or prevent these negative side effects and improve patients' outcomes.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^df30af45]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — conclusions and diagnostic approach emphasize that estrogen plus progestin may be a better strategy to differentiate hypoestrogenemia-related amenorrhea from endometrial scarring, noting that both false positive and negative progestin withdrawal tests (PWT) can occur and that other approaches may yield a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Most cases of primary and secondary amenorrhea are similar, and most causes are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. Initial assessment highlights that history, physical examination, and estimation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol will identify the most common causes; most patients presenting with amenorrhea should undergo measurements of serum prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and pregnancy should be excluded. For primary amenorrhea, physical examination and measurement of gonadotropins are key, and the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone may be less for secondary compared with primary amenorrhea.

### Use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women: a committee opinion [^a64ffddb]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism — clinical features and management include laboratory patterns, causes, and treatment principles. Endogenous circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations are in the low or low-normal range in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, which usually results from very low or absent hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, though pituitary disorders can lead to a similar clinical presentation; disorders of endogenous GnRH secretion can be congenital, acquired, or idiopathic and lead to pituitary deficiency. Conditions such as anorexia nervosa, excessive chronic physical exercise, low body mass index, poor nutritional status, and severe emotional stress can result in hypothalamic amenorrhea, and medications may also disturb the release of GnRH and gonadotropins; hyperprolactinemia can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea. Dopamine agonist treatment will restore ovulation in most women with hyperprolactinemia, and behavioral modifications may be appropriate first-line treatment for many secondary causes of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea are unlikely to respond to oral agents such as clomiphene citrate and letrozole, and treatment of hypothalamic amenorrhea should include gonadotropin preparations with both FSH and LH activity to effectively stimulate steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^cdc233ed]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Secondary amenorrhea — laboratory testing and hormone interpretation: Pregnancy as a mechanism for secondary amenorrhea must be the first consideration, and false negative urinary pregnancy tests are plausible; checking blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin may be preferred in appropriate clinical settings. In normo-ovulatory women, serum E2 levels fluctuate from early follicular phase values often in the range of 30–50 pg/mL to peak preovulatory levels in the range of 150–300 pg/mL, whereas in FHA circulating E2 is more in the menopausal range (< 30 pg/mL) with gonadotropins in the normal to low normal range; LH is often disproportionately lower than FSH in FHA, while disproportionately elevated LH relative to FSH is not uncommonly encountered in PCOS. For ovarian reserve markers, disproportionately elevated AMH is commonly encountered in PCOS, whereas undetectable AMH is consistent with decreased ovarian reserve and is observed in POI; such markers may be useful but are frequently not necessary and should be interpreted with caution. Hyperprolactinemia is a recognized mechanism, and checking prolactin levels must be included in the initial workup of not just of secondary amenorrhea.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^4b3fea5b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) overlap warrants vigilance for evolving features and careful monitoring: Clinicians should pay close attention to concerns about weight and appearance (including signs of hyperandrogenism) in the patient's history, and compared with women with FHA, those with FHA and underlying PCOS had higher BMI, BMD, LH and testosterone concentrations, and incidence of hyperandrogenism, with increased hyperandrogenism and irregular menses with weight gain. Recovered FHA patients with underlying PCOS may never resume regular menses and may develop other phenotypic characteristics of PCOS, though they seem to be at similar risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis; these patients are also hyperresponsive to exogenous gonadotropins when treated for infertility and need to be monitored carefully. FHA and PCOS may coexist, and as patients recover from FHA, manifestations of PCOS may emerge, including irregular menses.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^ffad79f4]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly prevalent and debilitating severe mental illnesses worldwide. Patients often experience both simultaneously because they share a similar causative process of diagnoses.

Risperidone is a leading second-generation antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents and for the short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. It is indexed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines. However, the manufacturers 'Johnson & Johnson' have been involved in over 13,500 legal (lawsuit) cases because of their failure to disclose that Risperidone may cause hormonal imbalances that could lead to breast tissue development ('gynecomastia') and increased blood prolactin levels ('galactorrhoea hyperprolactinaemia') in boys and girls. There have also been 'black box warnings' of misleading marketing of the drug for off label uses in children and adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and in elderly patients with dementia. Moreover, the clinical benefit of Risperidone is questionable when compared to other antipsychotics and was recently found to be only the sixth best treatment option for overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.

Paliperidone is another second-generation antipsychotic drug also manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and used to treat schizophrenia. As both Risperidone and Paliperidone act via the same pathways in the body, research have suggested strong links of drug-induced hormonal imbalances in both antipsychotics, and like Risperidone, the efficacy of Paliperidone over other antipsychotics is also questionable. Other serious adverse events experienced by patients with severe mental illnesses receiving either Risperidone or Paliperidone include muscle-related 'extrapyramidal effects'; permanent movement disorders such as 'tardive dyskinesia'; cerebrovascular events including stroke, transient ischaemic attack, vascular malformation and venous thromboembolism; and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, increased risk of suicide and weight gain. However, these harms are rarely reported exhaustively in journal publications.

The existing evidence that support policy on both antipsychotic drugs is solely based on aggregate data meta-analyses of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving mostly adults. Analyses of more exhaustive forms of unpublished data including individual participant data (IPD) and clinical study reports (CSRs) are increasingly recommended for evaluating the full evidence base for the effectiveness and safety of these drugs. Such analyses can create clear hierarchies of evidence about the benefit and harms of both interventions, taking into account reporting bias, and have the potential to better inform policy decisions.

### Female puberty: clinical implications for the use of prolactin-modulating psychotropics [^7b9945b1]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

During puberty, girls may present with psychiatric illness necessitating treatment with psychotropic medications. Pubertal girls are especially vulnerable to medication-associated adverse events. Atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have the potential to elevate prolactin levels, altering pubertal progression. Selection of prolactin-sparing atypical antipsychotics is recommended, as is treatment with the lowest effective dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Monitoring of serum prolactin levels may be necessary.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescents: ACOG management… [^58d9737e]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- One in five adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding has an underlying bleeding disorder.
- In hemodynamically stable adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding, most bleeding can be stopped with high-dose estrogen oral contraceptives taken every six to eight hours, tranexamic acid, or high-dose progesterone. Acute Management Hormonal therapy with intravenous conjugated equine estrogen, 25 mg every four to six hours, or monophasic combined oral contraceptives, 30 to 50 mcg of an ethinyl estradiol formulation every six to eight hours, may be used until bleeding has stopped. A combined oral contraceptive tapering regimen should begin after bleeding has stopped, usually within 24 to 48 hours. Nausea and vomiting are common with high-dose estrogen therapy and can be exacerbated by oral iron therapy.

Adolescents who do not tolerate estrogens can be treated with progesterone-only therapy of oral medroxyprogesterone, 10 to 20 mg every six to 12 hours, or norethindrone, 5 to 10 mg every six hours. Depot medroxy progesterone is not a first-line therapy because of difficulties with titration and discontinuation. Long-Term Management A combination of hormonal and nonhormonal therapies may be necessary to control heavy menstrual bleeding in adolescent girls with bleeding disorders. Effective options include combined oral contraceptives with higher estrogen levels, the transdermal contraceptive patch, the vaginal contraceptive ring, and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, all of which can be used continuously with minimal or no withdrawal periods. Breakthrough bleeding is best treated by doubling the dosage of the combined oral contraceptive.

For adolescents unable to tolerate estrogen-containing therapy, progestin therapy such as norethindrone, 5 to 15 mg per day, can be used for menstrual suppression. Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, such as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, are another choice for adolescents. Only the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device has been studied in women with bleeding disorders, with limited data in adolescents. Oral iron supplementation and dietary counseling are first-line therapies for treating iron deficiency anemia. Limited research supports higher effectiveness with dosing every other day due to improved absorption.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^121f9c3b]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our most notable finding was the inconsistencies in the reporting of harms between CSRs and journal publications. CSRs provided over double the number of AEs, and almost eight times more SAEs showing a significant increase in the relative differences favouring CSRs. The effect estimates from CSRs which involved more patients and studies, revealed an increased risk in the number of AEs and elevated risks for other harms such as 'extrapyramidal disorder', 'tardive dyskinesia' and 'weight increased'.

Limited outcome data were available for 'gynecomastia' and 'cerebrovascular events'. As these are very rare events with considerable delayed onset in younger children, it's likely that they are not well documented in these short-term randomised trials of only 63 days follow-up. Therefore, we recommend that both antipsychotics are administered with caution to children and adolescents until more solid evidence about the risks of hormonal imbalances and infertility is available from trials with long term follow-up data.

The combination of IPD and the corresponding CSR are the most comprehensive and trustworthy source of Johnson & Johnson trial evidence available to date. However, a significant limitation of this study is that we were unable to access all company data and CSRs for 22 further eligible trials, which meant that this review was not entirely systematic and may be subject to selection bias. We made several requests for CSRs for Paliperidone trials at the European Medicines Agency, but one ongoing court case meant that they were unable to provide access to the CSR for seven further trials. Thus, to alleviate the potential for selection bias, we inspected the 22 studies and found that 15 of the studies did not appear to report any of the relevant adverse event's data or provide the overall number of adverse events, and the other 7 studies did not provide amendable 'arm-level' data for inclusion in meta-analysis. Furthermore, the baseline scores for the primary outcome PANSS were measured using only one of the subscales in 13 of the studies and therefore the total PANSS score could not be estimated; the other 9 studies did not provide amenable PANSS data meaning they could not be meta-analysed with the IPD.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^e46fb782]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Causes of amenorrhea — prevalence and principal etiologies — The prevalence of amenorrhea not due to pregnancy, lactation, or menopause is approximately 3%–4%. Normal menstrual function requires four components (hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovaries, and genital outflow tract), and most cases are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. In specialized referral centers, approximately 5–20 patients per year were seen with primary amenorrhea annually. Amenorrhea may also occur with sexual ambiguity or virilization, and sexual ambiguity or virilization should be evaluated as separate disorders.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^98347112]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are a number of other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of antipsychotics; markedly raised levels are less common. Higher levels of prolactin result from longer exposure to higher doses, especially with older antipsychotics or with risperidone, sulpiride or amisulpride. Galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia, menstrual abnormalities and sexual dysfunction including hypogonadism and fertility problems are consequences of raised prolactin, and in the longer-term bone demineralisation. Younger patients may be more susceptible to hyperprolactinaemia. Trial reports often fail to state the frequency of raised levels.

### Antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinaemia: a series of illustrative case reports [^acae348c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side-effect of many antipsychotic drugs but, in comparison to extrapyramidal side-effects, it has received little attention. Four case reports are presented which illustrate important clinical and pharmacological aspects of the syndrome. Two of the cases were caused by conventional antipsychotic drugs and two by risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic. Symptoms included gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea and sexual dysfunction. Three patients were switched to a prolactin sparing antipsychotic leading to normalization of serum prolactin and resolution of the symptoms. Patients prescribed prolactin elevating antipsychotics should, where possible, have this issue explained to them prior to commencing treatment and be screened for symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinaemia before starting treatment and regularly thereafter.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e7820123]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — ovulation induction and body weight thresholds: We suggest that clinicians should only induce ovulation in women with FHA that have a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m2 and only after attempts to normalize energy balance, due to the increased risk for fetal loss, small-for-gestational-age babies, preterm labor, and delivery by Cesarean section for extreme low weight. A BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 is the weight threshold under which we consider an adult woman very underweight and possibly malnourished. Supporting data include a case control study that associated a BMI of < 20 kg/m2 with a fourfold higher likelihood of preterm labor (odds ratio, 3.96; 95% confidence interval, 2.61–7.09) and an association of undernutrition with lower birth weight (3233 g compared with 3516 g for normal controls). Therefore, clinicians should limit ovulation induction to women of satisfactory body weight.

### Menstrual disorders in the adolescent: amenorrhea… [^c67aba54]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The menstrual history is an integral part of the evaluation of the adolescent femaie. Abnormal menstrual flow or timing may be the first sign of systemic illness or sexually transmitted disease. Amenorrhea may signal an endocrine or genetic disorder or may suggest structural abnormalities of the genital tract. Most importantly, any abnormality in menstruation should alert the clinician to the possibility of pregnancy. Normal Menstrual Cycle The average age of menarche in the United States is 12. 8 years and ranges from 9 to 16 years. Menarche usually occurs 2 to 2. 5 years after breast budding and 1 year after the growth spurt. Consequently, the absence of menarche at 15 years of age may be normal in an adolescent who just passed her growth spurt but abnormal in an adolescent who completed puberty 2 years earlier. Most early menstrual cycles are anovulatory. As a result, menses in the young adolescent often are irregular and may be prolonged or heavy.

Dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms tend to accompany ovulatory cycles and, therefore, are more common in the older adolescent. Regular ovulatory cycles usually are established within 1 to 2 years of menarche. Although normal cycle length ranges from 21 to 45 days, the length for a given individual is fairly constant.

### Challenges in diagnosis, treatment and coordination of care of menstrual psychosis [^8caf278f]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We present a suspected case of menstrual psychosis in an adolescent to highlight the unique attributes of this rare condition. An early adolescent female began displaying episodes of aggression, irritability, insomnia, hallucinations and disorganisation at menarche. Subsequent episodes resulted in multiple inpatient psychiatric hospital admissions coinciding with her menstrual cycle. Management from both psychiatry and gynaecology of her episodes, and abnormal hormone levels, was challenging. This report emphasises the importance of coordination between specialties, navigating diagnostic challenges and weighing the risk versus benefit of long-term neuroleptic use.

### Approach to the patient: diagnostic challenges in the workup for polycystic ovary syndrome [^a91b3326]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Case 1

Patient 1, a 17-year-old high school student, was referred by her general practitioner due to primary amenorrhea. She had breast development at the age of 12, pubic and axillary hair at age 12, and experienced a growth spurt at the age of 13. Her older sister and mother had menarche aged 14. She had never taken any hormonal medication and had never been sexually active. There were some significant stressors over the last 2 years with her family situation and she was currently in the final year of high school with significant associated pressure and stress. She had no acne, had mild hirsutism, which was probably in keeping with her Sri Lankan heritage. Her weight was 85.6 kg, with a height of 166 cm, giving a BMI of 31.1 kg/m². Her breast and pubic hair were both Tanner stage 4. They were no stigmata suggestive of Cushing syndrome. Total testosterone, measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was 1.1 nmol/L (reference range, < 1.8 nmol/L), with a SHBG level of 11 nmol/L (reference range, 25–150 nmol/L) and calculated free testosterone of 33 pmol/L (reference range, 1–34 pmol/L). In excluding secondary causes, her prolactin, thyroid function, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels were normal. Her karyotype was 46 X, X. The FSH level was 4.9 IU/L (reference range, 2–10 IU/L), LH was 2.0 IU/L (reference range, 2–10 IU/L), estradiol (by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) 59 pmol/L (reference range, 10–900 pmol/L), and the remaining pituitary panel was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary revealed a normal pituitary gland. Given the primary amenorrhea, a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound was performed, revealing a small uterus measuring 44 × 13 × 23 mm (the average dimensions of the uterus in an nulliparous adult female are 6–8.5 cm long, 3–5 cm wide, and 2–4 cm deep), with a uterine body to cervix ratio approximately 1.5:1, normal myometrium, and thin endometrium with combined thickness of 1.2 mm (2–16 mm depending of stage of menstrual cycle in a premenopausal female). The ovaries were small, with the right ovary measuring 24 mm × 13 mm × 18 mm (volume 3.0 cc) and containing at least 5 small follicles and the left ovary measuring 18 mm × 14 mm × 17 mm (volume 2.2 cc) and containing 5 small follicles. A provisional diagnosis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea was made and Estradot 25 mcg patch was commenced with the plan to increase the estrogen dose and add in progesterone after the first breakthrough bleed. If the patient's secondary sexual characteristics were not as well developed, a lower dose of transdermal estrogen would have been commenced. The patient currently does not require contraception. The differential diagnosis here is polycystic ovary syndrome. In adolescents, PCOM is not recommended for PCOS diagnosis within 8 years of menarche given the overlap with normal developmental physiology. A diagnosis of PCOS was unable to be made at this stage on the basis of primary amenorrhea alone, in the absence of biochemical hyperandrogenism and convincing clinical hyperandrogenism. This patient should be considered at an "increased risk" of PCOS and reassessment should be considered at full reproductive maturity, 8 years post menarche. The management of adolescents at risk of PCOS is similar to adult women with a clear PCOS diagnosis. For this patient, her HbA1c was 5.9% and she was commenced on metformin and referred to a dietitian for lifestyle advice. In addition, she began a course of intensive psychotherapy with a psychologist.

### Gynecologic and reproductive health concerns of adolescents using selected psychotropic medications [^b13ecaa5]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders are common in adolescent girls and may require chronic therapies with psychotropic medications. Antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers have been increasingly prescribed to and widely used by adolescents for a variety of both "on" an "off" label indications. Studies on the safety and monitoring of these medications in adolescent girls have shown important potential for gynecologic and reproductive adverse effects. The objective of this article is to review the mechanisms for and management of menstrual disorders mediated by hyperprolactinemia associated with antipsychotic medications, hypothyroidism associated with lithium and quetiapine, and the independent association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in girls using valproic acid. Beyond their susceptibility to these disruptions in the menstrual cycle, adolescent girls with psychiatric illness also have increased sexual risk behaviors. These behaviors makes it all the more important to review teratogenicity and clinically relevant contraceptive drug interactions in adolescent girls using these psychotropic medications.

Prolactin-related adverse events

Prolactin-related adverse events were sparsely reported (see Table 3). Three RCTs reported overall prolactin-related adverse events, gynecomastia/galactorrhea, and amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea in patients treated with varying doses of aripiprazole and risperidone. In two studies, which assessed aripiprazole and risperidone, no cases of prolactin-related adverse events were reported. A study comparing doses of risperidone of 1.5–6 mg/day and 0.15–0.6 mg/day reported seven events (5.6% of study patients) and two events (1.5%), respectively. Specifically, investigators reported three (2.4%) and two (1.5%) cases of gynecomastia/galactorrhea in the risperidone 1.5–6 mg/day and risperidone 0.15–0.6 mg/day arms, respectively, as well as a single case (1.7% of female patients) of amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea in the risperidone 1.5–6 mg/day arm.

### Olanzapine pamoate (Zyprexa) [^d2d9beb6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47% of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 7% of placebo-treated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events1(1% [2/168] of females), sexual function-related events2(0.7% [3/454] of females and males), and breast-related events3(2% [3/168] of females, 2% [7/286] of males) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

2Based on a search of the following terms: anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction.

3Based on a search of the following terms: breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder.

Dose group differences with respect to prolactin elevation have been observed in some studies. In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study with ZYPREXA RELPREVV, statistically significant differences among dose groups were observed for prolactin levels, with a mean baseline-to-endpoint increase observed in the highest dose group (300 mg/2 weeks, n = 115: 3.57 ng/mL) relative to mean decreases in the lower dose groups (150 mg/2 weeks, n = 109: -5.61 ng/mL; 405 mg/4 weeks, n = 259: -2.76 ng/mL). In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N = 199), 20 (N = 200) and 40 (N = 200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, incidence of prolactin elevation > 24.2 ng/mL (female) or > 18.77 ng/mL (male) at any time during the trial (10 mg/day: 31.2%; 20 mg/day: 42.7%; 40 mg/day: 61.1%) indicated significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day and 20 vs 40 mg/day.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^4b5b9ae1]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Children and Adolescents — In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, olanzapine and fluoxetine was associated with a statistically significant greater mean change from baseline in prolactin levels compared to placebo (8.7 mcg/L vs 0.7 mcg/L, respectively). Although prolactin concentrations were very commonly (> 10%) elevated above normal in both the olanzapine and fluoxetine and placebo groups, more than twice as many olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients were seen with these elevations compared to placebo-treated patients. Five patients experienced an adverse event potentially associated with elevated prolactin; these events included dysmenorrhea, galactorrhea, and ovulation disorder.

The magnitude and frequency of change in prolactin in children and adolescents was larger than observed in adult patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine, but was similar to that observed in adolescents treated with olanzapine monotherapy.

Olanzapine Monotherapy

In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events1(2% [49/3240] of females), sexual function-related events2(2% [150/8136] of females and males), and breast-related events3(0.7% [23/3240] of females, 0.2% [9/4896] of males).

Children and Adolescents — In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with a statistically significant greater mean change from baseline in prolactin levels compared to placebo (8.7 mcg/L vs 0.7 mcg/L, respectively). Although prolactin concentrations were very commonly (> 10%) elevated above normal in both the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and placebo groups, more than twice as many olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients were seen with these elevations compared to placebo-treated patients. Five patients experienced an adverse event potentially associated with elevated prolactin; these events included dysmenorrhea, galactorrhea, and ovulation disorder.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^d5837afd]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Pituitary imaging and treatment in hyperprolactinemia — in women with hyperprolactinemia, the prevalence of a pituitary tumor is 50%–60%, the likelihood of a pituitary tumor is unrelated to the level of prolactin and only 16% of the variability in tumor size is associated with prolactin level (r = 0.40, P < .001), therefore an MRI should be performed whenever prolactin levels are persistently elevated; in most amenorrheic women with hyperprolactinemia, prolactin levels do not decline without treatment and amenorrhea does not resolve as long as the prolactin levels remain elevated, and in the absence of another organic condition, dopamine agonists are the preferred treatment of hyperprolactinemia with or without a pituitary tumor.

### Prolactin-related adverse events and change in prolactin levels in pediatric patients given antipsychotics for schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^f6cb2c3b]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Outcomes

Outcomes were typically reported after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment. Prolactin-related adverse events were reported in three studies; two reporting on patient experience with varying levels of risperidone and one with quetiapine 200–800 mg daily. Pandina et al. (2012) reported 36 (9%) prolactin-related adverse events, 14 cases (3.6%) of gynecomastia/galactorrhea, 3 cases (1.0%) of amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea, and a single case (< 0.5%) of impotence or decreased libido across study arms. These adverse events were not reported by treatment arm, which differed with regards to prior treatment experience and treatment duration. In a study of patients treated biweekly with 25–50 mg of risperidone for 24 weeks, 5 cases (16%) of prolactin-related adverse events, comprising 2 cases (6.5%) of gynecomastia/galactorrhea and 3 cases (9.7%) of amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea, were reported. A single study assessing quetiapine reported 3 cases (5.4%) of gynecomastia/galactorrhea, 4 cases (7.1%) of amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea, and 9 cases (16.1%) of impotence or decreased libido.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^3e3acba6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most, but certainly not all, ovulatory disorders are suggested by the presence of symptoms of AUB, ranging from complete absence (amenorrhea) to infrequent or irregular onset of menstrual blood flow. Secondary amenorrhea is generally defined as the cessation of menstruation for 6 months consecutively after at least one previous spontaneous menstrual bleed. Using data from extensive epidemiological studies, FIGO has previously determined that for those aged 18–45 years, and using the 5%–95% percentiles from large‐scale population studies, the normal frequency of menses is 24–38 days. Those with a cycle length of fewer than 24 days are deemed "frequent" while those whose cycle length is more than 38 days "infrequent", a term designed to replace oligomenorrhea. Even in this category, regularity varies by age; for those aged either 18–25 or 42–45 years, the difference between the shortest and longest cycle should be 9 days or less, while for those aged 26–41 years, it is 7 days or less. Regardless, those with infrequent or irregular menstrual bleeding should be considered to have an ovulatory disorder.

Diagnosing the presence of an ovulatory disorder at the extremes of reproductive age can be challenging, depending on the perception of what is normal. For postmenarcheal girls aged under 18 years, infrequent menstrual bleeding or irregular menstrual cycles suggesting ovulatory dysfunction are common, with available evidence suggesting that the individual's "normal" cycle length may not be established until the sixth year after menarche. During this pubertal transition, ovulatory dysfunction impacts about 50% of adolescent girls in the first year after menarche with a cycle length that is typically in the range of 21–45 days, but sometimes is as short as 20 days or may even exceed 60 days. In the years after menarche, these variations change such that 6 years later, the range is similar to those of adults. These issues can be explored in detail elsewhere. However, it should be remembered that while common, and even "normal", the individual's experience with this transition can be disruptive at a vulnerable time in their social, psychological, and physical development.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^1cedd799]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Etonogestrel implant — amenorrhea rates, duration limits, and adjunctive strategies: The etonogestrel 68-mg implant is associated with high rates of menstrual cycle irregularity and is FDA-approved for 3 years and can be continued for up to 5 years for contraception, although data are lacking on extended use in people with obesity (BMI higher than 30) and current data do not show a decrease in contraceptive efficacy. If the goal is menstrual suppression, use past 3 years may not be effective; data show that approximately 22% of individuals achieve amenorrhea with the progestin-only implant, breakthrough bleeding and spotting are common, and in clinical practice add-back therapy with continuous OCPs or norethindrone acetate has been used to achieve menstrual suppression in some patients.

### Update in hyper-and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea [^4af71531]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Amenorrhea is a relatively common condition that is present in up to 5% of adult women at any time. The clinical significance of a lack of regular menstrual cycles extends beyond reproductive concerns. Episodes of amenorrhea as short as 90 d may have implications for bone and cardiovascular health. Prolonged amenorrhea, depending upon its underlying cause, can be a harbinger of substantial cardiovascular risk.

Materials and Methods

This is an update of recent medical literature on this topic.

Results

The past few years have been marked by a greater appreciation of the early presentation of common ovulatory disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and less common disorders, such as premature ovarian insufficiency/failure. The long-term implications of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and its genetic origins have also been further elucidated. Finally, health consequences of these and other menstrual disorders are increasingly well defined, with firmer clinical endpoints rather than merely risk factor assessments.

### Prolactin elevation with antipsychotic medications: mechanisms of action and clinical consequences [^9e4b2a2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^bd04b4c6]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia evaluation — hyperprolactinemia may be associated with decreased E2 concentrations and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, yet only approximately 1/3 of women with hyperprolactinemia will have galactorrhea; prolactin concentrations are higher in women with amenorrhea than in those with oligomenorrhea, and prolactin levels < 15–20 ng/mL in most clinical laboratories will exclude hyperprolactinemia, whereas mildly elevated values (20–40 ng/mL) should be repeated and confirmed, and if they remain mildly elevated (and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic), a macroprolactin level should be considered; macroprolactin has been reported to have a prevalence as high as nearly 20% of patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, is biologically inactive compared with the predominant circulating form of prolactin (80%–95%) called monomeric prolactin, and macroprolactinemia is confirmed by having the laboratory pretreat the patient's serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging.

Adolescent cycle length and ovulation patterns indicate most females bleed for 2–7 days during their first menses; despite early anovulatory cycles, 90% of cycles are within 21–45 days, though cycles of less than 20 days or more than 45 days may occur; by the third year after menarche, 60–80% of cycles are 21–34 days long.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^c39cc034]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

Special considerations regarding pharmacotherapy in premenopausal women

Since pharmacokinetic processes are generally lower in women whereas D2 occupancy rates are higher during high oestrogen phases, dosing of most antipsychotics should start lower in premenopausal women than in men, except for quetiapine and lurasidone. At times when oestrogen levels are high (i.e. during the ovulatory phase), premenopausal women are especially vulnerable to overdosing of drugs metabolised by the CYP1A2 enzyme (olanzapine and clozapine) (Table 1). Although further research is required, it is possible that premenopausal women may, on average, have enough antipsychotic protection from a dose of clozapine and olanzapine that is half of an average male dose (Eugene & Masiak). The interaction between antipsychotics and the menstrual cycle is subject to individual differences and requires further investigation for each type of antipsychotic. In general, women with regular cycles who suffer from psychotic exacerbations during the menstrual phase may benefit from slight dose increments shortly before and around menstruation, although this is rarely done in practice (González-Rodríguez & Seeman; Lange et al; Seeman; Yum, Yum, & Kim). Side-effects of antipsychotic drugs that could be particularly relevant to younger female patients include weight gain, as obesity largely decreases self-esteem in women (Connors & Casey; Lieberman, Tybur, & Latner,) and hyperprolactinaemia, which reduces oestrogen levels. These low oestrogen levels not only increase the risk for somatic complications but also potentially have also a negative impact on psychotic symptoms (Brand et al.). Aripiprazole and lurasidone may, therefore, be drugs of first choice in this phase and options of second choice are olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine (Table 2).

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a2885d63]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia — evidence summary indicates that the most frequent cause of nontumoral hyperprolactinemia is medications, with neuroleptics/antipsychotic agents most commonly causing hyperprolactinemia; among patients taking typical antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines or butyrophenones), 40–90% have hyperprolactinemia, as do 50–100% of patients on risperidone; and with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, prolactin levels increase slowly after oral administration and it usually takes 3 d for levels to return to normal after discontinuation.

Endocrine side-effects

By diminishing the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion in the pituitary gland, antipsychotics often cause hyperprolactinaemia (González-Rodríguez, Labad, & Seeman,), which can result in galactorrhoea, cessation of normal cyclic ovarian function and hirsutism (Malik et al; Peuskens, Pani, Detraux, & De Hert). Premenopausal women have physiologically higher levels of prolactin compared to men and are therefore closer to the threshold for hyperprolactinaemia (Kaar, Natesan, McCutcheon, & Howes; Riecher-Rössler). Consequently, they are more than twice as likely to develop antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia compared to postmenopausal women and men (González-Rodríguez et al; Kinon, Gilmore, Liu, & Halbreich). Moreover, prolactin secretion suppresses the production of sex hormones and induces oestrogen deficiency, which is already more frequent in female SSD patients compared to healthy females before menopausal age (Brand et al; Gogos et al; Lindamer et al; Riecher-Rössler). Oestrogen deficiency can lead to polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and an increased risk of breast cancer (De Hert, Detraux, & Peuskens; Haring et al; Pottegård, Lash, Cronin-Fenton, Ahern, & Damkier; Yum, Kim, & Hwang). For example, up to 48% of women receiving antipsychotic treatment report irregularities in their menstrual cycle (O'Keane,) and reduced bone mineral density is present in 32% of women treated with prolactin-raising antipsychotics for > 10 years (Meaney et al.). Prolactin-sparing antipsychotics (e.g. aripiprazole) should, therefore, be preferred over prolactin-raising antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone) for female patients of all ages (Table 1).

### Vitamin D in pituitary driven osteopathies [^3b916120]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, in a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study, evaluating the supplementation with calcium and VD in young male subjects with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia, normal levels of VD were found. In this case the hyperprolactinemia would be due to the antidopaminergic activity of the antipsychotics and could cause, in turn, hypogonadism and reduced bone mass. The mechanisms involved in the bone demineralization may differ between males and females. In women hyperprolactinemia impairs the pulsatility of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, impairing the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, and causing amenorrhea that can, in turn, lead to reduction in bone mass. However, most studies did not define whether the evidence linking VD levels to prolactin was dependent or not of the presence of hypogonadism.

Despite the small patient cohorts analyzed, the female-only enrollment in most studies, the lack of prospective studies, which certainly requires greater in-depth analyses, these data seem to suggest a possible link between PRL and 25(OH)D, and that patients affected by hyperprolactinemia should often require VD supplementation.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^cea0fb9e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.
