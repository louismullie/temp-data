## Question

What cough medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to choose appropriate cough medication across different ages and causes of cough, with attention to self-verification and stepwise logic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying cough by duration and likely etiology. Then, I should verify the evidence base for over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines in adults and children. Next, I will examine special populations and safety, including pregnancy, breastfeeding, and neuromuscular disease. After that, I should review chronic cough management and novel therapies. Finally, I will synthesize practical, nonpharmacologic strategies and a concise decision framework, making sure each point aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because management hinges on duration and suspected cause. Acute cough is less than 3 weeks, subacute is 3–8 weeks, and chronic is more than 8 weeks in adults, whereas in children chronic cough is defined as daily cough beyond 4 weeks, and this duration-based approach is consistently endorsed by CHEST and related guidance to narrow differential diagnoses and guide testing and treatment decisions [^116C3J6t] [^112kmsV6].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence for OTC cough medicines in adults with acute viral upper respiratory infection. High-quality systematic reviews and guidelines converge on the conclusion that there is no good evidence that OTC antitussives, expectorants, antihistamines, decongestants, or combination products meaningfully reduce cough severity or duration, and CHEST explicitly recommends against prescribing OTC cough/cold medicines for acute cough due to the common cold, with AAFP similarly advising insufficient evidence for codeine or other antitussives in this setting [^112pi9bX] [^111JWW78] [^111cYDA2].

> Hold on, I should double-check the specific agents. Codeine shows no consistent benefit over placebo for acute cough and carries opioid-related risks, dextromethorphan has mixed and small effects that are often not clinically meaningful, guaifenesin has conflicting results and recent critiques question its expectorant benefit, and antihistamine-decongestant combinations show inconsistent effects with sedation trade-offs, reinforcing the recommendation to avoid routine OTC pharmacotherapy for acute viral cough in adults [^115j1sKh] [^112mwPV3] [^113oQJpc].

> I need to ensure I address acute bronchitis specifically. CHEST's expert panel advises no routine medications for immunocompetent adult outpatients with suspected acute bronchitis, and AAFP's rapid evidence review likewise concludes insufficient evidence for OTC cough medicines, antitussives, antihistamines, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to improve cough in acute bronchitis, so supportive care remains preferred [^114hBege] [^114XJ6Bx].

> Next, I should review children. Guidelines consistently advise against OTC cough/cold medicines for acute pediatric cough due to lack of efficacy and potential harm, with FDA labeling restricting use in children under 4 years and codeine restricted to adults 18 years and older, and CHEST suggests honey may offer modest relief for children older than 1 year while emphasizing that symptomatic medications should not be prescribed routinely [^112HKPwG] [^1178JuvT] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the child is very young? I should confirm the botulism risk with honey, which is real in infants under 1 year, and I should also remember that dextromethorphan is not recommended under 2 years, so safety counseling is essential and nonpharmacologic measures like hydration, humidification, and nasal suctioning are the mainstays in this age group [^111GyBva] [^1178JuvT] [^1178JuvT].

> Let me consider special populations. In pregnancy and lactation, codeine is contraindicated due to neonatal risk and FDA warnings, and given the weak evidence base for OTC cough medicines, nonpharmacologic strategies should be prioritized, with any pharmacologic consideration individualized and risk–benefit discussed explicitly with the patient [^115h69cf].

> I should confirm the approach in neuromuscular weakness or impaired cough mechanics. Medications that modify secretion properties or devices that augment cough peak flow may be more appropriate than antitussives, as the therapeutic goal is effective airway clearance rather than suppression, aligning with physiologic principles outlined in contemporary cough phenomenology guidance [^117CL7RD].

> Now, I will examine chronic cough in adults. After ruling out common causes such as upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and reflux, CHEST suggests a therapeutic trial of gabapentin for unexplained chronic cough with shared decision-making about adverse effects, and ERS suggests a trial of low-dose morphine for refractory chronic cough, while inhaled corticosteroids are reserved for specific phenotypes like cough-variant asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis rather than used broadly [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ] [^112f21xq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought inhaled corticosteroids might be broadly helpful for chronic cough, but I should correct that. Evidence is heterogeneous and largely negative for unexplained chronic cough, so ICS should not be prescribed routinely without supportive phenotypic evidence such as eosinophilic inflammation or asthma features, and even then, a time-limited, response-guided trial is prudent [^113WHqoM] [^113axWHu].

> Next, I should review emerging therapies. P2X3 antagonists such as gefapixant have shown efficacy in refractory chronic cough and represent a mechanistically targeted option for patients with cough reflex hypersensitivity, though access and patient selection vary by region and guideline uptake is evolving as longer-term data accrue [^115dRBLN].

> I will now examine chronic cough in children. The priority is to identify and treat the underlying cause using pediatric-specific algorithms, avoid routine OTC medications, and consider a short, closely monitored trial of low-dose ICS only if asthma features emerge, with re-evaluation in 2–4 weeks to confirm response and discontinue if ineffective [^117E6Atf] [^113oRUEW].

> Let me synthesize nonpharmacologic strategies that are consistently recommended. For acute viral cough, hydration, humidity, saline irrigation or suctioning, and honey for children older than 1 year are reasonable, sleep optimization and trigger avoidance can help, and patient education about the self-limited nature of viral cough reduces unnecessary medication use and anxiety [^114WR9cu] [^112HKPwG].

> Hold on, I should verify the decision framework. First classify by duration, then screen for red flags such as hemoptysis, weight loss, or respiratory distress, next tailor to likely etiology and age, avoid routine OTC cough medicines in acute viral illness, reserve specific therapies for defined phenotypes in chronic cough, and prioritize safety, with explicit follow-up and stopping rules if there is no benefit within a predefined interval [^111TB45w] [^111JWW78] [^114vDBiZ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: for acute viral cough in adults and children, OTC cough medicines should generally be avoided due to lack of proven benefit and potential harm, with supportive care and etiology-specific management guiding treatment, whereas chronic cough requires a diagnostic, phenotype-driven approach with selective use of evidence-supported therapies such as gabapentin, low-dose morphine in refractory cases, and P2X3 antagonists where available, all aligned with guideline-based reassessment timelines [^111JWW78] [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ] [^115dRBLN].

For acute cough from a viral URI, **no OTC cough medication is clearly effective** [^112pi9bX] and **guidelines advise against routine use** [^111JWW78] because benefits are small, inconsistent, and outweighed by harms, especially in children [^112HKPwG]. Honey may help children older than 1 year [^1178JuvT], but **avoid in infants** due to botulism risk [^114WR9cu]. For chronic cough, treat the cause; consider gabapentin [^113zvd6L] or low-dose morphine [^114P88QZ] if refractory, and avoid routine acid suppression [^1122coLg] or macrolides [^113K1JRR] unless indicated. Codeine is **not recommended for children** [^1135GYQg] because of serious adverse effects [^115h69cf].

---

## Evidence for OTC cough medications

### Adults

- **Antitussives (dextromethorphan, codeine)**: Mixed results; some trials show small benefits, others none [^115j1sKh]; clinical relevance is questionable [^112pi9bX].
- **Expectorants (guaifenesin)**: Conflicting data; one trial suggested benefit, others none [^113Hr835]; overall evidence is weak [^112mwPV3].
- **Antihistamines and combination products**: No consistent benefit [^112pi9bX]; antihistamines alone are ineffective [^113Hr835].

---

### Children

In children, **antitussives and expectorants** show no clear benefit [^115ZSRQV], and **combination products** likewise have no consistent benefit and may cause serious adverse effects, including respiratory depression and overdose [^112HKPwG] [^115TEeug].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute cough (adults and children) | - No routine OTC cough medications <br/> - Honey for children > 1 year [^1178JuvT] | High |
| Chronic cough (adults) | - Treat underlying cause <br/> - Gabapentin or low-dose morphine if refractory [^113zvd6L] [^114P88QZ] | High |
| Chronic cough (children) | - Treat underlying cause <br/> - No routine OTC medications [^117E6Atf] | High |
| Codeine-containing medications | - Avoid in children < 18 years [^115h69cf] <br/> - Risk of serious adverse effects [^1135GYQg] | High |

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

- **Codeine**: Serious adverse effects in children, including respiratory depression and death [^1135GYQg] [^112HKPwG].
- **Dextromethorphan**: Overdose risk, especially with combination products [^112HKPwG].
- **Antihistamines**: Sedation, paradoxical excitation, and overdose risk [^113Hr835].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Honey**: For children > 1 year; modest benefit in acute cough [^112HKPwG] [^1178JuvT].
- **Humidification and hydration**: Supportive care for symptom relief [^114WR9cu].
- **Speech therapy**: For chronic cough, especially refractory or unexplained [^113axWHu].

---

## Special populations

In pregnancy, **avoid codeine and other opioids**; use nonpharmacologic measures first. In patients with **neuromuscular disease**, avoid cough suppressants and prioritize airway clearance [^117CL7RD].

---

## Summary of evidence

OTC cough medications have **limited and inconsistent efficacy** for acute cough [^112pi9bX], with **no clear benefit** in children [^115ZSRQV] and potential harms; therefore, **guidelines recommend against routine use** [^111JWW78]. For chronic cough, treat the cause; consider gabapentin [^113zvd6L] or low-dose morphine [^114P88QZ] if refractory.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114vDBiZ]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough in adults — The updated management algorithm includes the suggestions that history should be sought for hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptom and, if present, should be immediately addressed and evaluated; a validated cough severity tool be routinely used to assess outcome of therapy; environmental and occupational exposures be considered and addressed if present; recognition that acid suppression alone is no longer recommended for treating cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease; sitagliptin, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, be discontinued to see if the drug is responsible for the cough; patients be routinely followed in the clinic within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial evaluation; and referral to a well-recognized cough clinic should be considered for the refractory unexplained chronic cough.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111KPPSk]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. This study had two aims: to identify therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients (internationally), and to consider the evidence required to address these unmet needs.

Methods

A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was performed to identify articles describing therapeutic principles in the treatment of pediatric cough. An online survey of international pediatric cough experts was conducted, with questions on the definitions, diagnosis, treatment, and unmet needs in pediatric cough management.

Results

Cough guidelines have differing definitions of pediatric patients (≤ 12–18years), acute pediatric cough (< 2–3weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 4–8weeks). Similarly, among 18 experts surveyed, definitions varied for pediatric patients (≤ 10–21years), acute pediatric cough (< 3–5days to < 6weeks), and chronic pediatric cough (> 2–8weeks). Guidelines generally do not recommend over-the-counter or prescription cough medicines in acute pediatric cough, due to lack of evidence. In the expert survey, participants had differing opinions on which medicines were most suitable for treating acute pediatric cough, and noted that effective treatments are lacking for cough-related pain and sleep disruption. Overall, guidelines and experts agreed that chronic pediatric cough requires diagnostic investigations to identify the underlying cough-causing disease and thereby to guide treatment. There are unmet needs for new effective and safe treatments for acute pediatric cough, and for randomized controlled trials of existing treatments. Safety is a particular concern in this vulnerable patient population. There is also a need for better understanding of the causes, phenotypes, and prevalence of pediatric cough, and how this relates to its diagnosis and treatment.

Conclusions

Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. There is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1131Cxg4]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This series of guidance documents on cough, which will be published over time, is a hybrid of two processes: (1) evidence-based guidelines and (2) trustworthy consensus statements based on a robust and transparent process.

Methods

The CHEST Guidelines Oversight Committee selected a nonconflicted Panel Chair and jointly assembled an international panel of experts in each clinical area with few, if any, conflicts of interest. PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome)-based key questions and parameters of eligibility were developed for each clinical topic to inform the comprehensive literature search. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, and primary studies were assessed for relevance and quality. Data elements were extracted into evidence tables and synthesized to provide summary statistics. These, in turn, are presented to support the evidence-based graded recommendations. A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements. Transparency of process was documented.

Results

Evidence-based guideline recommendations and consensus-based suggestions were carefully crafted to provide direction to health-care providers and investigators who treat and/or study patients with cough. Manuscripts and tables summarize the evidence in each clinical area supporting the recommendations and suggestions.

Conclusions

The resulting guidance statements are based on a rigorous methodology and transparency of process. Unless otherwise stated, the recommendations and suggestions meet the guidelines for trustworthiness developed by the Institute of Medicine and can be applied with confidence by physicians, nurses, other health-care providers, investigators, and patients.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116y3JnS]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) causes significant impairments in quality of life. Effective assessment and treatment approaches are needed for UCC.

Methods

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) asked: What is the efficacy of treatment compared with usual care for cough severity, cough frequency, and cough-related quality of life in patients with UCC? Studies of adults and adolescents aged > 12 years with a chronic cough of > 8 weeks' duration that was unexplained after systematic investigation and treatment were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the American College of Chest Physicians organization methodology.

Results

Eleven RCTs and five systematic reviews were included. The 11 RCTs reported data on 570 participants with chronic cough who received a variety of interventions. Study quality was high in 10 RCTs. The studies used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify UCC. Although gabapentin and morphine exhibited positive effects on cough-related quality of life, only gabapentin was supported as a treatment recommendation. Studies of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were affected by intervention fidelity bias; when this factor was addressed, ICS were found to be ineffective for UCC. Esomeprazole was ineffective for UCC without features of gastroesophageal acid reflux. Studies addressing nonacid gastroesophageal reflux disease were not identified. A multimodality speech pathology intervention improved cough severity.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the diagnosis and management of UCC is limited. UCC requires further study to establish agreed terminology and the optimal methods of investigation using established criteria for intervention fidelity. Speech pathology-based cough suppression is suggested as a treatment option for UCC. This guideline presents suggestions for diagnosis and treatment based on the best available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for future research.

### ERS guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in adults and children [^114P88QZ]. The European Respiratory Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to opioids, ERS 2020 guidelines recommend to offer a trial of low-dose morphine, e.g. 5–10 mg BID, in adult patients with chronic refractory cough.

### Cough. 6: which investigations are most useful in the diagnosis of chronic cough? [^116w9UxL]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

There is no consensus as to the best diagnostic strategy for chronic cough. Many protocols combine empirical trials of treatment with laboratory investigations. More precise diagnostic tools and improved therapeutic options are required. Until then, the management of chronic cough will remain a clinical challenge.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114TdJrD]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Guideline scope and evidence strength note that, compared to the 2006 guideline, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of managing chronic cough in children, reflected in Grades within each recommendation, and that 16 recommendations are Grade 1. The report states the general guideline does not substitute for sound clinical judgement, requires appropriate adaptations in population settings where disease patterns are different, and is not intended to be used as a definitive protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Overview of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111YV25B]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

This overview will demonstrate that cough is a common and potentially expensive health-care problem. Improvement in the quality of care of those with cough has been the focus of study for a variety of disciplines in medicine. The purpose of the Cough Guideline and Expert Panel is to synthesize current knowledge in a form that will aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and also identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### Assessing efficacy of therapy for cough [^112TVkqS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

An antitussive agent should reduce the amount of coughing experienced by the patient sufficiently for the patient to appreciate an improvement in cough severity and regard the improvement as sufficient to outweigh any adverse effects or risks associated with the treatment. In recent years the development of objective cough counting devices and cough-specific quality of life tools have vastly improved our ability to appropriately assess the effectiveness of anti-tussive agents and hopefully will lead to the development of safe and effective treatments in the future. This article summarizes current knowledge of methodologies available for assessing cough therapies, the patient groups to study, and the design of clinical trials.

### A critical review of the quality of cough clinical practice guidelines [^116Nw4uK]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been developed to provide health-care practitioners with the best possible evidence, but the quality of these CPGs varies greatly.

Objective

The goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the quality of cough CPGs and identify gaps limiting evidence-based practice.

Methods

Systematic searches were conducted to identify cough CPGs in guideline databases, developers' Websites, and Medline. Four reviewers independently evaluated eligible guidelines by using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II assessment tool. Agreement among reviewers was measured by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The number of recommendations, strength of recommendation, and levels of evidence were determined.

Results

Fifteen cough CPGs were identified. An overall high degree of agreement among reviewers was observed (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.79–0.85]). The quality ranged from good to acceptable in the scope and purpose (mean, 72%; range, 54%-93%) and clarity and presentation (mean, 68%; range, 50%-90%) domains but not in stakeholder involvement (mean, 36%; range, 18%-90%), rigor of development (mean, 36%; range, 9%-93%), applicability (mean, 23%; range, 9%-83%), and editorial independence domains (mean, 24%; range, 0–96%). Seven guidelines (46.7%) were considered "strongly recommended" or "recommended with modifications" for clinical practice. More than 70% of recommendations were based on nonrandomized studies (Level C, 30.4%) and expert opinion (Level D, 41.3%).

Conclusions

The quality of cough CPGs is variable, and recommendations are largely based on low-quality evidence. There is significant room for improvement to develop high-quality guidelines, which urgently warrants first-class research to minimize the vital gaps in the evidence for formulation of cough CPGs.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111GyBva]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Guaifenesin: the ubiquitous orphan [^112mwPV3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Guaifenesin, a widely used ingredient in over-the-counter cough and cold medications, has been a subject of debate regarding its efficacy in treating respiratory conditions. Despite its historical use and US Food and Drug Administration approval, recent studies have questioned its claimed expectorant effect and its effectiveness in managing symptoms. This article examines the available evidence, highlighting the lack of significant benefits over placebo for upper respiratory disease. The rationale for clinical use is examined alongside the potential downside and alternatives to recommending guaifenesin as a treatment option.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116ZAiCJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough caused by viral respiratory tract infections is probably the most common illness to afflict mankind. Despite the widespread but ineffective prescribing of antibiotics, there is no specific therapy. Home remedies and over-the-counter medicines are the mainstay for treatment of this short-lived but debilitating condition where cough is a major troublesome symptom. Across Europe, there are large variations in the recommendations made by healthcare professionals for the treatment of acute cough. This has arisen through custom and practice based on the evidence of historical studies performed to standards well short of what would be considered legitimate today. Acute cough is particularly difficult to study in a controlled setting because of the high rate of spontaneous remission and a large placebo effect. Here we detail the validated modern methodology used to assess the efficacy of antitussives and review the drugs commonly used in Europe against these standards.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113oRUEW]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Management of non-specific cough — For children aged ≤ 14 years with non-specific cough, we suggest that if cough does not resolve within 2 to 4 weeks, the child should be re-evaluated for emergence of specific etiological pointers, and we suggest when risk factors for asthma are present, a short (2–4 weeks) trial of 400 μg/day of beclomethasone equivalent may be warranted with re-evaluation always in 2 to 4 weeks (both Ungraded Consensus-Based Statements).

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough symptoms… [^113oQJpc]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Two out of three adult studies of dextromethorphan, including one meta-analysis of five studies, found a statistically significant benefit: a 30-mg single dose was more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms, as measured by cough counts, frequency, effort, and intensity. Based on the findings of two adult trials of codeine and three trials of antihistamines, neither medication is more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two adult trials comparing antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo showed conflicting results, with only the smaller of the two studies showing a statistically significant reduction in mean cough severity rating.

Two adult trials compared guaifenesin with placebo with mixed results: in the larger study, a greater percentage of patients in the guaifenesin group than in the placebo group reported reduction of cough frequency and intensity at 72 hours, and two trials of antihistamine-decongestant combinations showed that these treatments are no more effective than placebo in reducing daytime or nocturnal cough symptoms in children. Likewise, combination dextromethorphan and albuterol is no more effective than placebo in parent-reported symptom scores.

Two trials comparing antihistamines with placebo showed no statistically significant difference in cough symptoms or in parent and child sleep. 3 The American College of Chest Physicians 2006 practice guideline on the evaluation and treatment of cough recommends treating adults who have acute cough caused by the common cold with a first-generation antihistamine-decongestant combination, such as dex-brompheniramine and sustained-release pseudoephed-rine. It also endorses the use of naproxen in this circumstance. 4.

### Should you give kids medicine for coughs and colds? [^114WR9cu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

A makes breathing easier by decreasing congestion in nasal passages. Do not use warm mist humidifiers because they can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult. cool mist humidifier keep nasal passages moist and help avoid stuffiness. Saline nose drops or sprays or a similar product, with or without saline nose drops, works very well for children younger than a year old. You can use them on older children, too, but they often resist bulb syringes. Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe. can be used to reduce fever, aches, and pain. Carefully read and follow the product's instructions on the Drug Facts label or talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about dosage. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen Encourage children to drink plenty of liquids to. stay hydrated. Giving Children Cough and Cold Medicines Over-the-counter medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms.

The FDA doesn't recommend OTC medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 because they could cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products to state: "Do not use in children under 4 years of age". There Are No FDA-Approved Homeopathic Products At your pharmacy and online, you may see other cough and cold medicine being sold for children advertised as homeopathic. It's important to note that these homeopathic products are drugs because they are intended to treat or mitigate colds, even though some of these products might look similar to dietary supplements. There are no FDA-approved homeopathic products, and homeopathic products sold in the U. S. have not met the FDA's requirements for safety and effectiveness. The FDA is not aware of any proven benefits of these products and urges you not to give homeopathic cough and cold medicine to children younger than 4.

In certain instances, children younger than 4 who took these products have experienced serious side effects, some of which required hospitalization, including:

- Seizure, allergic reaction, and difficulty breathing.
- Low blood potassium and low blood sugar, which may result in headache, crankiness, drowsiness, and weakness. These serious side effects occurred soon after children took a homeopathic cough and cold product; however, it is not always possible to know whether a reported side effect was caused by a medicine.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114vAgWG]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Systematic review methods for unexplained chronic cough (UCC) defined the review question as "What is the efficacy of treatment compared with usual care for cough severity, cough frequency, and cough-related quality of life in patients with UCC?", searched guideline repositories and databases "(PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Cochrane Library]) commencing from the earliest available date until April 2014", used terms "[Cough OR chronic cough] AND [Idiopathic OR refractory OR unexplained OR intractable]" with an additional PubMed search for chronic cough and "[clinical trial]", screened titles/abstracts independently by two reviewers and included study designs "(randomized controlled trial [RCT], controlled clinical trial, or systematic review)" in populations of "adults or adolescents aged > 12 years", and assessed quality using "the Cochrane risk of bias tool" and "the Documentation and Appraisal Review Tool".

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GbBJs]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — recommendation development used a structured consensus-based modified Delphi approach, and for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, "75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement". Within this framework, "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies to only some patients", with strength "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations", where harms can include "convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness", resource considerations "go beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs", and a patient representative "provided patient-centered input".

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^113US1kb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cough is not standardized across the world. International experts use a variety of different guidelines, and have diverse opinions on how to define aspects of pediatric cough. Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. From an international perspective, there is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances. However, the development of such guidelines will require data gaps to be filled. In particular, clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of current acute cough therapies, and to better characterize subpopulations of pediatric patients with cough.

### Methods of cough assessment [^113RoK2m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

The accurate and consistent assessment of cough is essential not only for optimum standards of clinical care but also to drive forward advances in our understanding of cough. A range of tools for the subjective and objective measurement of cough exists, and their ongoing development has coincided with growth in clinical and preclinical research in cough, resulting in novel findings and promising new treatments. The most widely used and most fruitful approaches to assessing cough are discussed, along with some newer and preliminary techniques and directions for the future. These include methods for measuring cough-specific quality of life, subjective severity, cough frequency, intensity, and sensitivity of the underlying cough reflex. Ongoing development and more widespread adoption of cough assessment tools should help describe the heterogeneity of cough phenotypes, and may better guide treatment by enabling prediction of responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological antitussive therapies. More detailed assessments of cough may also bring benefits in measuring the transmission of respiratory infections, or in managing reduced airway protection in neuromuscular disease. Population-wide assessments should also help understand the epidemiology of cough and assist in screening for disease.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CvTe3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1143FvUM]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-bronchiolitis chronic cough — For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, we suggest that the cough be managed according to the CHEST pediatric chronic cough guidelines, asthma medications not be used for the cough unless other evidence of asthma is present, and inhaled osmotic agents not be used (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Toxicity of over-the-counter cough and cold medications [^115TEeug]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications are marketed widely for relief of common cold symptoms, and yet studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of these medications for young children. In addition, OTC medications can be associated with significant morbidity and even mortality in both acute overdoses and when administered in correct doses for chronic periods of time. Physicians often do not inquire about OTC medication use, and parents (or other caregivers) often do not perceive OTCs as medications. We present 3 cases of adverse outcomes over a 13-month period-including 1 death-as a result of OTC cough and cold medication use. We explore the toxicities of OTC cough and cold medications, discuss mechanisms of dosing errors, and suggest why physicians should be more vigilant in specifically inquiring about OTCs when evaluating an ill child.

### Methodology and grading of the evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116YQJ6G]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assemble a multidisciplinary, geographically diverse panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of cough with the intention of developing clinically relevant practice guidelines for pulmonary and primary care physicians, including recommendations covering many etiologies of cough, adult and pediatric evaluation and treatment, and empiric yet integrative algorithms for the management of the patient with cough.

Methods

The Duke University Center for Clinical Health Policy Research was selected to review and summarize the current evidence in this area. The expert panel established clinical recommendations and algorithms founded on the synthesis of this evidence.

Conclusions

This section describes the approach used to develop the guidelines, including identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the evidence, assessing the strength of evidence pertinent to individual guidelines, and grading the guideline recommendations.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings [^116zx6CN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine-decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three-day period. Twenty-one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over-the-counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.

### Cough medicines for children-time for a reality check [^115ZSRQV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cough medicines have been in use for over a century to treat the common and troublesome, but often helpful, symptoms of cough in children. They contain various combinations of "anti-tussive" drugs including opioids, antihistamines, herbal preparations, mucolytics, decongestants and expectorants. Whilst theoretically attractive for symptom relief when children are suffering, as time has passed these popular over the counter medicines have been shown to lack efficacy, delay more serious underlying diagnoses, and can cause complications and sometimes death. This has resulted in clinician concerns, a citizen petition to the American Food and Drug Association in 2007, some self-regulation from manufacturers and escalating restrictions on their use from regulatory agencies across the world over the last twenty years. This article will review the protective role of cough, juxtapose the conflicting treatment goals of suppressing a dry cough and promoting expectoration for a wet cough, consider the evidence basis for prescribing cough medicines in comparison to other more specific treatments such as for asthma [beta agonists] or infection [antibiotics], regulatory interventions, and conclude with the view that over counter cough medicines should not be used in children, especially young children.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1132y7WJ]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Discussion — evidence gaps and outcome measure limitations in chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB: the authors report a comprehensive search of several databases except non-English studies and state these reviews reflect a lack of good quality trials on non-invasive airway inflammation measures and on treatment for chronic cough in asthma and NAEB; in contrast, there is a wealth of high quality asthma treatment trials and moderate-to-good evidence for eosinophilic inflammation biomarkers supporting diagnosis and directing therapy; most asthma health status measures include cough among broader symptoms, cough is specifically excluded as a symptom in the asthma control questionnaire and included among other respiratory symptoms in asthma control tests; because guideline-based management focuses on improving control score, cough is largely excluded from key studies; consequently there is a lack of RCTs selecting patients with chronic cough due to asthma and cough-specific outcomes have rarely been included in asthma intervention trials.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^112sjUPJ]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

### Use of cough and cold medications in severe bronchiolitis before and after a health advisory warning against their use [^114kZSjf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

We compared the use of cough and cold medications in 2 multicenter studies of young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis before and after the 2008 Food and Drug Administration cough and cold medications advisory. Although cough and cold medication use decreased after the advisory, nearly 20% of children age 12–23.9 months with severe bronchiolitis received cough and cold medications.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^117JktcY]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Use of appropriate cough pathways or algorithms may reduce the morbidity of chronic cough, lead to earlier diagnosis of chronic underlying illness, and reduce unnecessary costs and medications. We undertook three systematic reviews to examine three related key questions (KQ): In children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), KQ1, do cough management protocols (or algorithms) improve clinical outcomes? KQ2, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the duration and/or severity? KQ3, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. Only systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and cohort studies published in English were included.

Results

Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses flowcharts and summary tabulated. Nine studies were included in KQ1 (RCT = 1; cohort studies = 7) and eight in KQ3 (RCT = 2; cohort = 6), but none in KQ2.

Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes and cough management or the testing algorithm should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. It remains uncertain whether the management or testing algorithm should depend on the duration or severity of chronic cough. Pending new data, chronic cough in children should be defined as > 4 weeks' duration and children should be systematically evaluated with treatment targeted to the underlying cause irrespective of the cough severity.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^1168TtjW]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Areas for future research — treatments for cough due to the common cold: To improve therapeutic options, proposed endeavors include development of validated models to demonstrate that mucoactive drug efficacy can accelerate the clinical development of mucoactive drugs for symptomatic respiratory tract infections, development of clinical studies to validate the use of multi-ingredient prescription and nonprescription cough therapies, development of effective antitussive medications that are safe for children and adults, and RCTs with appropriate comparators.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications to reduce cough as an adjunct to antibiotics for acute pneumonia in children and adults [^111vnKoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is often distressing for patients with pneumonia. Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (mucolytics or cough suppressants). These might provide relief in reducing the severity of cough, but conversely, suppression of the cough mechanism might impede airway clearance and cause harm.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of OTC cough medications as an adjunct to antibiotics in children and adults with pneumonia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); EMBASE (1980 to December 2006) and the list of references in relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults comparing any type of OTC cough medication with a placebo, or control medication, with cough as an outcome and where the cough is secondary to acute pneumonia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected trials for inclusion. Data were extracted from these studies, assessed for methodological quality without disagreement, and analysed using standard methods.

Main Results

Four studies were included with a total of 224 participants; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data. Three different mucolytics (bromhexine, ambroxol, neltenexine) were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data. They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' for mucolytics. A secondary outcome of 'not cured' was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.77; number needed to treat (NNT) 5, 95% CI 3 to 16 for children and OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 19 for adults). In a post hoc analysis combining data for children and adults, again there was also no difference in the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.80) although mucolytics reduced the secondary outcome 'not cured' (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 8).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to decide whether OTC medications for cough associated with acute pneumonia are beneficial. Mucolytics may be, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as an adjunctive treatment of acute pneumonia. This leaves only theoretical recommendations that OTC medications containing codeine and antihistamines should not be used in young children.

### Unapproved prescription cough, cold, and allergy drug products: recent US food and drug administration regulatory action on unapproved cough, cold, and allergy medications [^116XmtX3]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approval and over-the-counter drug monograph processes play an essential role in ensuring that all drugs are both safe and effective for their intended uses. Manufacturers of drugs that lack required approval have not provided the FDA with evidence demonstrating that their products are safe and effective. Some of these prescription drugs have been marketed for many years and have remained on the market despite changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires approval for safety and efficacy purposes. Many health-care providers may be unaware that unapproved drugs exist because the product labels of these drugs do not disclose that they lack FDA approval. The FDA recently took action against unapproved prescription oral cough, cold, and allergy drug products because of concerns about the potential risks of these products, particularly some extended-release formulations that have not been reviewed for quality. There is a potential for medication errors because product names and labeling have not been reviewed for potential confusion, with some products inappropriately labeled for use in children aged ≤ 2 years. FDA-approved prescription drugs or drugs appropriately marketed as over the counter remain available for treatment of cough, cold, and allergy symptoms. Such products are of known efficacy, safety, identity, quality, and purity. Removing unapproved drugs from the marketplace and encouraging manufacturers of unapproved products to seek FDA review and approval is a top priority for the FDA. Since the initiation of the Unapproved Drugs Initiative in 2006, the FDA has removed ~1,500 unapproved products from the market and has worked with firms to bring other unapproved drugs into the approval process. The FDA remains committed to its mission of ensuring that safe and effective drugs are available to American consumers.

### Over-the-counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^113Hr835]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first-line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2012 Issue 3 which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 1 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2012), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2012), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2012), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2012) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).

Selection Criteria

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials (18 in adults, eight in children) involving 4037 people (3421 adults and 616 children) were included. In the adult studies six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Two trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit whereas the other did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results.

No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. A minority of studies reported adverse effects and described a low incidence of mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. Studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. Higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.

Mucolytics may be beneficial but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as an adjunctive treatment for acute pneumonia. This leaves only theoretical recommendations that OTC medications containing codeine and antihistamines should not be used in young children.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to patients with chronic cough, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^112iVf6c]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Systematic review scope and methods — acute cough associated with the common cold (CACC) — are described as follows. The panel stated it "believed it would be beneficial to perform a systematic review to update the recommendations of the 2006 guideline". The clinical question was specified: "The review question was: Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies in reducing the duration/severity of acute CACC?" Methods conformed to CHEST processes: "The methods used for this systematic review conformed to those outlined in the article 'Methodologies for the Development of CHEST Guidelines and Expert Panel Reports'. Sources included guideline repositories: "The National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov) and the Guidelines International Network (http://www.g-i-n.net) were searched for existing guidelines on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for CACC". Databases and timeframe were comprehensive: "Systematic reviews and clinical trials were identified from searches of electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Cochrane Library], Google Scholar, and CINAHL), commencing from the earliest available date until April 2016". Search terms were prespecified: "The search terms used were common cold, cough, antihistamine, decongestant, cough suppressant, antitussive, antibiotic, zinc, expectorant, acute cough, anticholinergic, topical steroids, upper respiratory tract infection". A consensus approach was applied: "A highly structured consensus-based Delphi approach was used to provide expert advice on all guidance statements".

### Chronic cough related to acute viral bronchiolitis in children: CHEST expert panel report [^112PoMsw]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is common in young children, and some children develop chronic cough after their bronchiolitis. We thus undertook systematic reviews based on key questions (KQs) using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format. The KQs were: Among children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks) after acute viral bronchiolitis, how effective are the following interventions in improving the resolution of cough? (1) Antibiotics. If so what type and for how long? (2) Asthma medications (inhaled steroids, beta 2 agonist, montelukast); and (3) Inhaled osmotic agents like hypertonic saline?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form these suggestions. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus.

Results

Several studies and systematic reviews on the efficacy of the three types of interventions listed in the introduction were found but no data were relevant to our KQs. Thus, no recommendations on using the interventions above could be formulated.

Conclusions

The panel made several consensus-based suggestions and identified directions for future studies to advance the field of managing chronic cough post-acute bronchiolitis in children.

### Future directions in treating cough [^1144re9g]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and troublesome symptom that can be difficult to treat. New therapeutic options that are safe and more effective than those currently available are needed. In this article, the authors offer opinion on future directions in the treatment of cough, with a particular emphasis on the clinical syndrome associated with cough reflex hypersensitivity. In addition, the article provides an overview of some of the diagnostic technologies and promising drug targets likely to emerge from current clinical and scientific endeavor.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute and chronic cough in adults [^113WHqoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent cough is a common clinical problem. Despite thorough investigation and empirical management, a considerable proportion of those people with subacute and chronic cough have unexplained cough, for which treatment options are limited. While current guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the research evidence for this intervention is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ICS for subacute and chronic cough in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov in December 2012 and conducted handsearches.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently assessed all potentially relevant trials. All published and unpublished randomised comparisons of ICS versus placebo in adults with subacute or chronic cough were included. Participants with known chronic respiratory disease and asthma were excluded. Studies of cough-variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data pertaining to pre-defined outcomes. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical cure or significant improvement (over 70% reduction in cough severity measure) at follow up (clinical success). The secondary outcomes included proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure at follow up, mean change in cough severity measures, complications of cough, biomarkers of inflammation and adverse effects. We requested additional data from study authors.

Main Results

Eight primary studies, including 570 participants, were included. The overall methodological quality of studies was good. Significant clinical heterogeneity resulting from differences in participants and interventions, as well as variation in outcome measures, limited the validity of comparisons between studies for most outcomes. Data for the primary outcome of clinical cure or significant (> 70%) improvement were available for only three studies, which were too heterogeneous to pool. Similarly, heterogeneity in study characteristics limited the validity of meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes of proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure and clinical cure. One parallel group trial of predominantly chronic cough with 'cough-variant asthma' identified a significant treatment effect and contributed to the majority of statistical heterogeneity for these outcomes. While ICS treatment resulted in a mean decrease in cough score of 0.34 standard deviations (SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.13; 346 participants), the quality of evidence was low. Heterogeneity also prevented meta-analysis for the outcome of mean change in visual analogue scale score. Meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of pulmonary function, complications of cough or biomarkers of inflammation due to insufficient data. There was moderate quality evidence that treatment with ICS did not significantly increase the odds of experiencing an adverse event (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.04).

Authors' Conclusions

The studies were highly heterogeneous and results were inconsistent. Heterogeneity in study design needs to be addressed in future research in order to test the efficacy of this intervention. International cough guidelines recommend that a trial of ICS should only be considered in patients after thorough evaluation including chest X-ray and consideration of spirometry and other appropriate investigations.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116g381C]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — acute cough evidence base included only three studies meeting quality assessment, all with a high risk of bias; all were prospective with no harms reported, and none had a control group or used a validated outcome tool for cough assessment; two studies defined acute cough as < 3 weeks and the third as no more than 28 days; all the subjects (N = 308) sought medical attention for complaints of cough < 3 weeks' duration; the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause.

### Future directions in the clinical management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116rnN6b]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To impart a call for further research into the identified domains of particular interest in the etiology, management, and treatment of cough.

Design/Methodology

A literature review was performed using the search term "cough" in PubMed between 1983 and 2004. The final draft of this guideline was reviewed, in addition to recent studies on cough, and suggestions provided by the authors were collated into a definitive inventory of specific areas in which the lack of quality evidence encumbered the development of clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations.

Results/Conclusions

Although our understanding of the causes and optimal management of chronic cough have significantly increased over the past 25 years, further research remains to be done on this common symptom. This is reflected by the generally low level of evidence for many of the recommendations in these guidelines. Research is particularly needed on the optimal treatment of postinfectious cough, how to distinguish acute bronchitis from other conditions, how to reliably diagnose and treat cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, clearly identifying a role for nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities in diseases associated with an increased production of bronchial secretions, determining how often cough in patients with interstitial lung disease is due to conditions other than these, establishing the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in the immunocompromised hosts, and better characterizing psychogenic cough. Further studies are also needed on methods for the assessment of cough, in particular, noninvasive measures of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapy. It should be determined how often unexplained cough (previously referred to as idiopathic cough) is due to the use of non-evidence-based guidelines or to environmental causes, and assessed whether an empiric, integrative approach of diagnosing chronic cough leads to better outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, than routine testing. While much work has been done on chronic cough, we need studies on the spectrum and frequency of acute and subacute coughs.

### Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116TqsqE]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review relevant literature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methodology

The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, review articles, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched and reviewed by a single author. The date of the last comprehensive search was December 5, 2003, and that of the Cochrane database was November 7, 2004. The authors' own databases and expertise identified additional articles.

Results/Conclusions

Pediatric chronic cough (ie, cough in children aged < 15 years) is defined as a daily cough lasting for > 4 weeks. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of URTIs in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough (ie, cough associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem) and nonspecific cough (ie, dry cough in the absence of an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology). The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology. A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are a general guideline only, do not substitute for sound clinical judgment, and are not intended to be used as a protocol for the management of all children with a coughing illness. Children (aged < 15 years) with cough should be managed according to child-specific guidelines, which differ from those for adults as the etiologic factors and treatments for children are sometimes different from those for adults. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology, and there is no evidence for using medications for the symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, it is imperative that the children are followed up and therapy with the medications stopped if there is no effect on the cough within an expected time frame. An evaluation of the time to response is important. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences and parental expectations should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough often impacts the quality of life of both children and parents, and the exploration of parental expectations and fears is often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11781PdA]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST cough guideline development framework — living guidelines and evidence grading states that CHEST has embarked on a model of creating living guidelines to continually update recommendations as new evidence, pharmacotherapies, or medical technologies become available and now uses a more rigorous approach to grading evidence resulting in the downgrading of much of the cough research in some clinical areas. Where there are insufficient levels of evidence to create recommendations based on a systematic search of the literature, consensus suggestions are developed and revised using a modified Delphi approach, and CHEST's consensus-based approach combined with the evidence-based model results in a hybrid process supported by both evidence and expertise. The 2006 guidelines called for an empirical integrated approach to the diagnosis and management of cough, proposed future directions for research, and defined two new terminologies: upper airway cough syndrome and unexplained cough.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### Assessment of intervention fidelity and recommendations for researchers conducting studies on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in the adult: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Gh2KE]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough management variability — published literature: According to the published literature, successful management of chronic cough has varied from 54% to 100%, and one of the potential reasons relates to a lack of intervention fidelity to the core elements of the diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions that were meant to be used by the investigators.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111rREmW]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) causes significant impairment in quality of life, and effective treatment strategies are needed. We conducted a systematic review on the management of chronic cough due to CB to update the recommendations and suggestions of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review asked three questions: (1) What are the clinical features of the history that suggest a patient's cough-phlegm syndrome is due to CB? (2) Can treatment of stable CB improve or eliminate chronic cough? (3) Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to CB prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations? Studies of adult patients with CB were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the CHEST organization methodology.

Results

The search strategy used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify studies of chronic cough due to CB.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality. This article provides guidance on treatment by presenting suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^115CK7rd]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet needs in pediatric cough

Several articles in the literature review identified unmet needs in the management of pediatric cough. In terms of treatment, there is a dearth of evidence from adequately performed RCTs for the efficacy of current OTC and prescription products for acute cough. RCTs are also needed to assess treatment efficacy in different clinical settings, such as community versus hospital, and among different regions of the world. Overall, the number of therapeutic options for acute cough is limited, and there is a need for new medications that can suppress acute cough and relieve patient distress, without side effects.

Although treatment guidelines improve clinical outcomes in chronic cough, they are often based on low-quality evidence. Treatment algorithms have not been tested to see if children have different needs based on the duration and/or severity of their cough. Furthermore, the most appropriate age cutoff for the use of pediatric versus adult cough guidelines has not been determined.

Unmet needs also relate to the etiology and progression of pediatric cough. Studies are required to explore the progression of acute cough to chronic cough (current evidence suggests that clinical review is warranted when chronic cough develops following acute respiratory illness in children), the progression of chronic cough with time, and to determine the factors that predict this progression. At present, when a patient's cough does not respond to standard therapy, it can be unclear if the treatment was unsuitable, or if the etiology of cough was incorrectly discerned. There are also questions relating to the overlap of chronic cough with other conditions, such as respiratory disease. With regard to PBB, although initial research has looked into its risk factors and progression, further research is needed on its natural history, underlying disease mechanisms (factors influencing impaired pathogen clearance mechanisms), and how to optimize its treatment.

Finally, there is a need for additional studies on the clinical and psychosocial impact of cough on children and their families, and on the economic burden of cough to the individual and society.

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – expert survey

The expert survey ran from November 23 to December 21, 2020 (105 candidates identified from expert mapping) and May 24 to June 21, 2021 (217 candidates provided by the study sponsor). In total, 322 email invitations were sent out, of which 19 emails were undelivered.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112kmsV6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and initial threshold: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Because cough can spontaneously resolve within 4 weeks, the guideline does not advocate using medications or investigating all children at the 4-week timepoint other than with simple tests such as spirometry and a chest radiograph. Supporting the need for careful assessment, a serious potentially progressive underlying respiratory illness was documented in 18% of 346 children in a multicenter study using a cough algorithm, and new serious chronic lung disease was found in up to 30.8% of children with acute cough persisting > 4 weeks at a specialist hospital.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CL7RD]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough physiology and pathophysiology — conclusions emphasize that chronic cough is more often encountered as a clinical problem in older women and that physicians should recognize comorbidities when managing troublesome cough. Conditions associated with impairment in the nervous or muscular systems may contribute to deficits in cough mechanics, the consequences of which in some cases can be predicted by assessing cough peak flow (CPF) and other measures, and airway secretion properties may impact cough efficiency. Respiratory maneuvers and devices can augment CPF, whereas medications can modify the physical properties of secretions, and these approaches may be of particular help with cough efficiency in some patients, especially with neuromuscular weakness or with difficulty in sputum expectoration. Cough testing approaches vary greatly in the type of cough measured and reported measures, with most studies reporting CPF only, and in populations with ineffective cough there is reduced cough output as opposed to the hypersensitive, increased output seen with chronic cough. The focus with these populations is evaluating the ability to effectively clear the airways, there is critical need to develop therapeutic techniques with this goal, yet despite many airway clearance devices and medications there are few well-controlled randomized controlled trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness, and the design and delivery of such trials remain a priority. A heightened cough reflex sensitivity in women is widely reported but poorly understood, and creating normative values and a standardized methodology for CPF and other clinically meaningful cough metrics represent important knowledge gaps.

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^115j1sKh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 3, 2004); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2004); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (December 2003, http://www.update-software.com/National/nrr-frame.html). We also searched personal collections of references and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty four trials (17 in adults, seven in children) involving 3,392 people (2,876 adults and 516 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: 1. Antitussives: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two studies favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a third did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants: Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group. In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics: One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestants were significantly more effective than placebo in one of the studies, whereas the other did not show any difference between the study groups. 5. Other drug combinations: Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines: Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: 1. Antitussives: Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants: No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics: The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies showed no difference between antihistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations: One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. One study compared an antitussive/bronchodilator combination in children, which showed no difference between the treatment groups. 6. Antihistamines: In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, as identification of effective self-care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Identification of ineffective preparations could avoid costs for consumers and health care providers.

### Cough: new pharmacology [^115dRBLN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic coughing has a significant impact on the sufferer's quality of life. Despite this, licensed therapies are currently lacking, and until recently novel efficacious therapies for the treatment of chronic cough have remained elusive. In recent years, a first in class P2X3 antagonist has been found to be efficacious in patients with refractory chronic cough, stimulating much interest in the development of therapies for this problem. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of development of novel therapies acting both in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Most programs are focused on treating patients with refractory chronic cough, but chronic coughing is also a problem in common respiratory diseases in spite of standard care. However, unraveling of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cough will ultimately be needed to identify the relevant drug targets, better characterize patients, and match them to the most appropriate treatments.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^115Wgf3o]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cough is the most common symptom for which medical advice is sought. It is responsible for over 50% of new patient attendance in primary care and is the major source of consultation in pharmacy practice. Indeed, since symptomatic therapy is the mainstay of management of this generally benign and self-limiting illness, the pharmacist is the key player in the treatment of this condition.

Unfortunately, much of the over-the-counter (OTC) therapy currently recommended throughout Europe is based on custom and practice and is not supported by clinical studies of sufficient quality to meet the standards of modern evidence-based medicine. Here we review the diagnosis and therapeutic options available for the treatment of what is perhaps the most common ailment to afflict mankind.

### Over-the-counter cough and cold medications in children: are they helpful? [^115dHf8S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Over-the-counter cough/cold medications are commonly used in children. Recent recommendations by the Food and Drug Administration and changes to product labeling by cough/cold product manufacturers have reduced use of these products in children younger than four years of age. Data from controlled clinical trials of cough/cold product ingredients do not support their efficacy in young children. Serious adverse effects have been reported from cough/cold product use in infants and children, which largely result from inappropriate use by caregivers. Conservative therapies, including nasal suctioning, humidification, and nasal saline, should be recommended over cough/cold product use for infants and children. Otolaryngologists should educate caregivers of children on the safe and effective use of these products and therapies.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117E6Atf]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough in children — conclusions and management approach: Child-specific cough guidelines should be used for children aged ≤ 14 years and these differ from adults. All children with chronic cough should have a thorough clinical review to identify pointers suggestive of an underlying respiratory and/or systemic illness. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology and there is no evidence for using medications for symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, children must be followed up and medications ceased if there is no effect on the cough within an expected timeframe. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough negatively impacts the QoL of both the child and parents; education regarding when to look into and explore parental expectations and fears are often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^115eNAML]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — conclusions and research needs emphasize that there has been little change in treatment choices since the 2006 CHEST cough guidelines, many published studies are small with significant limitations and potential biases, and data pooling was generally not possible, making definitive recommendations difficult. The authors state they reviewed the available literature and, when possible, provided treatment recommendations, and they identified knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. Future priorities include a definition of CB with reliable and valid cough outcome measures and development of clinical studies to validate use of multi-ingredient prescription and nonprescription cough therapies.

### Cough and gastroesophageal reflux: identifying cough and assessing the efficacy of cough-modifying agents [^115DZ99s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

From a symptom research standpoint, much has been learned about the management of cough in general and cough caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease in particular. Yet, before further advances can be made in our understanding of how to best manage patients with this common symptom, methodologic challenges remain to be solved. One of the most basic is the development of valid and reliable methods by which to identify cough, assess its impact on patients, and assess the efficacy of cough therapies. Herein, we review the characteristics of cough that relate to its assessment and how the effect of drug treatment on cough has been assessed. Perspective is provided on evaluating the efficacy of cough-modifying agents and the optimal method for identifying a cough and linking it with a reflux event. Investigators should use both subjective and objective methods, because they have the potential to measure different aspects of cough. Subjective measures, such as a cough-specific quality-of-life instruments, are likely to best reflect the severity of cough from the patient's standpoint, because a subjective response most likely integrates both cough frequency and intensity. The ideal objective method should allow cough to be automatically counted over 24 hours in an ambulatory setting. Although it is theoretically possible to design and construct such a device that is also relatively unobtrusive, reliable, and accurate, one is not yet available.

### Guidelines for treating adults with acute cough… [^116fEyFX]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

This editorial highlights key recommendations for treating adult patients with acute cough. Figure 1 2 is an algorithm for the management of acute cough. |When cough is caused by the common cold, older anti-histamine/decongestant medications and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen are likely to be helpful; newer nonsedating antihistamines and over-the-counter combination cough medications are not likely to be helpful; antibiotics are not indicated. |. 4 Using this process, the committee's recommendations are stronger than Simasek and Blandino's, 1 who based their recommendations on Cochrane reviews. The committee strongly recommends that patients with acute cough from the common cold receive a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen unless there is a contraindication. 15 They also strongly recommend that newer-generation, nonsedating antihistamines should not be used because they are ineffective. 15 The committee does not recommend over-the-counter combination cold medications, except for those that contain older antihistamine/decongestant ingredients, until they are proved effective in randomized controlled trials. 16 A meta-analysis has called into question whether the presumed increased sedation effect of first-generation antihistamines compared with newer nonsedating antihistamines is substantiated by objective data and if it is clinically relevant.
17. Antibiotics are rarely effective for acute cough and are not indicated for acute cough from the common cold, acute bronchitis, asthma, mild exacerbations of chronic bronchitis related to smoking, or environmental irritants.

On the other hand, antibiotics are likely to be effective for conditions such as pneumonia, upper airway cough syndrome from bacterial sinusitis,… Bordetella pertussis infection in the lower respiratory tract, if given early in the illness, and for exacerbations of bronchiectasis and severe chronic bronchitis in current or previous smokers with severe airflow obstruction. 2 A history, physical examination, and selected diagnostic testing can help physicians accurately diagnose patients who will likely benefit from antibiotics. For example, cough will be at its worst during the first few days of a common cold when it is caused by an uncomplicated viral infection and will gradually and progressively improve over the next week or two.

### Cough: diagnosis and management… [^1154pf7d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

If the cough is due to the common cold, a first-generation antihistamine plus a decongestant should be prescribed. It has been shown that naproxen favorably affects cough. Newer-generation nonsedating antihistamines are not effective for reducing cough. Patients must be symptomatic for a least one week before a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is made, because prior to that point bacterial overgrowth is unlikely. Subacute Cough The first step in diagnosing subacute cough is to determine whether the cough has followed a respiratory infection. If the cough does not appear to be postinfectious, it should be managed as if it were a chronic cough. Bordetella pertussis, treatment with inhaled ipratropium should be initiated to attenuate the cough. If the cough persists, consider the use of inhaled corticosteroids. If the cough is severe, consider prescribing 30 to 40 mg of prednisone per day for a brief period.

When other treatments fail, codeine or dextromethorphan should be considered. UPPER AIRWAY COUGH SYNDROME–INDUCED CHRONIC COUGH Patients with chronic cough should first be treated with a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant. If the patient has complete or partial resolution of cough after one to two weeks of antihistamine/decongestant therapy, then it is assumed that upper airway cough syndrome was the cause and therapy should be continued. If the patient has persistent nasal symptoms, it is appropriate to begin a topical nasal steroid. If symptoms still persist, it is an indication for sinus imaging. ASTHMA-INDUCED CHRONIC COUGH It has been shown that bronchoprovocation is useful in the evaluation for cough caused by asthma. A positive challenge usually warrants trial treatment for asthma and clinical monitoring.

The majority of patients will respond to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and beta agonists after one week of therapy; it may take up to eight weeks for complete cough resolution. In patients who do not respond or cannot take inhaled medication, treatment with oral corticosteroids for five to 10 days is an option. Because oral leukotriene inhibitors may be effective, consideration should be given to adding a leukotriene inhibitor before an oral corticosteroid. If treatment for upper airway cough syndrome and asthma have both failed, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis should be considered next.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^1178JuvT]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel — acute cough due to the common cold — issues ungraded consensus-based suggestions as follows: For adult and pediatric patients, "we suggest against the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients, "we suggest against the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years), "we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), with the remark that "Infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms". In pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), "we suggest avoiding use of codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113axWHu]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — unexplained chronic cough (adult) management is summarized as follows: In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that unexplained chronic cough be defined as a cough that persists longer than 8 weeks, and remains unexplained after investigation, and supervised therapeutic trial(s) conducted according to published best-practice guidelines (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with chronic cough, we suggest that patients with chronic cough undergo a guideline/protocol based assessment process that includes objective testing for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilic bronchitis, or a therapeutic corticosteroid trial (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of multimodality speech pathology therapy (Grade 2C). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia (sputum eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide), we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids not be prescribed (Grade 2B). In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough, we suggest a therapeutic trial of gabapentin as long as the potential side effects and the risk-benefit profile are discussed with patients before use of the medication, and there is a reassessment of the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug (Grade 2C); remarks note that patients without contraindications to gabapentin can be prescribed a dose escalation schedule beginning at 300 mg once a day with additional doses being added each day as tolerated up to a maximum tolerable daily dose of 1,800 mg a day in two divided doses. In adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux disease, we suggest that proton pump inhibitor therapy not be prescribed (Grade 2C).

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^111kL97T]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) and other causes, airway clearance is one of the mainstays of management. We conducted a systematic review on airway clearance by using non-pharmacological methods as recommended by international guidelines to develop recommendations or suggestions to update the 2006 CHEST guideline on cough.

Methods

The systematic search for evidence examined the question, "Is there evidence of clinically important treatment effects for non-pharmacological therapies in cough treatment for patients with bronchiectasis?" Populations selected were all patients with bronchiectasis due to CF or non-CF bronchiectasis. The interventions explored were the non-pharmacological airway clearance therapies. The comparison populations included those receiving standard therapy and/or placebo. Clinically important outcomes that were explored were exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, and mortality.

Results

In both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis, there were systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews identified. Despite these findings, there were no large randomized controlled trials that explored the impact of airway clearance on exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, or mortality.

Conclusions

Although the cough panel was not able to make recommendations, they have made consensus-based suggestions and provided direction for future studies to fill the gaps in knowledge.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^114Xr2fx]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Two objective methods of assessing cough have been developed. First, in the 1950s, cough challenge was introduced and has been perfected as a highly accurate tool for assessing the cough reflex. The participant inhales an increasing concentration of a protussive substance such as citric acid or capsaicin — the pungent extract of red peppers. The effect of drug on their cough reflex sensitivity is then compared with that of placebo. This methodology is excellent at assessing the characteristics of the study drug, such as its time course, and is frequently used in the development of novel therapies; indeed, it is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the submission portfolio. However, it does not always correlate with subjective measures. For example, morphine has been demonstrated to have a highly effective activity in suppressing cough in some patients, but does not seem to alter cough reflex sensitivity.

The third is a recently developed modality of assessing cough using cough counting. It has required a number of strides in technical development, particularly in computing power, to establish a reliable methodology using cough counters. Cough counting is now recognised as the 'gold standard' for assessing antitussive efficacy by the FDA. Unfortunately, since it is a recently developed technique, very few of the current OTC antitussive medications have been studied using cough counting. Indeed, only a single agent, dextromethorphan, has been demonstrated to be efficacious in this arena.

It is best to consider the various methodologies for assessing cough as the three overlapping circles of Venn diagram (figure 1). Of the three, subjective measures have proven to be the least reliable and with a few notable exceptions have not been rigorously evaluated. We consider therefore that claims made of antitussive activity solely using subjective criteria provide insufficient evidence of efficacy, a view currently supported by the FDA.

The three methods for studying cough and the relationship between them. LCQ, Leicester cough questionnaire.

Therefore, in an attempt to promote rational prescribing, we have reviewed the evidence for frequently used treatments in acute cough, particularly from a European perspective. We examined three aspects of drug efficacy on acute cough: the effect on the cough reflex using cough challenge, and both objective (cough recording) and subjective (ie, symptom scores, specific quality of life tools) effects on clinical outcomes.

### Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of over the counter cough medicines for acute cough in adults [^112pi9bX]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether over the counter cough medicines are effective for acute cough in adults.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Search of the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group specialised register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, and the UK Department of Health National Research Register in all languages.

Included Studies

All randomised controlled trials that compared oral over the counter cough preparations with placebo in adults with acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection in ambulatory settings and that had cough symptoms as an outcome.

Results

15 trials involving 2166 participants met all the inclusion criteria. Antihistamines seemed to be no better than placebo. There was conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of antitussives, expectorants, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, and other drug combinations compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Over the counter cough medicines for acute cough cannot be recommended because there is no good evidence for their effectiveness. Even when trials had significant results, the effect sizes were small and of doubtful clinical relevance. Because of the small number of trials in each category, the results have to be interpreted cautiously.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^114QUpan]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a highly prevalent symptom in children of all ages and in different regions of the world. Pediatric cough is most commonly caused by acute viral respiratory tract infection, though it can be triggered by numerous conditions including bacterial infection, allergic response, and asthma. Pediatric cough has a major impact on sleep, school performance, and the ability to play and, therefore, has a negative influence on children's quality of life. Pediatric cough is also a source of stress and anxiety for parents, due to its impact on children's behavior (e.g. refusing food) and sleep patterns, and the often unwarranted fear that it will escalate into a more serious health condition. Thus, pediatric cough is a major driver to seek medical attention, and is associated with high costs resulting from physician visits, diagnostic tests, and medications, thereby placing a high burden on healthcare systems.

Various local, national, and international organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines in order to standardize the treatment of cough in adults and/or children. However, these guidelines vary in quality, and recommendations are often based on low-quality evidence (observational studies or expert consensus, as opposed to randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Cough is a symptom of multiple diseases and, therefore, is managed by a variety of disciplines. Furthermore, while guidelines for adults outnumber those for children, adult guidelines do not translate well to children. Overall, there are evidence gaps in the management of pediatric cough, particularly for acute pediatric cough. The aims of this study were to identify and present therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients, at an international level, and to consider the clinical studies required to address these unmet needs. The aims are addressed through a review of current literature on pediatric cough, and expert opinion collected using a questionnaire.
