## Question

What happens with you give a patient ART WITH A POSITIVE CRYPTO COCCAL ANTIGEN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what happens when a patient is given antiretroviral therapy (ART) while having a positive serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a positive serum CrAg means clinically and how urgently it changes management. Then, I should verify whether the patient has symptoms or signs of cryptococcal meningitis and whether a lumbar puncture has been done. Next, I will stratify by clinical scenario: asymptomatic antigenemia, cryptococcal meningitis, or non-CNS cryptococcosis. After that, I need to determine the timing of ART initiation for each scenario, including any exceptions. Finally, I should confirm antifungal regimens, monitoring, and how to handle IRIS if it occurs, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of a positive serum CrAg in HIV. A positive serum CrAg indicates disseminated cryptococcosis and carries a substantial risk of subclinical or overt cryptococcal meningitis; it may precede symptoms by weeks to months, so I should not dismiss it as "just a lab abnormality" and I must act promptly to exclude CNS disease and initiate appropriate therapy [^1118gLQ3] [^1132BTUv].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate next steps before talking about ART timing. I need to check for headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, altered mental status, and visual symptoms. If any are present, I should obtain an urgent lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement, CSF CrAg, India ink or Gram stain, cell count, glucose, protein, and culture, because elevated intracranial pressure and CNS involvement change both antifungal management and the timing of ART initiation [^112PxHJh] [^116BCvfJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk stratification by serum CrAg titer because it influences how aggressively I investigate and treat. Higher titers, particularly LFA ≥ 1:640 (EIA/latex ≥ 1:160), are associated with increased risk of mortality and progression to meningitis even without symptoms, so these patients warrant the same intensity of therapy as CNS disease if CSF is not available or if CNS disease is confirmed; lower titers, especially < 1:80 by LFA, may allow omission of LP in select low-risk, asymptomatic patients, but I need to ensure careful clinical judgment and shared decision-making [^117MBEKQ] [^116pnsXj] [^113G72kk].

> Now, for asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia with a negative lumbar puncture, I should confirm that immediate ART is appropriate. Yes — when CSF is normal and the patient is truly asymptomatic, guidelines support starting ART now and concurrently initiating preemptive fluconazole therapy to prevent progression, typically fluconazole 800–1,200 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 400–800 mg daily for 10 weeks, then 200 mg daily to complete 6 months total, alongside effective ART [^111pRz2U] [^113tLs11] [^116V6fCJ].

> But wait, what if cryptococcal meningitis is diagnosed or strongly suspected? I need to ensure I do not jump to early ART. In CNS cryptococcosis, ART should be deferred for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and early mortality; earlier initiation at 2 weeks is only considered in select high-resource settings with optimal induction therapy, negative CSF cultures, and close monitoring, and even then the balance of evidence favors delay in most patients [^111gLwRx] [^11316BLX] [^11753Xb5] [^111pRz2U].

> Let me consider non-CNS cryptococcosis next. For focal pulmonary disease or extrapulmonary non-CNS disease, I should confirm that ART timing is generally aligned with non-meningeal OIs: start ART within about 2 weeks of initiating antifungal therapy, while ensuring CSF has been evaluated to exclude occult CNS disease. If the serum CrAg titer is high (≥ 1:640 by LFA), treat with the same intensity as CNS disease even in the absence of meningitis symptoms, and coordinate ART timing accordingly [^111pRz2U] [^111azSaF] [^111MXTbJ].

> I should double-check the antifungal regimens because ART timing interacts with induction success. For cryptococcal meningitis, induction with amphotericin B plus flucytosine for at least 2 weeks is preferred. Consolidation with fluconazole 800 mg daily for at least 8 weeks follows, with maintenance fluconazole 200 mg daily for at least 12 months and discontinuation only after sustained immune recovery on ART. For asymptomatic antigenemia without CNS disease, fluconazole monotherapy as above is appropriate, and ART proceeds in parallel when safe [^114ez1Gc] [^1154T5F3] [^113uUcLE] [^116V6fCJ].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and avoid misinterpreting antigen titers. Serum and CSF CrAg can remain positive for weeks to months and should not be used to judge early treatment response. Instead, I should follow clinical status, repeat lumbar punctures to document CSF culture sterility, and manage elevated opening pressure proactively, as uncontrolled ICP is a major driver of early mortality and can mimic treatment failure [^117KcHxN] [^114CjuDB] [^116BCvfJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach if the patient deteriorates after ART is started. Worsening symptoms after ART initiation can reflect paradoxical IRIS or microbiologic failure; I need to check adherence, drug interactions, and obtain repeat LP with opening pressure and CSF culture, and if IRIS is likely, continue both ART and antifungals, treat elevated ICP, and consider a short tapering course of corticosteroids for severe IRIS, whereas culture-positive relapse requires antifungal escalation and susceptibility testing [^111g56w1] [^116Fch9N] [^115T8CeG].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting guidance about "immediate ART". Rapid ART is indeed recommended in most people with HIV, but cryptococcal meningitis is a key exception where a short, deliberate delay reduces harm. I should communicate this clearly to avoid inadvertently accelerating ART in a high-risk CNS scenario, while still ensuring ART is not delayed unnecessarily in non-CNS or asymptomatic cases where benefits outweigh risks [^111pRz2U] [^116TQvxx].

> Putting this together, my final algorithm is as follows: if serum CrAg is positive, I will urgently assess for CNS symptoms and perform LP when indicated. If CSF is normal and the patient is asymptomatic, I will start ART immediately and begin preemptive fluconazole. If cryptococcal meningitis is present, I will defer ART for 4–6 weeks while completing induction and consolidation antifungal therapy. If non-CNS cryptococcosis is diagnosed, I will start ART within about 2 weeks of antifungal initiation, escalating antifungal intensity when serum CrAg titers are high or dissemination is extensive, and I will monitor clinically and by CSF cultures rather than antigen titers to guide response [^111pRz2U] [^111gLwRx] [^111azSaF] [^117KcHxN].

If a patient has a positive cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test, **do not start ART immediately** if cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is suspected or confirmed; defer ART for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy to reduce the risk of severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and mortality [^111gLwRx] [^11753Xb5]. If the patient has **asymptomatic antigenemia without CNS disease**, start ART within 1–2 weeks alongside preemptive fluconazole [^111pRz2U] [^116V6fCJ]. Always perform a lumbar puncture to exclude CM before ART initiation, and monitor closely for IRIS after ART starts [^112PxHJh] [^113oeb3H].

## Clinical significance of a positive cryptococcal antigen test

A positive CrAg test indicates **cryptococcal infection** — most often Cryptococcus neoformans — and is common in people with advanced HIV (CD4 < 100 cells/mm³) [^113o8LfT]. It can reflect asymptomatic antigenemia or invasive disease, including meningitis, which carries high morbidity and mortality if untreated [^1118gLQ3].

---

## Risks associated with initiating ART in patients with positive cryptococcal antigen

Starting ART too early in patients with active cryptococcal infection — especially CM — can trigger **severe IRIS**, causing paradoxical worsening and increased mortality [^116Qs1fi]. IRIS is a major risk: it occurs in 10–30% of CM cases after ART initiation and can be fatal if not managed properly [^116Qs1fi] [^116HQkhm]. Early mortality is increased when ART is started within 1–2 weeks of antifungal therapy, particularly in resource-limited settings [^11753Xb5].

## Recommended timing of ART initiation in patients with positive cryptococcal antigen

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing of art initiation** |
|-|-|
| Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) | Defer ART for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy [^111gLwRx] [^11753Xb5] |
| Asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia (no CNS involvement) | Initiate ART within 1–2 weeks alongside preemptive fluconazole [^117XgYNP] |
| Non-CNS cryptococcal disease (e.g. pulmonary or cutaneous) | Initiate ART within 2–4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **WHO 2022 guidelines**: Strong recommendation to defer ART for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy in CM to reduce IRIS and mortality [^111gLwRx].
- **IAS–USA 2024 guidelines**: ART initiation 2–4 weeks after antifungal therapy in CM, earlier only if CSF cultures are negative and close monitoring is feasible [^111pRz2U].
- **ECMM/ISHAM 2024 guidelines**: Emphasize deferring ART until CSF sterility and clinical stability, typically 4–6 weeks [^1111zKbn].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications of early ART initiation

Early ART initiation in CM is associated with **higher IRIS incidence** and mortality, especially in the first 2–4 weeks [^11753Xb5]. Paradoxical worsening can occur despite microbiologic improvement, complicating management and increasing morbidity [^116HQkhm].

---

## Management strategies and precautions

- **Lumbar puncture**: Perform before ART to exclude CM in all patients with positive CrAg [^112PxHJh].
- **Preemptive therapy**: Start fluconazole for asymptomatic antigenemia to prevent progression [^117XgYNP].
- **Monitor for IRIS**: Watch closely after ART initiation; manage with continued ART and antifungals, and consider corticosteroids if severe [^111g56w1].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **individualize ART timing** with maternal–fetal medicine and infectious diseases input, balancing IRIS risk against perinatal transmission prevention [^113q8nej]. In pediatric patients, **follow adult guidance** but tailor decisions with pediatric HIV specialists [^115nXASq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **CM confirmed or suspected**: Defer ART 4–6 weeks after starting antifungal therapy [^111gLwRx].
- **Asymptomatic antigenemia**: Start ART within 1–2 weeks with preemptive fluconazole [^notfound].
- **Non-CNS disease**: Start ART within 2–4 weeks after antifungal therapy begins [^notfound].
- **Always exclude CM** with lumbar puncture before ART initiation [^112PxHJh].

---

Initiating ART in a patient with a positive CrAg requires **careful timing** to balance the risks of IRIS and mortality against the benefits of immune recovery. Defer ART in CM for 4–6 weeks; start within 1–2 weeks for asymptomatic antigenemia, and always exclude CNS disease before ART.

Coccidioidomycosis antigen detection — specimens and clinical utility: A coccidioidomycosis-specific antigen assay is commercially available and has been shown to detect antigen in urine, serum, and other body fluids, such as CSF, in samples from individuals with active coccidioidomycosis; the assay is most useful in diagnosing disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Detection of coccidioidal antigen in CSF has been reported to have a very high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing coccidioidal meningitis, but assessing therapeutic responses with this method is more difficult.

Cryptococcal meningitis in people with HIV — elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) risk and early therapeutic lumbar puncture: Elevated ICP can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and complications are more likely when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lumbar opening pressure is ≥ 25 cm CSF in the lateral decubitus position. Increased ICP was associated with 92% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. In a clinical trial, people with HIV who received at least one therapeutic lumbar puncture within 7 days after diagnosis (median time of 3 days) had a 69% relative reduction in the risk of death through 11 days, regardless of initial opening pressure. Those with symptoms and signs of increased ICP require immediate clinical intervention to reduce ICP.

HIV opportunistic infection consolidation therapy — timing, duration, and regimens: Consolidation Therapy (Duration of Therapy: ≥ 8 Weeks, Followed by Maintenance Therapy) advises to perform LP after 1 week and/or 2 weeks of induction therapy to document the culture is negative (AII); after 2 weeks of induction therapy, people who are clinically stable may be switched to consolidation therapy while awaiting culture results; and the duration of consolidation therapy should be for at least 8 weeks after receiving CSF culture at 2 weeks is negative (AII). The preferred regimen is fluconazole 800 mg PO daily (AI); for clinically stable patients, continue fluconazole 800 mg until CSF cultures are known to be sterile and ART has been initiated; dose then can be reduced to 400 mg PO daily (AII). If CSF remains positive in a clinically stable patient after 2 weeks of induction therapy, use one of the following two options for an additional 2 weeks before reducing the dose to fluconazole 800 mg PO daily: fluconazole 1,200 mg PO daily plus flucytosine 25 mg/kg PO four times a day (BIII), or fluconazole 1,200 mg PO daily for an additional 2 weeks (BIII). An alternative regimen is itraconazole 200 mg PO twice a day, if fluconazole is not available or not tolerated (CI).

Cryptococcal meningitis consolidation transition and monitoring: A lumbar puncture and repeat CSF culture should be performed after 1 week and/or 2 weeks of induction therapy in all patients (AII). After 2 weeks of induction therapy, clinically stable patients may be switched to consolidation therapy while awaiting CSF culture results. Successful induction therapy is defined as substantial clinical improvement and a negative CSF culture from the end-of-induction lumbar puncture. Serum or CSF CrAg may remain positive at 2 weeks and are not indicative of failure, and monitoring serum or CSF CrAg titers is of no value in determining initial response and is not recommended (AII). If new symptoms or clinical findings occur later, a repeat lumbar puncture with measurement of lumbar opening pressure and CSF culture should be performed.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV — antiretroviral therapy (ART) timing and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — is informed by adult data and a cautious directive: a randomized trial reported early combination ART (cART) "within the first 14 days of diagnosis" was "safe and resulted in less AIDS progression/death" versus deferred cART, whereas a Zimbabwe trial showed "higher mortality" when cART began "within 72 hours" compared with waiting "at least 10 weeks". In antiretroviral-naive patients newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis or disseminated disease, "delay in potent ART may be prudent until the end of the first 2 weeks of induction therapy (CIII); further delays in initiating cART, especially in resource-poor settings, should be individualized".

### Fluconazole [^1172a2E6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: The recommended fluconazole daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg, once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils cells/mm3) should start fluconazole prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia, and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells/mm3.

Dosage and Administration in Children:

The following dose equivalency scheme should generally provide equivalent exposure in pediatric and adult patients:

Experience with fluconazole in neonates is limited to pharmacokinetic studies in premature newborns. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .) Based on the prolonged half-life seen in premature newborns (gestational age 26 to 29 weeks), these children, in the first two weeks of life, should receive the same dosage (mg/kg) as in older children, but administered every 72 hours. After the first two weeks, these children should be dosed once daily. No information regarding fluconazole pharmacokinetics in full-term newborns is available.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Treatment should be administered for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Esophageal candidiasis: For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of fluconazole in children is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Doses up to 12 mg/kg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least 2 weeks following the resolution of symptoms. Systemic Candida infections: For the treatment of candidemia and disseminated Candida infections, daily doses of 6 to 12 mg/kg/day have been used in an open, noncomparative study of a small number of children.

Cryptococcal meningitis: For the treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis, the recommended dosage is 12 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 6 mg/kg once daily. A dosage of 12 mg/kg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. For suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in children with AIDS, the recommended dose of fluconazole is 6 mg/kg once daily.

### Fingolimod hcl (gilenya) [^113wmdhu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cases of Kaposi's sarcoma have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Kaposi's sarcoma is an angioproliferative disorder that is associated with infection with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). Patients with symptoms or signs consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma should be referred for prompt diagnostic evaluation and management.

Cryptococcal Infections

Cryptococcal infections, including cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated cryptococcal infections, have been reported with GILENYA in the postmarketing setting. Cryptococcal infections have generally occurred after approximately 2 years of GILENYA treatment, but may occur earlier. The relationship between the risk of cryptococcal infection and the duration of treatment is unknown. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with a cryptococcal infection should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment.

Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Antineoplastic, Immunosuppressive, or Immune-Modulating Therapies

In clinical studies, patients who received GILENYA did not receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of GILENYA with any of these therapies, and also with corticosteroids, would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

When switching to GILENYA from immune-modulating or immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects.

Varicella Zoster Virus Antibody Testing/Vaccination

Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating GILENYA. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with GILENYA, following which initiation of treatment with GILENYA should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Human Papilloma Virus Infection

Human papilloma virus (HPV) infections, including papilloma, dysplasia, warts, and HPV-related cancer, have been reported in patients treated with GILENYA in the postmarketing setting. Vaccination against HPV should be considered prior to treatment initiation with GILENYA, taking into account vaccination recommendations. Cancer screening, including Papanicolaou (Pap) test, is recommended as per standard of care for patients using an immunosuppressive therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^115nXASq]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation — pediatric HIV diagnosis: The Panel recommends rapid initiation of ART (defined as initiating ART immediately or within days of HIV diagnosis) for all children who receive an HIV diagnosis, regardless of clinical, immunologic, or virologic status, and the urgency of rapid ART initiation is especially critical for children aged < 1 year. The recommendation references initiation within days of birth for infants who are diagnosed with HIV at birth. In ART-naive children and adolescents with cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculous meningitis, or disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease, the Panel recommends initiation of treatment for the opportunistic infection first, before ART initiation, and timing of ART initiation in these cases should be discussed with a pediatric HIV specialist.

Cryptococcosis (non-CNS disease and asymptomatic antigenemia) — for non-CNS extrapulmonary or diffuse pulmonary disease, or people with non-CNS symptoms with normal CSF and serum CrAg ≥ 1:640 by LFA (or ≥ 1:160 by EIA or Latex Agglutination) (BII), treatment is the same as for CNS cryptococcosis. For non-CNS focal pulmonary infiltrates with mild symptoms, fluconazole 400 mg daily for 6 to 12 months (duration guided by symptom resolution) (BIII). For asymptomatic antigenemia without meningitis and serum CrAg < 1:640 by LFA (or < 1:160 by EIA or Latex Agglutination), fluconazole 800–1,200 mg PO daily for 2 weeks, followed by 400–800 mg PO daily for a total of 10 weeks, then fluconazole 200 mg PO daily for a total of 6 months plus effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) (BIII). People with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia, lower risk, and serum CrAg titer < 1:80 by LFA (or < 1:20 by EIA or latex agglutination) can be safely treated without lumbar puncture (AII); all others with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia should undergo CSF sampling to rule out CNS disease. All people with non-CNS extrapulmonary symptoms and cryptococcal antigenemia should have their CSF sampled to rule out CNS disease.

Cryptococcosis — diagnosis in people with HIV — is usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis and most commonly presents as subacute meningoencephalitis, and initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis generally shows mildly elevated protein levels, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and a variable pleocytosis mostly of lymphocytes. Some people with advanced HIV may have very few CSF inflammatory cells, and a Gram stain or an India ink preparation, if available, may reveal numerous yeast forms.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^111pRz2U]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

IAS–USA 2024 HIV — when to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) is summarized as follows: Initiation of ART is recommended as soon as possible after diagnosis, ideally within 7 days, including on the same day as diagnosis or at the first clinic visit if the individual is ready and there is no suspicion for a concomitant opportunistic infection; structural barriers that could delay receipt of ART and impede care engagement, continuous ART access, and ART adherence should be addressed using evidence informed strategies; initiation of ART at the time of diagnosis of acute HIV infection or in a person who is pregnant is recommended; and initiation of ART is recommended within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment for most opportunistic infections, with specific guidance as follows — active tuberculosis without tuberculosis meningitis: ART should be initiated within 2 weeks after initiation of tuberculosis treatment, especially for those with CD4+ cell count below 50/µL; tuberculosis meningitis: high-dose corticosteroids and tuberculosis treatment should be initiated immediately at diagnosis, and ART initiation is recommended when tuberculosis meningitis is under control, based on clinical improvement and changes toward normal in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, within 2 to 4 weeks thereafter; cryptococcal meningitis: for those who can be closely monitored and treated for increased intracranial pressure and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, ART initiation is recommended 2 to 4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy, with earlier initiation at 2 weeks for those who have no intracranial pressure, have negative CSF cultures with use of antifungal therapy, and can continue to be closely monitored, and 4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy for those who do not meet these criteria; asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia with a negative lumbar puncture: immediate ART and preemptive fluconazole are recommended; and newly diagnosed cancer: initiation of ART is recommended immediately with attention to drug interactions.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113oeb3H]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy for persons with acute opportunistic infections (OIs) and malignancies — clinical directives: Initiation of ART in the setting of an acute, AIDS-associated OI or malignancy can improve immune function and potentially enhance treatment success for the OI, and clinicians should refer to the Adult and Adolescent Opportunistic Infection Guidelines for a more in-depth discussion on specific OIs. When no effective therapy exists for the OI (e.g., cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), ART is the only treatment that can improve immune function and clinical outcomes and ART should be initiated without delay. For immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) concerns, for some OIs such as cryptococcal and tuberculosis meningitis, immediate ART initiation may increase the risk of serious IRIS and a short delay before initiating ART may be warranted, and after ART initiation patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms associated with IRIS. For nonmeningeal tuberculosis, initiating ART during treatment for TB confers a significant survival advantage; therefore, ART should be initiated as recommended in Tuberculosis/HIV Coinfection. For people with mild to moderate cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma, prompt initiation of ART alone without chemotherapy has been associated with improvement of cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions, even though initial transient progression as a manifestation of IRIS can also occur. For people with other OIs, after starting treatment for the OI, ART should be initiated as soon as feasible to improve immune function. For patients with malignancies that require chemotherapy, a diagnosis of malignancy should not delay initiation of ART, nor should initiation of ART delay treatment for the malignancy, and although an IRIS-like presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after initiation of ART has been described, ART-mediated viral suppression is associated with longer survival among individuals undergoing treatment for AIDS-related lymphoma.

Cryptococcal meningitis and timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — trial data — show controversy and risks with very early ART. Optimal timing for ART initiation in patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis is controversial, with one randomized, controlled trial including 35 patients suggesting ART was safe when started within the first 14 days of diagnosis, but another African study finding significantly worse outcomes in 54 patients started within 72 hours compared with delay for at least 10 weeks. In a randomized clinical trial at 2 African sites, starting ART within 1 to 2 weeks (median 8 days) versus deferring until 5 weeks (median 36 days) during induction with deoxycholate amphotericin B (0.7–1.0 mg/kg daily) plus 800 mg of fluconazole daily resulted in a significant increase in 6-month mortality in the early ART group (45% vs 30%, P = 0.03), most pronounced during the first 8 to 30 days (P = 0.007), especially when the CSF white cell count was < 5 cells/μL (P = 0.008). The excess deaths were attributed to cryptococcosis, but whether due to meningitis or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is unclear.

Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing in HIV — CSF CrAg is usually positive in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, but early meningitis can present with negative CSF studies and a positive CrAg in blood only. Thus, serum CrAg testing always should be performed in an immunocompromised individual with an unknown CNS disorder; serum CrAg is positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal cryptococcal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset, and all positive CrAg tests in patients with HIV require consideration for therapy.

Monitor for clinical relapse and investigate causality — investigations should include CT or MRI of the brain, lumbar puncture for opening pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses including microscopy and culture; review adherence to antifungal therapy, antiretroviral therapy (ART), immunosuppressants, and other medications and consider drug–drug interactions, with therapeutic drug monitoring if applicable and optimisation of underlying diseases. The use of follow-up blood or CSF cryptococcal antigen (including monitoring of titres) for clinical decision making is discouraged, and do not escalate antifungal therapy for persistent blood antigenaemia, persistently positive CSF cryptococcal antigen, visible cryptococci in CSF (without culture positivity), or abnormal CSF microscopy or biochemistry because these are not necessarily indicators of microbiological failure. Evaluate for drug adherence, drug–drug interactions, and drug resistance in people with culture-positive (microbiological) persistence or relapse.

People with TB meningitis — ART timing and risks: In a Vietnamese trial, people with HIV-associated TB meningitis randomized to immediate ART versus ART deferred until 2 months after initiation of TB treatment had a significantly higher rate of severe (Grade 4) adverse events with immediate ART (80.3% vs. 69.1%; P = 0.04). Despite these results, many experts would recommend initiating ART early in settings where close monitoring is feasible (BIII). The guideline also states that ART should be started after TB meningitis is under control and after at least 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment to reduce the risk of life-threatening inflammation due to immune reconstitution (AIII), and expert consultation is advised (AIII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcosis in HIV — diagnosis and screening: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generally demonstrates mildly elevated levels of serum protein, low-to-normal glucose concentrations, and pleocytosis consisting mostly of lymphocytes, and the opening pressure in the CSF may be elevated, with pressures ≥ 25 cm H2O occurring in 60% to 80% of patients. Cryptococcal disease can be diagnosed through culture, CSF microscopy, or by cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) detection; in patients with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis, 55% of blood cultures and 95% of CSF cultures are positive and visible colonies can be detected within 7 days. India ink staining of CSF demonstrates encapsulated yeast in 60% to 80% of cases. CSF CrAg is usually positive in patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, serum CrAg is usually positive in both meningeal and non-meningeal infections and may be present weeks to months before symptom onset, and a positive serum CrAg should prompt a lumbar puncture to rule out meningeal disease. Three methods exist for antigen detection — latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassays, and lateral flow assay — and testing for the antigen in the serum is a useful initial screening tool in diagnosing cryptococcosis in HIV-infected patients and may be particularly useful when a lumbar puncture is delayed or refused.

HIVMA/IDSA primary care — evidence summary on Rapid ART (antiretroviral therapy) and stigma mitigation notes that "Initiating ART on the day of or within 7 days of diagnosis is considered Rapid ART", and that "ART should be offered unless a clinical concern exists that warrants delaying ART initiation, such as cryptococcal or tuberculous meningitis, or if the patient expresses a desire to delay therapy". "Structural, systemic, or programmatic barriers that would impede Rapid ART should be removed", and "Delay from diagnosis to the initial appointment for HIV care has been shown to be a predictor of failure to engage in care, which Rapid ART mitigates". Clinicians "should emphasize that viral suppression not only improves the patient's health but prevents HIV transmission to others", with "Undetectable = Untransmittable (U = U) messaging… welcomed and encouraged… and should be part of routine messaging in the clinic". Inclusive communication is urged: "people-first language… and gender-affirming language should be used", and clinicians should disseminate knowledge "that risk of transmission in healthcare settings is < 1% with no reports of healthcare transmission in the modern ART and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) era". Procedure decisions "should not depend on the CD4 cell count or HIV RNA level alone", and "people with HIV can be considered as both recipients and donors in solid organ transplantation, and HIV alone should not be an exclusionary factor".

Coccidioidomycosis prevention and pre-emptive therapy in adults and adolescents with HIV — yearly or twice-yearly serological testing for coccidioidomycosis should be considered for serologically negative individuals with HIV who live in endemic areas (BIII), and both IgM and IgG antibody testing using either an EIA or ID technique are recommended (BIII). Primary antifungal prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy is not recommended for individuals with HIV and low CD4 counts who live in endemic areas and who have negative serologic tests for Coccidioides (AIII). In people with a CD4 count < 250 cells/mm3 who previously tested negative, a new positive serological test suggests possible active disease and should prompt further clinical evaluation; if no signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities compatible with active coccidioidomycosis are identified, pre-emptive antifungal therapy with fluconazole 400 mg daily is recommended for those with a new positive serological test and CD4 counts < 250 cells/mm3 (AIII), with preferred therapy fluconazole 400 mg PO once daily (AIII). Discontinuation of primary prophylaxis/pre-emptive therapy is tied to CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm3 with virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (BIII), and this regimen should be continued until the CD4 count is ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and virologic suppression is documented (BIII).

Antiretroviral therapy initiation in hospitalized people with HIV — The Panel recommends initiating ART during hospitalization whenever possible (BIII). Certain situations, such as in the setting of TB meningitis or cryptococcal meningitis, may warrant a short delay in ART initiation due to concerns of severe consequences related to paradoxical IRIS; however, in most other situations, the benefits of starting ART during hospitalization outweigh the concerns. A multicenter study that enrolled hospitalized people with HIV from 2012 to 2014 demonstrated that starting ART in hospitalized patients who had a recent history of substance use was associated with shorter time to linkage to their first HIV clinical appointment after discharge and more clinic visits in the first 12 months after ART initiation than those who were not started on ART before discharge; however, no difference was observed in the rate of viral suppression and retention in care over 12 months.

Timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV/cryptococcal meningitis — trial regimens and suggested timing windows are described with remaining uncertainties. Randomised trials used induction regimens including fluconazole (800 mg daily) monotherapy, amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg daily, and amphotericin B 0.7–1 mg/kg daily and fluconazole 800 mg daily for 2 weeks. These data seem to suggest that initiating ART within 2 weeks of cryptococcal meningitis presentation is too early in the setting of suboptimal antifungal therapy, and that delaying ART initiation for 4–6 weeks reduces the incidence of C-IRIS and death; CSF sterility before ART commencement might be another factor. A retrospective analysis of combined cohorts in high-income settings did not show higher mortality in those receiving early ART in the first two weeks compared with those with delayed therapy, and early ART in high-income settings will need careful justification and close monitoring. There are no studies for timing ART initiation in other forms of cryptococcosis, those with cryptococcal antigenaemia, or those recommencing ART after a period of interruption, and whether those presenting with cryptococcal meningitis within 2 weeks of starting ART require withholding of ART is uncertain.

Special considerations regarding ART initiation for cryptococcal meningitis state that ART initiation generally is deferred for 4 to 6 weeks after antifungal agents are started for treatment of CNS cryptococcosis (AI). In an African randomized trial, starting ART within 1 to 2 weeks (median 9 days) versus delaying 4 to 6 weeks (median 36 days) while receiving amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg once daily plus fluconazole 800 mg once daily led to higher 6-month mortality in the early ART group (45% vs. 30%, P = 0.03), with excess deaths most pronounced during the first 8 to 30 days (P = 0.007) and greater among those with CSF white cell count < 5 cells/µL (P = 0.008). In China, 102 participants were randomized to start ART within 2 to 5 weeks or > 5 weeks after antifungal therapy; although the primary analysis found no significant mortality difference, a secondary analysis of 78 patients showed excess risk of death with earlier ART within 5 to 10 weeks of antifungal initiation. An observational cohort using marginal structural modeling identified 630 people with HIV; among 198 eligible, 145 started ART during meningitis treatment, and initiating within 14 days versus 14 to 56 days yielded 13 versus 20 deaths with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.40 (0.66–2.95), with authors concluding there was "little evidence that earlier ART was associated with higher mortality". Therefore, most experts aim to start ART within 4 weeks of antifungal therapy.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — epidemiology and prevention in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis state that an estimated 10 to 30% of people with HIV who have cryptococcal meningitis experience IRIS after initiation or reinitiation of effective ART and both unmasking (before start of antifungal therapy) or paradoxical (after start of antifungal therapy) IRIS may occur. People with HIV who have cryptococcal IRIS are more likely to be ART naive and those whose CSF has less inflammation on presentation seem to be at higher risk of cryptococcal IRIS. The risk of IRIS can be minimized by achieving CSF culture sterility before starting ART, using fluconazole 800 mg per day as consolidation therapy, and deferring ART initiation for 4 to 6 weeks from the start of antifungal therapy (AII).

Cryptococcosis — preventing disease in HIV-infected adults and adolescents is characterized by low overall incidence in the United States, but among patients with CD4 counts ≤ 100 cells/μL the prevalence of cryptococcal antigenemia is 2.9%, increasing to 4.3% for CD4 counts ≤ 50 cells/μL; routine serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing in newly diagnosed persons with no overt clinical signs of meningitis is recommended by some experts for CD4 counts ≤ 100 cells/μL, particularly when CD4 counts are ≤ 50 cells/μL, and a positive test should prompt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation. Prospective, controlled trials indicate that prophylactic fluconazole or itraconazole can reduce primary disease in patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/μL, but in the United States primary prophylaxis in the absence of a positive serum cryptococcal antigen test is not recommended because of infrequency, lack of survival benefit, drug interactions, potential antifungal resistance, and cost (BII). Patients with isolated cryptococcal antigenemia without meningitis can be treated similarly to those with focal pulmonary cryptococcosis.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Cryptococcal meningitis: In a multicenter study comparing fluconazole (200 mg/day) to amphotericin B (0.3 mg/kg/day) for treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS, a multivariate analysis revealed three pretreatment factors that predicted death during the course of therapy: abnormal mental status, cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen titer greater than 1:1024, and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count of less than 20 cells/mm3. Mortality among high risk patients was 33% and 40% for amphotericin B and fluconazole patients, respectively (p = 0.58), with overall deaths 14% (9 of 63 subjects) and 18% (24 of 131 subjects) for the 2 arms of the study (p = 0.48). Optimal doses and regimens for patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis and at high risk for treatment failure remain to be determined. (Saag, et al. N Engl J Med 1992; 326:83–9.) Vaginal candidiasis: Two adequate and well-controlled studies were conducted in the U.S. using the 150 mg tablet. In both, the results of the fluconazole regimen were comparable to the control regimen (clotrimazole or miconazole intravaginally for 7 days) both clinically and statistically at the one month post-treatment evaluation.

The therapeutic cure rate, defined as a complete resolution of signs and symptoms of vaginal candidiasis (clinical cure), along with a negative KOH examination and negative culture for Candida (microbiologic eradication), was 55% in both the fluconazole group and the vaginal products group.

Approximately three-fourths of the enrolled patients had acute vaginitis (< 4 episodes/12 months) and achieved 80% clinical cure, 67% mycologic eradication, and 59% therapeutic cure when treated with a 150 mg fluconazole tablet administered orally. These rates were comparable to control products. The remaining one-fourth of enrolled patients had recurrent vaginitis (≥ 4 episodes/12 months) and achieved 57% clinical cure, 47% mycologic eradication, and 40% therapeutic cure. The numbers are too small to make meaningful clinical or statistical comparisons with vaginal products in the treatment of patients with recurrent vaginitis.

Substantially more gastrointestinal events were reported in the fluconazole group compared to the vaginal product group. Most of the events were mild to moderate. Because fluconazole was given as a single dose, no discontinuations occurred.

The routine use of high-dose dexamethasone in cryptococcal meningitis is not recommended. Maintenance therapy may be ceased after 12 months in patients aviremic on ART with a CD4 count more than 100 cells per mm3, and maintenance should be restarted if CD4 count drops to less than 100 cells per mm3.

Cryptococcal persistence, clinical relapse, and culture-positive relapse (panel 11) — management directives include: Think broadly and investigate thoroughly for causality (CNS or non-CNS and infective or non-infective) in cases of apparent clinical relapse; investigations should include brain CT or MRI, lumbar puncture for opening pressure, and CSF analyses, including microscopy and culture. Review adherence to antifungal therapy, ART, immunosuppressants, and other medications and consider drug–drug interactions; perform therapeutic drug monitoring if applicable. Optimise control of underlying diseases. Consider escalating antifungal therapy while awaiting CSF results (and de-escalate if culture-negative). The use of follow-up blood or CSF cryptococcal antigen (including monitoring of titres) for clinical decision making is discouraged. Do not escalate antifungal therapy for persistent blood antigenaemia, persistently positive CSF cryptococcal antigen, visible cryptococcus in CSF (without culture positivity), or abnormal CSF microscopy or biochemistry; these are not necessarily indicators of microbiological failure. For culture-positive persistent or relapsed infection, antifungal susceptibility testing should be done concurrently on all initial and relapse isolates; an increase in fluconazole MIC of more than two dilutions is considered concerning for the potential development of drug resistance, and reinduction with a more optimal regimen (guided by antifungal susceptibility testing) should be considered.

Immunosuppressive therapy in HIV with prior hepatitis B virus exposure — screening, ART backbone, and prophylaxis are outlined as follows: Individuals with HIV infection undergoing immunosuppressive therapy should have HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs testing, and since tenofovir/emtricitabine is a preferred antiretroviral therapy (ART) backbone, it is prudent to start or modify ART to include these drugs before initiating immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, or immunomodulatory therapy in patients with HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc positive disease (BIII). If tenofovir/emtricitabine cannot be used, these patients could either receive entecavir for anti-HBV prophylaxis or be monitored and given entecavir if signs of HBV reactivation occur (increase in HBV DNA or HBsAg seroreversion) (BIII), and the option to give pre-emptive entecavir prophylaxis is preferred if HBV DNA is detectable or if immunosuppression is more severe, such as with anti-CD20 antibodies (BIII). The panel agrees to continue treatment for 6 months after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy and for 12 months in the setting of anti-CD20 antibodies (BIII). Even in patients with HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc positive disease, HBV reactivation occurs in 8% to 18% of those receiving anti-cancer drugs and 1.7% of those receiving rheumatologic disease drugs, underscoring risk during immunosuppression.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell and lentiviral-based gene therapy — HIV NAT interpretation requires caution because recent reports indicate that these vectors may interfere with long terminal repeat genomes in HIV NAT results and, thus, produce false-positive results, and routine HIV-1 NAT results may give rise to false results. In addition, lentiviral vector–based gene therapy as treatment for severe combined immunodeficiency can give rise to false-positive HIV NAT results, and laboratories should, therefore, have appropriate alternate HIV-1 NAT resulting platforms made available for this emerging patient population.

screening for CrAg among people presenting to HIV centres, combined with oral antifungal treatment for those who screen CrAg-positive, can therefore decrease the risk of cryptococcal meningitis and death. CrAg screening has now been recommended in the national HIV guidelines of 28 countries and screening programmes are being rolled out across sub-. Saharan Africa. However, there is now also evidence showing that CrAg-positive patients who are treated with fluconazole alone have a 2. 5 to 3 times higher chance of dying compared to people with similar CD4 counts who test CrAg-negative, despite receiving this antifungal treatment. Up to 40% of. people testing blood CrAg-positive may have asymptomatic cryptococcal meningitis diagnosed at the time of the screening test; these people need a combination of antifungal medicines to treat meningitis.

Yet many patients decline the procedure to diagnose meningitis and are thus not treated appropriately for meningitis. and a CrAg-positive blood test in Tanzania, South Africa and Vietnam.

Cryptococcosis IRIS management in adults and adolescents with HIV — continue both ART and antifungal therapy and reduce elevated intracranial pressure if present (AII); while diagnostic tests are pending, escalating antifungal therapy, such as restarting amphotericin B therapy or increasing fluconazole to 1,200 mg per day, is recommended (BIII). In severe IRIS, some experts recommend a brief taper of corticosteroids with dosages that commonly start at 1.0 mg/kg per day of prednisone, and serum C‑reactive protein is generally elevated at IRIS onset and will decrease with corticosteroid therapy, allowing empirical monitoring of resolution. Once clinical improvement is evident, fluconazole at consolidation doses should be continued or restarted upon hospital discharge (BIII). For non-meningeal cryptococcosis, the risk of IRIS appears lower and less severe than in cryptococcal meningitis; management is similar, including continuing ART, initiating or continuing antifungal therapy (AIII), and only considering corticosteroids if symptoms are severe (CIII).

Tuberculosis/HIV coinfection — antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in active tuberculosis (TB) is guided by CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell count and clinical context: All people with HIV and active TB who are not on ART should be started on ART (AI). For CD4 cell count ≤ 50 cells/mm3, initiate ART as soon as possible, but within 2 weeks of starting TB treatment (AI). For CD4 counts ≥ 50 cells/mm3, initiate ART within 2 to 8 weeks of starting TB treatment (AI). During pregnancy, regardless of CD4 count, initiate ART as early as feasible for treatment of the person with HIV and prevention of HIV transmission to the infant (AIII). With TB meningitis, initiate ART after TB meningitis is under control and after at least 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment to reduce the risk of life-threatening inflammation in a closed space as a result of immune reconstitution (AIII).

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) — assessment schedule and tools: Treatment response should be monitored with clinical examination and MRI, and in patients with detectable JCV DNA in CSF before antiretroviral therapy, quantitation of CSF JCV DNA may prove useful to follow for assessing response. No clear guidelines exist for follow-up timing; it is reasonable to be guided by clinical progress, and clinical deterioration is often seen before stabilization and improvement. In patients who appear stable or improved, neuroimaging can be obtained 6 to 8 weeks after ART initiation to screen for radiographic signs of progression or immune response and to provide a further baseline for later scans if deterioration occurs.

Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV — timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after diagnosis is mixed in adult studies, and in antiretroviral-naive patients delay may be prudent. One randomized adult trial including 35 patients suggested that early combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) within the first 14 days was safe with less AIDS progression/death versus deferred therapy, whereas another trial reported higher mortality when starting within 72 hours compared with waiting at least 10 weeks; accordingly, in ARV-naive patients newly diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis or disseminated disease, delay in potent ART may be prudent until the end of the first 2 weeks of induction therapy (CIII), with further delays individualized, especially in resource-poor settings.

Cryptococcosis — persistence, clinical relapse, and culture-positive relapse describes differential causes and test limitations. Distinguishing clinical relapse from persistent cryptococcal infection is challenging. Clinical relapse can be due to a microbiological relapse, C-IRIS, raised intracranial pressure (whether related to C-IRIS or not), or other infective and non-infective (CNS and non-CNS) causes. Cryptococcal antigen persists in the CSF and blood, thus it has little clinical utility in distinguishing clinical responders from non-responders. Most cases of culture-positive (microbiological) relapse occur early and result from inadequate or suboptimal induction therapy or early discontinuation of consolidation or maintenance therapy.

If ART is started sooner than generally recommended, close monitoring for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) should be implemented with a low threshold for treatment for IRIS. During pregnancy, the risk of IRIS associated with non CNS cryptococcosis appears to be lower, and a delay in ART initiation of no longer than 2 weeks after starting antifungal therapy is recommended.

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) in cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure (ICP) management, procedures, and medication guidance: ICP elevations can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and they are more likely to occur if the CSF opening lumbar pressure is ≥ 25cm H2O; in 1 large clinical trial, increased ICP was associated with 93% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of therapy and 40% of deaths during weeks 3 to 10. Lumbar opening pressure should be measured in all patients with cryptococcal meningitis at the time of diagnosis. Drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture is recommended for initial management, and one approach is to remove a volume of CSF (typically 20–30 mL) that at least halves the opening pressure and repeat daily until symptoms and signs consistently improve. CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate repeated lumbar punctures or in whom signs and symptoms of cerebral edema persist after multiple lumbar taps (BIII). Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP and are not recommended (AIII), and acetazolamide should not be used as therapy for increased ICP management since it may cause hyperchloremic acidosis and does not result in a decrease in ICP (AI). A randomized study compared a 6-week course of a tapering dose of dexamethasone among 451 Asian and African patients with HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis who received amphotericin B deoxycholate plus fluconazole; compared to placebo, there was no improvement in survival at 10 weeks and dexamethasone was associated with more adverse events, supporting that corticosteroids should not routinely be used during induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis unless they are being used for IRIS (AI). After the first 2 weeks of treatment, many experts would advocate a repeat lumbar puncture; even with clinical improvement, positive CSF cultures after 2 weeks of therapy are predictive of future relapse, and some experts would continue amphotericin B plus flucytosine until the CSF cultures are negative (BIII). Monitoring titers of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in serum or CSF is of no value in determining response to therapy and is not recommended, and if new symptoms or clinical findings occur later, a repeat lumbar puncture with measurement of opening lumbar pressure and CSF culture should be performed. Patients treated with amphotericin B formulations should be monitored for dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances, and pre-infusion administration of 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline appears to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV — definition, risk factors, presentation, timing, and management — is described as a paradoxical worsening of clinical status related to recovery of the immune system after initiation of ART, with mycobacterial infections, particularly M. tuberculosis and MAC, most frequent and fungal (Cryptococcus, PCP) and viral (cytomegalovirus) infections also associated; initiating ART in close proximity to treatment for an acute opportunistic infection increases risk of IRIS, patients who develop IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive at ART initiation, and lower CD4+ cell counts are also associated. Common presenting symptoms consist of fever and lymphadenopathy with chest radiographic patterns including pulmonary infiltrates, nodules or masses, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion, and diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion of other causes; the majority of IRIS cases occur within the first 1 to 3 months after ART initiation. Most cases are mild and outcomes are generally good with supportive therapy; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids may be used, patients on ART can continue their regimens, and when to start ART in patients with opportunistic infections remains controversial although early ART may be beneficial, with caution that timing in critically ill patients is not well studied and may carry potential harm from ART-related toxicity or inflammatory reactions.

Cryptococcal meningitis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — frequency, features, and management: An estimated 30% of HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis experience IRIS after initiation or reinitiation of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients with cryptococcal IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive, have higher HIV RNA levels, and have less cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammation at presentation; risk may be decreased when CSF cultures are negative at ART initiation. Cryptococcal IRIS presents with worsening clinical disease despite microbiological evidence of effective antifungal therapy, whereas treatment failure has continued positive cultures. The appropriate management strategy for IRIS is to continue both ART and antifungal therapy and reduce elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), if present (AII); some specialists recommend a brief course of glucocorticosteroids for severe symptoms (CIII). With non-meningeal cryptococcosis, IRIS risk appears lower and may present as lymphadenitis, cutaneous abscesses, or bony lesions; management is similar, including continuing ART, initiating or continuing antifungal therapy (AIII), and considering glucocorticoids (CIII).
