## Question

What is ttp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what TTP is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acronym and its full definition. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology, especially the role of ADAMTS13 and von Willebrand factor. Next, I will classify the etiologies into congenital versus immune-mediated forms. After that, I need to review the clinical presentation and the classic pentad, while remembering how often it is incomplete. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic approach, including ADAMTS13 testing and the need to act before results return. Next, I will examine evidence-based treatment, including plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab, and consider special populations like pregnancy. Finally, I should review prognosis, relapse risk, and long-term complications, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these pieces together.

> Let me first confirm the acronym and basic definition. TTP stands for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, and ischemic organ injury due to microvascular platelet-rich thrombi, historically described by Moschcowitz in 1924 [^112qYjjG] [^1123wBQV].

> I need to check the core pathophysiology next. The central mechanism is severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, the von Willebrand factor–cleaving protease, which normally proteolyzes ultra-large VWF multimers under shear stress; when ADAMTS13 activity is very low, these ultra-large VWF strings drive platelet aggregation and microthrombi, producing thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and organ ischemia, so ADAMTS13 deficiency is both mechanistic and diagnostic in the right clinical context [^112qYjjG] [^112jAZWF] [^115VBC4F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I should classify the etiologies. There are two principal forms: congenital TTP due to biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations with absent or dysfunctional protein, and immune-mediated TTP due to autoantibodies that inhibit or clear ADAMTS13; a third proposed category, acquired TTP of unidentified pathophysiology, reflects severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without detectable antibodies in contexts like sepsis, cancer, or liver failure, though some such cases later reveal antibodies and may be misclassified initially [^111rSfmS] [^112qYjjG] [^1157CuU7] [^1177FLjK].

> Let me consider the clinical presentation carefully. The classic pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic abnormalities, and renal dysfunction is now rarely complete at presentation; most patients have thrombocytopenia and hemolysis with variable neurologic and cardiac involvement, and renal failure is less prominent in TTP than in HUS, so I should avoid anchoring on the full pentad and instead prioritize the core features and organ involvement patterns [^113KCWZS] [^112qYjjG] [^117B5rWb].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I don't delay life-saving therapy. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by CBC showing thrombocytopenia, a peripheral smear with schistocytes, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin, and normal coagulation tests; ADAMTS13 activity less than 10% strongly supports TTP in the right context, but results are often delayed, so guidelines advise initiating plasma exchange and corticosteroids without waiting for ADAMTS13 when suspicion is high, and using clinical prediction tools like PLASMIC to estimate pretest probability while arranging urgent hematology consultation and transfer to centers with apheresis capability [^115zsjG4] [^113TAd2M] [^112zky1Q] [^11473bnD] [^1121AvPj].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and how it changes management. TTP must be distinguished from complement-mediated HUS, DIC, malignant hypertension, drug-induced TMA, and transplant-associated TMA; ADAMTS13 activity helps, as normal or mildly reduced activity argues against TTP and should redirect toward alternative TMA etiologies, whereas severe deficiency supports TTP and justifies plasma exchange and immunosuppression while other evaluations proceed [^112eiwWp] [^112qYjjG] [^117B5rWb].

> I will now examine treatment, and I need to ensure I sequence therapies correctly. The cornerstone is urgent therapeutic plasma exchange with plasma replacement, ideally initiated within 4–8 hours of suspected diagnosis; adjunct immunosuppression with corticosteroids is recommended for immune-mediated TTP, rituximab reduces relapse and is increasingly used early or preemptively in persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency, and caplacizumab, an anti-VWF nanobody, shortens time to platelet recovery and is recommended to be added on confirmation of iTTP and continued for about 30 days after plasma exchange; for congenital TTP, plasma infusion or recombinant ADAMTS13 are used acutely and for prophylaxis, with rADAMTS13 now preferred for prophylaxis in remission when available [^1121AvPj] [^114TCXSb] [^111DeWCj] [^114jMCbH] [^117JYDM6] [^115PXxrK].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I should double-check special considerations. In pregnancy, treat suspected iTTP with plasma exchange and corticosteroids as first-line, consider rituximab when necessary, and provide prophylactic plasma infusion for cTTP; for asymptomatic iTTP with low ADAMTS13, prophylactic rituximab may be considered outside pregnancy, whereas in pregnancy prophylactic plasma exchange is favored, and for cTTP, prophylactic plasma infusion or rADAMTS13 is recommended during pregnancy to prevent acute episodes [^1173f4sQ] [^114TCXSb] [^1172oBQo] [^11437cYT] [^115NZL7P].

> I should confirm prognosis and long-term risks next. Historically fatal, TTP now has acute survival exceeding 90–95% in many centers due to early plasma exchange and modern immunotherapy, but relapse occurs in roughly 30–50% and is linked to persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency; long-term neurocognitive impairment, depression, and increased cardiovascular risk are common, so lifelong follow-up with periodic ADAMTS13 monitoring is advised to guide preemptive therapy and detect relapse early [^1123wBQV] [^113JhDqB] [^112E4Jne] [^117C1oHH].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, leading to ultra-large VWF–driven platelet microthrombi, presenting with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis with variable neurologic and cardiac involvement; diagnosis is clinical with supportive labs and ADAMTS13 testing, but treatment must begin urgently with plasma exchange and immunosuppression when suspected, and newer targeted therapies like caplacizumab and rADAMTS13 have further improved outcomes, while relapse prevention hinges on vigilant ADAMTS13 surveillance and risk-adapted prophylaxis [^112qYjjG] [^114TCXSb] [^111DeWCj] [^117JYDM6].

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a **life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy** [^112qYjjG] caused by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, leading to microvascular platelet-rich thrombi, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [^112qYjjG]. It presents with neurologic deficits, renal dysfunction, and ischemic injury; **prompt plasma exchange** [^114TCXSb] and immunosuppression are essential to reduce mortality [^117NgZt3]. Caplacizumab [^111DeWCj] and rituximab improve outcomes, and recombinant ADAMTS13 is now available for congenital TTP [^117JYDM6]. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent death and organ damage [^116JMXAd].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **ADAMTS13 deficiency**: Severe deficiency (< 10% activity) allows ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers to persist, driving platelet aggregation and microthrombi [^112qYjjG] [^11473bnD].

- **Immune-mediated TTP (iTTP)**: Autoantibodies inhibit or clear ADAMTS13; most common in adults [^112qYjjG] [^116m7YCN].

- **Congenital TTP (cTTP)**: Genetic ADAMTS13 mutations cause chronic deficiency; often presents in childhood [^112qYjjG] [^114Cf5W8].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Classic pentad**: Thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), neurologic deficits, renal dysfunction, and fever [^113KCWZS].

- **Modern triad**: Thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and neurologic or renal involvement are most consistent [^112qYjjG] [^113KCWZS].

- **Neurologic symptoms**: Fluctuating deficits, seizures, confusion, and coma are common [^114vUCbp] [^113JhDqB] [^111VqTo8] [^1112K5FS].

- **Renal involvement**: Proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury occur frequently [^notfound].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC with thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, hemolysis markers, and schistocytes on smear [^113KCWZS] [^111VqTo8].

- **ADAMTS13 activity**: Severe deficiency (< 10%) with or without inhibitors confirms TTP [^1146x1q2].

- **Differential diagnosis**: HUS, DIC, malignant hypertension, and drug-induced TMA must be considered [^116XFCCU] [^114qhRB8].

---

## Treatment

- **Plasma exchange (TPE)**: First-line therapy; initiate within 4–8 hours of suspicion [^1121AvPj] [^114TCXSb].

- **Immunosuppression**: Corticosteroids and rituximab reduce relapse and improve outcomes [^112eq6b4] [^116m7YCN].

- **Caplacizumab**: Anti-VWF nanobody that accelerates platelet recovery; recommended in acute iTTP [^111DeWCj] [^114jMCbH].

- **Recombinant ADAMTS13**: Approved for prophylaxis in cTTP [^117JYDM6] [^116XxA7j].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Mortality has fallen to **10–20% with modern therapy**, though delays increase risk [^112qYjjG] [^116JMXAd]. Relapse occurs in **30–50%**, especially with persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency [^1174Nu8z] [^113JhDqB]. Long-term complications include neurocognitive deficits, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [^116m7YCN] [^117C1oHH].

---

## Recent advances

- **Caplacizumab**: Reduces time to platelet recovery and exacerbations [^1174Nu8z].

- **Recombinant ADAMTS13**: Enables effective prophylaxis in cTTP [^117JYDM6] [^1146bqzN].

- **Improved diagnostics**: Rapid ADAMTS13 assays enable earlier confirmation and targeted therapy [^1123wBQV] [^112xSWtE].

---

TTP is a **medical emergency** defined by ADAMTS13 deficiency–driven microthrombi; **early plasma exchange and immunosuppression** are lifesaving, and newer agents like caplacizumab and recombinant ADAMTS13 further improve outcomes [^1123wBQV].

### A proposal: the need for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura specialist centres – providing better outcomes [^1111CsZn]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is heralded by its demanding presentation and impending mortality. The complex and life-threatening characteristics of TTP justify the need for early referral and responsive management in centres with comprehensive multi-disciplinary resources. In an era where compromise of patient safety or experience is unsatisfactory, the provision of specialist-led, organized care for this patient group remains overdue. Patients and clinical teams continue to lack the knowledge, support and resources required to achieve consistently high levels of clinical care. This forms the rationale for development of TTP Specialist Centres. In this article we focus on what we believe to be the recognized and potential merits of a specialist service provision, highlighting individual components of a high level of integrated expertise. The challenges in managing the condition from acute diagnosis to long-term care are described alongside defining key standards that represent excellence in patient care. The emphasis will be on understanding how the evolution of TTP Specialist Centres diverges from an ad hoc approach to managing this vulnerable patient group and offers promise in the translation to improved patient outcomes.

### Animal models for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116eL469]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a puzzling disorder in many ways. The disease is difficult to diagnose as analogous symptoms are also found in other microangiopathic disorders. Although ADAMTS13 deficiency is generally required to develop TTP, only some patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency do spontaneously develop this disease. It is therefore assumed that environmental and/or genetic factors are needed to cause acute TTP. Nevertheless, acute TTP-like symptoms have also been observed in patients with moderate or normal levels of ADAMTS13. The development of animal models for TTP has allowed a closer look at the specific need for ADAMTS13 deficiency and the necessity for additional triggers in the pathophysiology of TTP. Mouse models for congenital TTP and a baboon model for acquired TTP have been generated. These animal models have also proven to be extremely valuable in developing new treatment strategies for TTP. In the current review, we discuss current animal models for TTP, what we have learned from them and how they were used to test new treatment strategies.

### ISTH guidelines for treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^114TCXSb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in treatment options for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there are still limited high quality data to inform clinicians regarding its appropriate treatment.

Methods

In June 2018, the ISTH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to issue recommendations about treatment of TTP. The panel discussed 12 treatment questions related to immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) and hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP). The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 11 recommendations based on evidence ranging from very low to moderate certainty. For first acute episode and relapses of iTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for adding corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and a conditional recommendation for adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, the panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic cTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and a conditional recommendation for plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.

Conclusions

The panel's recommendations are based on all the available evidence for the effects of an individual component of various treatment approaches, including suppressing inflammation, blocking platelet clumping, replacing the missing and/or inhibited ADAMTS13, and suppressing the formation of ADAMTS13 autoantibody. There was insufficient evidence for further comparing different treatment approaches (eg, TPE, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab, etc.), for which high quality studies are needed.

### Consensus on the standardization of terminology in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related thrombotic microangiopathies [^116XFCCU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials An international collaboration provides a consensus for clinical definitions. This concerns thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The consensus defines diagnosis, disease monitoring and response to treatment. Requirements for ADAMTS-13 are given.

Summary

Background Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are two important acute conditions to diagnose. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a broad pathophysiologic process that leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and involves capillary and small-vessel platelet aggregates. The most common cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be differentiated by abnormal coagulation. Clinically, a number of conditions present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, including cancer, infection, transplantation, drug use, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in pregnancy. Despite overlapping clinical presentations, TTP and HUS have distinct pathophysiologies and treatment pathways. Objectives To present a consensus document from an International Working Group on TTP and associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Methods The International Working Group has proposed definitions and terminology based on published information and consensus-based recommendations. Conclusion The consensus aims to aid clinical decisions, but also future studies and trials, utilizing standardized definitions. It presents a classification of the causes of TMA, and criteria for clinical response, remission and relapse of congenital and immune-mediated TTP.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: early diagnosis and effective treatment in 2025 [^1123wBQV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the centenary of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) marks a significant milestone in the understanding and management of this rare and life-threatening condition. To commemorate this occasion, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine launched an educational initiative aimed at consolidating and disseminating key knowledge on TTP, spanning its history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This paper summarizes the advances that have transformed TTP from a nearly universally fatal disease to one with a survival rate exceeding 95%. The journey from Eli Moschcowitz's first description of TTP in 1924 to today's sophisticated therapeutic options highlights the crucial contributions of clinicians, basic scientists, and industry collaborators. Central to TTP's pathophysiology is the deficiency of the plasma protease ADAMTS13, caused either by autoantibodies as in immune TTP (iTTP) or by genetic mutations of ADAMTS13 in congenital TTP (cTTP). The discovery of ADAMTS13 and its deficiency has led to breakthroughs in diagnosis and differential diagnoses, and the development of targeted treatments, including therapeutic plasma exchange, caplacizumab (an anti-VWF nanobody), and recombinant ADAMTS13. This review provides a comprehensive summary of TTP, with a focus on diagnostic challenges, therapeutic advancements, and future perspectives. It also serves as a tribute to the collaborative efforts that have shaped our understanding of this disease over the past century. By raising awareness and sharing best practices, this educational initiative aims to further improve outcomes for patients with TTP and foster continued progress in the field.

### Advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112gNMRE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are both characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis, and organ dysfunction. Other disorders occasionally present with similar manifestations. Recent studies have demonstrated that deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13, due to genetic mutations or autoimmune inhibitors, causes TTP. Molecular cloning of ADAMTS13 elucidates the structure of the protease, raising the prospect for advances in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Assay of ADAMTS13 activity distinguishes TTP from HUS and other types of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); therefore, the term TTP/HUS should be avoided because it obscures the known or potential differences among the various types of TMA.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^115epCSv]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The 100th anniversary of the first description of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a disease by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz approaches. For many decades, TTP remained mostly a mysterious fatal condition, where diagnosis was often post-mortem. Initially a pentad of symptoms was identified, a pattern that later revealed to be fallible. Sporadic observations led to empiric interventions that allowed for the first impactful breakthrough in TTP treatment, almost 70 years after its first description: the introduction of plasma exchange and infusions as treatments. The main body of knowledge within the field was gathered in the latest three decades: patient registries were set and proved crucial for advancements; the general mechanisms of disease have been described; the diagnosis was refined; new treatments and biomarkers with improvements on prognosis and management were introduced. Further changes and improvements are expected in the upcoming decades. In this review, we provide a brief historic overview of TTP, as an illustrative example of the success of translational medicine enabling to rapidly shift from a management largely based on empiricism to targeted therapies and personalized medicine, for the benefit of patients. Current management options and present and future perspectives in this still evolving field are summarized.

### Evaluation and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the emergency department [^113KCWZS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a dangerous condition that can be misdiagnosed in the emergency department.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of TTP, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

TTP is a disorder with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and multiorgan ischemic injury. It may be acquired or hereditary, and is caused by a reduced amount or function of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), which is an enzyme involved in cleaving von Willebrand factor. The classic presentation of TTP includes fever, neurologic abnormalities, thrombocytopenia with purpura, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal injury. However, < 7% of cases have all of these findings present. Testing should include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, blood smear, coagulation panel, fibrinogen, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, ADAMTS13 level, troponin, human immunodeficiency virus assessment, urinalysis, pregnancy test as appropriate, and electrocardiogram. Management includes hematology consultation if available, plasma exchange and corticosteroids, and treatment of end-organ complications. All patients require admission for treatment and close monitoring.

Conclusion

TTP is a potentially dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management. It is essential for emergency clinicians to know how to diagnose and treat this disorder.

### How I treat patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: 2010 [^113nC6kB]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is the common name for adults with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, with or without neurologic or renal abnormalities, and without another etiology; children without renal failure are also described as TTP. The diagnosis of TTP is an indication for plasma exchange treatment, but beginning treatment requires sufficient confidence in the diagnosis to justify the risk of plasma exchange complications. Documentation of a severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, defined as less than 10% of normal, is not essential for the diagnosis of TTP. Some patients without severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may benefit from plasma exchange treatment; in addition, some patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may subsequently be diagnosed with another cause for their clinical features. However, severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency does define a subgroup of patients who appear to benefit from treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in addition to plasma exchange but who have a high risk for relapse. Approximately 80% of patients survive their acute episode, a survival rate that has not changed since the introduction of plasma exchange treatment. Although recovery may appear to be complete, many patients have persistent minor cognitive abnormalities. More effective as well as safer treatment for TTP is needed.

### Different clinical severity of first episodes and recurrences of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^113JhDqB]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by recurrent disease episodes in up to 50% of cases. The clinical presentation and severity of different TTP episodes have not been systematically compared. Laboratory and clinical information from 51 patients with recurrent disease, derived from 136 patients with TTP included in the Milan TTP registry (URL: http://www.ttpdatabase.org), were used to compare mortality, symptoms and disease-related laboratory measurements in different disease episodes. The prevalence of severe neurological symptoms (coma, seizures, and focal neurological defects) was significantly lower in recurrences than in the first episode. Platelet counts and haemoglobin levels at presentation were higher in recurrences than in the first disease episode, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were lower. Also, mortality tended to be lower in the second and third disease episodes than in the first. Recurrences of TTP are generally milder than first episodes. These differences in severity should be taken into account in clinical research on TTP and in patient management.

### TTP and ADAMTS13: when is testing appropriate? [^114KctnU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The last 10 years witnessed the publication of many studies on the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure. The most important finding was the identification of a novel metalloprotease, named ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motives), that is involved in the regulation of the size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a major modulator of platelet adhesion and aggregation in the microcirculation. Inherited or acquired deficiencies of ADAMTS13 impair VWF cleavage, leading in turn to the disseminated formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the micro-circulation and to symptoms of end-organ ischemia. By measuring ADAMTS13 in plasma, it has been clearly shown that patients with inherited TTP have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, patients with acquired TTP present with clinical and laboratory heterogeneity, and there are unequivocal cases of acquired TTP with measurable plasma levels of ADAMTS13. This heterogeneity poses a challenge for understanding the pathogenesis of TTP and selecting appropriate therapies.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of TTP: an integrated approach [^11473bnD]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease with an incidence of approximately 2 persons per million per year. It is characterized by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), leading to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, particularly plasma exchange, may be life-saving. Diagnosis of TTP is challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations, overlap in clinical presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies, and limited availability of ADAMTS13 testing. Clinical prediction scores have been developed to estimate the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and may be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide initial management decisions. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP in appropriate clinical contexts, but many centers do not offer testing in-house and must send out the test to a reference laboratory with a turnaround time of several days. In such instances, initial management decisions must be made without the benefit of laboratory testing. In patients with TTP, inhibitor tests may be useful for distinguishing immune-mediated from congenital TTP. In this article, we review the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of TTP and laboratory assays for TTP including ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor assays. We also describe an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected TTP that integrates clinical and laboratory assessment.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood [^116XJ5iX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease, especially in childhood, and has a high mortality rate in the absence of appropriate treatment. It is characterised by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and consumptive thrombocytopenia. TTP may be difficult to distinguish from haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) because of similar clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. In the past, TTP and HUS have often been considered to represent variable expressions of a single entity. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of TTP has in turn resulted in significant improvements in its treatment and outcomes. Several immunomodulating agents are currently being used with variable outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, more specifically with respect to ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining plasma ADAMTS13 testing (such as ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitors or anti-ADAMTS13 IgG) before initiating therapeutic plasma exchange or any blood product in patients with a high (≥ 90% pretest probability), intermediate or low clinical suspicion of immune-mediated TTP (based on a clinical assessment or a formal clinical risk assessment method) in settings with timely access to plasma ADAMTS13 activity testing.

### Caplacizumab for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^111DeWCj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study TITAN (caplacizumab) was published by Peyvandi F and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of caplacizumab in patients with acquired TTP? In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the population was: 75 patients (44 female, 31 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with an acute episode of acquired TTP with a platelet count of < 100,000/mcL, without active bleeding, and who required plasma exchange. The key exclusion criteria were platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcL; severe active infection; antiphospholipid syndrome; DIC; hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy; known congenital TTP; active bleeding or high risk of bleeding; uncontrolled arterial hypertension; pregnancy or lactation. In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the interventions were: n = 36 caplacizumab (10 mg SC once daily during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward) n = 39 placebo (SC daily during plasma exchange daily and for 30 days afterward). In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in median time to response (3 days vs. 4.9 days; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.04). In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in total adverse events. significant difference in mild-to-moderate bleeding-related adverse events (54% vs. 38%). In the TITAN (caplacizumab) study, the conclusion was: in patients with an acute episode of acquired TTP with a platelet count of < 100,000/mcL, without active bleeding, and who required plasma exchange, caplacizumab was superior to placebo with respect to median time to response.

CHAPTER 2. METHODS

The ERBP assigned a working group consisting of experts in TTP and guideline development to evaluate the 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP for endorsement. We evaluated the methodological quality of the ISTH guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. AGREE II is an internationally validated and widely accepted clinical practice guideline evaluation tool assessing six domains of guideline development: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, applicability and editorial independence. Four members of the ERBP working group independently scored each item from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). We calculated each domain score using the formula provided by the AGREE II instrument by summing up all scores of the individual items in a domain and by scaling the total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain. The threshold to determine high quality within a domain was set at a domain score > 70%. Domain scores can be used to identify the strengths and limitations of guidelines to compare methodological quality between guidelines or to select high-quality guidelines for endorsement.

For the 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP, all domains received a score > 70% (94% for scope and purpose, 88% for stakeholder involvement, 74% for rigour of development, 83% for clarity of presentation, 72% for applicability and 88% for editorial independence) and thus the ERBP working group classified the 2020 ISTH guideline on TTP as high-quality guidelines.

### The third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura shows up again: what is it, does it even exist, how to find out? Comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^1146bqzN]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica a Letter by Delphine Simon et al. on behalf of the French Centre National de Référence des Microangiopathies Thrombotiques (CNR-MAT), again brings up the existence and characteristics of a third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), labeled as TTP of unidentified pathophysiology (uTTP). This reiterated important insight is accompanied by a comment by a TTP specialist, Paul Knöbl. Many questions concerning this potentially important but so far incompletely understood variant of TTP remain and I will try to put this uTTP variant into perspective and propose further steps to confirm its existence and unravel its secrets.

TTP was first described in 1924 by Moschcowitzand the history of extensive research, elucidation of the pathophysiology, and the enormous therapeutic advances for this rare - and during half a century universally fatal - disease has been reviewed by many groups. In all these reviews two separate forms of TTP are generally distinguished: (i) a rare congenital or hereditary form (cTTP or hTTP) caused by biallelic variants of the ADAMTS13 gene giving rise to a severe constitutional deficiency of ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motifs, number 13), the specific von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving metalloprotease and (ii) a still rare but more common acquired form of TTP caused by autoantibodies inhibiting and/or clearing ADAMTS13 from plasma, generally termed autoimmune TTP (iTTP). In both forms of TTP, cTTP and iTTP, the defective proteolytic processing of VWF multimers results in accumulation of highly adhesive, unusually large VWF multimers leading to microvascular clumping of platelets and ischemia of multiple organs. Treatment of acute cTTP episodes consists of plasma infusions and many patients need regular plasma prophylaxis to avoid recurring acute bouts. More recently, recombinant human ADAMTS13 has become available for improved and facilitated treatment and prophylaxis of cTTP. Acute iTTP episodes are managed by daily plasma exchanges with plasma replacement, immunosuppression with corticosteroids and rituximab, and the anti-VWF nanobody caplacizumab. The International Working Group on TTP has proposed consensus definitions of the disease TTP, outlined the differential diagnosis between TTP and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and defined response to treatment and outcomes. Moreover, under the auspices of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TTP have been established. In sum, TTP, both cTTP and iTTP, have been transformed from a generally deadly condition without any effective therapy until the 1960s to 1970s to two pathophysiologically well understood separate diseases, which can be effectively managed provided they are recognized promptly and diagnosed in a timely manner.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) in 2020. These guidelines were necessary due to the important innovations made in the field of TTP, including diagnostics using ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) as well as therapy with caplacizumab. TTP can be differentiated into immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), caused by autoantibody-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS13, and congenital TTP, caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. ADAMTS13 cleaves the ultralarge multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF). In the absence of ADAMTS13, the ultralarge vWF multimers persist in the circulation, unfold and expose their A1 domains upon enhanced blood flow shear forces, thereby becoming hyperadhesive for platelets, which results in microthrombi obstructing microcirculation, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with ischaemic organ injury. Important improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of TTP have been made in recent years. First, ADAMTS13 activity measurement is available not only for the diagnosis of TTP, but also for the response to therapy as well as the risk for recurrence of the disease. Second, immunosuppressive medications, especially rituximab, have been successful in reducing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, which shortens the time to remission and limits the risk for exacerbation and relapse. Third, caplacizumab, a nanobody directed against A1 binding domains of vWF, has been approved for the treatment of iTTP together with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE).

The 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP have now been evaluated by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) Working Group and are herewith endorsed. Recommendations of the 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP are summarized in Table 1. However, the working group argued that some recommendations need refinement from a European perspective. This endorsement highlights and expands on certain elements of the rationale following each recommendation. It also includes some comments on the treatment, while not based on randomized controlled trials, which may still be relevant for the treatment of patients with TTP.

We also discuss relevant issues in the diagnosis and treatment of TTP and try to make recommendations for clinical practice in Europe.

### Recent advances in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112xSWtE]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, accompanied by microvascular thrombosis that causes variable degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction. Intravascular coagulation is not a prominent feature of the disorder. Plasma exchange can induce remissions in approximately 80% of patients with idiopathic TTP, but patients have a much worse prognosis when thrombotic microangiopathy is associated with cancer, certain drugs, infections, or tissue transplantation. Recently, acquired autoimmune deficiency of a plasma metalloprotease named ADAMTS13 was shown to cause many cases of idiopathic TTP. This review describes our current understanding of how to use this knowledge clinically. In Section I, Dr. Joel Moake describes the presentation of thrombotic microangiopathy, emphasizing the pathophysiology of idiopathic TTP. Platelets adhere to ultra-large (or "unusually large") von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers that are immobilized in exposed subendothelial connective tissue and secreted into the circulation in long "strings" from stimulated endothelial cells. ADAMTS13 cleaves ULVWF multimers within growing platelet aggregates under flowing conditions, and this normally limits platelet thrombus formation. If ADAMTS13 is absent, either congenitally or due to acquired autoantibodies, platelet-rich microvascular thrombosis proceeds unchecked and TTP ensues. Plasma exchange is effective therapy for idiopathic TTP, probably because it replenishes the deficient ADAMTS13 and removes some of the pathogenic autoantibodies and endothelial-stimulating cytokines. Some patients have a type of thrombotic microangiopathy after transplantation/chemotherapy but do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. The pathogenesis of their disease must differ but remains poorly understood. In Section II, Dr. Toshiyuki Miyata describes recent advances in assay methods that should facilitate routine laboratory testing of ADAMTS13 for patients with thrombotic microangiopathy. ADAMTS13 cleaves a single Tyr-Met bond in domain A2 of the VWF subunit. ADAMTS13 assays based on the cleavage of plasma VWF multimers have been used extensively but require considerable time and expertise to perform. A recombinant substrate containing 73 amino acid residues of VWF domain A2 has been devised that allows short incubation times and rapid product detection by gel electrophoresis or immunoassay. These results should encourage the development of even simpler assays that can be performed in most clinical laboratories. In Section III, Dr. James George provides an update on the long-term prospective study of thrombotic microangiopathy in the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry. At presentation, the clinical distinction between idiopathic TTP, various forms of secondary thrombotic microangiopathy, and even Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can be problematic because the symptoms and laboratory findings often overlap. Consequently, plasma exchange usually is administered to any patient with thrombotic microangiopathy if there is doubt about the cause. The role of ADAMTS13 testing in choosing therapy remains uncertain, but the results do appear to have prognostic significance. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is specific for idiopathic TTP and identifies a subgroup with a high likelihood of response to plasma exchange, and high-titer ADAMTS13 inhibitors correlate strongly with a high risk of relapsing disease. Patients with normal ADAMTS13 activity have a much worse prognosis, although many factors probably contribute to this difference. Longitudinal study of these patients will continue to clarify the relationship of ADAMTS13 deficiency to the clinical course of thrombotic microangiopathy.

### The remarkable diversity of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a perspective [^111fw24t]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Understanding the autoimmune etiology of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has provided precision for the diagnosis and a rationale for immunosuppressive treatment. These advances have also allowed recognition of the remarkable clinical diversities of patients' initial presentations and their long-term outcomes. These diversities are illustrated by the stories of patients from the Oklahoma TTP Registry. The initial presentation of TTP may be the discovery of unexpected severe thrombocytopenia in a patient with minimal or no symptoms. The patient may remain asymptomatic throughout treatment or may die suddenly before treatment can be started. ADAMTS13 activity may be reported as normal in a patient with characteristic clinical features of TTP, or the unexpected report of ADAMTS13 deficiency in a patient with another established disorder may lead to the discovery of TTP. ADAMTS13 activity during clinical remission is unpredictable. ADAMTS13 activity may recover and remain normal, it may remain severely deficient for many years, or it may become normal only many years after recovery. Our treatment of initial episodes and management of patients after recovery and during remission continue to change. The addition of rituximab to the treatment of acute episodes and preemptive rituximab for patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency during remission are reported to prevent relapse. Because TTP is uncommon, there are few data to guide these changes. Therefore our patients' stories are profoundly influential. Their stories are the foundation of our experience, and our experience is the guide for our decisions.

### What's new in the diagnosis and pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^111jJUed]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Severe ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) deficiency causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the absence of oliguric or anuric renal failure. However, some patients with this constellation of findings do not have ADAMTS13 deficiency, and some patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency have renal failure or relatively normal blood counts. Consequently, many investigators and clinicians have incorporated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency into the case definition of TTP. This change has facilitated the timely initiation of treatment for patients with atypical clinical features who otherwise would not be recognized as having TTP. Conversely, excluding severe ADAMTS13 deficiency focuses attention on the diagnosis and treatment of other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy that require different treatment. The rapid return of ADAMTS13 data is important to make the best use of this information.

### Pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^115VBC4F]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The discovery of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) revolutionized our approach to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Inherited or acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency allows the unrestrained growth of microthrombi that are composed of von Willebrand factor and platelets, which account for the thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, schistocytes, and tissue injury that characterize TTP. Most patients with acquired TTP respond to a combination of plasma exchange and rituximab, but some die or acquire irreversible neurological deficits before they can respond, and relapses can occur unpredictably. However, knowledge of the pathophysiology of TTP has inspired new ways to prevent early deaths by targeting autoantibody production, replenishing ADAMTS13, and blocking microvascular thrombosis despite persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency. In addition, monitoring ADAMTS13 has the potential to identify patients who are at risk of relapse in time for preventive therapy.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndromes [^116m7YCN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation and management of patients with suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) continue to be a critical challenge for hematologists. The diagnostic criteria are not precise, often causing uncertainty about whether it is appropriate to initiate plasma exchange (PEX), the essential treatment for TTP. Initiation of PEX remains a clinical decision; severe ADAMTS13 (< 10% activity) deficiency alone is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of TTP. However, patients who do have severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency define the characteristic clinical features of TTP, the response to treatment, and the long-term outcomes. Patients with severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency are predominantly young women and the relative frequency of blacks is increased. Patients may present with only microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, neurologic and renal abnormalities are often not present, fever rarely occurs; the complete "pentad" of these clinical features almost never occurs in current practice. Response to PEX is typically rapid but may not be sustained when PEX is stopped. Use of corticosteroids and rituximab has decreased the number of PEX treatments required to achieve a remission and has resulted in fewer PEX-related major complications. Relapse (in approximately 40% of patients) may be the most apparent risk after recovery, but long-term health outcomes are also very important. Minor cognitive abnormalities are common, the frequency of depression is increased, and the frequency of hypertension is increased. Careful long-term follow-up of TTP patients is essential.

### Is there a shared pathophysiology for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome? [^116KoikB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by microvascular thrombosis coupled with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and red blood cell fragmentation. Familiar to nephrologists and hematologists alike, classically associated with thrombotic microangiopathy are the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the histories and presentations of which are closely intertwined. Not surprising, these two disorders are considered by many to be manifestations of the same disease process, whereas others consider HUS and TTP to be distinct clinical and pathologic entities. Herein are reviewed HUS and TTP along with recent progress shedding new light on possible shared pathophysiologic mechanisms for these two intriguing disorders.

### Plasma exchange in thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) other than thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [^116FopVW]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a diverse group of disorders that are characterized by common clinical and laboratory features. The most commonly thought-of TMA is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Because of the marked improvement in patient mortality associated with the use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in TTP, this therapy has been applied to all of the TMAs. The issue, however, is that the pathophysiology varies and in many instances may represent a disorder of the endothelium and not the blood; in some cases, the pathophysiology is unknown. The use of TPE is further obscured by a lack of strong supporting literature on its use, with most consisting of case series and case reports; controlled or randomized controlled trials are lacking. Evidence supporting the use of TPE in the treatment of TMAs (other than TTP and TMA-complement mediated) is lacking, and therefore its role is uncertain. With the greater availability of genetic testing for mutations involving complement regulatory genes and complement pathway components, there seems to be a percentage of TMA cases, other than TMA-complement mediated, in which complement pathway mutations are involved in some patients. The ability of TPE to remove abnormal complement pathway components and replace them with normal components may support its use in some patients with TMAs other than TTP and TMA-complement mediated.

### Time from suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura to initiation of plasma exchange and impact on survival: a 10-year provincial retrospective cohort study [^116JMXAd]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with significant morbidity and mortality. Guidelines recommend initiating plasma exchange within 4–8 h of suspected diagnosis. It is unclear what are real-world practice patterns and whether delays > 8 h increases mortality.

Objectives

To determine if delayed initiation of plasma exchange is associated with increased risk of death and complications.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the time from suspected diagnosis to plasma exchange in all adults presenting with suspected TTP to apheresis centres in Alberta, Canada (2008–2018). Among patients with acquired TTP, the association between delayed plasma exchange and risk of death was evaluated using Cox regression.

Results

Overall 190 episodes of suspected TTP were included among 163 individuals. Acquired TTP was confirmed in 61 patients. Inappropriate Emergency Department triage occurred in 59%. The median time from suspected diagnosis to first plasma exchange was 10.7 h; 59% had delayed plasma exchange > 8 h, among whom plasma infusion was administered in only 45%. 36% of suspected TTP and 13% of confirmed TTP patients died. Delayed plasma exchange between 8 and 24 h was not associated with a significantly higher risk of death (adjusted hazards ratio; aHR 0.63, 95% CI 0.08–4.83) in confirmed TTP. On the other hand, the risks of death (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 0.20–9.79) and major thrombotic events (aHR 2.9, 95% CI 0.6–12.8) were markedly increased with > 24 h delay.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that TTP care in a real-world setting is discordant with expert guidelines due to multiple barriers. There is a gradient of increased mortality risk and thrombotic complications with longer treatment delays, although the study is likely underpowered.

Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

The consensus guideline introduced by Scully et al. in 2017 and reports of several other groups offered a comprehensive update on the management and classification of TTP by addressing both acquired and inherited forms of TTP, including the diagnostic criteria and the importance of ADAMTS13 testing for TTP diagnosis. A major clue to our understanding of ADAMTS13 was introduced by Roose et al. who showed that this protease usually circulates in an open conformation during the acute phase of iTTP but remains primarily closed during remission, with ADAMTS13 activity higher than 50% and undetectable anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. All in all, despite major advances in recent years in the understanding of the disease, many aspects of its pathophysiology still remain unclear. TTP remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, which must be confirmed by the presence of severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%) with or without the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^113HftC5]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

The main advances in the understanding of the century‐old disease Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) pathophysiology took place during the last three decades, and were successfully translated into diagnostic and therapeutic improvements.
Today, innovative technologies are driving profound changes in the diagnosis and treatment standards for TTP, making TTP an illustrative success of translational medicine.
In a foreseeable future, historical treatments such as therapeutic plasma exchange and plasma therapy for TTP may become obsolete with the upcoming inception of rhADAMTS13 for clinical use, the introduction of caplacizumab, and the extensive use of rituximab.
Knowledge gaps still exist, as it is yet not fully known how TTP patients develop cognitive impairments, and we must reinforce measures against cardiovascular risk factors and premature death, which are still prevalent in TTP patients.

### Diagnostic uncertainty presented barriers to the timely management of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2019 [^116MvkSR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life‐threatening emergency and plasma exchange (PEX) is the initial treatment shown to reduce acute mortality.

Objectives

To compare current practice in the United Kingdom (UK) against the standards set out in the 2012 British Society of Haematology guideline, and to better understand the issues affecting prompt initiation of PEX.

Patients/Methods

The trainee research network HaemSTAR conducted a retrospective nationwide review of adults presenting to UK hospitals with a first episode of acute TTP.

Results

Data on 148 patients treated at 80 UK hospitals between 2014 and 2019 demonstrated that 64.8% of patients received PEX within 24 h. Diagnostic uncertainty was the most commonly cited reason for delayed treatment. Conversely, a shorter time to PEX occurred in patients who had red cell fragments or severe thrombocytopenia identified on their first complete blood count. Availability of on‐site PEX was associated with a greater proportion of patients receiving PEX within 8 h compared to patients transferred, but by 24 h there was no difference between the two groups and two‐thirds of all patients had received their first PEX. The mortality rate for patients that received PEX was 9.2%, with 27.8% of deaths linked to delayed treatment initiation.

Conclusions

This is the first multi‐center evaluation of treatment delays in acute TTP and it will inform targeted pathways to improve prompt access to life‐saving intervention.

### The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1177FLjK]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Today, 100 years after it was first described, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is understood as a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by severe deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). The discovery of this enzyme and the subsequent exponential expansion of scientific research led to the establishment of two distinct types of TTP: a congenital type with mutations in the ADAMTS13 genes, resulting in a missing or dysfunctional protein (cTTP; e.g. Upshaw-Schulman syndrome), and an acquired type, caused by autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 (iTTP). Recent remarkable research, however, suggests a more complex pathophysiology: the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-ADAMTS13 axis is now understood as a dynamic, shear-dependent system, based on the binding and conformation change of both VWF and ADAMTS13, providing an autoregulatory mechanism of VWF multimeric size and thrombogenicity. Current ADAMTS13 assays measure the metalloprotease activity to cleave a 73 amino-acid VWF fragment. The other functionalities of the VWF-ADAMTS13 system are not captured, which explains why some patients with clinically typical TTP have nonspecific laboratory results.

A few years ago, an article from the French TMA Reference Center challenged the TTP classification and proposed a third entity. In a retrospective analysis of a large registry of TMA patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, assessed from 1999 to 2013, 21.5% of patients did not have detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies at admission or during the follow-up, and only transient ADAMTS13 deficiency. For these patients, the term "acquired TTP of unknown cause" (uTTP) was coined. The clinical data of these patients differed considerably from those of patients with iTTP: more had cancer, infections, or transplantation, conditions that are typically considered unlikely for TTP. This article triggered a lively discussion, as such a high number of unexplained cases of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is not consistent with the data from other large TTP registries. Interestingly, the same group later reported on a modern TTP treatment regimen (with plasma exchange, caplacizumab and rituximab), including patients since September 2018. Here, a much smaller proportion of patients had undetectable antibodies (and therefore uTTP).

### Does hemolytic uremic syndrome differ from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^117B5rWb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Both hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), affecting mainly the kidney and brain, respectively. Diagnosis of HUS or TTP has been complicated by the fact that these disorders share several clinical characteristics, and by the dearth of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of TMA. Advances in the identification of pathogenic features — deficiency of the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 in TTP and association of mutated complement proteins with atypical HUS — have gone some way towards improving clinicians' ability to distinguish between the two diseases. Here, we pose the following question: is it important to patient management that HUS be distinguished from TTP? By discussing what is known about the pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of these two conditions we address this question, and propose a new nomenclature for TMA.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: from platelet aggregates to plasma [^112qyVmV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a syndrome of severe thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without an alternative explanation. Although some patients also have a combination of fever and neurologic and/or renal manifestations, these are not required for the diagnosis. Thus, plasmapheresis should start as soon as TTP is placed high in the differential diagnosis to prevent significant mortality. Histopathologically, TTP is characterized by widespread platelet thrombi in the microcirculation. Ultralarge von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers found in the patient's plasma are the basis for the platelet thrombi. Recent evidence has linked the abnormal fragments of vWf with deficiency of a plasma enzyme named vWf-cleaving protease, or ADAMTS-13. While a small percentage of patients with TTP have a constitutional defect in this enzyme, many with the acute idiopathic form have an antibody to ADAMTS-13, affecting its ability to cleave vWf. The determination of the enzyme activity and the presence of its inhibitor have emerged as a potential tool in the diagnosis and prognosis of TTP. Furthermore, it helps to differentiate TTP from the hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the level of ADAMTS-13 is expected to be normal or only slightly decreased.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: an update [^112pFKMn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Since the last review in 2007 of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the Clinics, further understanding of the nature of TTP and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has led to increasing use of rituximab in the treatment of TTP and the approval in 2011 of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. With this new armamentarium, distinction of aHUS from TTP has become more critical than ever. This article updates the new knowledge, highlights the difference between aHUS and TTP, and presents a scheme for their diagnosis and management.

### The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116XiPeN]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Mandatory preconditions for prospective studies on thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Alterations of the ADAMTS13 protein, impaired synthesis, or exhaustion by very high VWF levels would not cause severe deficiency. A reciprocal relation between VWF and ADAMTS13 is long known, with a reduced, but not deficient ADAMTS13 activity in acute phase situations.

Autoantibodies (or other agents) may be directed against the ADAMTS13 cleavage site in the A2 domain of VWF. This could potentially prevent ADAMTS13 from cleaving VWF or the VWF-73 substrate. Such antibodies would not open ADAMTS13.

It is good clinical practice to confirm the reproducibility of results, particularly in controversial settings. A coordinated international effort, analyzing more recent and well-documented patients from industry-sponsored trials (Titan, Hercules, Vita) and other national registries, managed according to current guidelines with sufficient follow-up data, could provide valuable confirmatory information. For definite confirmation, it is essential to adopt a prospective approach for future trials to identify the actual proportion of TTP patients with unexplained severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and to further analyze potential causes. As suggested by the authors, several preconditions are mandatory for such an approach to provide good data quality and avoid methodological errors (Table 1).

To conclude, the finding of a third, distinct class of non-im-munological TTP is an interesting observation, although not concordant with other publications. Prospective confirmation is needed, including elaborate laboraty work, to elucidate the existence and pathophysiology of uTTP. In the meantime, management according to current iTTP guidelines is probably the best way to reduce the high mortality of these patients.

### A classification of hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related disorders [^114e9sTj]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnostic terms hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are based on historical and overlapping clinical descriptions. Advances in understanding some of the causes of the syndrome now permit many patients to be classified according to etiology. The increased precision of a diagnosis based on causation is important for considering logical approaches to treatment and prognosis. It is also essential for research. We propose a classification that accommodates both a current understanding of causation (level 1) and clinical association in cases for whom cause of disease is unclear (level 2). We tested the classification in a pediatric disease registry of HUS. The revised classification is a stimulus to comprehensive investigation of all cases of HUS and TTP and is expected to increase the proportion of cases in whom a level 1 etiological diagnosis is confirmed.

### Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology in patients with severe disease: completing the landscape of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1157CuU7]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) results from a severe (activity < 10 IU/dL) ADAMTS13 deficiency, typically categorized as congenital (cTTP), immune-mediated (iTTP), or acquired with an unknown mechanism (uTTP). Recently, our group proposed the term uTTP to describe acquired TTP cases with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency but without detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, that typically occur in association with other comorbidities such as cancer, severe infection, liver failure or systemic autoimmune disease. This proposal raises new questions about the pathophysiological landscape of TTP and highlights potential diagnostic gaps. We understand and appreciate the comprehensive editorial of TTP classification by Knöbland we respectfully address several key points for further clarification and nuance.

Among patients classified as uTTP, who systematically exhibited features of TMA justifying an ADAMTS13 investigation, a substantial subset (20–25%) likely represents iTTP cases. These cases are typically associated with specific clinical contexts that include a history of systemic autoimmune disease, pregnancy, or mild infections; ADAMTS13 is in an open conformation, indicating an underlying autoimmune, antibody-mediated mechanism for ADAMTS13 deficiency, and clinical features are those typically observed in iTTP. In that way, anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies can be finally identified in up to 20% of those patients later during follow-up. This group of patients differs significantly from uTTP cases defined by a TMA syndrome associated with specific conditions such as cancer, severe sepsis or liver failure, which tend to exhibit a closed ADAMTS13 conformation. In that regard, outside of any context of TMA, rare cases of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency have been previously reported in severe sepsis, with no underlying autoimmune mechanism. Our group has documented this point, reinforcing the view that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency can arise in critical diseases and results from non-immune mechanisms, particularly in the context of severe inflammation or hemodynamic stress, occurring in the absence of TMA features. In those contexts, ADAMTS13 deficiency may result from a cleavage of the protein by other proteases, such as plasmin, as well as degradation or consumption. In uTTP, such mechanisms may account for a severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency but also for TMA features.uTTP is therefore an important and specific condition occurring in non-immunologic contexts that needs to be considered in patients with features of TMA, as it expands our clinical understanding of ADAMTS13 deficiency in various pathophysiological settings. Recognizing uTTP patients provides crucial insights into ADAMTS13 activity and conformation as well as clinical background, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate categorization and management of TTP patients. It is noteworthy that the underlying contexts in uTTP patients usually lead to their exclusion from clinical studies to ensure homogeneous patient populations, as their condition can contribute to cytopenias and directly affect prognosis, accounting for a bias where over 95% of iTTP patients with well-documented anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies are included in published studies.

### A third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^115oPteW]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica a highly provocative letter by B.S. Joly et al. on behalf of the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies (CNR-MAT), reiterates the existence of a so-far largely disregarded - not to say «scotomized» - form of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). In the hundred years since its first description by Moschcowitz in 1924, TTP has attracted the interest of numerous clinicians and researchers; the development of our knowledge on the pathophysiology and more recently new therapeutic advances in this previously mostly fatal disease are a major success story of modern scientific medicine.

TTP specialists usually distinguish two pathophysiologically distinct forms of TTP: (i) a very rare hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP) or Upshaw-Schulman syndrome caused by biallelic mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene leading to a severe constitutional deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS13 and (ii) an acquired, autoimmune TTP (iTTP) associated with autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.

Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment

For each included study, 2 authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. We extracted data on study design, setting, inclusion criteria, enrollment period, baseline characteristics of study participants and treatments provided, and outcomes of interest. We discussed discrepancies in data extraction, and a third author arbitrated when needed. Our primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality, and our primary safety outcome was bleeding. We initially intended to evaluate iTTP-specific mortality, but cause of death was inconsistently reported, particularly in retrospective studies. Instead, we focused on all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included time to platelet count recovery, iTTP exacerbation or relapse (clinical recurrence within or after 30 days of TPE cessation, respectively), refractory iTTP, duration of TPE, hospital length of stay (LOS), treatment-emergent thrombosis, and treatment-emergent bleeding (any bleeding, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding). We extracted event rates for binary outcomes and means or medians for continuous outcomes. We used the event rates from the longest duration of follow-up if multiple rates were reported. If studies reported different refractory iTTP rates, we chose the rate that reflected the International TTP Working Group's definition of refractory iTTP. Because time to platelet count recovery was not reported for the entire TITAN cohort, we used aggregate data reported for the subgroup of patients with a baseline ADAMTS13 activity < 10% (n = 58).

To assess risk of bias, we used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB-2) for RCTsand the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for nonrandomized, observational studies. Two authors independently performed study-level and outcome-based quality appraisals for each study. We answered all RoB-2 signaling questions but reported an aggregate summary of the domains of interest; the overall risk of bias was generated by the RoB-2 algorithm. For NOS, we report study-level selection and comparability domains and cohort follow-up adequacy from the outcome domain; we also report the average of outcome-level appraisal of outcome assessment, reporting, and follow-up adequacy. We also report the combined qualitative assessments performed by the 2 reviewers for each observational study. We judged the overall risk of bias using the NOS star system as follows: very high risk of bias (0–3 NOS points), high risk of bias (4–6 NOS points), and low risk of bias (7–9 NOS points).

1 INTRODUCTION

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a very rare, life‐threatening condition precipitated by an acquired (immune‐mediated) or hereditary deficiency of A Disintigren And Metalloprotease with ThromboSponin‐type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS‐13). TTP presents with a variable combination of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, neurological impairment, or other organ dysfunction. It is a recognized medical emergency and prompt diagnosis and initiation of therapy is imperative for survival. In cases of immune TTP, the introduction of plasma exchange (PEX) using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the 1990s transformed TTP from a near‐universally fatal disease into one with survival rates approaching 80%. In the UK plasma exchange for TTP is performed using FFP that has been solvent detergent treated (SD‐FFP) to achieve viral inactivation, and this is sourced as the commercial product Octaplas. Both acquired and hereditary cases of TTP will receive urgent PEX at first presentation until the underlying cause is differentiated.

The addition of immunosuppression with steroids and rituximab further improved outcomes, but PEX remains the cornerstone of treatment shown to significantly impact acute mortality, and early treatment initiation is critical as up to 50% of TTP deaths occur within 24 h of presentation. Caplacizumab, the monoclonal anti‐Von Willebrand factor (VWF) nanobody, was approved for use combined with PEX for the treatment of acute TTP in the UK in December 2020. While it is acknowledged that some international centers are moving to the use of caplacizumab to the exclusion of PEX, this is not the current standard of care in the UK.

Prompt initiation of PEX faces many logistical challenges. The average UK National Health Service (NHS) Trust may diagnose only one case of TTP per year, presenting symptoms are often non‐specific, and first point of contact is normally with non‐hematologists in the primary or secondary care setting. Laboratory biomedical scientists and/or laboratory technicians are often the first to propose the diagnosis of TTP after identifying thrombocytopenia and red cell fragmentation on blood film examination. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by uniting the patient's clinical presentation with the complete blood count and an ADAMTS‐13 activity of < 10 iu/dl. ADAMTS‐13 activity is a specialist hemostasis assay that is only available at tertiary centers, with a turnaround time of 4–6 h, and is usually only offered during regular working hours.

### Mutations in a member of the ADAMTS gene family cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112jAZWF]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening systemic illness of abrupt onset and unknown cause. Proteolysis of the blood-clotting protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) observed in normal plasma is decreased in TTP patients. However, the identity of the responsible protease and its role in the pathophysiology of TTP remain unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage analysis in four pedigrees of humans with congenital TTP and mapped the responsible genetic locus to chromosome 9q34. A predicted gene in the identified interval corresponds to a segment of a much larger transcript, identifying a new member of the ADAMTS family of zinc metalloproteinase genes (ADAMTS13). Analysis of patients' genomic DNA identified 12 mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, accounting for 14 of the 15 disease alleles studied. We show that deficiency of ADAMTS13 is the molecular mechanism responsible for TTP, and suggest that physiologic proteolysis of VWF and/or other ADAMTS13 substrates is required for normal vascular homeostasis.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112qYjjG]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP; also known as Moschcowitz disease) is characterized by the concomitant occurrence of often severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and a variable degree of ischaemic organ damage, particularly affecting the brain, heart and kidneys. Acute TTP was almost universally fatal until the introduction of plasma therapy, which improved survival from < 10% to 80–90%. However, patients who survive an acute episode are at high risk of relapse and of long-term morbidity. A timely diagnosis is vital but challenging, as TTP shares symptoms and clinical presentation with numerous conditions, including, for example, haemolytic uraemic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. The underlying pathophysiology is a severe deficiency of the activity of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13), the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimeric strings. Ultra-large vWF strings remain uncleaved after endothelial cell secretion and anchorage, bind to platelets and form microthrombi, leading to the clinical manifestations of TTP. Congenital TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) is the result of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ADAMTS13, whereas acquired TTP is an autoimmune disorder caused by circulating anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, which inhibit the enzyme or increase its clearance. Consequently, immunosuppressive drugs, such as corticosteroids and often rituximab, supplement plasma exchange therapy in patients with acquired TTP.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a hematological emergency [^116T1RzJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematological emergency and diagnostic challenge. The critical determinant of outcome is timely diagnosis and treatment.

Objectives

Describe the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Discussion

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has a varied presentation and a tendency to mimic several disorders. However, it may be at least provisionally diagnosed in the patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without alternate cause. The mainstay of treatment is immediate plasma exchange to be repeated until platelet count is stabilized. Adjuvant therapies include corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclosporine.

Conclusion

It is essential for the emergency physician to be aware of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura's range of presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

### Drug-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a systematic review and review of European and north American pharmacovigilance data [^112hJoN1]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Many medications have been reported to be associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) through pharmacovigilance data and published case reports. Whilst there are existing data available regarding drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy, there is no available synthesis of evidence to assess drug-induced TTP (DI-TTP). Despite this lack of evidence, patients with TTP are often advised against using many medications due to the theoretical risk of DI-TTP. This systematic review evaluated the evidence for an association of medications reported as potential triggers for TTP. Of 5098 records available 261 articles were assessed further for eligibility. Fifty-seven reports, totalling 90 patients, were included in the final analysis. There were no cases where the level of association was rated as definite or probable, demonstrating a lack of evidence of any drug causing DI-TTP. This paucity of evidence was also demonstrated in the pharmacovigilance data, where 613 drugs were reported as potential causes of TTP without assessment of the strength of association. This systematic review demonstrates the need for standardised reporting of potential drugs causing TTP. Many reports omit basic information and, therefore, hinder the chance of finding a causative link if one exists.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disease whose incidence is now increasing. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented with bilateral flank pain and hematuria, subsequently diagnosed with TTP. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has classically been characterized by the pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic symptoms, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis of the disease has been a mystery until recently. We review the current literature regarding the pathophysiology and management of this disorder. Our discussion focuses on the importance of understanding this disease while considering the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with anemia and thrombocytopenia because the common pitfall of rapidly administering platelets to a patient with TTP may lead to a disastrous outcome.

### Advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome [^114qC9oH]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

The thrombotic microangiopathies are microvascular occlusive disorders characterized by hemolytic anemia caused by fragmentation of erythrocytes and thrombocytopenia due to increased platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, eventually leading to disturbed microcirculation with reduced organ perfusion. Depending on whether brain or renal lesions prevail, two different entities have been described: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, not rarely the clinical distinctions between these two conditions remain questionable. Recent studies have contributed greatly to our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to TTP and HUS. In this review, we briefly focus on the most important advances in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of these two thrombotic microangiopathies.

### Beyond plasma exchange: novel therapies for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1174Nu8z]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

The advent of plasma exchange has dramatically changed the prognosis of acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Recent insights into TTP pathogenesis have led to the development of novel therapies targeting pathogenic anti-ADAMTS13 antibody production, von Willebrand factor (VWF)-platelet interactions, and ADAMTS13 replacement. Retrospective and prospective studies have established the efficacy of rituximab as an adjunct to plasma exchange for patients with acute TTP, either upfront or for refractory disease. Relapse prevention is a major concern for survivors of acute TTP, and emerging data support the prophylactic use of rituximab in patients with persistent or recurrent ADAMTS13 deficiency in clinical remission. Capalcizumab, a nanobody directed against domain A1 of VWF that prevents the formation of VWF-platelet aggregates, recently completed phase 2 (TITAN) and 3 (HERCULES) trials with encouraging results. Compared with placebo, caplacizumab shortened the time to platelet recovery and may protect against microthrombotic tissue injury in the acute phase of TTP, though it does not modify the underlying immune response. Other promising therapies including plasma cell inhibitors (bortezomib), recombinant ADAMTS13, N -acetyl cysteine, and inhibitors of the VWF-glycoprotein Ib/IX interaction (anfibatide) are in development, and several of these agents are in prospective clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy and role in TTP. In the coming years, we are optimistic that novel therapies and international collaborative efforts will usher in even more effective, evidence-based approaches to address refractory acute TTP and relapse prevention.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presenting as pancreatitis [^111p6Zuf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare clinical entity. It is a multi-systemic disorder characterized by a clinical pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, diffuse and nonfocal neurologic symptoms, decreased renal function, and fever. Abdominal pain is an uncommon presenting symptom for TTP. Pancreatitis may occur from TTP or, in a few cases, may trigger TTP. The clinical diagnosis of TTP is generally difficult because there are many varied clinical presentations and the full expression of the pentad may be prolonged. However, once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, immediate plasmapherseis with plasma exchange must be performed to reduce the severe morbidity from neurologic disability.

Proposal for a prospective study to establish the existence and search for pathomechanisms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura of unidentified pathophysiology

If the underlying pathophysiology in uTTP cases were indeed to involve a non-immune mechanism, one may imagine several possibilities resulting in severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity. As suggested by Simon et al. non-immune destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, deficient synthesis in liver failure, proteolytic degradation or catalytic inhibition of ADAMTS13, e.g. by interleukin-6, may be considered. I fully agree with Knöbl that carefully planned prospective studies will be needed and Table 1 in his Commentlists many important items to be applied: prospective patient enrollment at hospital admission is mandatory. A strict protocol must be in place for clinical monitoring, blood sampling, laboratory analyses and biomaterial sample storage for future investigations, e.g. citrated plasma, EDTA plasma, serum and samples for DNA- and/or RNA-based analyses. A professional biobank set-up, as reported for a prospective cohort study on elderly patients with venous thrombosis, should be established. Necessarily, this needs to be a multicenter study with dedicated TTP specialist centers and all included patients should be followed-up, optimally for several years. This will allow to determine whether, similarly to the cohort reported by Simon et al.some 20% of patients will later receive a revised diagnosis of iTTP when autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 become positive and/or clinical relapses occur.

Such a proposed study needs broad academic input from many centers and needs to be funded. The International Working Group on TTP, may be optimally positioned to set up a Steering Committee preparing a study protocol and I would hope that, besides academically acquired funding, industry will substantially support such an investigation.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: 100 years of research on moschcowitz syndrome [^117C1oHH]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In the 100 years since Eli Moschcowitz reported the first case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there has been remarkable awareness and progress in the diagnosis and management of this rare blood disorder. This progress initially was the result of careful clinical observations followed by well thought-out therapeutic interventions, with dual goals of both improving outcomes and discerning the pathophysiology of TTP. The discovery of the ADAMTS13 protease set in motion the efforts to more accurately define the specific etiologies of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) based on objective, scientific data rather than clinical characterizations alone. This accurate differentiation led to better and more revealing clinical trials and advancements in the treatment of TTP and other TMAs. Further advances followed and included improvements in immune-suppressive therapy and targeted therapies of immune-mediated TTP (iTTP; caplacizumab) and congenital TTP (cTTP; recombinant ADAMTS13). The longitudinal study of patients with TTP revealed the unexpected risk for long-term complications in both patients with iTTP and those with cTTP in remission. Ongoing studies aim to further understand the prevalence, mechanisms, and appropriate screening for these mood disorders, neurocognitive deficits, and cardiovascular complications that develop at remarkably high rates and are associated with a decreased life expectancy. These discoveries are a result of the collaborative efforts of investigators worldwide that have been fostered by the frequent interactions of investigators via the International TTP Working Group meetings and TMA workshops held regularly at international meetings. These efforts will support the rapid pace of discovery and improved understanding of this rare disease.

### How I treat thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^112N32Vb]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The last 10 years has been associated with a paradigm shift in our understanding, diagnosis, treatment and continuing clinical and basic research into Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Here we will concentrate specifically on TTP and aHUS, which, for many years were considered to be the same disease, but it is now clear that their pathophysiology and therapies are quite distinct. TTP results from a deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), a serine metalloprotease required for the cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In the majority of cases, the low ADAMTS13 levels are due to Anti‐ADAMTS13 autoantibodies and an underlying disturbance in immune function. aHUS is the consequence of dysregulation of the complement system associated with gain‐ or loss‐of‐function mutations causing excessive complement activation.

However, in both disorders, further environmental and possible genetic triggers will be needed for disease presentation.

### New-onset and idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: incidence, diagnostic validity, and potential risk factors [^111xECnM]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence rate for new-onset and idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) among adults 20–64 years old, the validity of diagnostic criteria, and potential risk factors for TTP.

Methods

This retrospective observational study analyzed automated administrative data from 11 geographically dispersed U.S. health plans. Cases of TTP were identified based on the presence of an inpatient hospital claim for TTP (ICD-9-CM 446.6) between 1/1/97 and 12/31/01 and confirmed by medical record review. Pharmacy and medical claims were used to evaluate outpatient drug exposure and comorbidities preceding hospitalization for TTP. Cases and the base population were screened so as to result in an incidence rate for idiopathic TTP.

Results

We confirmed new-onset and idiopathic TTP in 9 of 15 presumptive cases for an incidence density of 1.4 per million person-years (95% CI: 0.6–2.6). The rate increased to 1.8 per million person-years after projection and age-standardization. The highest incidence rate of TTP was found in patients 50–64 years old (2.8 per million person-years; 95% CI: 0.8–7.1). These 9 patients had no apparent risk factors for TTP based on claims and medical record data.

Conclusions

In a general U.S. population, the incidence rate of confirmed new-onset and idiopathic TTP was lower than previously reported, but appears to be on the rise. Our findings suggest that administrative claims data are useful for identifying outpatient drug exposures and comorbidities potentially associated with TTP.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy and indications for therapeutic plasma exchange [^111a9Cz7]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a clinicopathological condition associated with a wide variety of medical conditions. TMA is classically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular thrombi that cause end-organ damage. The most prominent diagnoses associated with TMA are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although TTP and HUS can have similar clinical and laboratory features and are often lumped together as a combined entity referred to as "TTP/HUS", the pathologic processes causing TMA and optimal therapies for these conditions are different. Empiric use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in the setting of TMA is common. The high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with some causes of TMA justify rapid institution of this relatively low-risk procedure. However, many causes of TMA do not respond to TPE and prolonged courses of exchange in the absence of an underlying diagnosis may cause a detrimental delay in appropriate medical therapy. The American Society of Apheresis has published guidelines for the use of TPE for several distinct conditions associated with TMA. This list is not comprehensive and the use of TPE for other causes of TMA may be considered if the mechanism of the underlying disease process provides a clear rationale for this intervention.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anemia, fluctuating neurological deficits, fever, and renal impairment. This case report is about a young man who presented with acute onset right sided paralysis, dysarthria, and central facial paralysis, suggestive of cerebrovascular accident, but eventually diagnosed as TTP. In addition, the clinical presentation of TTP is discussed and some teaching points for the emergency physicians are emphasised.

### None of the above: thrombotic microangiopathy beyond TTP and HUS [^114qhRB8]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are appropriately at the top of a clinician's differential when a patient presents with a clinical picture consistent with an acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, there are several additional diagnoses that should be considered in patients presenting with an acute TMA, especially in patients with nondeficient ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity (> 10%). An increased awareness of drug-induced TMA is also essential because the key to their diagnosis more often is an appropriately detailed medical history to inquire about potential exposures. Widespread inflammation and endothelial damage are central in the pathogenesis of the TMA, with the treatment directed at the underlying disease if possible. TMA presentations in the critically ill, drug-induced TMA, cancer-associated TMA, and hematopoietic transplant-associated TMA (TA-TMA) and their specific treatment, where applicable, will be discussed in this manuscript. A complete assessment of all the potential etiologies for the TMA findings including acquired TTP will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and prevent prolonged or inappropriate treatment with plasma exchange therapy when it is less likely to be successful.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a thrombotic disorder caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency [^111VqTo8]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

A serious disorder with characteristic microvascular thrombosis involving the brain and other organs, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with thrombocytopenia, hemolysis with schistocytes on blood smears, and mental changes or seizures. It may progress rapidly to a fatal end if the patient is not treated immediately with plasma. Recent advances have shown that TTP is caused by deficiency of a circulating, von Willebrand factor cleaving metalloprotease, ADAMTS13. This new knowledge will provide clues to improve the diagnosis and management of this intriguing disease.

### Impact of new medications on the treatment of immune TTP [^116XxA7j]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The last decade has seen the introduction of 2 new licensed therapies for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), caplacizumab and recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13), for immune and congenital TTP (cTTP), respectively. They improve acute TTP outcomes, and reduce the need for plasma therapy, time to clinical response, and treatment burden. Future pathways need to replace plasma exchange in acute TTP and optimize/personalize rADAMTS13 in cTTP. Future emphasis should focus on additional monoclonals/treatments to tackle ADAMTS13 antibodies.

### Ipilimumab-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) [^117Di2s1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) was the first immune checkpoint receptor clinically targeted for use in cancer treatment. It is expressed exclusively on T-cells where its primary role is to regulate the amplitude of the early stages of T-cell activation.1 Ipilimumab, a CTLA-4 blocking antibody, has been widely used for the treatment of patients with high risk and metastatic melanoma. Given its mechanism of action and consequent immune activation, the side effect profile of this drug greatly differs from that of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. Adverse events are from the most part immune-mediated, ranging from the more common, such as rash and fatigue, to the less common, such as immune endocrinopathy and colitis.

Case presentation

We describe a case of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in a 68 year-old woman with high risk, stage III melanoma occurring after 3 cycles of adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab as part of a clinical trial.

Conclusion

The range of immune-mediated adverse events during treatment with ipilimumab is wide and varied and clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion when managing these patients.

### A third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^111LYDqS]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

It is clear that concerted, multicenter efforts would be ideal to clarify the nature of uTTP. Such exemplary country-wide collaborative cohorts as provided by the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies will be instrumental in unraveling the pathophysiology of uTTP and thereby establishing whether therapeutic plasma exchange with plasma replacement, corticosteroids, other immunosuppressant drugs and caplacizumabare the optimal measures also in this form of TTP.

In brief, the research on TTP must go on!

### More on the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^112Npjsn]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, many publications have clarified the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure.TTP is a clinical entity caused by the deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). ADAMTS13, also known as von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving protease, is responsible for cleaving VWF multimers, thereby quenching the heightened activity of ultra-large VWF multimers in binding to Gp1b receptors on platelets. In the absence of ADAMTS13 (i.e. in TTP), ultra-large VWF multimers accumulate in plasma, resulting in the widespread formation of VWF- and platelet-rich microthrombi.

Congenital TTP is caused by defects in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to decreased or absent enzyme activity. In contrast, in most patients with immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), ADAMTS13 deficiency is an acquired disorder due to the development of antibodies against ADAMTS13, which promote the clearance of ADAMTS13 from the circulation or inhibit its activity. Mariotte et al. reported that TTP can also occur without anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies as an acquired form of unknown cause (uTTP) and unclear mechanism. The same group reported that 20% of the cases in their national cohort were uTTP, although 21% of them needed to be revisited because anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies were actually detected during follow-up. In the remaining cases, the absence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, searched for using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, excluded the presence of ADAMTS13 activity inhibition, as confirmed by the Bethesda method or plasma mixing assay. Therefore, the authors suggested a non-immune mechanism involving the destruction or consumption of ADAMTS13, and concluded that the absence at baseline of detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies in patients with typical features of iTTP (such as young age, cerebral involvement, severe thrombocytopenia, and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency) should not rule out a diagnosis of iTTP.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^116vC4GD]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
A representation of current Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) epidemiology and its main mechanisms. (A) An overview of a population of 100 TTP patients and the likely distribution of the different types of TTP is shown (adapted from reference). (B) The multimeric size distribution of von Willebrand factor (VWF; adapted from reference). (C) Comparison between normal physiologic conditions of blood flow and TTP. The basic mechanisms of disease are shown, as well as the characteristic signs and symptoms. The relative sizes of ADAMTS13, autoantibodies, VWF multimers and blood cell components is not to scale. In physiologic conditions, functional ADAMTS13 (green ADAMTS13 molecules) cleaves [unusually large (UL)]‐VWF multimers that are secreted from endothelial cells and unravel under high shear stress conditions. In TTP, ADAMTS13 is not functional (activity < 10%) either due to mutations (yellow ADAMTS13 molecules)/lack of its secretion (cTTP), or because of autoantibodies that target functional ADAMTS13 and directly inhibit its activity and/or clear it from circulation (iTTP). In TTP, UL‐VWF multimers are not processed and this facilitates platelet recruitment and thrombosis within the circulation, as well as red‐blood‐cell damage (red blood cells get fragmented and will appear as schistocytes in a blood film)

A delay in the management of TTP worsens its prognosis. Several ADAMTS13 assays exist, and having the ADAMTS13 activity results early at presentation would allow a fast and effective distinction of TTP from another TMA. Since ADAMTS13 tests are not always directly available in all healthcare facilities, time lags usually existand therefore the initial diagnosis of TTP is frequently a clinical diagnosis. To assist the clinician in predicting the ADAMTS13 activity level, clinical score systems have been developed. Among the most popular are the French Score, set out by the French TMA Reference Center (CNR‐MAT), and more recently the PLASMIC Score. The difference between both scores is that the French Score presupposes that patients have a TMA with no associated condition. Clinical experience and awareness of TTP as a possible diagnosis is essential to prevent misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and adverse outcomes owing to delayed treatment. This aspect is of particular importance at a time when new standards of care started early in the course of disease allow survival of virtually all patients.

### Von Willebrand factor and its cleaving protease ADAMTS13 balance in coronary artery vessels: lessons learned from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. A narrative review [^116D7jQq]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 is central to the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a microangiopathic syndrome that presents as an acute medical emergency. In this review we will explore the evidence of a two-way relationship between TTP and ACS. Moreover, we will review the evidence emerged from epidemiological studies of an inverse relationship between the plasma levels of ADAMTS13 and the risk of ACS.

Methods and Results

Pubmed, MEDLINE and EMBASE, CINHAL, COCHRANE and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to January 2017. The search yielded 43 studies representing 23 unique patient cases, 5 case series, 5 cohort studies and 10 case-control studies. Most ACS cases developing in the setting of TTP resolved with standard treatment of the underlying microangiopathy, with only a few requiring coronary invasive management. Antiplatelet therapy was not usually prescribed and all of the currently used P2Y 12 were felt to be a potential trigger for a TTP-like syndrome, although our review revealed that the occurrence of TTP in patients treated with new P2Y 12 antagonists is rare. Most studies confirmed the inverse association among ADAMTS13 levels and ACS.

Conclusions

The heart is a definite target organ in TTP. The clinical spectrum of its involvement is probably influenced by local factors that add on to the systemic deficiency characteristic of TTP. It follows that patients with TTP should be carefully monitored for ACS events, especially when multiple risk factors for coronary disease exist.

### The third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura shows up again: what is it, does it even exist, how to find out? Comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^116y9ZhQ]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Is there a third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?

In 2016, Mariotte and colleagues published a large cross-sectional study on behalf of the French CNR-MAT on more than 900 adult patients hospitalized in the years 1999 to 2013 for a first bout of acute TMA associated with severely decreased functional activity of ADAMTS13. From 772 patients clinical and laboratory data at admission, before starting plasma therapy, were available: 378 patients had idiopathic TTP without an accompanying clinical condition and 394 had non-idiopathic TTP, i.e. TTP with a concomitant disorder, such as an infection, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, cancer, organ transplantation, and certain drugs. Pathophysiologically, 585/772 (75%) were diagnosed as iTTP, 21/772 (3%) had cTTP, and 166/772 (22%) received a diagnosis of acquired TTP of unknown cause (uTTP). The pathophysiological diagnosis of iTTP in 75% of the patients was based on the detection of free anti-ADAMTS13 IgG antibodies in the plasma, cTTP in 3% was established based on lacking anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies and biallelic ADAMTS13 genetic variants, whereas uTTP in 22% of the cohort was diagnosed in those with acquired severe ADAMTS13 deficiency without detectable anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies. Of note, most cases with an idiopathic TTP presentation had iTTP (345/378, 91%) whereas among the cases of non-idiopathic acquired TTP only 240/373 (64%) had iTTP and 133/373 had uTTP. Thus, the diagnosis of uTTP was made predominantly in cases of non-idiopathic TTP and was associated with sepsis, cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus, transplantation and other conditions.

### Prognostic risk-stratified score for predicting mortality in hospitalized patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: nationally representative data from 2007 to 2012 [^1172FWKE]. Transfusion (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "French mortality score in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (MITS score)" for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

The French mortality score in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, also known as the MITS score, is a clinical tool designed to predict in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The score is calculated based on seven key components: age equal to or greater than 60 years, platelet transfusion, acute or chronic renal failure or need of hemodialysis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, central nervous system hemorrhage, and arterial thrombosis. Each component contributes to the overall score, which ranges from 0 to 7 or more.

The MITS score provides a quantitative measure of mortality risk, with higher scores indicating a greater risk. For instance, a score of 0 corresponds to a 0.72% risk of in-hospital mortality, while a score of 7 or more corresponds to a risk greater than 60%. This scoring system allows clinicians to stratify patients based on their risk and guide clinical decision-making accordingly.

The French MITS score calculator is a tool designed to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) through seven clinical factors. Here's how it works:

1. **Inputs and Scoring**: The calculator uses seven yes-or-no questions based on the patient's clinical status:

- **Age 60 years or older**: 2 points
- **Platelet transfusion**: 1 point
- **Acute or chronic renal failure, or need for hemodialysis**: 1 point
- **Myocardial infarction**: 1 point
- **Ischemic stroke**: 1 point
- **Central nervous system hemorrhage**: 3 points
- **Arterial thrombosis**: 3 points

2. **Score Calculation**: Each affirmative answer adds the corresponding points for that factor. The total score is the sum of these points and can range from 0 to 12.

3. **Interpreting the Score**

- **Score of 0**: The risk of in-hospital mortality is 0.72%.
- **Score of 1**: The risk is 5.47%.
- **Score of 2**: The risk is 8.33%.
- **Score of 3**: The risk is 19.6%.
- **Score of 4**: The risk is 26.67%.
- **Score of 5**: The risk is 35.36%.
- **Score of 6**: The risk is 60%.
- **Score of 7 or higher**: The risk is greater than 60%.

Using these scores, medical professionals can assess the severity and mortality risk of TTP in a structured way, guiding informed decisions about patient care.

### Thrombotic microangiopathies [^115YE6kK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are rare diseases characterized by endothelial injury and microvascular clots. TMAs often lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and end organ damage. Common TMA types include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and complement-mediated TMAs. Diagnosing TMAs in the emergency setting is challenging. Laboratory tests, such as complete blood count and peripheral smear are useful in the diagnosis. TTP, marked by severe thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and normal coagulation factors, has high mortality without treatment. Early recognition and thorough evaluation are crucial for appropriate management and improved patient outcomes.

### Management of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemias with therapeutic plasma exchange: when It works and when It does not [^117X44zq]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies are a heterogeneous group of inherited and acquired disorders sharing a common clinical presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage. These disorders have been treated with plasma exchange (TPE) based on randomized controlled trials, which found this therapy to be effective in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). For the remaining disorders, low- to very low-quality evidence exists for the use of TPE. When TPE is applied, the treatment regimen used for TTP is usually applied. There is a need for further evaluation of the role of TPE in the treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies other than TTP.

THROMBOTIC thrombocytopenic purpura is an unusual disease manifested clinically by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, renal involvement and neurologic manifestations, and characterized pathologically by occlusion of small blood vessels in many organs by an homogenous, eosinophilic matter. While the disease is unusual and its etiology is unknown, the condition can no longer be considered rare. Table 1 is a summary of the number of patients with TTP reported since 1925 when the disease was first described. 1 The last review2 of TTP, published in March 1966, collected 271 cases from the literature. Since then we have found more than 30 new published cases. Neurologic involvement occurs in over 90% of patients with TTP, 2 and the illness begins as a neurologic one in 47%12 to 60%3 of patients with TTP. Since 1947, 5 almost all reviewers of this interesting disease have reported that the initial neurologic Silverstein A.
