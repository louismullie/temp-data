## Question

Mounjaro dosing in CKD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Mounjaro (tirzepatide) dosing in chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and whether dose adjustment is required in renal impairment. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for no adjustment. Next, I will review clinical trial and real-world data in CKD, including dialysis. After that, I need to check safety considerations and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate guideline perspectives and provide a practical, stepwise dosing recommendation with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that anchors dosing decisions. The FDA labeling states no dosage adjustment of Mounjaro is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, based on pharmacokinetic data showing no clinically meaningful change in exposure across mild to severe CKD and ESRD, which supports using standard dosing in CKD [^3cc4cb1c] [^a13dfcab].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic basis before I jump ahead. Tirzepatide is cleared predominantly by proteolytic degradation and beta-oxidation, with minimal renal elimination, and intact drug is not found in urine or feces; exposure is similar in subjects with normal renal function versus those with renal impairment, including ESRD, which explains why no dose adjustment is needed from a PK standpoint [^a13dfcab] [^0e35d78f].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence in CKD populations to ensure this PK signal translates clinically. In SURPASS-4, a large randomized trial enriched for cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide slowed eGFR decline and reduced albuminuria compared with insulin glargine, with benefits more pronounced in those with eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², supporting both glycemic and kidney-protective effects without signal for harm in CKD [^a12f259b] [^26198145]. Observational and small studies in CKD, including patients on hemodialysis, report improvements in glycemic markers and body composition without excess serious adverse events, though these data are lower quality and should be interpreted cautiously [^09f317a6] [^2bef75c1] [^c8c281f3].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and monitoring, because even without dose adjustment, CKD patients may have unique vulnerabilities. The main concerns are gastrointestinal adverse effects leading to volume depletion and prerenal AKI, and hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas; labeling advises monitoring renal function when initiating or escalating doses in the setting of severe GI reactions, and to consider reducing concomitant insulin or sulfonylurea to mitigate hypoglycemia risk [^3cc4cb1c] [^5548377b]. I need to ensure we also watch for rare but serious events like acute pancreatitis and gallbladder disease, and counsel on thyroid C-cell tumor risk in those with relevant personal or family history [^5548377b] [^de00c0f6].

> Let me consider guideline context to align practice. KDIGO 2024 recognizes GLP-1 receptor agonists, including tirzepatide, as options in T2D with CKD and emphasizes drug stewardship, periodic medication review, and monitoring of eGFR and electrolytes when using agents with potential adverse effects or narrow therapeutic windows, which fits tirzepatide's profile even though no dose change is required [^9c75a9c8] [^1c91d94d] [^3fc3d8fd]. The VA/DoD CKD guideline operationalizes tirzepatide dosing as 2.5 mg weekly initially with escalation to 5–15 mg weekly, mirroring standard practice and reinforcing that CKD does not alter the titration scheme [^38dbcd1d].

> I should double-check practical dosing steps and escalation, because getting the titration right improves tolerability. Standard initiation is 2.5 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks, then increase to 5 mg weekly; subsequent 2.5 mg increments can be made every 4 weeks based on tolerance and glycemic response to a maximum of 15 mg weekly, with no modification for eGFR level, which applies across CKD stages including dialysis in the absence of contraindications [^e7b269e9] [^3cc4cb1c]. If GI intolerance emerges, I need to ensure we slow escalation or temporarily hold the dose rather than reduce the target maintenance dose, since efficacy is dose-related and CKD itself does not mandate a lower ceiling [^e7b269e9].

> But wait, what if the patient has fluctuating volume status or is on an SGLT2 inhibitor with osmotic diuresis; could that change risk? Yes, I should confirm that we reassess volume status, blood pressure, and renal function after initiation and each dose escalation, especially in advanced CKD or if the patient experiences vomiting or poor oral intake, to preempt prerenal AKI and guide concomitant therapy adjustments [^3cc4cb1c] [^1c91d94d]. If eGFR is unreliable due to extremes of body composition or muscle mass, I need to consider cystatin C–based eGFR or measured GFR for drug-related decisions where accuracy matters, though this is more critical for narrow therapeutic index drugs than for tirzepatide [^9191fb53] [^3732f72a].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. No dose adjustment is required for tirzepatide in CKD, including ESRD, based on robust PK data and supportive clinical outcomes; use the standard 2.5 mg start with 2.5 mg increments every 4 weeks to 5–15 mg weekly, monitor renal function and volume status during initiation and titration, and adjust concomitant glucose-lowering therapies to mitigate hypoglycemia and GI-related volume depletion risks [^3cc4cb1c] [^a13dfcab] [^e7b269e9] [^5548377b].

Mounjaro (tirzepatide) **does not require dose adjustment** in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [^3cc4cb1c] [^a13dfcab]. The standard dosing is **2.5 mg once weekly for 4 weeks**, then **5 mg once weekly**; if additional glycemic control is needed, increase by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maximum of 15 mg weekly [^e7b269e9]. Monitor renal function at baseline and periodically, especially if gastrointestinal adverse effects occur, and adjust concomitant insulin or sulfonylureas to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^3cc4cb1c] [^5548377b]. Tirzepatide is not recommended for patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders or a history of pancreatitis [^5548377b].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide in CKD

Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist with **minimal renal clearance**; it is metabolized by proteolysis and beta-oxidation, with metabolites excreted in urine and feces, and intact drug is not detected in excreta [^a13dfcab] [^0e35d78f]. Pharmacokinetic studies show **no clinically significant change in exposure** across mild to severe renal impairment or ESRD, supporting no dose adjustment in CKD [^a13dfcab] [^e7b269e9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing in CKD

Clinical trials and post hoc analyses demonstrate tirzepatide's efficacy and safety in CKD, including ESRD:

- **SURPASS-4 trial**: Tirzepatide slowed eGFR decline and reduced albuminuria versus insulin glargine in T2D with high cardiovascular risk, including CKD patients [^a12f259b] [^26198145].
- **Post hoc analyses**: Consistent reductions in albuminuria and slower eGFR decline were observed across SURPASS-1–5, including CKD subgroups [^121fd61c] [^55983430].
- **Dialysis studies**: Small studies in hemodialysis patients show improved glycemic control and weight loss without significant adverse renal effects [^09f317a6] [^2bef75c1].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen in CKD

The **standard dosing regimen** applies to CKD patients:

| **Dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|
| 2.5 mg once weekly | 4 weeks (initial dose) |
| 5 mg once weekly | Maintenance dose |
| Increase by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks | If additional glycemic control is needed |
| Maximum dose | 15 mg once weekly |

---

## Monitoring and precautions

Although no dose adjustment is required, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor renal function**: Baseline and periodic eGFR and electrolytes, especially with GI adverse effects or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs [^1c91d94d] [^3cc4cb1c].
- **Hypoglycemia risk**: Adjust insulin or sulfonylureas as needed due to tirzepatide's glucose-dependent effects [^5548377b] [^f076ef09].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common; monitor for dehydration and AKI risk in CKD [^fa9a4c55] [^c64206dd].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Tirzepatide is **contraindicated** in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 [^de00c0f6]. Use caution in patients with:

- **Pancreatitis**: Discontinue if suspected [^5548377b].
- **Severe gastrointestinal disorders**: e.g. gastroparesis [^5548377b].
- **Diabetic retinopathy**: Monitor for worsening with rapid glycemic improvement [^5548377b].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **No dose adjustment**: Required in CKD, including ESRD [^3cc4cb1c] [^a13dfcab].
- **Standard dosing**: 2.5 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 5 mg weekly; titrate by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to 15 mg if needed [^e7b269e9].
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic renal function, electrolytes, and volume status [^1c91d94d].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Adjust insulin or sulfonylureas as needed [^5548377b] [^f076ef09].

---

Tirzepatide **does not require dose adjustment** in CKD, including ESRD, and should be dosed per standard regimens with routine monitoring and precautions to ensure safety and efficacy.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of seven clinical trials, 1539 (30.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 65 years of age or older, and 212 (4.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 75 years of age or older at baseline.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), no change in tirzepatide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a clinical pharmacology study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no change in tirzepatide PK was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Elimination

The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is 0.061 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days, enabling once-weekly dosing.

Metabolism

Tirzepatide is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta-oxidation of the C20 fatty diacid and amide hydrolysis.

Excretion

The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and feces. Intact tirzepatide is not observed in urine or feces.

Specific Populations

The intrinsic factors of age, gender, race, ethnicity, or body weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of tirzepatide.

Patients with Renal Impairment

Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Hepatic impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^c8c281f3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding safety, gastrointestinal and hypoglycemic symptoms were observed mainly in the TZP group. Even when switching from GLP-1RAs, gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, and adverse events seemed to be more frequent at dosage of 5.0 mg. Subjects with hypoglycemic symptoms were all insulin users except for one, and therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required prior to administration for patients with CKD on insulin therapy. Moreover, it is important to consider that the muscle mass was significantly decreased in the TZP group. Another valuable finding of the present study was that tirzepatide had efficacy in older patients (Table 1), although it is indicated as a risk for sarcopenia in the elderly. CKD itself was reported to be a risk factor for sarcopenia; thus, additional investigation is necessary.

The strengths of this study were that we focused on subjects with CKD who were pre-treated with GLP-1RAs. Coincidentally, our prospective, two-arm study contained mainly older subjects. This might reflect that tirzepatide is effective for high-risk older patients in a real-world clinical setting. This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was small, and the dropout rate in the TZP group was higher than expected. Although the post hoc power calculation supported the statistical validity of the results, all statistical analyses were conducted based on the PPS. Second, this was an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial. All participants received explanations about the risk-benefit, including costs and adverse events. Treatment selection was determined based on participants' individual discretion. Therefore, it is possible that the TZP group included subjects who were highly motivated for treatment or by increased concern regarding the inadequacy of their current therapeutic state. Although we addressed this issue by adjusting for baseline HbA1c, increased burdens — such as financial costs or the requirement for additional clinic visits during tirzepatide dose escalation (from 2.5 to 5.0 mg) — may also have contributed to the participant's discretion, especially in those who had no intention of changing their treatment regimen. Additionally, selection bias might have been present to some extent, even though no significant differences in patient background were observed. Third, treatments other than the target medication were adjusted at the discretion of the attending physicians, consistent with the observational nature of the study. In practice, treatment intensification options were limited in both groups because of patient characteristics. However, it is important to note that the absence of defined criteria for treatment intensification may have contributed to the insufficient reduction in HbA1c observed in the Dula group. Finally, the observation period, race of subjects, and dosage of the drug were limited. Long-term observation or high-dose administration might have changed the renal outcomes, considering the maintenance dosage of tirzepatide for T2D is 5.0 mg in Japan, which is consistent with actual clinical practice.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for subjects with T2D and CKD pre-treated with dulaglutide for the first time. Tirzepatide decreased the HbA1c and body weight, and reduced the insulin dosage. Although gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, they were not serious, and no other severe adverse events were noted. Renal outcomes were unchanged in the TZP group, whereas those in the Dula group deteriorated over 6 months (Table 2). The UACR was significantly increased in the Dula group, suggesting tirzepatide might have reduced the progression of nephropathy. Additionally, our results showed that tirzepatide was effective when switching from dulaglutide in patients with T2D and CKD. Patients at high risk for cardiovascular diseases require more intensive and safer medications; however, treatment options are limited because of the insufficient renal function of these patients. Therefore, tirzepatide might be beneficial for patients with CKD who have poor glycemic control, even if they are using conventional GLP-1RAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the therapeutic effects of tirzepatide prospectively, in Japanese subjects with T2D and CKD, in a real-world clinical setting.

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^f076ef09]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR INCRETIN THERAPIES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended as part of GDMT by guideline forming organizations to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce ASCVD-related risks in patients with T2D. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists with evidence of ASCVD benefit as a first-line treatment option in patients with T2D at high risk or with established ASCVD. Use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist is further recommended in patients with T2D and CKD unable to use metformin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. Streamlining for ease of use in patients with T2D and CKD, several GLP-1 receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide do not require dose adjustment by eGFR level for glycemic control or weight loss (Table 1).

Table 1
Key administration and dosing information for currently available GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

The most common dose-limiting side effect with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which typically resolve over time with continued use. To minimize gastrointestinal side effects it is recommended to start medications at low dose, with gradual increase every 2–4 weeks as tolerated. In the AWARD-7 trial which enrolled participants with moderate-to-severe CKD, these gastrointestinal side effects were reported in approximately 15–20% of patients. Use of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Caution is additionally recommended in patients with history or risk factors for pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and/or gallbladder disease. While GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are not associated with hypoglycemia when used alone or as add-on to metformin, dose reduction or discontinuation of background sulfonylurea and/or insulin therapy may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia (Table 2).

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^d95a5f9d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The SURPASS clinical trials reported the efficacy of tirzepatide worldwide, and the SURPASS J-mono and J-combo trials were conducted in Japanese subjects. Each trial demonstrated a marked reduction in HbA1c and body weight, with no apparent racial differences. In these trials, the HbA1c reduction by 5.0 mg tirzepatide was 1.9%–2.7% (IFCC: 20.0–27.0 mmol/mol), which was slightly higher than our result. However, the background regimen and characteristics of subjects are important. No clinical trials have been conducted where GLP-1RAs were set as the background regimen nor limited to subjects with CKD, prospectively. For comparators, the SURPASS-2 and SURPASS J-mono trials reported differences between tirzepatide and GLP-1RAs, and semaglutide and dulaglutide, respectively. Although the background regimens of subjects were diet and exercise therapy in the SURPASS J-mono trial, the difference in the change in HbA1c was 1.1% (IFCC: 12 mmol/mol) between those receiving 5.0 mg tirzepatide and 0.75 mg dulaglutide, which was similar to our results. The SURPASS-4 trial only performed a post hoc analysis of subjects with CKD. However, the proportion of subjects in the SURPASS-4 trial with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was only 17% and a reduction in HbA1c was unclear for this population. Additionally, participants in the present study were older and had more impaired renal function than those in the SURPASS J-mono and SURPASS-4 trials. Even considering these differences, tirzepatide was shown to be effective in the present study.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^8206adc8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this is the first report of a prospective, two-arm study of the efficacy of tirzepatide in subjects with T2D and CKD. As well as improving glycemic control, it might be beneficial in preventing the progression of nephropathy; however, attention should be paid to the risk of sarcopenia and hypoglycemia in insulin users. Tirzepatide might be an effective alternative for patients who have not achieved sufficient glycemic control with conventional GLP-1RAs.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine on kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS-4 trial: post-hoc analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^26198145]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

The study SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) was published by Hiddo J L Heerspink and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: is tirzepatide superior to insulin glargine in patients with T2DM with regard to renal outcomes? In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 1995 patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus, chronic or acute pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopathy requiring urgent treatment, heart attack or stroke in the past 2 months. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 995 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1000 insulin glargine (titrated to 100 U/mL SC once daily). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration decline (1.4 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²; AD -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -1.6 to -2.8). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in urine albumin-creatinine ratio reduction (6.8% vs. -36.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 37.7). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine with respect to estimated glomerular filtration decline.

Background

Tirzepatide (TZP) has demonstrated efficacy for glycemic control and weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, previous clinical trials were not conducted under the treatment of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as a background regimen nor were they limited to subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objectives

We evaluated the glycemic control of tirzepatide switching from conventional GLP-1 receptor agonists in subjects with T2D and CKD.

Design

This was a prospective, two-arm, observational study performed at a single center.

Methods

Eligible subjects were individuals with T2D and CKD who had been treated with dulaglutide for more than 3months, with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ⩾7.0%, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2. Subjects who switched to tirzepatide (TZP group) and those who continued dulaglutide (Dula group) were observed over 6months. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c over 6months between the groups. Additional metabolic parameters, including body weight and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), were evaluated. Adverse events in the TZP group were also investigated.

Results

Of the 55 participants, 48 completed the study (TZP group, n = 23; Dula group, n = 25). Tirzepatide significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight compared with the Dula group over 6months (both p < 0.01). UACR levels remained stable in the TZP group throughout the study period and increased significantly in the Dula group (p < 0.05). Gastrointestinal events and hypoglycemia were observed in the TZP group, and those subjects who suffered hypoglycemic symptoms were mostly insulin users.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide might be an effective alternative treatment for subjects with T2D and CKD who did not achieve sufficient glycemic control with conventional GLP-1RAs, as well as preventing the progression of nephropathy.

1.2 Dosing and administration

The preclinical characterization, clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tirzepatide are presented in the Panel. Tirzepatide pharmacokinetics were similar in participants with renal impairment (lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate category: end stage renal disease (ESRD)) or hepatic [up to severe (class C) on Child‐Pugh score] impairment compared with healthy subjects, indicating that dose adjustment may not be required for these groups. Tirzepatide also delays gastric emptying with this effect diminishing over time. An approximate 20% reduction in the overall exposure of oral contraceptives was observed following the administration of a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide. These results were observed in a study conducted at a point where the effect on gastric emptying was maximal, namely following a single 5 mg dose. This study reflects the effect of a single 5 mg dose of tirzepatide on oral contraceptive absorption and does not take into account tachyphylaxis observed with repeated dosing. A gastric emptying delay is also observed in patients taking other GLP‐1 receptor agonists and the effect diminishes over time. The dosing recommendation for tirzepatide is to initiate treatment at 2.5 mg and escalate in 2.5 mg doses at 4‐week intervals.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^4874db7f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Given that CKD leads to various outcomes, including death and cardiovascular events, its early and appropriate treatment is desired. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis and causes of CKD are complex, and comprehensive approaches are required for its treatment. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most common underlying diseases of CKD. Furthermore, CKD complicated with T2D had a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases and microvascular complications. According to the J-DOIT3 study, a randomized controlled trial for subjects with T2D in Japan, intensive treatment, including glycemic control, was effective at preventing the onset and progression of renal events.

Following the development of medications for diabetes mellitus, some of these drugs also showed benefit for albuminuria and CKD. Although sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a representative anti-diabetes drug that is also useful for CKD, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were recently shown to also be effective for CKD. Considering the pathogenesis of CKD in patients with diabetes is multifaceted, mechanisms related to these therapeutic effects, other than glycemic control, have been suggested, although they are poorly understood at present. –

Tirzepatide (TZP), the first glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor dual agonist, improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in clinical trials. Among these clinical trials, only the post hoc analysis of SURPASS-4 investigated the renal outcomes of tirzepatide; however, the comparator was insulin, and the background regimen was limited to oral glucose-lowering medications (either metformin, sulfonylurea, or SGLT2i). Despite the benefits of these interventions, alternative anti-diabetes medications for patients with CKD and T2D are limited because of the impaired renal function of these patients. As GLP-1RAs have steadily grown in importance, the effectiveness of the dual agonist for patients with T2D and CKD is expected. Here, we investigated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in Japanese subjects with T2D and CKD. Patients receiving treatment with GLP-1RAs, those who had switched to tirzepatide from conventional treatments, and those who continued GLP-1RAs were observed prospectively.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine on kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS-4 trial: post-hoc analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^a12f259b]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

In the SURPASS-4 trial, the dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide reduced HbA 1c concentrations, bodyweight, and blood pressure more than titrated daily insulin glargine in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral diabetes treatments and with high cardiovascular risk. We aimed to compare the effects of tirzepatide and insulin glargine on kidney parameters and outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We did a post-hoc analysis of data from SURPASS-4, a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 study at 187 sites (including private practice, research institutes, and hospitals) in 14 countries. Eligible participants were adults (age ≥ 18 years), with type 2 diabetes treated with any combination of metformin, sulfonylurea, or SGLT2 inhibitor, and with baseline HbA 1c of 7·5–10·5% (58–91 mmol/mol), BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or greater, and established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of cardiovascular events. Randomisation via an interactive web-response system was 1:1:1:3 to a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or a once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin glargine (100 U/mL). The study included up to 104 weeks of treatment, with a median treatment duration of 85 weeks. We compared the rates of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) between the combined tirzepatide groups and the insulin glargine group in the modified intention-to-treat population. The kidney composite outcome was time to first occurrence of eGFR decline of at least 40% from baseline, end-stage kidney disease, death owing to kidney failure, or new-onset macroalbuminuria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03730662.

Findings

Between Nov 20, 2018, and Dec 30, 2019, we screened 3045 people, of whom 1043 (34%) were ineligible, and 2002 (66%) were randomly assigned to a study drug (997 to tirzepatide and 1005 to insulin glargine). 1995 (> 99%) of 2002 received at least one dose of tirzepatide (n = 995) or insulin glargine (n = 1000). At baseline, participants had a mean eGFR of 81·3 (SD 21·11) mL/min per 1·73 m 2 and a median UACR of 15·0 mg/g (IQR 5·0–55·8). The mean rate of eGFR decline was -1·4 (SE 0·2) mL/min per 1·73 m 2 per year in the combined tirzepatide groups and -3·6 (0·2) mL/min per 1·73 m 2 per year in the insulin group (between-group difference 2·2 [95% CI 1·6 to 2·8]). Compared with insulin glargine, the reduction in the annual rate of eGFR decline induced by tirzepatide was more pronounced in participants with eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 than in those with eGFR 60 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 or higher (between-group difference 3·7 [95% CI 2·4 to 5·1]). UACR increased from baseline to follow-up with insulin glargine (36·9% [95% CI 26·0 to 48·7]) but not with tirzepatide (-6·8% [-14·1 to 1·1]; between-group difference -31·9% [-37·7 to -25·7]). Participants who received tirzepatide showed a significantly lower occurrence of the composite kidney endpoint compared with those who received insulin glargine (hazard ratio 0·58 [95% CI 0·43 to 0·80]).

Interpretation

Our analysis suggests that in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide slowed the rate of eGFR decline and reduced UACR in clinically meaningful ways compared with insulin glargine.

No primary studies with tirzepatide in CKD are available. However, in the SURPASS program, which addresses the glucose- and weight-lowering properties of tirzepatide in patients with T2DM, the UACR was found to be lowered compared with comparators such as placebo or insulin. In fact, a post hoc analysis of the phase 3 SURPASS-4 study (NCT03730662) was clearly associated with beneficial kidney outcomes. In this study, 2002 eligible patients with T2DM that was inadequately controlled with any combination of sulfonylurea, metformin or SGLT2 inhibitor were randomized in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to either treatment with three different weekly doses of tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg) or daily insulin glargine. At baseline, the median eGFR was 81 ml/min/BSA (18% had an eGFR < 60 ml/min/BSA), median UACR was 15 mg/g and average BMI was 32.6 kg/m 2. Furthermore, baseline HbA1c was 8.5% and 25% of the patients used an SGLT2 inhibitor. In the combined tirzepatide groups (all doses taken together), the UACR did not increase over the median treatment duration of 85 weeks while it increased by 37% from baseline over the same period in those treated with insulin glargine. The eGFR slope was −1.4 ml/min/BSA/year in the combined tirzepatide groups compared with −3.6 ml/min/BSA/year in the insulin glargine group. Furthermore, patients treated with tirzepatide were less likely to develop the composite kidney endpoint (eGFR decline of ≥ 40%, new-onset macroalbuminuria, ESKD or renal death), an effect that was mainly driven by the effect on macroalbuminuria.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^c5a96275]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Tirzepatide (TZP) has demonstrated efficacy for glycemic control and weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, previous clinical trials were not conducted under the treatment of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as a background regimen nor were they limited to subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objectives:

We evaluated the glycemic control of tirzepatide switching from conventional GLP-1 receptor agonists in subjects with T2D and CKD.

Design:

This was a prospective, two-arm, observational study performed at a single center.

Methods:

Eligible subjects were individuals with T2D and CKD who had been treated with dulaglutide for more than 3 months, with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ⩾7.0%, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Subjects who switched to tirzepatide (TZP group) and those who continued dulaglutide (Dula group) were observed over 6 months. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c over 6 months between the groups. Additional metabolic parameters, including body weight and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), were evaluated. Adverse events in the TZP group were also investigated.

Results:

Of the 55 participants, 48 completed the study (TZP group, n = 23; Dula group, n = 25). Tirzepatide significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight compared with the Dula group over 6 months (both p < 0.01). UACR levels remained stable in the TZP group throughout the study period and increased significantly in the Dula group (p < 0.05). Gastrointestinal events and hypoglycemia were observed in the TZP group, and those subjects who suffered hypoglycemic symptoms were mostly insulin users.

Conclusion:

Tirzepatide might be an effective alternative treatment for subjects with T2D and CKD who did not achieve sufficient glycemic control with conventional GLP-1RAs, as well as preventing the progression of nephropathy.

Trial registration:

This study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (registration number UMIN 000051344, date: June 16, 2023).

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^b270f5ef]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

In human subjects, international phase 1 studies indicated a linear relationship between the dose of tirzepatide and peak circulating concentrations (C max), a time from injection to C max of 1–2 days, and an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days. In patients with type 2 diabetes, over 29 days, body weight was reduced by up to 3 kg, fasting plasma glucose was reduced by up to 3 mmol/l, plasma glucose following an oral glucose load was dose-dependently reduced, while insulin secretory responses were dose-dependently increased. Similar pharmacokinetic and initial pharmacodynamic data were collected in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Neither renal functional impairment nor compromised liver function change the pharmacokinetic behavior of tirzepatide. Based on these findings, the dosage of tirzepatide will likely not have to be changed in chronic kidney disease or with reduced liver function, but dedicated clinical studies in such patients are not yet available.

1 Introduction

The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF)'s report indicates a noteworthy rise in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Projections from this report suggest that approximately 783 million people globally could be affected by diabetes, with many patients being from African countries by 2035. Furthermore, studies have reported that T2DM is the seventh leading cause of mortality in the United States.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite numerous advances in the clinical management of DKD, its prevalence is rising steadily.

The increase in patients with DKD, demonstrating a high risk of progressing to end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and necessitating renal replacement therapies such as haemodialysis (HD). Effective management of blood glucose is crucial in preventing DKD because the level of glucose control and onset of DKD are directly correlated. Additionally, the administration of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors for controlling blood pressure appears to impart renoprotective effects.

In T2DM, the intestine's L cells release incretin hormones, including glucagon‐like peptide (GLP‐1), which is pivotal in the regulation of blood glucose levels. GLP‐1 operates by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion. In contrast, intestinal K cells secrete glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in response to food intake, stimulating insulin secretion to regulate blood glucose. Recently, the GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Lilly) has been approved for T2DM treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration. Tirzepatide induces a significant body weight loss, primarily by decreasing energy intake and enhancing energy expenditure in preclinical models, and has shown robust body weight reduction in patients with T2DM.

A combination of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors, incretin‐based therapies, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, namely the 'DKD fantastic four', has been proposed for managing DKD. However, the risk of ESRD persists despite the efficacy of these agents. Consequently, a significant optimism surrounds tirzepatide, a novel incretin‐based therapeutic agent, for its potential in treating DKD.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as well as changes in body composition using bioimpedance analysis in patients with T2DM undergoing HD.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^55983430]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

GLP-1RA and the dual incretin GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist (tirzepatide) were originally developed for treatment of hyperglycemia and obesity. - Trials of glycemic lowering with these agents found reductions in kidney disease events as major secondary outcomes. GLP-1RA (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide) and tirzepatide reduced albuminuria and slowed eGFR decline in patients with T2DM, most of whom did not have CKD at baseline.- In studies of people with obesity, with or without T2DM, semaglutide also reduced albuminuria and increased the number who remitted from albuminuria categories A2 or A3 to lower levels including A1.

Meta-analyses of the GLP-1RA studied in CVOTs also found lower risk of a composite kidney disease outcome (A3 albuminuria, serum creatinine doubling, ≥ 40% eGFR decline, kidney failure, death due to kidney disease), with a HR of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.87) in participants with T2DM. The Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) trial, a CVOT of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly versus placebo in persons with overweight or obesity and without diabetes, has since reported comparable results with a HR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63–0.96) for a similar composite outcome (A3 albuminuria, ≥ 50% eGFR decline, eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, dialysis or transplant, death due to kidney disease). As only 21% in SELECT had eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or UACR ≥ 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol) at baseline, these data support the concept that CKD can be prevented. In A Study of Tirzepatide (LY3298176) versus Insulin Glargine in Participants with Type 2 Diabetes (CVOT SURPASS-4), the rate of eGFR decline was significantly slower with tirzepatide, and albuminuria onset or progression was not seen across strata of eGFR and albuminuria, including those without CKD at baseline. In the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6), participants with T2DM were more likely to remit to a lower KDIGO risk category (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.32–2.16) and less likely to progress to a higher risk category (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59–0.86) by weekly semaglutide relative to placebo. Notably, one-half of the SUSTAIN-6 population had low KDIGO risk at baseline (eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and UACR < 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol]), again making the case for CKD prevention or regression by a GLP-1RA. In a mediation analysis of kidney disease outcomes (A3 albuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, eGFR < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, kidney failure) from CVOTs of liraglutide and semaglutide, lower glycemia or blood pressure only moderately mediated (10%–25%) these benefits, pointing to direct actions on the kidney by GLP-1RA. Recent real-world clinical practice data support randomized controlled trial findings on CKD prevention by SGLT2i and GLP-1RA in people with diabetes in the primary care setting.

### Pattern, frequency and factors associated with inappropriate high dosing in chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan [^db5126eb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a persistently low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1.73m 2, typically present for more than three months. Due to reduced elimination of drugs and their metabolites in patients with CKD, there is an increased risk of potential toxicity and increased healthcare costs. Patients with CKD often have multiple comorbidities and are prescribed various medications requiring dose adjustment, therefore, it is recommended to adjust the drug dosage based on the patient's renal function. Despite this recommendation, the research indicates that clinicians find it challenging to perform this dose adjustment. According to various published studies, the frequency of CKD patients receiving the inappropriate high doses reportedly ranges from 13 to 84.3%. Independent variables commonly found to be associated with the reception of inappropriate high doses by CKD patients include CKD stage 4 & 5, polypharmacy, comorbidities and patients over 65 years of age. By evaluating the dosage regimen and factors associated with inappropriate high doses among CKD patients, insights can be gained into the extent of the problem and the patients groups who are at high risk. The data from such studies can be used to design targeted interventions aimed at improving clinical practices, patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs associated with inappropriate dosing.

Pakistan is the world's sixth most populated country and harbors a high burden of CKD patients. A press talk by a nephrologist at Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore and findings of a systematic review, suggest that over 20% of the country's population suffers from CKD. Despite this high prevalence of CKD patients, very little information is currently available from Pakistan about the frequency, the related factors, and drugs involved in inappropriate high dosing among CKD patients. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to address these gaps.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine on cystatin C-based kidney function: a SURPASS-4 post hoc analysis [^1754c2c5]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tirzepatide reduces HbA1c and body weight, and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline. Unlike creatine-derived eGFR (eGFR-creatinine), cystatin C-derived eGFR (eGFR-cystatin C) is unaffected by muscle mass changes. We assessed effects of tirzepatide on eGFR-creatinine and eGFR-cystatin C.

Research Design and Methods

Our primary outcome was eGFR change from baseline at 52 weeks with pooled tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) and titrated insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk (SURPASS-4).

Results

Least squares mean (SE) eGFR-creatinine (mL/min/1.73 m2) changes from baseline with tirzepatide and insulin glargine were -2.5 (0.38) and -3.9 (0.38) (between-group difference, 1.4 [95% CI 0.3–2.4]) and -3.5 (0.37) and -5.3 (0.37) (between-group difference, 1.8 [95% CI 0.8–2.8]) for eGFR-cystatin C. Baseline, 1-year, and 1-year change from baseline values significantly correlated between eGFR-cystatin C and eGFR-creatinine. Measures of eGFR changes did not correlate with body weight changes.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide slows the eGFR decline rate, supporting a kidney-protective effect.

### Tirzepatide reduces fat mass and provides good glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients undergoing haemodialysis: a single-centre retrospective study [^09f317a6]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

Tirzepatide is an injectable peptide approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Its weight‐loss effect primarily targets fat reduction; however, such effect on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing haemodialysis (HD) has not been reported.

Methods

Nine patients with CKD undergoing HD received weekly tirzepatide doses (2.5–7.5 mg) once a week. Evaluations encompassed tirzepatide's impact on dry weight (DW) and body composition assessed at baseline and study conclusion using bioelectrical impedance analysis. This longitudinal study included nine patients, with a median age of 53 years and median HD duration of 4 years.

Results

Tirzepatide treatment significantly decreased glycated albumin compared with the value at baseline (22.7 ± 5.4 vs. 18.3 ± 2.5%, p = 0.028, respectively). Significant reductions were observed in DW (−1.0 kg, p = 0.024) and body mass index (−0.6 kg/m 2, p = 0.050) following tirzepatide administration. Total fat mass was also reduced, but not significantly (− 2.51% from baseline, p = 0.214). In contrast, skeletal muscle mass was not decreased (−1.02% from baseline, p = 0.722). No serious side effects other than nausea were observed during the study period.

Conclusion

Tirzepatide effectively provides good glycaemic control in T2DM patients undergoing HD, decreasing DW by reducing body fat mass without increasing frailty risk.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in subjects with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a prospective, two-arm observational study [^86bd6b03]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety

Adverse events were evaluated only for the TZP group. Only one subject required the discontinuation of tirzepatide for injection site pain (Figure 1), and no other severe adverse events defined using CTCAE v5 were observed. Most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms. These occurred in those receiving 5.0 mg tirzepatide, and they were assessed as Grade 1 based on CTCAE v5 and were tolerable. Hypoglycemia was detected in two subjects with insulin treatment, and three of four subjects who experienced hypersomnia and dizziness also received insulin treatment. Their mean total insulin dose was approximately 20 units/day, and the category of renal function by eGFRcr was G3a (n = 3) and G3b (n = 2).

Sample size

Because the sample size was small in this study, we calculated the post hoc power for confirmation. The overall detection power value under a 5% α error was 0.9998 for a change in HbA1c between the TZP group and Dula group over 6 months.

### Tirzepatide associated with reduced albuminuria in participants with type 2 diabetes: pooled post hoc analysis from the randomized active-and placebo-controlled SURPASS-1-5 clinical trials [^121fd61c]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tirzepatide, a long-acting, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, reduced urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk in the SURPASS-4 trial. To examine the generalizability of these findings, we assessed change from baseline in UACR for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) compared with active and placebo treatment in a broad population from the SURPASS-1-5 trials.

Research Design and Methods

This post hoc analysis examined data from the overall pooled SURPASS-1-5 population and subgroups defined by baseline UACR ≥ 30 mg/g. A mixed model for repeated measures was used to analyze on-treatment data from baseline to the end-of-treatment visit. Study identifier was included in the model as a covariate.

Results

The adjusted mean percent change from baseline in UACR for tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg compared with all pooled comparators was -19.3% (95% CI -25.5, -12.5), -22.0% (-28.1, -15.3), and -26.3 (-32.0, -20.0), respectively, at week 40/42. Results were similar across pooled placebo, active, and insulin comparator studies. UACR lowering appeared more pronounced in subgroups with UACR ≥ 30 mg/g. Mediation analysis findings suggested that approximately one-half of the reduction in albuminuria associated with tirzepatide may be weight loss related. There was no difference in eGFR between tirzepatide and pooled comparators at week 40/42.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis in people with type 2 diabetes, including those with chronic kidney disease, tirzepatide was associated with a clinically relevant decreased UACR versus comparators, suggesting a potential kidney-protective effect.

### Drug dosing consideration in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease-a clinical update from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^5d838aef]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Drug dosage adjustment for patients with acute or chronic kidney disease is an accepted standard of practice. The challenge is how to accurately estimate a patient's kidney function in both acute and chronic kidney disease and determine the influence of renal replacement therapies on drug disposition. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a conference to investigate these issues and propose recommendations for practitioners, researchers, and those involved in the drug development and regulatory arenas. The conference attendees discussed the major challenges facing drug dosage adjustment for patients with kidney disease. In particular, although glomerular filtration rate is the metric used to guide dose adjustment, kidney disease does affect nonrenal clearances, and this is not adequately considered in most pharmacokinetic studies. There are also inadequate studies in patients receiving all forms of renal replacement therapy and in the pediatric population. The conference generated 37 recommendations for clinical practice, 32 recommendations for future research directions, and 24 recommendations for regulatory agencies (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) to enhance the quality of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information available to clinicians. The KDIGO Conference highlighted the gaps and focused on crafting paths to the future that will stimulate research and improve the global outcomes of patients with acute and chronic kidney disease.

### Clinical outcomes of tirzepatide or GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^c64206dd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The kidney-protective effect of tirzepatide was first shown in post hoc analyses of the SURPASS-4 (Tirzepatide vs Insulin Glargine in Type 2 Diabetes and Increased Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which recruited patients with type 2 diabetes, overweight, and established or high risk for cardiovascular disease. Patients treated with tirzepatide added to insulin had less eGFR decline, and proteinuria progression and fewer composite kidney end points compared with the insulin group. These findings align with studies on selective GLP-1 agonists. Notably, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly compare the association with kidney outcomes between tirzepatide and selective GLP-1 RAs. Preclinical studies suggested that GIP may attenuate local adipose tissue inflammation and reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels, which may act favorably on the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. On the other hand, GLP-1 receptors are present on preglomerular vascular smooth muscle, glomerular, and tubular cells and, thus, may directly affect the kidney. Proposed mechanisms include afferent arteriole vasodilation, proximal tubular diuresis, and inhibition of glomerular hyperfiltration. Importantly, pharmacokinetic studies showed that tirzepatide exposure was not significantly affected by kidney function impairmentand represented a viable therapy for patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD, for whom few options existed. Treatment with tirzepatide or a GLP-1 RA might pose a risk of AKI due to dehydration from gastrointestinal adverse effects. Although our analysis found a lower hazard of AKI in the tirzepatide group compared with the GLP-1 RA group, this result should be interpreted with caution since we could not identify the cause of these AKI events or their chronologic association with tirzepatide or GLP-1 RA use.

### Interplay of chronic kidney disease and the effects of tirzepatide in patients with heart Failure, preserved ejection Fraction, and obesity: the SUMMIT trial [^40c9cd53]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity leads to both heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and to chronic kidney disease (CKD); CKD may both influence the clinical course of obesity-related HFpEF; and incretin-based drugs may influence renal function.

Objectives

This analysis had dual objectives: 1) to evaluate the influence of CKD on the clinical responses to tirzepatide in patients with obesity-related HFpEF; and 2) to investigate the complexity of tirzepatide-related changes in renal function. For both objectives, we focused on discrepancies between creatinine-based and cystatin C-based estimates of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Methods

The SUMMIT trial randomly assigned 731 patients with HFpEF and a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2, who were enriched for participants with CKD. Patients received either placebo or tirzepatide for a median of 104 weeks and were followed for cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure events and for changes in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) after 52 weeks. Because of the confounding produced by obesity and changes in muscle mass, eGFR was assessed at randomization and after 12, 24, and 52 weeks by both creatinine-based and cystatin C-based formulae.

Results

Patients with CKD (based on creatinine or cystatin C) had greater severity of heart failure, as reflected by: 1) worse functional class, KCCQ-CSS scores, and 6-minute walk distance; 2) higher levels of NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin T; and 3) a 2-fold increase in the risk of worsening heart failure events. CKD did not influence the effect of tirzepatide to reduce the relative risk of major adverse heart failure events and to improve KCCQ-CSS, quality of life, and functional capacity, but the absolute risk reduction in the primary events was numerically greater in patients with CKD. Regarding renal function assessments, baseline eGFR-cystatin C was consistently ≈9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 lower than that eGFR-creatinine, with significant individual variance. Furthermore, tirzepatide increased eGFR at 52 weeks, assessed by both creatinine-based and cystatin C-based formulae, but with considerable discordance in individual patients. Tirzepatide produced a decline in eGFR at 12 weeks with eGFR-creatinine (but not eGFR-cystatin C), and it led to an improvement in eGFR at 52 weeks in all patients (when assessed by cystatin C), but only in patients with CKD (when assessed by eGFR-creatinine).

Conclusions

The triad of obesity, HFpEF, and CKD identifies patients with considerable functional impairment and an unfavorable prognosis, who nevertheless respond favorably to tirzepatide. Long-term tirzepatide improves renal function (both by cystatin C and creatinine), but the measurement of eGFR in patients with obesity receiving incretin-based drugs is likely to be skewed by the effects of fat and muscle mass (and by changes in body composition) on the synthesis of both cystatin C and creatinine.

### Tirzepatide and cardiometabolic parameters in obesity: summary of current evidence [^ad23e140]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can increase CKD risk by elevating the risk of T2D, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Weight reduction‐induced mitigation of these risk factors could potentially have a protective effect on obesity‐related CKD. Preliminary post hoc analyses on surrogate measures of kidney function from SURPASS‐4 suggest that tirzepatide may be associated with improved albuminuria and slow the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline among people with T2D. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of a pooled population from the SURPASS 1–5 studies showed that tirzepatide was associated with a clinically meaningful decrease in the urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio relative to comparators, suggesting potential kidney‐related benefits among people with T2D, with or without CKD. Additionally, a post hoc analysis of the SURMOUNT‐2 trial demonstrated that among participants with obesity or overweight with T2D and preserved eGFR at baseline, tirzepatide was associated with reduced albuminuria without adversely affecting eGFR. Further studies are needed to understand the potential association between the effects of tirzepatide on the kidney and its impact on the risk of CVD among people with obesity. TREASURE‐CKD (NCT05536804)is a randomized, placebo‐controlled study of the effects of tirzepatide on kidney oxygenation and perturbed renal energetics, kidney inflammation, fibrosis and renal blood flow, in participants with overweight or obesity and CKD, with or without T2D. In addition, assessments of kidney function among people with obesity are ongoing for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT‐MMO (NCT05556512)trial.

Sample size and post hoc power

The sample size was calculated using data from a previous phase III trial of Japanese subjects with T2D. Assuming a mean difference of 1.1% (IFCC; 12.0 mmol/mol) and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.30% (IFCC: 14.2 mmol/mol) for the reduction of HbA1c, 22 subjects per group were needed for a power of 80% and a two-sided significance level of 5%. Considering a 15% dropout rate (three subjects per group), the target number of subjects per group was 25. As a comparison to the switching group, the number of subjects in the conventional treatment group was set to be the same as that of the switching group. The post hoc power calculation was verified using GPower ® version 3.1.9.6. (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany).

### Glucose-lowering drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease: a narrative review on pharmacokinetic properties [^afffb836]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The achievement of a good glycaemic control is one of the cornerstones for preventing and delaying progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with both diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As for other drugs, the presence of an impaired renal function may significantly affect pharmacokinetics of the majority of glucose-lowering agents, thus exposing diabetic CKD patients to a higher risk of side effects, mainly hypoglycaemic episodes. As a consequence, a reduction in dosing and/or frequency of administration is necessary to keep a satisfactory efficacy/safety profile. In this review, we aim to summarize the pharmacology of the most widely used glucose-lowering agents, discuss whether and how it is altered by a reduced renal function, and the recommendations that can be made for their use in patients with different degrees of CKD.

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) [^0e35d78f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is an amino-acid sequence including a C20 fatty diacid that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. Tirzepatide selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1.

Tirzepatide enhances first- and second-phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels, both in a glucose-dependent manner.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Tirzepatide lowers fasting and postprandial glucose concentration, decreases food intake, and reduces body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

First and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion

Tirzepatide enhances the first- and second-phase insulin secretion. (Figure 1)

Figure 1: Mean insulin concentration at 0–120 minutes during hyperglycemic clamp at baseline and Week 28

Insulin Sensitivity

Tirzepatide increases insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study after 28 weeks of treatment.

Glucagon Secretion

Tirzepatide reduces fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28% and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43%, compared with no change for placebo after 28 weeks of treatment.

Gastric Emptying

Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying. The delay is largest after the first dose and this effect diminishes over time. Tirzepatide slows post-meal glucose absorption, reducing postprandial glucose.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Steady-state plasma tirzepatide concentrations were achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner.

Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of tirzepatide ranges from 8 to 72 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration is 80%. Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

Distribution

The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is approximately 10.3 L. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%).

Evidence gaps and research needs — Most included studies had shorter-term follow-up. The evidence was very uncertain regarding predefined subgroups of interest, including demographic subgroups, treatment-naive patients, and patients with established CVD or CKD, and evidence was insufficient or had low certainty regarding cost-effectiveness analyses directly comparing newer type 2 diabetes medications or pharmacologic classes. For newer type 2 diabetes medications compared with usual care, evidence was not available on the effects of GLP-1 agonists for the progression of CKD and effects of tirzepatide on MI, stroke, hospitalizations for CHF, and progression of CKD. Evidence from RCTs was lacking for examined newer diabetes pharmacologic classes in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been previously treated, and the net benefit and cost-effectiveness of combined formulations or combined treatments with newer pharmacologic classes beyond glycemic control are currently unknown.

### Renal drug dosing practices and clinical outcomes in patients with kidney disease admitted at two referral hospitals in northwest Ethiopia [^6aa3dcb9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal disease, encompassing both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a major global health concern, affecting over 33 million people worldwide and contributing to approximately 5–10 million deaths annually. AKI, characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, and CKD, defined by persistent abnormalities in kidney structure or function for over three months, are both associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden, especially in hospitalized patients. Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to renal disease due to factors such as sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and nephrotoxic drug exposure. Among the studies that adopted a Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) - equivalent AKI definition, AKI affects 20.9% of patients admitted to hospital settings and 31.7% of patients in critical care settings.

Patients with kidney disease often require multiple medications to manage underlying illnesses and complications. The kidneys play a critical role in drug metabolism and excretion; hence, impaired renal function necessitates dose adjustments for many medications to prevent toxicity or therapeutic failure. Hospitalized and critically ill patients often require frequent adjustments in drugs and doses due to their unstable condition, adverse effects, hospital-acquired complications, and diagnostic uncertainties. However, inappropriate renal dose adjustment remains a common clinical challenge. Studies indicate that prescribers frequently fail to consider renal function when adjusting dosages, which may lead to adverse drug reactions, prolonged hospital stays, mortality and worsening renal function. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, prolonging the dosing interval, or both which can be achieved through the implementation of trainings and local guidance. In addition to renal drug dose adjustment, pre-treatment hydration with saline has demonstrated the most consistent benefits, whereas sodium loading and pharmacological interventions have been less effective.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^caeffb72]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Medication management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Patients with CKD have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to reduced renal elimination of drugs, including reduced filtration, secretion, and kidney metabolism. Bioavailability and non-kidney drug clearance may also be altered, especially in more advanced stages of CKD. Drugs that can be used in CKD should be dose-adjusted based on the degree of residual kidney function; the extent of dose reduction typically depends on the level of kidney function, and some medications may be contraindicated in those with severe kidney dysfunction. Most often, as the data to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in patients with CKD is part of the FDA approval process, recommendations frequently rely primarily on the manufacturer's product labeling.

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^851bfe26]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This prospectively planned, pooled individual participant data, cardiovascular safety meta-analysis was conducted for the tirzepatide T2D clinical development program, SURPASS. The overall cardiovascular findings indicate that tirzepatide treatment given for a median duration of just over 1 year, at a mean randomization dose of 9.9 mg per week to a population with just over one-third having established cardiovascular disease, is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk when compared to placebo or comparators not known to be cardioprotective, with point estimates of HR < 1.0 and upper confidence limits of 95% CI < 1.8 for all MACE components. Furthermore, the incidence of MACE-4 with tirzepatide starts to diverge from the control groups after approximately 1 year. A similar pattern was observed in most previous GLP-1RA cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) –.

The population in the SURPASS clinical development program included a wide spectrum of people on the continuum of T2D — from participants treated with diet and exercise alone with a mean duration of diabetes of 4.7 years (SURPASS-1) to participants for whom basal insulin treatment was insufficient with a mean duration of diabetes of 13.3 years (SURPASS-5). Similarly, participants' cardiovascular risk varied among trials. The SURPASS-4 trial enrolled participants at especially high cardiovascular risk, with enrichment criteria including previous cardiovascular event, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Consequently, as anticipated in the planning of the cardiovascular safety meta-analysis, this trial had the highest MACE incidence and contributed considerably to events analyzed in the present study. On the other hand, as similar changes in cardiovascular surrogate markers (HbA1c, weight, blood pressure and lipoproteins) by tirzepatide were observed in studies with high or moderate cardiovascular risk, it was assumed that the relative treatment effect would not be different regardless of the participants' baseline cardiovascular risk level. Moreover, baseline cardiovascular risk did not modify the estimate of treatment effects of GLP-1RAs on MACE.

### Compliance with dosing guidelines in patients with chronic kidney disease [^01b0472d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the level of reported compliance with renal dosing guidelines in inpatient, long-term care, and ambulatory settings.

Data Sources

Available databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, ACP Journal Club) were searched (1966-December 2002) to identify published literature pertaining to renal dosing guideline compliance in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles addressing renal dosing guideline compliance in inpatient, long-term care or ambulatory settings were included. Six articles matching our inclusion criteria were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Patients with chronic kidney disease require appropriate medication dosing for disease severity and level of renal function for avoiding adverse drug events, preventing additional renal injury, and optimizing patient outcomes. Consensus-based medication dosing guidelines are readily available and provide initial dose estimations, which can be further individualized based on disease severity and therapeutic response. Studies conducted in hospitals found renal dosing guideline noncompliance rates ranged from 19% to 67%. Limited data in long-term care reported a noncompliance rate of 34%. While published studies concerning compliance to renal dosing recommendations in ambulatory settings are not available, an abstract indicated 69% noncompliance.

Conclusions

Based on limited published data, improvements in renal dosing guideline compliance are needed in all settings where data are available. Research is needed to further assess the appropriateness of renal dosing in ambulatory settings and inform quality improvement efforts in all settings.

Secondary Outcomes

The hazard of MACEs was lower among patients treated with tirzepatide (AHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.91; P < .001), as was the hazard of kidney events (AHR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37–0.73; P < .001), AKI (AHR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.88; P < .001), MAKEs (AHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.67; P < .001), and the composite of MACEs and all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.84; P < .001), favoring tirzepatide (Table 2; Figure 2). Our E-value analysis indicated an unlikely significant influence from unmeasured confounders (E-values of the point estimates [upper limits of the CI] for all-cause mortality, MACEs, and kidney events were 2.82 [1.99], 1.79 [1.44], and 3.24 [2.09], respectively) (Table 2). The hazard of each MACE component (ie, myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, cardiac death) and MAKE component (ie, stage 5 CKD or ESKD) was consistently lower with tirzepatide compared with GLP-1 RAs, with AHRs ranging from 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67–0.91) to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.56–1.45) for MACE components and from 0.45 (95% CI, 0.25–0.82) to 0.49 (95% CI, 0.35–0.67) for MAKE components (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

### Systematic and quantitative assessment of the effect of chronic kidney disease on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 / 5 [^d464ced0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Liver and kidney function are important patient‐specific factors that can affect drug clearance. 1 Impaired kidney function may lead to altered systemic exposure, efficacy‐safety profiles, and drug dosing requirements. Because of the growing number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States, 2 it is imperative to appropriately evaluate the effect of CKD on drug exposure to optimize drug use in these patients. Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have therefore published guidances 3, 4 to recommend when and how to conduct clinical studies to determine the effect of CKD on a drug's pharmacokinetics during drug development.

Although pharmacokinetic studies with CKD patients primarily assess changes in renal elimination of drugs, it has been reported that CKD can also affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are cleared by nonrenal routes of elimination 5, 6 that in some cases requires dose adjustment. 7 Based on these data, both the FDA and EMA currently recommend performing clinical studies of nonrenally cleared drugs in which pharmacokinetics in subjects with "worst‐case scenario" CKD are compared to those of subjects with normal kidney function. 3, 4 There are, however, differing opinions on whether dedicated CKD studies should be conducted for drugs that are cleared predominantly by nonrenal mechanisms, 8 and if such studies are conducted, what study designs should be employed. 9 Moreover, product labels for many drugs do not contain information on dose adjustment requirements in patients with impaired kidney function at the time of drug approval due to limited knowledge and uncertainty. 10

### CVOT summit report 2023: new cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic outcomes [^ec1f425d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

CKD and HF are major complications of diabetes. CKD develops in at least 40% of people with T2D, reducing their life expectancy by 16 years, whereas HF affects 10–30% of all subjects with T2D. Therefore, not only CVOTs, but also kidney outcome and HF trials have been conducted with these new medications. Until 2022, five and six CVOTs have been conducted for DPP-4is and GLP-1 RAs, respectively, and five CVOTs, five HF and three kidney outcome trials with SGLT2is were published. The RENAL LIFECYCLE trial (NCT05374291) is currently evaluating the CV and kidney outcomes with dapagliflozin (SGLT2i) in patients with severe CKD. Regarding finerenone, one CVOT and one kidney outcome trial have been completed and one HF study, FINEARTS-HF (NCT04435626), is ongoing. In addition, FIND-CKD (NCT05047263) is evaluating its effects in non-diabetic CKD patients, and CAPTIVATE-CKD (NCT06058585) is evaluating the best finerenone treatment or combination of treatments to slow CKD progression. In the case of tirzepatide, two CVOTs are currently being conducted: SURPASS-CVOT (NCT04255433) in people with T2D and a history of CVD and SURMOUNT-MMO (NCT05556512) in people who are overweight or living with obesity. Tirzepatide is also being evaluated in HF and CKD in the SUMMIT (NCT04847557) and TREASURE-CKD (NCT05536804) trials, respectively.

### Tirzepatide reduces fat mass and provides good glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients undergoing haemodialysis: a single-centre retrospective study [^2bef75c1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Our findings revealed that the reduction in DW observed during tirzepatide treatment stemmed from changes in volume status, including reductions in ICW, ECW and TBW and a decrease in body fat content. The reduction in DW because of tirzepatide treatment was −3.5 ± 0.5 kg and was also observed over an extended period of time; however, the effect was observed mainly in body fat content, showing no discernible impact on skeletal muscle mass and SMI. Recent studies have demonstrated that a decrease in SMI, or the appearance of sarcopenia and frailty, is often observed in patients with CKD, which shortens their life expectancy. In this regard, tirzepatide only reduces fat and does not affect muscle mass, thereby eliminating concerns regarding sarcopenia and frailty in patients with DKD undergoing HD.

PEW, the wasting of muscle and fat, is prevalent in patients undergoing HD and is strongly linked to mortality; the ECW/TBW ratio has been proposed as a possible marker for protein‐energy wasting and mortality, as a ratio exceeding 0.4 correlates with an elevated risk of mortality associated with protein‐energy wasting. In our study, the ECW/TBW ratio with tirzepatide administration was 0.3, suggesting a low risk of protein‐energy wasting or frailty. However, the large fluctuations in TBW in HD patients may be a limitation of applying the BIA to HD patients.

Previous report showed that exposure to tirzepatide was similar in CKD and healthy participants: the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of area under the plasma concentration–time curves (AUCs) and maximum plasma drug concentration comparing each renal impairment group to the normal renal function group were consistent, except for a 25%–29% increase in AUCs in the moderate renal impairment group. Few adverse events were reported across the renal impairment group in this study, which are similar to our results.

### Clinical outcomes of tirzepatide or GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^95f17612]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Within the cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, 14 834 received tirzepatide, while 125 474 were prescribed a GLP-1 RA during the study time frame (Figure 1). The numbers of patients excluded due to lack of follow-up after the index date were 348 of 15 182 (2.3%) prescribed tirzepatide and 4141 of 129 615 (3.2%) prescribed a GLP-1 RA. The characteristics of patients lost to follow-up were similar between groups, including younger age, a high proportion of male and Black individuals, high HbA 1c, and few comorbidities (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Following PSM, each group included 14 832 individuals for our outcome analyses (Table 1).

Flow Diagram of Cohort Construction

BMI indicates body mass index; CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist; ICH, intracranial hemorrhage; MI, myocardial infarction; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Before PSM, tirzepatide-treated patients were younger (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [11.8] years) compared with the GLP-1 RA group (mean [SD] age, 58.1 [13.3] years) (P < .001). Additionally, the tirzepatide group had a higher percentage of White patients (67.3% vs 60.4%; P < .001), whereas the GLP-1 RA group had higher percentages of Black (20.1% vs 17.0%), Asian (3.6% vs 2.3%), and Hispanic or Latinx (9.3% vs 6.5%) patients; and a higher percentage of female patients (56.9% vs 53.8%; P < .001), whereas the GLP-1 RA group a higher percentage of males (42.5% vs 37.5%). Patients in the tirzepatide group also had lower prevalence rates of CKD or anemia, and fewer were using statins, biguanides, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, β-blockers, ARBs, or calcium channel blockers. After PSM, the 2 groups were balanced, with standardized differences for all the included covariates being less than 0.1 (Table 1).

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^6b31dbae]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, from a mechanistic perspective, it remains to be determined whether the renal benefits of GLP-1 RAs are mediated through a direct action on the kidneys and/or indirectly, particularly via weight reduction.

It is worth noting that several cardio-renal benefits of GLP-1 RAs were present for both molecules with a shorter half-life and those with a prolonged half-life administered weekly.

Our study has several limitations. First, we categorized eGFR as a dichotomous variable due to insufficient data for stratification by creatinine, albuminuria, or detailed eGFR ranges. The definitions of cardiovascular and renal outcomes varied across studies, which may have influenced the comparability of results. Many studies lacked stratification by CKD status, and few reported data based on albuminuria, an essential component of CKD definition. Certain outcomes, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, were evaluated in only a few studies, and in some instances, outcomes like non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke were assessed in just one study. All included studies enrolled diabetic patients, except for the SELECT study, which included 17,000 non-diabetic patients but only 11% with CKD. Therefore, future prospective studies evaluating GLP-1 RAs in patients with obesity and CKD without diabetes are needed to better assess the benefits of GLP-1 RAs in populations for whom this treatment is indicated. It should also be noted that currently available data from clinical trials on patients treated with GLP-1 RAs who have advanced CKD, particularly those with an eGFR < 30 mL/min, remain very limited and limits the generalizability of our findings in this population. Since treatment with GLP-1 RAs is possible in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min, it would be valuable to have future data on this specific population to better evaluate whether a cardio-renal benefit exists in these individuals, whose numbers are steadily increasing. Currently, there is no available data on cardio-renal outcomes based on the presence or absence of CKD in RCTs evaluating the efficacy of the dual GLP-1/GIP RA, tirzepatide, particularly in the SURPASS and SURMOUNT programs. Therefore, such data will be of significant interest. This molecule has already demonstrated significant benefits in terms of weight reduction and glycemic control. It also appears to be safe in patients with advanced CKD, including those on dialysis, by promoting fat mass reduction without compromising patient stability. However, the currently available data remain very limited, based on small cohorts and not derived from prospective randomized controlled trials. Therefore, further studies are needed in the future.

### Effects of tirzepatide on circulatory overload and end-organ damage in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity: a secondary analysis of the SUMMIT trial [^67985831]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Obesity can contribute to CKD through multiple mechanisms including volume expansion (leading to glomerular hyperfiltration) and the effect of adipocytokines (leptin and aldosterone) to cause renal injury and fibrosis. Leptin is an important determinant of the decline in eGFR in the general population, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists ameliorate the progression of CKD. In the SUMMIT trial, decreases in estimated BV at 52 weeks (potentially related to the suppression of adipocytokines) were associated with reduction in albuminuria, but we observed no relationship with the improvements in eGFR. Tirzepatide tended to worsen eGFR estimated using cystatin C compared with placebo at 12 weeks, but this was reversed by 52 weeks, an effect that was consistently observed across all formulas used to determine eGFR. This pattern of an early worsening of eGFR followed by favorable improvements with longer-term follow-up was also observed in the tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk (SURPASS-4) trial with tirzepatideand the Evaluate Renal Function with Semaglutide Once Weekly (FLOW) trial with semaglutide, as well as other renoprotective drugs such as sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. The present study suggests that the bimodal relationship may be explained by a relatively early-onset reduction in systolic BP and estimated BV, resulting in short-term decline in eGFR at 12 weeks. This is then superseded by a favorable effect on eGFR and UACR, potentially mediated by long-term decrease in fat mass and the suppression of adipocytokines.

### Effects of tirzepatide on circulatory overload and end-organ damage in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity: a secondary analysis of the SUMMIT trial [^0f4ff1fd]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SUMMIT (secondary analysis) was published by Barry A Borlaug and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure and Obesity. In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tirzepatide on circulatory overload and end-organ damage in patients with HFpEF and obesity? In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the population was: 731 patients (393 female, 338 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF and obesity. The key exclusion criteria were major cardiovascular event in the last 90 days; acute decompensated HF in the past 4 weeks; noncardiac causes of functional impairment; uncontrolled diabetes; pancreatitis; proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic maculopathy. In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 364 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 52 weeks) n = 367 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for at least 52 weeks). In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in SBP at week 52 (4.6 mmHg vs. -0.1 mmHg; ETD 4.7, 95% CI 2.5 to 6.8). In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in hs-CRP at week 52 (39.8% vs. 4.1%; ETD 37.2, 95% CI 27.3 to 45.7) Significant increase in improvement in eGFR at week 52 (2.6 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. -0.3 mL/min/1.73 m²; ETD 2.9, 95% CI 0.9 to 4.9) Significant increase in reduction in troponin-T levels at week 52 (9.6% vs. -0.9%; ETD 10.4, 95% CI 3.6 to 16.7). In the SUMMIT (secondary analysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF and obesity, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in SBP at week 52.

- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Discontinue tirzepatide if acute pancreatitis is suspected.
- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: use caution in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: use caution in patients taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Consider reducing the insulin or insulin secretagogue dose.
- **Exacerbation of diabetic retinopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Monitor for progression of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Exacerbation of gastrointestinal disorders**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with severe gastrointestinal disorders, including severe gastroparesis.
- **Gallbladder disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tirzepatide has been associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.
- **Suicidal ideation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other chronic weight management products. Monitor for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and/or changes in mood or behavior. Avoid using tirzepatide in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. Discontinue tirzepatide if suicidal thoughts or behaviors occur.

### Rational dosing of gabapentin and pregabalin in chronic kidney disease [^934b1a84]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Dosing considerations in chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD alters renal drug elimination by affecting glomerular blood flow, filtration rate, tubular secretion and reabsorption, and renal bioactivation and metabolism. Additionally, pharmacokinetic handling of medications (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) may be affected. Reducing the dose is recommended for medications with narrow therapeutic index. Extending the interval is recommended for medications with prolonged half-life in renal impairment; however, this may be subtherapeutic and may cause end-of-dose failure. Understanding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of medications is important when making these adjustments. Nevertheless, while dosing gabapentinoids, we must also consider reports by the patient that include side effect profile and tolerability as measured against efficacy, irrespective of the theoretical calculations.

### Pattern, frequency and factors associated with inappropriate high dosing in chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan [^1b4ddd06]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The study findings highlight a significant quality gap in medication dosing for patients with ND-CKD at the study site, as inappropriate doses were prevalent, and most drugs requiring dose adjustment were not appropriately adjusted. To address this issue, the continued medical education of clinical pharmacokinetics for doctors, the calculation of GFR by the support staff prior to prescription, drug dosing services provided by clinical pharmacists, and the display of charts of drugs requiring dose adjustment in CKD patients may help to reduce the frequency of inappropriate dosing. Special attention should be paid to the drugs and patients with identified risk factors for inappropriate high dosing.

### Can dual incretin receptor agonists exert better cardiovascular protection than selective GLP-1 receptor agonists? Highlights from SURPASS-CVOT [^3c19f334]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Topline Results of SURPASS-CVOT

SURPASS-CVOT enrolled 13,299 participants with T2D (28.9% female), with a mean age of 64.1 years and established CVD (65% coronary artery disease, 19% prior stroke, 25% peripheral arterial disease). Thirty percent of the participants were already on an SGLT2 inhibitor at baseline.

The topline findings from SURPASS-CVOT, disclosed before publication of the main manuscript, reported a hazard ratio of 0.92 (95.3% CI 0.83–1.01) for 3P-MACE in favor of tirzepatide, confirming noninferiority to dulaglutide. Some secondary analyses had nominal significance in favor of tirzepatide, with a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality versus dulaglutide (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75–0.94), and renal benefit in patients at high CKD risk, showcased by eGFR decline slowed by 3.54 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over 36 months. Yet, these analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity of testing and must be considered hypothesis-generating and interpreted with caution. No formal claim of superiority can be derived from these secondary endpoints under the original statistical plan, especially from regulatory standpoints. Notably, however, the pre-specified indirect comparison with a putative placebo suggested a significant 28% reduction in MACE (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.55–0.94) and 39% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.45–0.82), which projects tirzepatide among the most effective diabetes drugs for outcome prevention in people with established atherosclerosis (Fig. 1).

Combining medications

Most medications for which recommendations are provided can be used in combination (except for GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide, which have similar mechanisms of action). Clinicians and patients may choose to avoid combining candidate medications in certain contexts, including where the additive burden of administration or additive harms of treatment are substantial, or where additive benefits are not anticipated to be substantial. For example, adults taking multiple medications may choose to avoid adding another oral or subcutaneous treatment if the incremental benefit is small. Adults already taking medications with gastrointestinal side effects (such as metformin) may choose to avoid adding in other drugs with similar side effects (such as GLP-1 receptor agonists) if the cumulative risk of gastrointestinal events exceeds anticipated benefits or is perceived as being too large a harm overall. Here, treatment decisions are expected to vary across patients depending on the anticipated benefits a patient may derive from combined therapy, their risk of cumulative harms, and how they value the balance of these effects. Of note, recent evidence supports the additive effects of drugs with strong recommendations in favour of use (SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in moderate and higher risk adults).

Table K-2. Drug stewardship activities in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — key actions include ensuring awareness of CKD across providers, assessing kidney function accurately, adjusting therapy to kidney function, performing regular medication review, and educating patients: Given that patients with CKD are likely to receive care from multiple providers, electronic health records and decision support tools can be leveraged to highlight CKD diagnosis and stage. Automatically reported eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation is common; consider use of combination creatinine-cystatin C equation when accurate eGFR is needed, and some estimate of GFR or creatinine clearance is better than no assessment or serum creatinine only. For dosing, utilize the manufacturer's product labeling for recommendations; if kidney dosing information is not available, tertiary references (e.g. Micromedex, Lexicomp) can be utilized, in some cases, specialty consult may be necessary, and when available, consider drug monitoring for medications with narrow therapeutic index. Regular medication review can detect drug-drug interactions, adverse effects, need for dose adjustment, and drugs for which an indication no longer exists; OTC and herbal/natural products are commonly used and should specifically be queried during a medication review. Patients with CKD have a key role in drug stewardship and should be comfortable informing all providers that they have kidney disease to ensure that, at point-of-care, treatment planning considers their degree of kidney function.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This 12‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of tirzepatide (12 and 15 mg [two groups]) using three different dose‐escalation regimens. The dose‐escalation regimens evaluated different starting doses and magnitudes of each dose escalation. Tirzepatide treatment doses were escalated over an 8‐week period to a final dose of 12 or 15 mg, which was administered during the remaining 4 weeks of the treatment period. Although the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on changes in HbA1c at 12 weeks, a key secondary objective was to evaluate the tolerability of tirzepatide within each of the dose‐escalation regimens.
