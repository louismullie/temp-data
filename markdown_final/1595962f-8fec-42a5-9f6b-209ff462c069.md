## Question

Can Group A Streptococcus cause lung cavitation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) can cause lung cavitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pulmonary cavitation and which organisms classically produce it. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence linking GAS to cavitation, including case reports and cohort series. Next, I will review radiologic-pathologic correlates that distinguish necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess from other cavitary processes. After that, I should consider mechanistic plausibility, including GAS virulence factors and host factors that predispose to necrosis. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I separate GAS from Streptococcus pneumoniae where needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: pulmonary cavitation in bacterial pneumonia typically reflects parenchymal necrosis with liquefaction and gas formation, seen in necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess. Common culprits include Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobes, and certain Gram-negatives, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae can also cause necrotizing pneumonia, particularly in children, so I need to be careful not to conflate pneumococcus with GAS when inferring causality [^115b4b3L] [^117SKJm8] [^1154kQqE].

> Now, I should verify direct evidence for GAS cavitation. Wait, let me verify the outbreak data: a 2022–2023 series of pulmonary invasive GAS (PiGAS) in central Scotland explicitly reported that cavitation was common on chest CT among adults with severe GAS pneumonia, which is a direct signal that GAS can drive cavitary lung disease in humans [^114djzQD]. I also need to check case-level corroboration: a BMJ case report describes necrotizing myositis arising secondary to cavitating pneumonia in a young adult with GAS, confirming radiographic cavitation in the setting of invasive GAS disease, although the primary lung pathology details are limited in that report [^117Ep7GH]. Hold on, I should also review pediatric signals: a multicenter French study of GAS empyema in children noted high rates of ICU admission and pleural complications, and while it did not quantify cavitation, the severity profile and pleural-parenchymal involvement are consistent with a necrotizing phenotype that can include cavitation in some cases [^111VfV4W].

> Next, I should review radiologic-pathologic correlates to ensure I'm labeling the process correctly. Necrotizing pneumonia shows progressive consolidation with loss of pulmonary architecture, multiple small nonenhancing necrotic foci, and eventual cavitation or pneumatocele formation; contrast-enhanced CT is superior to chest radiography for detecting early necrosis and cavities, and this pattern fits what has been described for severe bacterial pneumonias including those due to GAS in the outbreak cohort [^115BzPRw] [^116WY2ok]. Let me consider the distinction from a simple lung abscess: abscesses are typically single, thick-walled cavities with an air-fluid level, whereas necrotizing pneumonia often shows multiple thin-walled cavities evolving from areas of necrosis; both are plausible cavitary endpoints of GAS infection depending on host and local factors, so I should avoid over-specifying morphology without imaging [^115BzPRw] [^115b4b3L].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. GAS expresses potent virulence factors that can injure lung parenchyma and microvasculature, including streptolysin O, NADase, and superantigens such as SpeA, which together promote tissue destruction, neutrophil-mediated injury, microthrombosis, and ischemic necrosis. These are precisely the ingredients that lead to liquefaction and cavitation in necrotizing pneumonia, and hypervirulent emm1 clones have been repeatedly implicated in severe invasive disease with pulmonary involvement [^114EjqqN] [^115AQKRf]. But wait, what if host factors dominate? Indeed, severe systemic inflammation, microvascular thrombosis, and impaired perfusion amplify necrosis and cavitation, and these host-pathogen dynamics have been highlighted in severe bacterial pneumonias including GAS, aligning with the observed clinical severity in PiGAS cases [^115b4b3L] [^114djzQD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check that I'm not conflating Streptococcus pneumoniae with GAS. Many pediatric series and reviews emphasize S. pneumoniae as the leading cause of necrotizing pneumonia and empyema, and some mechanistic data on necrosis severity come from pneumococcal cohorts; however, the question here is specifically about GAS, and the outbreak data plus case reports provide direct evidence that GAS itself can cause cavitation, even if it is less common than pneumococcus overall [^117SKJm8] [^116GUAhn] [^114djzQD]. I should confirm that the outbreak explicitly reported cavitation as a hallmark, which it did, strengthening the causal inference for GAS in that context [^114djzQD].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence. Direct human data include a contemporary adult outbreak where cavitation was common in PiGAS, supported by a case report of cavitating pneumonia with downstream necrotizing myositis, and pediatric data showing severe pleuropulmonary disease patterns consistent with necrotizing phenotypes. Mechanistically, GAS toxins and superantigens plausibly drive the necrosis-cavitation pathway, and CT imaging correlates align with necrotizing pneumonia rather than isolated abscess in many severe cases [^114djzQD] [^117Ep7GH] [^111VfV4W] [^115BzPRw]. I should confirm that no contradictory series negate this, and I do not find reports excluding GAS as a cause of cavitation, which supports the conclusion that GAS can, albeit infrequently, cause lung cavitation [^114djzQD].

> Clinically, I need to ensure the implications are clear. If GAS pneumonia is suspected or confirmed and the patient has persistent fever, leukopenia, rising inflammatory markers, or clinical deterioration, I should obtain contrast-enhanced chest CT to evaluate for necrosis and cavitation early, because this changes management toward aggressive antibiotics, consideration of antitoxin therapy such as clindamycin, and timely source control including drainage or surgical consultation if empyema, abscess, or gangrene is present. Delays in recognizing necrotizing pneumonia worsen outcomes, and this principle applies across pathogens including GAS [^116WY2ok] [^116VRtr8] [^112NXKoo]. I should confirm that pleural involvement is common in severe GAS pneumonia, which it is, and that empiric regimens should cover GAS while cultures are pending in compatible presentations [^111VfV4W] [^114djzQD].

> Final answer: Yes, Group A Streptococcus can cause lung cavitation, most clearly manifesting as necrotizing pneumonia with cavitary change on imaging. This is supported by direct clinical observations in recent outbreaks, compatible case reports, and strong mechanistic plausibility from GAS virulence factors, even though cavitation due to GAS appears uncommon relative to other causes such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae [^114djzQD] [^117Ep7GH].

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) can cause **lung cavitation** through necrotizing pneumonia [^115b4b3L], a severe complication marked by rapid parenchymal necrosis and cavity formation [^115BzPRw]. This is most often associated with **emm1 strains** [^notfound] and can occur in immunocompetent hosts [^114EjqqN]. Cavitation is detected by **CT** [^114pxFhE] as multiple thin-walled cavities within consolidations, often with empyema or bronchopleural fistula [^116H2Vw3]. Management requires **prompt antibiotics** (penicillin plus clindamycin) [^notfound], close monitoring, and surgical or interventional radiology for complications [^116VRtr8]; outcomes depend on early recognition and aggressive care [^112NXKoo].

## Pathophysiology of lung cavitation in GAS infections

Lung cavitation in GAS arises from **necrotizing pneumonia**, driven by:

- **Toxin production**: Streptolysin O, Streptolysin S, and NADase cause tissue destruction and necrosis [^notfound].

- **Superantigenic effects**: Pyrogenic exotoxins (SpeA, SpeC, SpeJ) trigger cytokine storms and vascular injury [^112q8C6B].

- **Microvascular thrombosis**: Thrombotic occlusion of small vessels causes ischemic necrosis and cavity formation [^115AQKRf].

- **Immune evasion**: The M protein and hyaluronic acid capsule help GAS evade phagocytosis, promoting persistent infection and necrosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of GAS-associated lung cavitation

Several reports document **GAS-associated cavitation**:

- **Outbreak data**: A 2022–2023 UK outbreak of severe pulmonary GAS (emm1) reported frequent cavitation on CT [^114djzQD].

- **Case reports**: Fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia with extensive necrosis and cavitation has been described [^notfound].

- **Pediatric series**: GAS pneumonia with empyema and cavitation has been reported in children [^notfound].

---

## Radiological features

CT is the **diagnostic modality of choice** [^111QHao5] and typically shows:

- **Multiple thin-walled cavities**: Within areas of consolidation [^115BzPRw].

- **Empyema**: Pleural effusions with septations or loculations [^112Jhq2v].

- **Bronchopleural fistula**: Air leaks and pneumothorax [^115AQKRf].

---

## Risk factors and patient populations

GAS cavitation can occur in diverse populations; **risk factors** include:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Children and elderly are at higher risk [^115cyQet] |
| Immune status | Immunocompromised patients have increased risk [^1172wE8f] |
| Comorbidities | Chronic lung disease, diabetes, malignancy [^112BTirp] |
| Viral co-infections | Influenza, COVID-19 increase risk [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

GAS cavitation is associated with **high morbidity and mortality**:

- **Respiratory failure**: Often requiring mechanical ventilation [^notfound].

- **Empyema and pleural effusions**: Common complications [^114djzQD].

- **Bronchopleural fistula**: Persistent air leaks [^115AQKRf].

- **Sepsis and multiorgan failure**: Life-threatening complications [^114LYyLq].

- **Mortality**: High, especially with delayed treatment [^114sceEG].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires **multidisciplinary care**:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Penicillin or ampicillin plus clindamycin for toxin suppression [^111VfV4W].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, fluid management, and critical care support [^114LYyLq].

- **Surgical intervention**: Lobectomy or pneumonectomy for refractory cases [^116VRtr8].

- **Interventional radiology**: CT-guided drainage of abscesses or empyema [^116VRtr8].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **early recognition and aggressive management**; **favorable outcomes** are possible with prompt therapy, whereas **poor prognostic factors** include delayed treatment, extensive cavitation, empyema, bronchopleural fistula, and immunocompromise [^117SKJm8].

---

Group A Streptococcus can cause **lung cavitation** through necrotizing pneumonia, most often with emm1 strains [^114djzQD]. Early diagnosis, appropriate antibiotics, and surgical or interventional management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^117SKJm8].

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major bacterial pathogen affecting children globally. Approximately 15% of school-age children experience a symptomatic episode of GAS culture-positive pharyngitis each year. Although the incidence of invasive GAS disease under these circumstances is low (0.5%-2%), an increasing number of invasive GAS cases have been reported over the last 2 decades. This report describes a 7-year-old boy who, after being treated for GAS pharyngitis, developed a fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

A 75-year-old man of Asian descent presented to the acute medical unit with signs and symptoms suggestive of a community-acquired pneumonia. He had multiple comorbidities and was relatively immunocompromised as a result. Initial investigations supported the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia complicated by a cavitating lung lesion, and the patient was treated as per hospital guidelines. He continued to deteriorate despite appropriate therapy and developed a hydropneumothorax, requiring the insertion of a chest drain. A diagnosis of pulmonary mucormycosis (Rhizopus microsporus) was made based on microbiology results from pleural aspirate, and patient was treated with intravenous antifungals. The patient was referred to the thoracic team for consideration of surgical intervention but was not suitable due to his multiple comorbidities. This case highlighted the importance of early consideration of fungal infection in patients with multiple risk factors and the need for aggressive therapy to ensure the best outcome.

### Necrotizing pneumonia in children: a review [^112Wb5pZ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of the review was to determine the long-term outcomes of necrotising pneumonia (NP). Studies published since 1990 in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, published on PubMed and Scielo were evaluated. Our findings showed ultrasound scanning is the diagnostic modality of choice. Despite prolonged hospitalisation (median 13–27 days) and fever (median 9–16 days), most patients recover completely. Empyema and bronchopleural fistulae are frequent in bacterial NP. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prevalent cause. Seventeen studies with 497 patients followed for 30 days to 8.75 years showed that most patients were clinically asymptomatic and had normal lung function. X-ray or CT chest imaging demonstrated that almost all lung lesions recovered within 4–6 months. We suggest that it is not necessary to request frequent chest X-rays during the treatment and recovery process. Chest CT scans should be reserved for specific cases not following the expected clinical course.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by rapid progression of consolidation to necrosis and cavitation which may lead to pulmonary gangrene. Morbidity and mortality are high and chronic sequelae are frequent. The lack of guidance supports the review of the latest recommendations in the management of these pneumonias.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic therapy alone may not be enough to alter the course of the infection, and regimens, adjunctive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulins, surgery may be required to alter the course of the disease especially with pulmonary gangrene.

Summary

The causative agents, clinical features and management of necrotizing pneumonias are discussed.

Postmortem lung pathology of a patient in Japan with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection showed diffuse alveolar damage as well as bronchopneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The distribution of each pathogen and the accompanying histopathology suggested the infections progressed in a mutually exclusive manner within the lung, resulting in fatal respiratory failure.

### Multidetector CT of pulmonary cavitation: filling in the holes [^114pxFhE]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary cavitation causes significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of the presence and aetiology of a cavity is therefore crucial in order to avoid further demise in both the localized pulmonary and systemic disorders that may manifest with pulmonary cavity formation. Multidetector CT has become the principal diagnostic technique for detecting pulmonary cavitation and its complications. This review provides an overview of the aetiologies and their imaging findings using this technique. Combining a literature review with case illustration, a synopsis of the different imaging features and constellations is provided, which may suggest a particular cause and aid the differentiation from diseases with similar findings.

### Pulmonary cavitation: an under-recognized late complication of severe COVID-19 lung disease [^114eTk1R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective observational nature and the changing patient population in terms of severity of disease being admitted to hospital (and hence included in the registry) over time. The decision to obtain cross sectional imaging was clinically guided and not protocolized, and hence the study may have underestimated the true prevalence of pulmonary cavitation if some had formed in patients who did not have CT scans. Finally, treatment protocols changed over time as novel clinical evidence became available as the pandemic evolved, and the use of antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, and the treatment of superadded infections was not standardized.

### Microbiological diagnostic procedures in respiratory infections: suppurative lung disease [^116quZ4t]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Pursuing a microbiological diagnosis in suppurative lung disease can enable focused antibiotic therapy, identify pathogens of potential concern for infection control, and in some cases delineate a specific pathological process. Suppurative lung disease can be categorized as acute or chronic. Acute disease most commonly consists of lung abscess or parapneumonic empyema. The vast majority of chronic suppurative lung disease in childhood is due to cystic fibrosis. Samples from the respiratory tract offer the most useful information for diagnosis and management, but adjunctive information can also be obtained from serological methods, blood cultures and molecular techniques. The quality of respiratory tract samples is vital to aid accurate interpretation of results, and this varies according to the technique of collection. Antibiotic sensitivity testing is of particular importance in an era of evolving antibiotic resistance and can be problematical in cystic fibrosis.

### Necrotizing pneumonia caused by group C streptococci in a young adult [^114bsEgm]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

While group C beta hemolytic streptococcal infections are uncommon in humans, group C beta hemolytic streptococcal pneumonia is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 2 cases of necrotizing pneumonia caused by group C beta hemolytic streptococcus have been reported in the past. Thus, we are reporting a rare case of necrotizing group C beta hemolytic streptococcal pneumonia in a young healthy adult with no risk factors.

Discussion and conclusions

The first case of necrotizing pneumonia (NP) in children was reported in 1994, with a gradual increase until now. The most common pathogens implicated in pediatrics with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. NP is an intermediate condition between pulmonary abscess and pulmonary gangrene, where the latter is mostly accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae (BPF). In 0.8–7% of cases, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may complicate NP. The incidence of complicated pneumonia has risen in the last two decades; however, the condition is still uncommon and occurs in less than 1% of pediatric patients with CAP. Most of the children are under 5 years old, and the clinical manifestations of NP include those of pneumonia, such as fever, cough, tachycardia, chest pain, and localized chest signs, which show dullness by percussion with decreased breath and/or bronchial breathing sounds. Symptoms have long existed before presentation, and the patient looks overly sick with persistent fever, respiratory distress, and non-responding clinical and radiographic signs of ongoing pneumonia. Empyema coexists in 60–100% of cases, and BPF is diagnosed on a chest radiograph. Continuing (> 24 h) gas leakage from chest tubes is considered a common (17–67%) complication.

Children with pneumonia who remain unwell for 72 h despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be suspected for NP, especially if the BPF or loculated empyema is present despite drainage and surgical management without improvement. Extra-pulmonary site infections, such as those of the skin, soft tissue, and musculoskeletal system, should also be sought. Sometimes, following presentation, the condition of children with NP deteriorates to severe sepsis, presenting as septic shock, multi-organ failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. Reduced peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts are concerning and have been linked to S. aureus infections in the past. CXR will show underlying pneumonia with coexistent parapneumonic effusion (PPE) and shifted mediastinum, and if one or more small lucencies or pneumatoceles are seen in the 4–8-day interval of hospitalization, this imaging modality is diagnostic in 27–41% of pediatric cases of NP. In the late stage of NP, the lesion became more visible when the necrotic fluid drained into the communicating bronchi and was replaced by gas.

### Risk factors for severe pediatric invasive group A streptococcal disease [^113vwnQM]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

An increase in pediatric cases of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease was noted in the Netherlands starting in early 2022. GAS disease can range from mild to life-threatening invasive infections. Clinical and public health decisions rely on timely and detailed reporting of clinical data.

Objective

To determine risk factors associated with severe pediatric iGAS, defined as requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or death, and to analyze pediatric iGAS incidence, presentations, and outcome between pre-COVID-19 pandemic (January 2015 to March 2020), COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 to December 2021), and post-COVID-19 pandemic (January 2022 to June 2024) periods.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational, retrospective and prospective cohort study in 20 hospitals (tertiary and nontertiary) in the Netherlands was conducted from January 2015 to June 2024, with real-time reporting of data on the study website since January 2022. Children aged 0 to 17 years with iGAS (positive culture or polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical presentation) were included.

Exposure

iGAS infection.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was risk factors for severe iGAS; secondary outcomes included iGAS incidence rate and clinical phenotypes prior, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk factors for severity and mortality were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) between pre-COVID-19 and postCOVID-19 pandemic periods were calculated using Poisson regression.

Results

Of 617 children included, 351 (56.9%) were aged 0 to 4 years. For the 192 participants with detailed data collection, median (IQR) age was 4.2 (1.7–7.1) years and 91 (47.4%) were male. iGAS cases decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic and increased significantly in the post-COVID-19 period (IRR, 2.93; 95%, 2.46–3.49), as compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. By late 2023, the incidence of iGAS returned to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Factors associated with increased risk of severe disease included a post-COVID-19 pandemic diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 3.49; 95% CI, 2.31–6.26), pulmonary involvement (OR, 8.64; 95% CI, 5.50–13.55), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS; OR, 11.71; 95% CI, 4.39–31.18), and meningitis or encephalitis (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 4.39–31.18). Clinical factors associated with increased risk of severe disease were reduced consciousness (OR, 7.61; 95% CI, 1.84–34.41), dyspnea (OR, 9.89; 95% CI, 3.04–32.14), abnormal auscultation (OR, 6.32; 95% CI, 2.18–18.32), and elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.32; 95% CI, 2.18–18.32), while estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with a decreased risk (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.84). Disease severity increased in post-COVID-19-pandemic cases, with higher mortality (13 of 294 cases [4.4%] vs 3 of 218 cases [1.4%]) and intensive care admission rates (113 of 294 cases [38.4%] vs 34 of 218 cases [15.6%]), as compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic cases. Severity of pulmonary iGAS was similar in both periods. In the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, there was a significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary infections (IRR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.27–7.97), STSS (IRR, 10.30; 95% CI, 3.88–35.60), meningitis or encephalitis (IRR, 12.30; 95% CI, 4.14–52.70), and necrotizing fasciitis (IRR, 26.10; 95% CI, 5.14–475.00).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, risk factors for a complicated course of iGAS in children included pulmonary or central nervous system involvement, STSS, reduced consciousness or pulmonary clinical signs, elevated CRP, and decreased eGFR. Awareness of these risk factors is important to improve timely recognition of at-risk cases and improve clinical outcomes.

### Childhood necrotising pneumonia, empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusion secondary to community acquired pneumonia: report of 158 cases from a tertiary hospital in Egypt [^115AQKRf]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Complicated Community-acquired pneumonia consists of one or more of pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, and necrotising pneumonia; the local CAP complications. Pleural effusion is the most common complication of CAP and can be divided into three stages: exudative (simple parapneumonic effusion), fibrinopurulent (complicated parapneumonic effusion), and the organizing phase with fibrosis and peel formation. Complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) is characterized by the formation of septations and loculations within the pleural cavity. Empyema is defined as pus, on gross appearance, during thoracentesis. Necrotising pneumonia (NP) is characterized by liquefaction of the lung parenchyma and formation of multiple air-filled cavities (pneumatoceles). Pneumatoceles are thin-walled, air-filled intraparenchymal cavities that develop secondary to localized bronchiolar and alveolar necrosis, which allow one-way passage of air into the interstitial space. These necrotic cavities can coalesce and form large cysts that can rupture into the pleural space causing pneumothorax or bronchopleural fistula (persistent air leaks). Radiological imaging is necessary for the diagnosis of NP. S pneumoniae is the most common cause of necrotising pneumonia in children. Severe forms of necrotising pneumonia have been associated with S aureus strains expressing Panton- Valentine leucocidin, a pore-forming exotoxin that lyses immune cells, potentially releasing tissue-damaging proteases. Additionally, bacterial pore-forming toxins, such as Streptococcus pyogenes -derived streptolysin O and Staphylococcus aureus -derived α-hemolysin, promote neutrophil–platelet aggregation, which may drive microvascular thrombosis and alveolar-capillary destruction in necrotising pneumonia.

### Pneumonia outbreak associated with group a Streptococcus species at a military training facility [^115KB8TG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although group A streptococci (GAS) infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, outbreaks of associated pneumonia are rare. We report an outbreak of GAS pneumonia that occurred at a US military training camp.

Methods

Standard epidemiologic and laboratory procedures were used to characterize the outbreak and causative organism(s). A case-control study and determination of the prevalence of GAS infection among camp personnel were also performed.

Results

A total of 162 of 4500 Marine Corps personnel were hospitalized for respiratory symptoms during the period of 1 November and 20 December 2002, and 127 (78%) had radiographically confirmed pneumonia. The attack rate was 1.6 cases per 100 person-months. Thirty-four (27%) of 127 patients with pneumonitis had definite or probable GAS pneumonia; an additional 22 (17.3%) were coinfected with GAS and another pathogen. Pathogens, in addition to GAS, included Chlamydia pneumoniae (27 patients), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (19), adenovirus (5), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2). A survey revealed that the pharyngeal carriage rate of GAS among camp personnel was 16%. Molecular characterization of the GAS isolates found emm type 3, multilocus sequence type 15. The epidemic ended after administration of additional prophylaxis with a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin (1.2 million U) or azithromycin (1 g orally). Because the number of days from the last penicillin injection was correlated with a positive throat culture result and the occurrence of pneumonia, the dosing interval of benzathine penicillin was shortened from every 28–35 days to every 21 days.

Conclusions

This is the largest outbreak of GAS pneumonia reported in > 30 years. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for GAS to cause epidemics of severe infection and demonstrates the need for surveillance and consideration of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis among particularly high-risk populations.

### Rapidly fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia and group A Streptococcus serotype M1 [^112q8C6B]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a versatile pathogen that can cause serious diseases, including bacteremia, cellulitis, puerperal sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and necrotizing fasciitis. This pathogen also causes streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a severe response to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe proteins), which trigger overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and shock. Despite improved awareness and treatment, GAS infections remain among the top 10 infectious causes of fatal disease in humans.

Periodic resurgences of invasive GAS infections in industrialized countries have been linked to emergence of dominant GAS clones resulting from horizontal gene transfer. The ability of these clones to cause life-threatening disease in healthy persons probably depends on expression of virulence factors that facilitate penetration of host cell barriers and evasion of immune defenses.

More than 250 GAS types have been identified in sequencing studies of the hypervariable region of the emm gene, which encodes the M surface protein. The emm types seem to correlate with tissue tropism of the organism, and M protein augments GAS virulence by interfering with antibody and complement deposition, facilitating formation of microcolonies and neutralizing antimicrobial peptides, and stimulating proinflammatory and procoagulatory activities. M1 protein and M1 fragments released by neutrophil proteases can also provoke pulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation, and tissue destruction by their interaction with fibrinogen, which causes neutrophils to release heparin-binding protein, a mediator of vascular leakage. The hypervirulent emm 1 GAS clone also harbors prophages encoding SpeA proteins and extracellular streptodornase D (Sda1), which can also enhance virulence and dissemination. We report 3 cases of rapidly fatal, hemorrhagic pneumonia in previously healthy patients that were determined to be caused by infection with hypervirulent GAS.

### Lung pathology of mutually exclusive Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae [^115Wsd37]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has claimed > 1 million lives worldwide. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death from COVID-19; however, the pathogenic process of the combined infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens is not fully understood.

We describe the clinical course and postmortem pathologic findings of a patient in Japna who died from SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infection. Extensive histopathologic and molecular analyses of the lungs and other organs provided insights into the pathogenesis of severe lung disease caused by the co-infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^116yad1G]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia — HIV-infected children without combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and those with chronic lung disease have worse outcomes and typical bacterial causes. Acute pneumonia, often presumptively diagnosed in children, was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality in HIV-infected children in one study during the pre-cART era, and HIV-infected children not receiving cART who present with pneumonia are more likely to be bacteremic and to die than are HIV-uninfected children with pneumonia. Children with chronic lung disease, including bronchiectasis or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, are more susceptible to infectious exacerbations caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas spp.

### When should clinicians suspect group A Streptococcus empyema in children? A multicentre case-control study in French tertiary care centres [^111VfV4W]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of invasive group A streptococcus (GAS) infections is increasing worldwide, whereas there has been a dramatic decrease in pneumococcal invasive diseases. Few data describing GAS pleural empyema in children are available.

Objective

To describe the clinical and microbiological features, management and outcome of GAS pleural empyema in children and compare them with those of pneumococcal empyema.

Design, Setting and Patients

Fifty children admitted for GAS pleural empyema between January 2006 and May 2013 to 8 hospitals participating in a national pneumonia survey were included in a descriptive study and matched by age and centre with 50 children with pneumococcal empyema.

Results

The median age of the children with GAS pleural empyema was 2 (range 0.1–7.6) years. Eighteen children (36%) had at least one risk factor for invasive GAS infection (corticosteroid use and/or current varicella). On admission, 37 patients (74%) had signs of circulatory failure, and 31 (62%) had a rash. GAS was isolated from 49/50 pleural fluid samples and from one blood culture. The commonest GAS genotype was emm1 (n = 17/22). Two children died (4%). Children with GAS empyema presented more frequently with a rash (p < 0.01), signs of circulatory failure (p = 0.01) and respiratory disorders (p = 0.02) and with low leucocyte levels (p = 0.04) than children with pneumococcal empyema. Intensive care unit admissions (p < 0.01), drainage procedures (p = 0.04) and short-term complications (p = 0.01) were also more frequent in patients with GAS empyema.

Conclusions

Pleural empyema following varicella or presenting with rash, signs of circulatory failure and leucopenia may be due to GAS. These features should prompt the addition to treatment of an antitoxin drug, such as clindamycin.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^111QHao5]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

CT diagnosis of the suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia

Expansile pneumonia refers to an increased volume of an involved lobe or segment, with a chest radiograph appearance of dense consolidation causing bulging fissures. Even though expansile pneumonia is not commonly seen in children, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are known to cause this, with Klebsiella pneumoniae mostly affecting the upper lobes (Fig. 1). Aspergillus fumigatus in immunocompromised and neutropenic children as well as Mycobacteriun tuberculosis can also cause expansile pneumonia. When there is expansile pneumonia but no visible cavitation containing air or an air-fluid level, the variety of underlying parenchymal changes cannot be differentiated from each other on chest radiographs. These can range from exudative consolidation with fluid bronchograms to necrotizing pneumonia and eventual lung abscess and may be accompanied by a pleural effusion or empyema. These pathological changes can be distinguished on CT, allowing for different management options to be considered. In addition, CT can suggest tuberculosis as a possible cause by demonstrating typical lymphadenopathy or indicate a missed/unsuspected foreign body. Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia resulting in liquefaction and cavitation of lung tissue. The true incidence of this complication in children with community-acquired pneumonia is unknown, but it is increasingly reported, possibly due to early detection from the increased use of chest CT. Lai et al. reported a frequency as high as 34% using chest CT. Lung necrosis is suspected on chest radiographs, but the diagnosis can only be confirmed by CT. Radiologists are clear that CT yields more detailed information concerning chest anatomy and pathology than chest radiography. In the context of diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia or the other complications of community-acquired pneumonia in children, CT has been shown to be the most sensitive and accurate modality, demonstrating pathology before it becomes evident on chest radiographs. Detection and differentiation of pulmonary parenchymal complications require contrast-enhanced CT. In a study by Donnelly et al. all CT examinations performed in children not responding to treatment for community acquired pneumonia (when a chest radiograph was non-contributory) demonstrated at least one significant finding. The suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia seen on CT can be considered an evolution of events from exudation, followed by necrosis of the lung, to cavitation or abscess formation and possibly the development of a bronchopleural fistula, but since CT is not performed in a sequential, temporal fashion in children (a single CT scan only represents a moment in time) and since interventions may interrupt the process, each of these complications can be considered individually.

### Pediatric necrotizing pneumonia: a case report and review of the literature [^112oTWgp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Necrotizing pneumonias occur infrequently in children but may be associated with significant morbidity. If not adequately treated, necrotizing pneumonia may lead to complications including bronchopleural fistula, empyema, respiratory failure, and septic shock. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated agent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial treatment is the cornerstone of management, although surgical drainage may be required in some cases. We present the case of a 14-month-old child with fever and cough that persisted despite treatment with typical first-line oral antimicrobial therapy. An initial plain radiograph of the chest demonstrated lobar pneumonia. Ultimately, computed tomography of the chest revealed a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. We review the literature and describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, microbiological etiology, and management of necrotizing pneumonia in children.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Amniotic fluid interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 are superior predictors of fetal lung injury compared with maternal or fetal plasma cytokines or placental histopathology in a nonhuman primate model [^112QtEzM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-amniotic infection or inflammation is common in early preterm birth and associated with substantial neonatal lung morbidity owing to fetal exposure to proinflammatory cytokines and infectious organisms. Amniotic fluid interleukin 8, a proinflammatory cytokine, was previously correlated with the development of neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but whether amniotic fluid cytokines or placental pathology more accurately predicts neonatal lung pathology and morbidity is unknown. We have used a pregnant nonhuman primate model of group B Streptococcus infection to study the pathogenesis of intra-amniotic infection, bacterial invasion of the amniotic cavity and fetus, and microbial-host interactions. In this nonhuman primate model, we have studied the pathogenesis of group B Streptococcus strains with differing potential for virulence, which has resulted in a spectrum of intra-amniotic infection and fetal lung injury that affords the opportunity to study the inflammatory predictors of fetal lung pathology and injury.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether fetal lung injury is best predicted by placental histopathology or the cytokine response in amniotic fluid or maternal plasma.

Study Design

Chronically catheterized pregnant monkeys (Macaca nemestrina, pigtail macaque) at 116 to 125 days gestation (term at 172 days) received a choriodecidual inoculation of saline (n = 5), weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus strain (n = 5, low virulence), or hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus strain (n = 5, high virulence). Adverse pregnancy outcomes were defined as either preterm labor, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, or development of the fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Amniotic fluid and maternal and fetal plasma samples were collected after inoculation, and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8) were measured by a multiplex assay. Cesarean delivery was performed at the time of preterm labor or within 1 week of inoculation. Fetal necropsy was performed at the time of delivery. Placental pathology was scored in a blinded fashion by a pediatric pathologist, and fetal lung injury was determined by a semiquantitative score from histopathology evaluating inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, tissue thickening, or collapse scored by a veterinary pathologist.

Results

The principal findings in our study are as follows: (1) adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred more frequently in animals receiving hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus (80% with preterm labor, 80% with fetal inflammatory response syndrome) than in animals receiving weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus (40% with preterm labor, 20% with fetal inflammatory response syndrome) and in controls (0% preterm labor, 0% fetal inflammatory response syndrome); (2) despite differences in the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal inflammatory response syndrome, fetal lung injury scores were similar between animals receiving the weakly hemolytic group B Streptococcus strains and animals receiving the hyperhemolytic group B Streptococcus strains; (3) fetal lung injury score was significantly correlated with peak amniotic fluid cytokines interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 but not tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin 1 beta; and (4) fetal lung scores were poorly correlated with maternal and fetal plasma cytokine levels and placental pathology.

Conclusion

Amniotic fluid interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 levels were superior predictors of fetal lung injury than placental histopathology or maternal plasma cytokines. This evidence supports a role for amniocentesis in the prediction of neonatal lung morbidity owing to intra-amniotic infection, which cannot be provided by cytokine analysis of maternal plasma or placental histopathology.

B) Postmortem view of the lungs showing hemorrhage and edema. C) Microscopic evidence of necrosis and bacteria in the lungs (original magnification ×40).

Autopsy specimens showed bilateral hemorrhagic pleural effusions (1,500–2,000 cells/mL), heavy, blood-engorged lungs (1,600–1,700 g), and patent hilar structures, but no thoracic or abdominal lymphadenopathy. Lungs showed hemorrhage and edema (Figure, panel B). Microscopic analysis of the lungs showed necrosis and bacteria (Figure, panel C). Admission blood cultures (3 sets/patient) were positive at the 12-h reading. S. pyogenes was identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonik, Breman, Germany) and isolated in all culture bottles, bronchoalveolar lavage cultures (pure colonies, 10 6 CFU/mL), and postmortem lung tissue cultures.

GAS emm -Type

GAS was most frequently detected in blood (69 of 177 children [39.0%]) and pleural fluid (39 of 177 children [22.0%]), primarily via culture (162 of 176 children [92.0%]), and in 16 of 176 cases (9.1%), with polymerase chain reaction (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). The emm -type could be inferred for 101 of 192 children (52.6%) in the post–COVID-19 pandemic period. The most prevalent emm -types were 1.0 (41 of 101 children [40.6%]), 3.93 (20 of 101 children [19.8%]), and 4.0 (11 of 101 children [10.9%]) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In the 2022 to 2023 surge, e mm -type 1.0 and 12.0 were predominant in 46 of 77 cases (59.7%), but decreased to 2 of 24 cases (8.3%) in 2024, when emm -type 3.93 dominated in 17 of 24 cases (70.8%) (eFigure 8 and eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

The emm- type 1.0 was detected in 48.1% of severe cases (25 of 52 cases) and 32.6% of mild cases (16 of 49 cases; χ 2 1 = 2.49; p = 0.23) (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). However, multivariable analysis revealed that emm- types 1.0 and 4.0 were significantly associated with severe iGAS after adjusting for clinical syndrome (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). The emm -type 4.0, identified in 11 of 101 cases (10.9%), caused no pulmonary manifestations but accounted for 2 of 5 meningitis or encephalitis cases (40.0%) and 5 of 16 nonfocal systemic disease cases (31.3%) (eFigure 8 and eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

### Clinical considerations for group A Streptococcus… [^115P1bKQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Streptococcus pyogenesare also called group A Streptococcus.
- Group A strep bacteria can cause both noninvasive and invasive disease.
- They can also cause long-term sequelae.
- The bacteria are contagious and usually spread via respiratory droplets.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A strep infection. Guiding principles Etiology S. pyogenes are gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. They exhibit β-hemolysis when grown on blood agar plates. They belong to group A in the Lancefield classification system for β-hemolytic Streptococcus, and thus are called group A streptococci. Cause infections and immune-mediated sequelae Learn about clinical features, complications, diagnosis, and treatment options for the following conditions related to group A strep bacteria. Noninvasive diseases Invasive diseases Immune-mediated sequelae.

Transmission Transmission is most often direct person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets. It can also occur through contact with secretions from an infected person. Although rare, spread of group A strep bacteria may also occur via food. Environmental transmission via surfaces and fomites may be possible. However, it's likely a less common route of transmission. How they don't spread There's no evidence pets can transmit the bacteria to humans, the primary reservoir for group A strep bacteria. Prevention Prevention activities vary by condition, but generally focus on three important goals:

- Limit exposure and spread of bacteria
- Treat group A strep infections
- Use preventive antibiotics when appropriate Surveillance and trends CDC tracks invasive group A strep disease. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is the only nationally notifiable disease caused by group A strep bacteria.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Group A Streptococcus | Infection control… [^116DQKYV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background Group A Streptococcus is a bacterium that can cause many different infections, including strep throat, scarlet fever, impetigo, and others. A common cause of pharyngeal, skin, and other soft tissue infections, GAS can also cause severe, life-threatening invasive disease, including pneumonia, streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis. Healthcare-associated transmission of GAS has been documented from patients to healthcare personnel and from HCP to patients. Persons with GAS pharyngitis who are treated with an appropriate antibiotic are generally non-infectious after the first 24 hours of treatment. In addition, GAS can cause an array of both superficial and invasive skin and soft tissue infections. Many invasive GAS infections – such as pneumonia, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and STSS – are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in the United States.

The portal of entry is unknown in most invasive GAS infections, but is presumed to be skin or mucous membranes. Necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening condition, can be caused by GAS and is often initially characterized by development of a red or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly; severe pain, including pain beyond what is expected on physical examination; and fever. Toxin-producing GAS strains can cause STSS that typically manifests as a severe acute systemic illness characterized by fever, hypotension, and signs of multiorgan system failure. STSS can occur without an identifiable focus of infection, although the presence of concomitant local soft tissue infection is common. The incubation period of GAS pharyngitis is approximately 2 to 5 days. The incubation period is variable for other GAS infections. The incubation period for STSS has been as short as 14 hours when associated with penetrating trauma or other methods resulting in subcutaneous inoculation of organisms.

14 When screening of HCP is performed, sites from which specimens are obtained and cultured include the throat, anus, vagina, and any skin lesions. Colonization with GAS does not necessitate treatment unless the carrier is epidemiologically linked to GAS transmission in the healthcare setting. Information regarding dosage and administration of chemoprophylaxis for GAS-colonized HCP who are epidemiologically linked to transmission is available in the document.

### Epidemiology and management of pediatric group A streptococcal pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion: an observational study [^1176w9pV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

An increased incidence of iGAS in the form of pneumonia with effusion or empyema was noted by UK pediatricians in autumn 2022. The descriptors "parapneumonic effusion" and "empyema" represent a continuum from clear pleural fluid with few white blood cells, to septations and organized collection of pus complicating bacterial pneumonia. There are no data correlating the stages along this continuum with management strategy; therefore, we will refer to "parapneumonic pleural effusion" (PPE) to include all of these stages.

Data on pediatric PPE in the post-pneumococcal vaccine era suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a predominant causative agent, alongside other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. Those with GAS PPE have an increased likelihood of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission versus pneumococcal PPE. There is no agreed standard treatment for childhood PPE, with no clear difference in outcomes between chest drain with fibrinolysis and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and treatment is often dependent on local availability and clinician preference. For antibiotic management, a lack of prospective studies means no uniform UK pediatric guidance exists on choice of agent, narrowing of spectrum, route of administration and duration of treatment for GAS empyema.

Here, we describe the presentation, investigations, management and outcomes of the largest single cohort of children with GAS pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion.

### Cellular interactions of covR / S mutant group A streptococci [^116e5ngw]. Microbes and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococci (GAS) are responsible for a wide array of non-invasive and invasive diseases and varying immune sequelae with high rates of mortality and morbidity. GAS strains with a mutation in their covR/S regulatory system are hypervirulent with an increased capacity for causing invasive disease. covR/S mutants augment their virulence through the up-regulation of important virulence factors and target host immune surveillance primarily by inhibiting neutrophils. An in-depth understanding of the immunopathogenesis of covR/S mutants will facilitate the development of vaccine strategies and design. Ultimately, by targeting separate virulence mechanisms, multi-component vaccines may provide improved protective efficacy against hypervirulent GAS infections.

The autopsy was conducted 45 hours after the patient's death. Macroscopically, the lungs (left, 680 g; right, 800 g) were mostly colored red and consolidated with only remnant airspaces accompanied by a small pleural effusion. The heart (450 g) exhibited no macroscopic intravascular thrombosis. There were no remarkable changes in other organs, including the liver (1120 g), kidneys (left, 140 g; right, 100 g), and spleen (110 g). Microscopically, the epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles were mostly denuded, with submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and congestion (Appendix Figure 2, panel A). Histological analysis of 42 lung sections (Figure 1) showed the acute exudative phase and early organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membrane formation (Figure 2, panels A, B; Appendix Figure 2, panel B). We observed edema with fibrin deposits, desquamated alveolar epithelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrates, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the alveolar air spaces (Appendix Figure 2, panel C), and various degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in the interstitium. In addition, we observed neutrophil infiltration in the alveolar spaces scattered throughout the lower lobes, suggestive of acute bronchopneumonia (Figure 2, panels A, C; Appendix Figure 2, panel D). We noted a limited number of gram-positive cocci in the intracellular and extracellular regions (Appendix Figure 2, panel E). Vascular congestion was present in several lung sections with prominent fibrin microthrombi in blood vessels of various sizes (Appendix Figure 2, panel F). We did not see either endotheliitis or vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.

- Generally, people spread the bacteria to others through respiratory droplets or direct contact.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about group A strep. Types Group A strep bacteria can cause many different types of infections that range from minor to serious. The bacteria can also cause inflammatory diseases. The following are some, but not all, of the conditions associated with group A strep bacteria. Minor infections The following infections caused by group A strep bacteria are generally mild:

Serious infections Three infections caused by group A strep bacteria can be very serious and even deadly: Inflammatory diseases Long-term health issues related to group A strep bacteria include: Both are thought to be caused by an immune response to an earlier group A strep infection. As the body's defense system, the immune system is important in fighting off infections. But the immune system can mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body and cause damage.
- Cancer
- Chronic heart, kidney, liver, or lung disease
- Diabetes
- Immunocompromising condition
- Obesity
- Wounds or skin disease Other groups at increased risk for getting a serious group A strep infection include:

- American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Island populations
- People aged 65 years or older
- People who inject drugs or who are experiencing homelessness
- Residents of long-term care facilities.

Respiratory droplets Group A strep bacteria often live in the nose and throat. People who are infected spread the bacteria by talking, coughing, or sneezing. This creates respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria. People can get sick if they:

- Breathe in respiratory droplets that contain the bacteria
- Touch their mouth or nose after touching something with those droplets on it
- Use the same plate, utensils, or glass as someone infected with the bacteria Once washed, plates, utensils, and glasses are safe for others to use.

### Tissue tropism in streptococcal infection: wild-type M1T1 group AIs efficiently cleared by neutrophils using an NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism in the lung but not in the skin [^116GJDxD]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) commonly causes pharyngitis and skin infections. Little is known why streptococcal pharyngitis usually does not lead to pneumonia and why the skin is a favorite niche for GAS. To partially address these questions, the effectiveness of neutrophils in clearing wild-type (wt) M1T1 GAS strain MGAS2221 from the lung and from the skin was examined in murine models of intratracheal pneumonia and subcutaneous infection. Ninety-nine point seven percent of the MGAS2221 inoculum was cleared from the lungs of C57BL/6J mice at 24h after inoculation, while there was no MGAS2221 clearance from skin infection sites. The bronchial termini had robust neutrophil infiltration, and depletion of neutrophils abolished MGAS2221 clearance from the lung. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase but not myeloperoxidase was required for MGAS2221 clearance. Thus, wt M1T1 GAS can be cleared by neutrophils using an NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism in the lung. MGAS2221 induced robust neutrophil infiltration at the edge of skin infection sites and throughout infection sites at 24h and 48h after inoculation, respectively. Neutrophils within MGAS2221 infection sites had no nuclear staining. Skin infection sites of streptolysin S-deficient MGAS2221 Δ sagA were full of neutrophils with nuclear staining, whereas MGAS2221 Δ sagA infection was not cleared. Gp91 phox knockout (KO) and control mice had similar GAS numbers at skin infection sites and similar abilities to select SpeB activity-negative (SpeB A-) variants. These results indicate that phagocyte NADPH oxidase-mediated GAS killing is compromised in the skin. Our findings support a model for GAS skin tropism in which GAS generates an anoxic niche to evade phagocyte NADPH oxidase-mediated clearance.

### Surgical management of a COVID-19-associated necrotic pneumonia [^116VRtr8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Necrotising pneumonia is a relatively rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia. Necrosis is defined as cellular/tissue death typically in the context of poor parenchymal oxygenation. Pathogenesis may relate to either (1) organism-associated toxin production or (2) parenchymal ischaemia secondary to vasculitis/microthrombosis. Liquefaction and cavitation represent the primary pathological and radiological features. Subsequent severe sepsis and respiratory failure are associated with high mortality. Unfortunately, medical management in the form of intravenous antibiotics is limited secondary to reduced lung parenchymal vascularity. CT-guided percutaneous drainage is important in management of cavitating disease. However, surgery forms the primary treatment modality in the setting of failed medical management. In particular, surgery is indicated in the context of empyema, massive haemoptysis, gangrene and non-resolving abscess.

Surgical management of necrotising pneumonia takes many forms including lobectomy, pneumonectomy, sublobar and wedge resection. Mortality is high (up to 30%) and so surgery is undertaken in tertiary referral centres under the care of thoracic surgeons (with reported mortality as low as 8%). Few reports describe the outcomes of surgical resections of necrotic lungs in established COVID-19-positive patients.

The pathological association between COVID-19 and necrotic lung is yet to be established. However, there are striking similarities in the underlying pathology of the two. As stated above, microthrombi-induced and vasculitis-induced parenchymal hypoxia is central in the aetiology of lung necrosis. Autopsy reports of COVID-19 victims, demonstrate significant capillary congestion and associated microthrombi. Both small and large pulmonary vessel thrombosis have been widely reported. These similarities are interesting.

Throughout the pandemic, surgeries were cancelled in an endeavour to both redirect services and avoid increased morbidity/mortality associated with COVID-19 infection, in patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery. COVID-19-positive patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery were thought to have poor outcomes. COVID-19-induced necrotic lung represents a particular case. The authors demonstrate the safe and efficacious management of a necrotic lung secondary to COVID-19.

General considerations for human respiratory bacterial infections describe that they "are initiated by an unknown dose of the infectious agent that enters the respiratory tract through an unknown route (inhalation, microaspiration) at an unknown time", and note that "Typically, vulnerable humans such as the immune-insufficient like in infants, elderly persons, and those with a debilitating chronic disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis), as well as the immunodeficient (e.g., those with cancer) and the immunosuppressed (e.g., pregnant mothers, corticosteroid-treated patients, transplant recipients), are more likely to have bacterial infections that progress to pneumonia". If initial defenses fail, "inflammation ensues, leading to alveolar consolidation of varying intensities", with symptoms that "such as fever, productive cough, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia develop", and although "most patients recover with antibiotic treatment, some develop severe disease that can be fatal".

### Group A Streptococcus necrotising myositis of the limbs secondary to cavitating pneumonia [^117Ep7GH]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Necrotising myositis is a rare complication of Group A Streptococcus infection requiring early and aggressive surgical management to prevent mortality. However, early diagnosis is difficult due to non-specific initial presentation and a low index of clinical suspicion given the paucity of cases. We highlight these challenges and present a case of a 22-year-old woman presenting with cough, fever and severe limb pain refractory to analgesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. We outline potential confounding factors that can delay intervention and offer diagnostic tools that can aid clinical diagnosis of necrotising myositis. In reporting this case, we hope to raise awareness among clinicians to avoid these pitfalls.

### Clinical implications and characterization of group A streptoccoccus infections in adults with cystic fibrosis [^115SJEuj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

One such organism is Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), a common human pathogen that is rarely observed from CF lungs. S. pyogenes are β-hemolytic Gram positive cocci and facultative anaerobes. Its ability to cause hemolysis on blood agar plates allows it to be distinguished from other more indolent streptococci.

Furthermore, GAS has numerous virulence factors that enable it to evade host immune defenses, colonize epithelial surfaces, and cause infection.

GAS can cause a variety of different infections with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from mild to invasive and life threatening. While it most often manifests as pharyngeal, soft tissue or skin infections, it can rarely manifest as a respiratory infection. Although GAS only accounts for a small proportion of community acquired pneumonia in the general population, it tends to cause more severe and aggressive pulmonary infections and often manifest as empyema. The prevalence, natural history and clinical effect of GAS in the CF population are unknown. Herein we set out to determine the natural history of GAS and outcomes associated with GAS infection in adults with CF. Furthermore, we sought to characterize GAS to determine if genotypic or phenotypic features were associated with disease.

For experimental practice, "It is highly recommended that investigators create large low-passage stocks for the initiation of all experiments", and "Investigators are encouraged to identify the Global Pneumococcal Sequence Cluster of their strains to gain an understanding of the isolate's genetic content, including the serotypes carried by the lineage", noting "a new international genome-based classification system for S. pneumoniae… the Global Pneumococcal Sequence Cluster".

### COVID-19 pneumonia-ultrasound, radiographic, and computed tomography findings: a comprehensive pictorial essay [^116E5Q3w]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound, chest X-ray, and computed tomography (CT) have been used with excellent results in diagnosis, first assessment, and follow-up of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients. Ultrasound and chest X-ray have the advantages of the wide availability and acquisition at the patient's bed; CT showed high sensitivity in COVID-19 diagnosis. Ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the main CT and X-ray features; the distribution of lung abnormalities is typically bilateral and peripheral. Less typical findings, including pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathies, the bubble air sign, and cavitation, can also be visible on chest CT. Radiologists should be aware of the advantages and limitations of the available imaging techniques and of the different pulmonary aspects of COVID-19 infection.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^114iaMja]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is a clinical condition where the lower respiratory tract epithelium below the larynx is invaded through inhalation, or hematogenous spread. The annual estimation of pneumonia reaches 120 million cases worldwide, with the consequent 1.3-million deaths. In developing nations, children under 2-years of age account for nearly 80% of pneumonia related deaths. Necrotizing pneumonia is one of the severe complications of pneumonia and is characterized by continuing pneumonic illness in a previously healthy child despite proper antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis is made by imaging and pathological analysis. Chest radiographs show pulmonary consolidation with one or more small, thin-walled cavities, whereas pathologic examination shows pulmonary inflammation, alveolar consolidation, and thrombosis of intrapulmonary vessels, and consequent necrosis with multiple small cavities. Reduced blood flow due to thrombotic vessels is thought to be the cause of pulmonary tissue destruction.

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^112Jhq2v]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus anginosus group

Streptococcus anginosus group, previously known as Streptococcus milleri, is a group of three species of streptococci (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) that are commensals in the oral cavity and may cause opportunistic severe infections in the abdominal cavity, central nervous system, lung, and pleural space. These pathogens have a striking predilection for abscess formation or empyema that usually require prolonged antibiotic therapy and surgical interventions. While the S. anginosus group is increasingly recognized as a substantial cause of pulmonary infections in adults, especially immunocompromised patients, it is a rare cause of pulmonary infections in both immunocompromised and even immunocompetent children.

Affected patients with complicated pulmonary infection present with prolonged fever, respiratory symptoms, chest pain, and chest distress. The most common findings on CT include lung abscesses, found in up to one-third of cases, and consolidations complicated by lung necrosis (Fig. 3). Pleural effusions are common, seen in up to two-thirds of cases. Pleural fluid is usually complex (loculated pleural fluid, with or without septations or split pleura sign), indicative of empyema. Hilar lymphadenopathy is occasionally seen. Although rare, infection with the S. anginosus group should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients presenting with empyema or lung abscess, regardless of their immune status.

### Imaging of cavitary necrosis in complicated childhood pneumonia [^115ihVTq]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the chest radiographs (CR) and CT imaging features and sequential findings of cavitary necrosis in complicated childhood pneumonia. Among 30 children admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for persistent or progressive pneumonia, respiratory distress or sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy, a study group of 9 children (5 girls and 4 boys; mean age 4 years) who had the radiographic features and CT criteria for cavitary necrosis complicated pneumonia was identified. The pathogens identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae(n = 4), Aspergillus(n = 2), Legionella(n = 1), and Staphylococcus aureus(n = 1). Sequential CR and CT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up CR and CT were evaluated for persistent abnormalities. Chest radiographs showed consolidations in 8 of the 9 patients. On CT examination, cavitary necrosis was localized to 1 lobe in 2 patients and 7 patients showed multilobar or bilateral areas of cavitary necrosis. In 3 patients of 9, the cavitary necrosis was initially shown on CT and visualization by CR was delayed by a time span varying from 5 to 9 days. In all patients with cavities, a mean number of five cavities were seen on antero-posterior CR, contrasting with the multiple cavities seen on CT. Parapneumonic effusions were shown by CR in 3 patients and in 5 patients by CT. Bronchopleural fistulae were demonstrated by CT alone (n = 3). No purulent pericarditis was demonstrated. The CT scan displayed persistent residual pneumatoceles of the left lower lobe in 2 patients. Computed tomography is able to define a more specific pattern of abnormalities than conventional CR in children with necrotizing pneumonia and allows an earlier diagnosis of this rapidly progressing condition. Lung necrosis and cavitation may also be associated with Aspergillus or Legionella pneumonia in the pediatric population.

### Large cavitary lung lesions in a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [^1157TycP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary cavitary lesions are rare manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia. According to one case series, the overall prevalence of this complication is ≈3% of patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. The mechanisms of pulmonary cavitary lesions in COVID-19 are still unknown. Possible causes of cavitation are bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infections, but in our patient all these factors were excluded. Another plausible cause of cavitary lesions is distal pulmonary embolism or thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary infarction. Pulmonary cavitation can be associated with secondary complications such as pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and superinfection; therefore, close follow-up of patients is necessary.

### Pleural empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius and Fusobacterium nucleatum: a distinct entity of pleural infections [^113fqYHb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral-Type Pleural Infections and Lung Abscess

Lung abscess and pleural empyema are generally considered separate conditions. However, most lung abscesses contain the same oral pathogens found in OPIs and poor dental health is recognized as a major risk factor. Concurrent lung abscess and pleural empyema has been described in a small proportion of patients in studies of lung abscesses and pleural empyemas.

In the present study, 24 (38%) patients with OPI had radiologic signs of a lung abscess. A likely pathogenesis for the pleural infection in these patients is leakage of bacteria from a ruptured abscess into the pleural cavity. Notably, there were no significant differences between the microbiota of abscess-related empyemas and that of empyemas without radiological evidence of an abscess (Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Table 4 B).

We suggest that OPI and lung abscess caused by oral bacteria might represent different, sometimes overlapping, presentations of the same disease. Following hematogenous seeding to a predilection site in the lung, these bacteria establish a purulent infection leading to a consolidation/abscess that can, depending on factors like the proximity to the pleura and the immune status of the patient, erode into the pleural cavity. If bacteria spread directly to a predilection site in the pleura, it might result in an infection without involvement of the lung. This could explain why a significant group of pleural infections have no evidence of concurrent parenchymal infection.

### The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group [^1147DLcF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Previous reports of the three different members of the SAG (S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus) described that the bacteria were observed equally in thoracic infections and that there were no significant differences among these three pathogens. S. intermedius is commonly isolated from the brain or the liver, while S. constellatus and S. anginosus are widely distributed and can be found in infections of the respiratory tract or blood. On the other hand, higher rates of S. intermedius detection have also been reported from respiratory sources. In addition, S. intermedius and S. constellatus are generally more frequently associated with abscess formation than S. anginosus. In this study, S. intermedius and S. constellatus were mainly detected in patients with respiratory infections. Interestingly, S. intermedius was significantly more common in patients with "pneumonia or lung abscess with pleural effusion" than those with "bacterial pleurisy only", and S. intermedius also tended to be more frequently detected in older patients. Several mechanisms for these thoracic infections caused by SAG have been suggested, including the aspiration of oral secretions, direct implantation by trauma or surgery, extension by contiguity, and hematogenous dissemination. Teramoto et al. reported that aspiration often contributes to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in elderly patients, especially those over 70–80 years of age, and an increased age is associated with the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Therefore, the aspiration of oral secretions may be able to cause lung infection with empyema due to S. intermedius in older patients. In comparison with the two other SAG members, S. constellatus tended to be more frequently detected in male patients in this study, although there were no significant differences in the gender of patients whose cultures were positive for S. intermedius or S. constellatus. This finding is contrary to previous reports which demonstrated that there were no gender differences in the rate patients infected with these three pathogens. The reasons for the gender differences between the three SAG members remain to be elucidated and further investigation is necessary.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, affecting medium to small vessels in the respiratory and renal vasculature. Patients with WG may present with clinical and radiographic features similar to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which may delay life-saving immunosuppressive therapy. We report a 14-year-old female originally diagnosed with recalcitrant, necrotizing CAP complicated by massive pulmonary cavitations eventually proven to be WG. We also compare the radiographic features of WG and necrotizing CAP.

### About streptococcal toxic shock syndrome | Group A strep… [^1131gt1k]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rare, but serious bacterial infection.
- STSS can develop very quickly into a life-threatening emergency.
- People with STSS need immediate care in a hospital and antibiotics.
- Treatment focuses on managing low blood pressure and multiple organ failure.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about STSS.
- Hypotension
- Organ failure
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea Examples of organ failure signs: Someone with kidney failure may not make urine. Someone with liver failure may bleed or bruise a lot or their skin and eyes may turn yellow. When to seek immediate medical attention Complications STSS often results in complications from organs shutting down and the body going into shock. Complications can include needing surgery to remove infected tissue or limbs to control the infection.

Even with treatment, STSS can be deadly. Out of 10 people with STSS, as many as 3 people will die from the infection. Other health factors People with diabetes or alcohol use disorder, previously known as alcohol dependence or alcoholism, are at increased risk for STSS. Causes Group A Streptococcus cause STSS. It is very rare for someone with STSS to spread the infection to other people. However, less severe group A strep infection can turn into STSS and these bacteria are contagious. Keep ReadingCauses and How the Bacteria Spread. Prevention There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections. Keep ReadingPreventing Group A Strep Infection. Testing and diagnosis There is no single test used to diagnose STSS. Instead, healthcare providers may collect blood or other samples to test for group A strep infection. They can also order tests to see how well different organs are working.

Healthcare providers diagnose STSS when the patient has all the following:

- A group A strep infection
- Low blood pressure
- Problems with 2 or more organs Organs that can be affected by STSS include:

- Blood
- Kidney
- Liver
- Lung
- Skin
- Soft tissue.

### The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group [^117MRGTn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

Pneumonia was defined by the fulfillment of all three of the following criteria: (1) positive findings for at least one of the assessed clinical symptoms (fever, cough, sputum production, chest pain); (2) the presence of new infiltrates without a cavity or low density areas on chest radiography and/or computed tomography (CT); and (3) positive findings for at least one of the sign(s) of leukocytosis (a white blood cell count (WBC) of ≥ 10,000/μl) and/or increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). A lung abscess was defined when a cavity or low density area within the infiltrates was confirmed on chest radiography and/or CT in addition to the above clinical criteria. Bacterial pleurisy, which is defined as pleural infection due to bacteria, was macroscopically defined by the existence of purulent pleural fluid or inflammatory cells (predominantly neutrophils) in the pleural effusion in addition to (1) and (3) of the above criteria. Pneumonia and lung abscess, with or without pleural effusion, was described as "pneumonia" and "lung abscess", respectively, in spite of the associated pleural effusion, while bacterial pleurisy without pneumonia or lung abscess was described as "bacterial pleurisy only". Complicated parapneumonic effusion was defined by a low glucose level (< 40 mg/dL) and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (> 1000 IU/L), or positive gram staining or culture results. Empyema thoracis was defined by the existence of macroscopically observable purulent pleural fluid. Patients who did not fulfill the above-described diagnostic criteria (pneumonia, lung abscess, and bacterial pleurisy only) were excluded from the study.

### Clinical implications and characterization of group A streptoccoccus infections in adults with cystic fibrosis [^114sceEG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the first to investigate the prevalence of GAS and its clinical effects in the adult CF population. S. pyogenes is a common organism that can affect healthy individuals of any age. While GAS may transiently colonize the upper respiratory tract as a commensal organism (as is the case in 15 to 20% of healthy children), it has also proven itself as a major human pathogen. It is responsible for a broad spectrum of disease including pharyngitis, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, and pneumonia. GAS infections can range from mild to life threatening; severe disease is not limited to those with chronic illness or immune compromise. Globally, GAS is responsible for a significant burden of disease; every year it accounts for 110 million skin and soft tissue infections, 660 000 cases of invasive infection and over 294 000 deaths.

From a pulmonary standpoint, GAS is an infrequent but important cause of pneumonia. While it only accounts for a small percentage of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults, S. pyogenes tends to cause more severe and invasive infection compared to common CAP pathogens. Furthermore, GAS has a higher likelihood of resulting in necrotizing pneumonia, progression to empyema and/or hemorrhagic pleural effusion. Mortality rates for GAS pneumonia range between 20 and 38%, which is similar to that of necrotizing fasciitis.

Although S. pyogenes is a major global pathogen, little is known about its role in CF lung disease. Given the potential for GAS to cause exceptional virulence and the compromised innate immunity of CF lungs, we hypothesized that GAS may lead to adverse clinical outcomes in this population. There is a paucity of GAS epidemiologic data in the CF literature, with prior studies reporting prevalence of 0.8% (2/258) and 0.9% (4/495), respectively. Over 34 years, we identified that five percent of patients isolated GAS on at least one occasion. However, the presence of GAS increased the risk of PEx relative to the preceding clinic visit, particularly if present as the numerically dominant sputum pathogen. This finding may warrant treating individuals with GAS in their sputum with anti-GAS treatments in order to potentially avoid an ensuing PEx. However, other factors including exacerbation of chronically infecting pathogens, and inter-current upper respiratory viral illnesses could also have contributed (although these factors were just as likely in comparator clinical visits).

### Pulmonary cavitation: an under-recognized late complication of severe COVID-19 lung disease [^111STWpt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused over 700,000 recorded deaths worldwide thus far. Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 which can lead to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome. The typical abnormalities seen on computerized tomography (CT) of the chest in patients with COVID-19 lung disease have been well described, with a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 55 studies finding peripheral ground glass opacities in most, consolidation in 44% (95% CI 1–71%), air bronchograms in 43% (95% CI 8–80%), linear opacities in 41% (95% CI 7–65%), crazy-paving pattern in 24% (95% CI 3–92%) and interlobular septal thickening in 23% (95% CI 1–80%) of the CT scans reviewed. Notable is the absence of cavitation. Similarly, another meta-analysis of 15 studies including 2451 patients did not report any cavitation, but commented on the development of traction bronchiectasis, consolidation, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions at late stages of severe disease. Reports from the previous two coronavirus epidemics, SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate similar patterns of radiological abnormalities with the development of bilateral, predominantly lower lobe, subpleural distribution of ground glass opacities and consolidation in both. However, MERS-CoV had more severe inflammatory changes with reports of pleural effusions and only MERS-CoV reports noted the rare presence of pulmonary cavitation.

A small number published single patient case reports have more recently reported pulmonary cavitation, but this is considered a rare event. In contrast, experience at our tertiary care referral hospital differed. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective trial to study the incidence of pulmonary cavitation in patients with COVID-19, and to describe its characteristics and evolution.

### Necrotising pneumonia caused by non-PVLwith 2-year follow-up [^115yNbHY]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Necrotising pneumonia (NP) is a rare but life-threatening complication of pulmonary infection. It is characterised by progressive necrosis of lung parenchyma with cavitating foci evident upon radiological investigation. This article reports the case of a 52-year-old woman, immunocompetent healthcare professional presenting to Accident and Emergency with NP and Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia. The cavitating lesion was not identified on initial chest X-ray leading to a delay in antimicrobial optimisation. However, the patient went on to achieve a full symptomatic recovery in 1month and complete radiological recovery at 2-year follow-up. Long-term prognosis for adult cases of NP currently remains undocumented. This case serves as the first piece of published evidence documenting full physiological and radiological recovery following appropriate treatment of NP in an immunocompetent adult patient.

### A comparison of group A Streptococcus versus Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia [^112idmXk]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

St reptococcus pyogenes is an uncommon cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children. Further, its clinical course in comparison to pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia has not been previously highlighted.

Methods

We reviewed medical records of children 0–18 years of age from April 1983 to April 2005, with discharge diagnoses of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes), or Streptococcus pneumonia (SP) or pneumonia. Data were extracted from the charts, and a comparison of clinical characteristics between the 2 etiologies was performed. Confirmed disease required blood or pleural fluid isolates. Patients with single isolates of GAS in tracheobronchial secretions or sputum were classified as having presumed disease caused by GAS. Patients with confirmed disease due to GAS and SP were compared with respect to clinical characteristics.

Results

Of 103 patients with invasive GAS disease, 12 (11.6%) had confirmed GAS lobar pneumonia. In addition 7 patients had presumed GAS pneumonia. There were 54 patients with confirmed SP pneumonia. Most children who had GAS pneumonia were healthy and recovered completely. Compared with patients with confirmed SP pneumonia, those with confirmed GAS pneumonia had more frequent and larger effusions, more culture positive effusions, had prolonged fever, and had longer hospitalizations. There was not an increasing trend to GAS pneumonia over the 22-year period. There was not a predominant serotype responsible for the pneumonias.

Conclusions

Lobar GAS pneumonia represents approximately 11% of all cases of invasive disease in this institution during a 22-year period. Compared with patients with SP pneumonia, it appears to cause more effusions and morbidity. The organism is also more frequently recovered from pleural fluid.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1172wE8f]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

HIV in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) — CD4 metrics and residual risks define pulmonary infection susceptibility. The CD4 cell count is the most readily quantifiable immune defect in people with HIV (PWH), with the risk for many opportunistic infections increasing sharply once the CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/microliter, and the risk for bacterial pneumonia also increases with a decreasing CD4 cell count. However, even patients on ART with well-controlled HIV disease and a normal CD4 count have significant impairments to the immune system and an increased risk of nonopportunistic bacterial pneumonia by organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, PWH with CD4 counts above 500 cells/microliter have a fivefold increased risk of S. pneumoniae pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease compared with the general population, and they remain at high risk for tuberculosis even with appropriate ART and preserved CD4 cell counts.

### Streptococcus anginosus infections: crossing tissue planes [^112xPnyi]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Streptococcus anginosus has long been recognized to cause invasive pyogenic infections. This holds true for thoracic infections where S. anginosus has a propensity for abscess and empyema formation. Early diagnosis is important given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with thoracic S. anginosus infections. Yet, distinguishing thoracic S. anginosus clinically is difficult. We present three cases of thoracic S. anginosus that demonstrated radiographic extension across tissue planes, including the interlobar fissure, diaphragm, and chest wall. Few infectious etiologies are known to cross tissue planes. Accordingly, we propose S. anginosus be considered among the differential diagnosis of potential infectious etiologies causing radiographic extension across tissue planes.

### The clinical features of respiratory infections caused by the Streptococcus anginosus group [^111jJxTa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We summarized the clinical characteristics of patients with respiratory infections induced by the SAG bacteria, and found that the respiratory infections tended to more frequently occur in males with comorbid diseases and involve pleural effusion with purulent formation. S. intermedius was mainly identified in elderly patients with lung infection complicated with pleural effusion, and aspiration of the oral secretions may be a risk factor in the formation of empyema thoracis associated with pneumonia due to S. intermedius. In addition to investigating culture results, physicians should pay more attention to the clinical background, including symptoms such as pleural effusion.

### The value of early CT in complicated childhood pneumonia [^116WY2ok]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the value of CT in complicated childhood pneumonia and its role in early intervention when chest radiography (CXR) is non-contributory.

Materials and Methods

Forty-two immunocompetent children, aged 1–11 years, admitted for community-acquired pneumonia from October 1997 to September 1999, had 42 contrast-enhanced CT scans and frontal chest radiographs on the same day, which were assessed independently. CT was performed when the patient remained unwell and the CXR images showed failure of resolution despite 7–10 days of antibiotics and/or drainage with urokinase therapy.

Results

Compared to CT, CXR revealed suboptimal accuracy rates of lobar involvement (84%), chest tube placement (73%), fluid loculation (42%), abscess formation (40%) and bronchopleural fistulae (33%). It could not assess parenchymal or pleural complications such as cavitary necrosis, early abscess formation, empyemas or pericardial effusions. On the basis of the CT findings and poor clinical progress, 16 patients underwent surgical intervention with the aid of video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). The CT features correlated well with surgical findings. Ten cases required pleural decortication while six with destructive or necrotic lung lesions had surgical resection. Debridement was difficult when the pleura had become thick and fibrotic. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the offending organism in 81% of cases. The right side was affected in 67% of cases.

Conclusions

In complicated childhood pneumonia, CT is far superior to CXR in revealing pleural and parenchymal complications, which may require early surgical intervention.

### Large septic pulmonary embolus complicating Streptococcus mutans pulmonary valve endocarditis [^116hdjRe]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Large septic pulmonary embolus is a rare finding in right-sided endocarditis. The entity represents a challenging diagnosis due to its variable and nonspecific clinical and radiological presentation and similarities with other conditions. We present a case of a 41 year-old woman who developed a large main pulmonary artery embolus and bilateral cavitary lung nodules in the setting of severe sepsis. Pulmonary artery exploration and clot retrieval ultimately revealed a large septic embolus from Streptococcus mutans native pulmonary valve endocarditis. The diagnosis of septic pulmonary emboli from right-sided endocarditis should be considered in patients with ancillary findings of septic embolic phenomenon, particularly the presence of multifocal cavitary nodules and in the setting of appropriate predisposing factors.

CASE DESCRIPTION

A previously healthy 12-year-old boy presented to his local hospital with 24 hours history of fever and worsening right-sided lower chest pain. His oxygen saturations were 92% on room air, with tachypnoea of 36 breaths per minute at rest. His initial white cell count was 10.7 × 10 9 /L; with neutrophils 9 × 10 9 /L, lymphocytes 0.6 × 10 9 /L, eosinophils 0.38 × 10 9 /L and C-reactive protein (CRP) 68 mg/L. Chest radiograph (CXR) (Fig. 1 A) findings were suggestive of a lung abscess. He was commenced on intravenous ceftriaxone and oral clindamycin to cover likely local pathogens for primary lung abscess (Streptococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group A Streptococcus). By day 5 of admission, the child remained febrile. Additional history included that the child had moved to the United Kingdom from Botswana at 7 years of age. He had lived in a rural area of Botswana and had helped to look after goats at his family's property.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111XY1Ja]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in HIV — risk factors, severity assessment, and outcomes are outlined as follows: Risk factors associated with bacteremia include lack of ART, low CD4 count (particularly < 100 cells/mm3), alcohol use, current smoking, and comorbidities. Disease severity and arterial oxygenation should be assessed in all patients with pneumonia, and noninvasive measurement of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is an appropriate screening test; arterial blood gas analysis is indicated for patients with evidence of hypoxemia suggested by noninvasive assessment and for patients who have tachypnea and/or respiratory distress. In a prospective study of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV, independent predictors of increased mortality were CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3, radiographic progression of disease, and presence of shock, and multilobar or cavitary infiltrates and pleural effusion at baseline independently predicted radiographic progression. In patients on ART with controlled HIV viremia and high CD4 counts (> 350 cells/mm3), the clinical courses and outcomes of pneumonia appear to be similar to those in patients without HIV. Longer term impacts include increased mortality after hospitalization for pneumonia up to one year later, along with associations with impaired lung function and risk of subsequent lung cancer in individuals with HIV.

Table 1b — bacterial tracheobronchitis and bronchial anastomotic infections in lung transplant recipients — defines proven tracheobronchitis by symptoms plus endobronchial lesions without parenchymal disease, radiology that is a negative chest X-ray or one CT scan without new/progressive and persistent infiltrate, consolidation, or cavitation (radiology may be positive if concurrent pneumonia is present), microbiology requiring at least one positive respiratory culture from sputum, bronchial secretions or tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or bronchial protected sterile brushing, and histopathology showing inflammation with organisms or positive culture from sterile tissue alone; proven bronchial anastomotic infection requires the same symptom complex but with endobronchial lesions restricted to the anastomosis without involvement of other parts of the bronchial tree or lung parenchyma, radiology as for proven tracheobronchitis (may be positive if concurrent pneumonia is present), microbiology as for proven tracheobronchitis, and histopathology as for proven tracheobronchitis; probable bronchial anastomotic infection shares the same radiology and microbiology as proven tracheobronchitis but has negative histopathology.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^115EfGbk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on community-acquired pneumonia:

- Definition: CAP is an acute infection of the lungs occurring in an individual who has had little contact with the healthcare system.
- Pathophysiology: Common causes of CAP include bacterial infections (such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus) and respiratory viruses (such as influenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus). No causative organism is identified in over 50% of patients.
- Epidemiology: In the US, the incidence of CAP is estimated at 248 cases per 100,000 person-years. In adults ≥ 65 years of age, the incidence increases to 630–1640 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: The most common complications of CAP include parapneumonic effusion and empyema, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. Influenza and bacterial pneumonia are strongly associated with cardiac events including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and HF. Other pathogen-specific complications include Streptococcus pneumonia-associated HUS, rhabdomyolysis and AKI often seen in Legionella pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumonia-induced rash and mucositis (Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like), and reactive arthritis after Chlamydia pneumonia. CAP can be classified by severity and setting of care. Nonsevere pneumonia typically presents without signs of respiratory failure or sepsis and is managed in the outpatient or general hospital ward setting. Severe pneumonia is characterized by clinical features, such as respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, uremia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, or hypotension requiring fluids. Non-ICU pneumonia refers to hospitalized patients who do not require intensive care, while ICU pneumonia involves patients with acute respiratory failure or septic shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: In patients requiring hospitalization, CAP is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of 11%.

### Histopathology is key to interpreting multiplex molecular test results from postmortem minimally invasive tissue samples [^114x3T8L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Agreement of TAC With Histopathology and Other Test Methods

Etiologic agents (ie, those deemed significant to the observed pathology and to the patient's cause of death) identified for each case and associated contributory, equivocal, and extraneous TAC results are shown in Figure 2. Seven different etiologic agents present on the lung TAC (parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, adenovirus, and Klebsiella spp) were identified 11 times among 10 cases. Streptococcus spp was identified by IHC in 2 cases with negative TAC results for the streptococci on the card (S. pneumoniae and group A and group B streptococci). The antibody utilized in the IHC assay against S. pneumoniae is known to cross-react with other streptococci not tested by the TAC. Therefore, these cases likely had nonpneumococcal, non–group A, non–group B streptococcal infection. Two additional agents not present on the TAC (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and Enterococcus) were identified by other test methods in nonpulmonary specimens from 2 cases.

### An unusual course of disease in two patients with COVID-19: pulmonary cavitation [^113wYgDB]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Two 59-year-old male patients with COVID-19 pneumonia developed pulmonary cavitation with air-fluid level, accompanied by right-sided chest pain several weeks after first onset of symptoms. Considering a possible bacterial abscess formation, both patients were started on antibiotics. No microbiological pathogen was detected in further investigations (sputum analysis, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and CT-guided drainage of the cavitation). Histopathological analysis of the drained fluid was non-specific, and the aetiology remained not fully understood. We report pulmonary cavitation as a rare finding in late stage COVID-19 pneumonia. As both our patients presented with localised chest pain prior to detection of the lesions, new onset of this symptom should warrant further investigation.

### Atypical pneumonia – time to breathe new life into a useful term? [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens, or to a distinct clinical syndrome the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation, epidemiology, or both.

### On the nature of pleural involvement in necrotizing pneumonia: a report of two cases of life threatening late complications [^115eWN4k]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Suppurative complications of pneumonia such as empyema, lung abscess, pyopneumothorax, and necrotizing pneumonia (NP) are uncommon in children. Over the last decade an increasing incidence of NP has been reported. Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the predominant causative organism of NP, and while sporadic cases were reported prior to routine administration of heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine, a marked increase in NP appears to relate to replacement pneumococcal strains. Pleural involvement is almost universal in NP, and the course of pleural disease often determines its duration and outcome, particularly as it relates to complication of bronchopleural fistula. Cavities are formed in NP within the lung parenchyma and in the pleural space as the fibrosing pleural process organizes. The similarity of the radiologic appearance of parenchymal and pleural space cavities often makes the differentiation of pneumatocele versus residua of loculated pneumothorax challenging. The prevailing perception from most reports on childhood NP is of a favorable outcome with conservative approach. We report two pediatric cases with pneumonia who presented with prolonged fever despite antibiotic treatment, eventually diagnosed with NP. After stabilization on prolonged IV antibiotics, and weeks after discharge, they presented with unexpected acute respiratory failure due to a life-threatening tension air collection. In this article we discuss the nature of NP, its typical presentation, benign course and outcome, albeit its potential to cause serious late complications in the light of our recent experiences. Increasing awareness of such complications will result in more careful follow-up and in providing appropriate recommendations to parents of patients recovering from NP.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bacterial CAP in HIV — presentation, examination, and hospitalization threshold — are generally similar to those in individuals without HIV, with acute symptom onset over 3–5 days typical for S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus infections. Indicators of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, and/or hypotension, and tachypnea with decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicates moderate-to-severe pneumonia for which clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Bacterial pneumonia commonly shows focal consolidation signs on exam, whereas Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) often has a normal lung exam or inspiratory crackles if abnormal; white blood cell count is usually elevated (often relative to baseline in advanced HIV) with possible neutrophilia or left shift. On chest radiograph, bacterial pneumonia characteristically produces unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; consolidation is typical with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus, whereas cavitation may suggest P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

### Pulmonary cavitation: an under-recognized late complication of severe COVID-19 lung disease [^1114H8eu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The development of pulmonary cavitation in patients with severe COVID-19 lung disease treated in our institution's ICU was not a rare event (11%, n = 12/110). This subgroup of patients had very severe infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required a prolonged ICU stay. Median (range) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 23 (range 16–24) on admission, and all patients were leucopenic. Seven of 12 required renal replacement therapy, four developed venous thromboembolism, three required ECMO with all surviving to successful decannulation, and two had thromboembolic cerebrovascular events.

By definition, a cavity is an air-filled space forming within an area of pulmonary consolidation, mass or nodule, as a result of liquefication of the necrotic portion of the lesion and the discharge of this necrotic material via the bronchial tree. This exact process occurred in our patients as cavities formed in areas of the lung where ground glass opacities were seen in early stages, morphing into more dense consolidation, later developing necrosis and ultimately cavitating. This is demonstrated for patients 8 and 9 in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. It is uncommon for viral pneumonias, including those due to the other human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, to cause pulmonary cavitation even in severe and advanced viral infection. We are unable to speculate as to whether bacterial infection and/or invasive fungal coinfection may have contributed to the development of the cavities, or if the infections were opportunistic. Four of twelve patients who had developed pulmonary cavitation (including two of the survivors) had no microbiological, serological, clinical or distinct radiological characteristics of invasive fungal infection and did not receive treatment for this. However, these four patients did have infection with bacterial organisms known to cause cavitation. Infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is also a common cause of lung cavitation and in a recently published case series, it has been described as a coinfection in COVID-19 patients resulting in cavity formation. However, in all 12 of our patients, MTB infection was ruled out based on negative Acid-Fast Bacilli on smear and culture of multiple respiratory specimens.

### Infectious pulmonary diseases [^111Pf2wG]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by the inability to clear pathogens from the lower airway and alveoli. Cytokines and local inflammatory markers are released, causing further damage to the lungs through the accumulation of white blood cells and fluid congestion, leading to pus in the parenchyma. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines pneumonia as the presence of new lung infiltrate with other clinical evidence supporting infection, including new fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation. Importantly, lower respiratory infections remain the most deadly communicable disease. Pneumonia is subdivided into three categories: (1) community acquired, (2) hospital acquired, and (3) ventilator associated. Therapy for each differs based on the severity of the disease and the presence of risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Figure 1
Monthly incidence of pulmonary invasive group A Streptococcus infections in adults > 18 years of age, National Health Service Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, central Scotland, UK, December 2017–February 2023.

We observed no significant difference in the median age between the 2022–23 cohort and historical records (45 [interquartile range (IQR) 26] years) vs. 57 [IQR 23.5] years). Both groups were healthy at baseline, having a median Charlson comorbidity index score of 0. We noted no significant difference in chronic respiratory underlying conditions. The 2022–23 cohort was associated with a more deprived SIMD postcode (median SIMD score of 3 vs. 5 for historical records). Other demographic, biochemical, and hematologic characteristics were comparable (Table). The PiGAS syndrome exhibits substantial leukopenia (median 0.53 [IQR 0.3–1] × 10 9 cells/L) with a normal median white cell count (9.5 [IQR 4–18.7] × 10 9 cells/L). Although respiratory symptoms predominated, diarrhea was reported in 18.4% (7/38) of cases in the 2022–23 outbreak. Microbiologically confirmed empyema was common, and a greater number of 2022–23 patients received an intercostal drain and exhibited radiologic evidence of empyema or pleural effusion (Table). Those characteristics, along with multifocal consolidation, were the radiologic hallmarks of PiGAS; cavitation also was common. A lower proportion of patients in the historical cohort had chest computed tomography results, precluding greater sensitivity (47% vs. 76%).

### Snoring-generated fluid droplets as a potential mechanistic link between sleep-disordered breathing and pneumonia [^1153YXP8]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The soft palate and back of the throat represent vulnerable early infection sites for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, streptococci, and many other pathogens. We demonstrate that snoring causes aerosolization of pharyngeal fluid that covers these surfaces, which previously has escaped detection because the inspired airstream carries the micron-sized droplets into the lung, inaccessible to traditional aerosol detectors. While many of these droplets will settle in the lower respiratory tract, a fraction of the respirable smallest droplets remains airborne and can be detected in exhaled breath. We distinguished these exhaled droplets from those generated by the underlying breathing activity by using a chemical tracer, thereby proving their existence. The direct transfer of pharyngeal fluids and their pathogens into the deep lung by snoring represents a plausible mechanistic link between the previously recognized association between sleep-disordered breathing and pneumonia incidence.

### Interventional radiology treatment of empyema and lung abscesses [^1177hJ2N]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumonias in children can be complicated by pleural effusions, empyema and abscesses. The incidence of these complications is increasing, correlated to an increased virulence of the pneumococcal bacterium. These complications may prolong morbidity and lead to decreased pulmonary function. Traditionally, patients were treated medically with antibiotics, and refractory complications were treated surgically with large bore chest tube placement and thoracotomy. Improvements included instilling fibrinolytics into the chest tubes and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which expedited recovery and improved outcomes. Image guided techniques from interventional radiology have been developed as an alternative to treat these patients with minimal invasiveness. These therapies have achieved high success and low complication rates, and are the preferred first-line procedures when available.

### Evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule: size matters, but do not ignore the power of morphology [^116LrYEp]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Cavitation

A cavity is defined as a gas-filled space, seen as lucency or low-attenuation area within pulmonary consolidation, mass or nodule. Cavitation can occur in both benign and malignant nodules. In benign nodules, cavitation is mainly associated with abscesses (bacterial) pulmonary tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, aspergilloma (Fig. 18), and other fungal infections, Wegener granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis. Even in infectious causes, there are often no clinical symptoms of infection, raising difficulties for diagnosis. Cavitation in malignant SPNs is caused by necrosis of the central portion and is mainly seen in squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 19) and metastasis. Wall thickness, irregularity, and cavity morphology have been regarded as partially useful for differentiating benignity from malignancy, with great overlap of features. A thicker irregular wall and irregular inner contour are both observed in malignant nodules and in benign diseases. Associated ground glass, consolidation, bronchial wall thickening, and the presence of satellite nodules are indicative of a benign nature of the cavitary nodule. Since infectious (bacterial) or inflammatory cavitation often present with rapid changes, short-term follow-up with chest radiographs can be the key to diagnosis. Rapid progression in these cases excludes a malignant cause. Correlation with clinical setting and often histology is mandatory in cavitated nodules since imaging can barely differentiate between benign and malignant.

Fig. 18
Chest radiograph in a 59-year-old woman with a previous history of heart transplantation showed a nodule in the right upper lobe. This was confirmed on chest CT scan with axial images in lung window setting showing a 2.4 cm nodule with central cavitation. Since efforts to prove an infectious cause remained unsuccessful and the lesion persisted, wedge excision was performed. Histopathologic examination could not reveal any malignancy, but showed findings consistent with an aspergilloma

Fig. 19
Chest CT in a 57-year-old man who presented with chronic cough. Axial CT-image in lung window setting shows a 12 mm well-defined round nodule in the left lower lobe. The nodule shows a central area of cavitation. Since there were clinically no arguments for an infectious cause, video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination showed a small squamous cell carcinoma

### Invasive group A streptococcal disease in pregnant women and young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1152pNSC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) can colonise the skin and mucosal surfaces, especially the upper respiratory tract and the rectovaginal tract.GAS causes a range of infections, from superficial skin infections and pharyngitis to more severe skin and soft tissue infections (eg, cellulitis) and invasive GAS (eg, pneumonia, sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and necrotising fasciitis). Although most non-invasive GAS infections are mild, they can result in severe immune sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Non-invasive infections can also lead to invasive GAS disease. Long-term sequelae resulting years after GAS infection include rheumatic heart disease and end-stage renal failure. Rheumatic heart disease ranks among the leading causes of non-communicable diseases in LMICs, where almost all cases of rheumatic heart disease and deaths occur. Rheumatic heart disease accounts for 250 000 premature deaths annually and the greatest cardiovascular-related loss of disability-adjusted life-years among adolescents (aged 10–14 years) worldwide. Altogether, GAS infections and sequelae have been estimated to cause about 500 000 deaths among all ages annually, with the greatest burden of deaths among young adults in LMICs and the incidence of infection increasing.

### Role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia in children [^116Rxsqh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included children admitted to the Pediatric Pulmonology Unit, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt, between September 2022 and August 2023 with a diagnosis of CAP. This study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University (approval number 35,694/9/22). Written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all patients.

All children aged between two months and 18 years who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CAP were included in this study. CAP was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child who acquired an infection outside the hospital and radiological findings of lung consolidation. Children were diagnosed with parapneumonic effusion based on clinical examination and radiographic findings, whereas NP was diagnosed clinically based on the presence of progressive pneumonia in previously healthy children despite appropriate antibiotic therapy with a protracted course plus CT chest scans that revealed multiple necrotic foci in the consolidated area.

Children with the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) Other causes of lung cavitation in radiological findings, such as solitary lung cavitation with defined rim of enhancement (lung abscess), congenital lung abnormalities, septic pulmonary embolism, or traumatic pseudocyst. (2) Chronic lung disorders, malignancy, underlying immunodeficiency, or neuromuscular illnesses. (3) Hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 included patients with NP, Group 2 included patients with parapneumonic effusion (PPE), and Group 3 included patients with non-complicated pneumonia (CAP).

Demographic information was collected, including sex, age, characteristics of the initial clinical manifestations, length of hospitalization, duration of fever, occurrence of complications, and requirement for surgical intervention.

The duration of fever, the length of hospitalization, improvement in inflammatory markers, and the continuation of the same empirical antibiotics were objective measures to assess the recovery and the effectiveness of utilized antibiotics.

### Management of invasive group A streptococcal infections [^112NXKoo]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in children includes deep soft tissue infection, bacteraemia, bacteraemic pneumonia, meningitis and osteomyelitis. The expression of toxins and super antigens by GAS can complicate infection by triggering an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response, referred to as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The onset and progression of GAS disease can be rapid, and the associated mortality high. Prompt antibiotics therapy and early surgical debridement of infected tissue are essential. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and hyperbaric therapy may improve outcomes in severe disease. Nosocomial outbreaks and secondary cases in close personal contacts are not uncommon; infection control measures and consideration of prophylactic antibiotics to those at high risk are important aspects of disease control. To reduce a substantial part of the global burden of GAS disease, an affordable GAS vaccine with efficacy against a broad number of strains is needed.

Pneumonia and complicated pneumonia

Pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. Pathogens include bacterial, viral, or fungal microorganisms. A presumptive diagnosis of the pathogens can be made based on the child's age and whether it was a community or nosocomial pneumonia (Table 3). Clinical symptoms include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, while neonates may present with symptoms resembling other conditions like TTN, RDS, or MAS. In community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), imaging is not required for the diagnosis, unless there is no response to outpatient treatment, which requires hospital admission due to suspected complications.

Table 3
Association between age and pathogen causing pneumonia in children

* Higher incidence of necrosis and empyema

Radiography helps in detecting nosocomial pneumonia and identifying radiological patterns. Typical CR and CT findings of lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia are shown in detail in Table 4. However, these patterns lack sensitivity and specificity for determining aetiology. A unique type of pneumonia seen only in children is round pneumonia, which presents as a round opacity on CR, typically in contact with the pleura, hilum, or pulmonary fissure. This form of pneumonia is most commonly caused by bacteria, with Streptococcus pneumoniae responsible for about 90% of cases. Round pneumonia predominantly affects children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, as the incomplete development of collateral ventilation predisposes this age group to the condition (Fig. 8).

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^116THwGZ]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, or 'Strep A') can cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Superficial infections of the upper respiratory tract and skin can lead to pharyngitis and impetigo, respectively, as well as blood stream and other sterile site infections, manifesting as necrotising fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, maternal sepsis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. Strep A infection can also cause the immune-mediated sequelae of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), which in turn can lead to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively.

Collectively, Strep A infections and complications cause over half a million deaths globally each year, making it — before the emergence of SarS-COVID-2 — the fifth most lethal pathogen on the planet behind HIV, Mycobacterium, tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The morbidity and mortality from Strep A infection is inequitably concentrated in resource-limited settings, though the burden of sepsis and superficial infections is also significant in high-resource settings. For example, sore throat is the third most common diagnosis with an antibiotic prescription in the U.S. and the most common reason for antibiotic self-medication in Europe.

### Pulmonary cavitation: an under-recognized late complication of severe COVID-19 lung disease [^115CubUR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary radiological findings of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been well documented and range from scattered ground-glass infiltrates in milder cases to confluent ground-glass change, dense consolidation, and crazy paving in the critically ill. However, lung cavitation has not been commonly described in these patients. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of pulmonary cavitation in patients with COVID-19 and describe its characteristics and evolution.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 and reviewed electronic medical records and imaging to identify patients who developed pulmonary cavitation.

Results

Twelve out of 689 (1.7%) patients admitted to our institution with COVID-19 developed pulmonary cavitation, comprising 3.3% (n = 12/359) of patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia, and 11% (n = 12/110) of those admitted to the intensive care unit. We describe the imaging characteristics of the cavitation and present the clinical, pharmacological, laboratory, and microbiological parameters for these patients. In this cohort six patients have died, and six discharged home.

Conclusion

Cavitary lung disease in patients with severe COVID-19 disease is not uncommon, and is associated with a high level of morbidity and mortality.

### Streptococcus intermedius: unusual presentation and complication of lung abscess [^115Ayt5G]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of a 54-year-old immunocompetent male who had lung abscess secondary to Streptococcus intermedius that led to discitis by contiguous spread of infection. He initially presented with constant chest pain for 6 weeks that radiated to lower back, with no fever, chills or weight loss. He denied smoking cigarettes, alcohol use or any illicit drug. On investigation, a mass was identified on the posterior medial aspect of the right lower lobe with direct infiltration into right side of the T5-T6 vertebral bodies. Histopathology identified organising pneumonia with abscess. Tissue cultures showed S. intermedius, and were negative for other microorganisms. This case highlights a rare presentation of S intermedius discitis by contiguous spread of infection from posterior right lower lobe lung abscess. S intermedius usually occurs in older patients with pulmonary infections complicated with pleural effusion or lung abscess, but can present in young patients with no clear symptoms of lung infection, like our patient.

### Treatment… [^114LYyLq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Cause STSS is a disease defined as an infection with Streptococcus pyogenes accompanied by sudden onset of shock and organ failure. S. pyogenes are also called group A Streptococcus. When the bacteria produce exotoxins and virulence factors in the deep tissues and bloodstream, it can induce a cytokine cascade. Massive cytokine cascades contribute to the development of shock or organ failure. Strains that produce certain virulence factors and exotoxins, particularly streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, are more likely to cause severe infections, including STSS. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread Incubation period The incubation period for STSS varies depending on site of entry. Once initial symptoms occur, hypotension generally develops within 24 to 48 hours.

Clinical features Initial symptoms STSS often begins with influenza-like symptoms, including:

- Chills
- Fever
- Myalgia
- Nausea
- Vomiting Disease progression These symptoms often quickly progress to sepsis with
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Signs and symptoms suggestive of specific organ failure Any of the following organ systems may fail:

- Blood
- Kidney
- Liver
- Lung. Treatment Hospitalization STSS requires hospitalization. Standard treatment of shock and organ failure, such as fluid resuscitation, is imperative as the first step in treatment. Surgery Removal of the source of infection, if possible, is important in the management of STSS. Surgical debridement of deep tissue infection may be necessary. Other treatment options Use of intravenous immunoglobulin can be considered for severely ill patients early in the clinical course although efficacy hasn't been proven.

Complications Known complications of shock and organ failure can occur:

- Tissue necrosis
- Loss of extremities Mortality rates Despite aggressive treatment, the mortality rate for STSS can exceed 30%. Mortality from STSS increases with age and is substantially lower in children than adults. Clin Infect Dis. 2002; 35: 950–9. Erratum in: Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36: 243.

Contrast-enhanced chest CT-scan evaluates lung parenchymal changes that are not visible on CXR and detects underlying congenital lung malformations; therefore, this modality is superior to CXR in the diagnosis of NP. The diagnostic highlights are weak or absent vascularity, loss of pulmonary architecture, and cavity formation. Multiple small gas or fluid-filled, thin-walled cavities are usually seen involving only a single lobe. As the lung continued to liquefy, the multiple small cavities may coalesce and form larger cavities, including gas-filled pneumatoceles, which develop in the later stages of NP.

A number of disorders will cause pulmonary cavities, but infection-induced lung cavities and infected congenital lung defects along with traumatic pseudocysts should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with NP. Differentiating NP from lung abscess is clinically important since the underlying causes and management can differ. A simple lung abscess has an inactive course of fever and cough that can last for weeks. Investigational delay may lead to complications, which are represented by multiple thin-walled cavities in the NP that may fuse to form one or more contrast-enhancing, thick-walled abscesses containing gaseous fluid levels within the pulmonary consolidated regions.

### Complicated pneumonia in children [^117SKJm8]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Complicated community-acquired pneumonia in a previously well child is a severe illness characterised by combinations of local complications (eg, parapneumonic effusion, empyema, necrotising pneumonia, and lung abscess) and systemic complications (eg, bacteraemia, metastatic infection, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and, rarely, death). Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48–72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome.

### Increase in fitness of Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with the severity of necrotizing pneumonia [^116GUAhn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of necrotizing pneumococcal pneumonia has increased during the past 2 decades. We hypothesized that increased pneumococcal load or augmented inflammatory cytokine production might lead to destructive pneumococcal lung disease.

Methods

This study enrolled prospectively 0- to 18-year-old children with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia with pleural effusion admitted to 6 medical centers from March 2010 to April 2012. Children were diagnosed with pneumococcal empyema if the pleural fluid tested positive for quantitative pneumococcal (lytA) detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pneumococcal empyema cases were further divided into 4 groups according to necrosis severity: (0) nonnecrosis, (1) mild necrosis, (2) cavitation and (3) bronchopleural fistula. Nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load, as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8), Th1-(IL-2, IFN-γ), Th2-(IL-4, IL-10) and Th17-cytokines (IL-17), in the pleural fluid was measured.

Results

Serotypes 19A and 3 accounted for 69.4% and 12.5%, respectively, of 72 cases of pneumococcal empyema. Pleural pneumococcal load was significantly higher in serotypes 19A and 3 infection than in the other strains causing infection (P = 0.006). There was a correlation between nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load (ρ = 0.35; P = 0.05). In multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, pleural pneumococcal load (adjusted odds ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.03–3.06) and IL-8 (adjusted odds ratio: 2.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.21–5.75) were independent factors associated with the severity of lung necrosis.

Conclusions

Evolution of Streptococcus pneumoniae toward increased fitness in their interaction with host and exaggerated IL-8 expression may be responsible for the increase of necrotizing pneumococcal pneumonia.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis in adults [^117DJAYZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis is an uncommon infection. The classic clinical picture is that of concomitant pulmonary and/or meningeal and joint infections in the presence of predisposing local and systemic factors. Initial laboratory tests are usually inconclusive, and joint aspiration is required for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy (usually with penicillin) combined with closed or open joint drainage. Increasing reports of infections involving penicillin-resistant strains are a concern. The prognosis is usually favourable, but early recognition and aggressive management are essential to reduce the likelihood of significant joint injury.

Streptococcus pneumoniae experimental pneumonia models — In mouse models, S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia depends on bacterial strain and host factors, with adult mice typically requiring 10^6–10^8 colony-forming units (CFU) to cause pneumonia, whereas approximately 10 CFU is sufficient to cause severe disease in neonatal animals; commonly used mouse strains include C57BL/6 and BALB/c, with CBA/N also used due to high susceptibility attributable to inability to produce antibodies against pneumococcal polysaccharides.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — diagnostic basis and etiologies state that "The diagnosis of CAP is based on the presence of specific symptoms and suggestive radiographic features, such as pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion", and "Carefully obtained microbiological data can support the diagnosis but often fails to provide an etiologic agent". A systematic review found that "S. pneumoniae is still the most common bacterial cause of CAP followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacterales", and the "atypical" bacterial pathogens M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila "account for 3%–11% of cases".

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^111HASnG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The incidence of pneumonia that occurred within the first 30 days following surgery was evaluated as the primary outcome, as recommended as a follow-up period for the occurrence of adverse events in perioperative medicine. The secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate and postoperative LOS. Atelectasis was defined as lung opacification with a shift of the mediastinum, hilum, or hemidiaphragm toward the affected area, and compensatory overinflation in the adjacent non-atelectatic lung on CXR obtained within the first 7 postoperative days. Radiological diagnoses were reported by the attending radiologists independent of the study. Preoperative CXR is a routine evaluation in every department while postoperative CXR is routinely obtained in a few departments or as required when a patient have fever, or develops respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough and sputum, or decrease of oxygen saturation in our hospital.

Postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed by respiratory physicians as consulted by the clinicians in charge of the patients based on the US Centers for Disease Control definition of pneumonia with two or more serial CXR showing at least one of the following findings: (i) new or progressive and persistent infiltrates, (ii) consolidation, and (iii) cavitation (one radiograph is sufficient for patients with no underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease). They also should have at least one of the following signs: (i) fever (> 38℃) with no other recognized cause; (ii) leukopenia (white cell count < 4 × 10 9 /L) or leukocytosis (white cell count > 12 × 10 9 /L), (iii) altered mental status with no other recognized cause for adults > 70 years old; and at least two of the following: (i) new onset of purulent sputum or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions, or increased suctioning requirements, (ii) new onset or worsening cough, dyspnea, or tachypnea, (iii) rales or bronchial breath sounds, and (iv) worsening gas exchange (hypoxemia, increased oxygen requirement, increased ventilator demand).

Pulmonary infections

Bacterial pneumonia

Lung infections are common in clinical practice and bacterial pneumonia is one of the most frequent causes. It is classified as community acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia (NP) based on clinical scenario.

CAP is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative (Enterobacteriae or E. coli) often cause NP, while aspiration pneumonia is due to microorganisms found in oropharynx such as Gram-negative cocci.

Clinical manifestations are fever, chills, cough, and sometimes chest pain; symptoms can be milder or absent in immunocompromised patients.

When pneumonia is suspected, diagnosis is confirmed by imaging evaluation, with chest X-ray (CXR) being the most used tool. CT is more sensitive but usually performed in unclear cases or when complications are suspected.

Imaging findings are variable: in CAP, CT images classically show airspace consolidation and can also evidence GGO, centrilobular nodules and bronchial walls thickening, with or without pleural effusion. Rarer presentations are round and multi-lobar pneumonia. The first, mainly seen in children, is typically characterized by a focal, round-shaped consolidation at imaging. Round pneumonia should be suspected in case of a rapid growing pulmonary nodule/mass, which disappears after antibiotic therapy.

Multi-lobar or bilateral pneumonia are non-focal patterns of CAP, with greater extent, often seen in patient with an underlying lung disease causing parenchymal distortion.

Aspiration pneumonia is secondary to inhalation of oropharyngeal or gastric secretions into the lower respiratory tract. Imaging generally shows bilateral and peri-hilar air-space consolidations, involving lower lobes, especially in the right lung.

NP is a complication of hospitalized patients defined as a pneumonia occurring 48 h after the admission or 48 h after hospital discharge. Imaging findings are bilateral, diffuse, or multiple foci of consolidation involving more than one lobe, frequently associated with pleural effusion.

Complications may occur in any pneumonia but are more frequent in CAP and NP, especially in immunocompromised patients, and are usually detected by CT. Lung cavitation suggests bacterial etiology, with S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria being the most frequent agents in immunocompetent patients, and Aspergillus in immunocompromised ones. Pleural effusions are frequent during uncomplicated CAP and are reactive in nature, resolving after antibiotic therapy, 5–10% of these might complicate and progress to empyema.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^112wUkSB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics and Clinical Findings on Admission

We identified a total of 78 patients hospitalized for invasive GAS, of which 63 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1.
Flowchart of patient selection.

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Denominators vary because the available information was not complete for all patients. Six (10%) of 62 had an underlying disease but none was immunosuppressed. The most common clinical feature of invasive GAS disease was fever (95%), with a median duration of 4 days and a range of 0 to more than 10 days before admission. Signs and symptoms suggestive of local GAS infections, such as sore throat or typical rash for scarlet fever, were less common than unspecific signs and symptoms (Table 1).

TABLE 1.
Characteristics and Clinical Presentation on Hospital Admission

Seven (16%) of 43 patients with iGAS disease had a known contact with GAS, usually in a family member, but none had contact with a case of iGAS disease.

Clinical and Microbiologic Diagnosis

The predominant presentations of invasive GAS disease were bloodstream infections, pneumonia (mostly with pleura empyema; 12/14 cases) and mastoiditis (Table 1). About 21 (33%) of 63 patients had more than 1 invasive GAS disease manifestation.

Invasive GAS disease was confirmed by the isolation of GAS from the following specimens of sterile body sites: surgical soft tissue samples, that is, abscesses (n = 25); positive cultures of blood (n = 18); pleural fluid (n = 12); bone samples (n = 6); joint fluid (n = 5); muscle tissue (n = 4); and cerebrospinal fluid (n = 1). In 10 patients GAS was isolated from 2 body sites.

In 3 patients with the clinical presentation of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, GAS was only isolated from a nonsterile site, that is, the pharynx (n = 3).

### Can we prevent the spread of focal lung inflammation? [^115qbhxn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

By definition, the acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with diffuse cellular infiltration and proteinaceous edema. It is generally believed that the widespread injury that characterizes acute respiratory distress syndrome is a process that is launched almost synchronously throughout the lung, caused by blood-borne mediators of inflammation, voluminous aspiration, or inhalation of noxious gases or infective inoculums. Relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that inflammatory lung injury may sometimes begin focally and propagate sequentially via the airway network, generalizing as mobile liquids carry their damaging products mouthward from distal to proximal. Were this true, modifications of ventilatory pattern and positioning aimed at geographic containment of the injury process could help prevent generalization and limit disease severity. This seldom-considered mechanism for extending lung injury might further justify implementation of low tidal volume/high positive end-expiratory pressure ventilatory strategies, as well as encourage additional lung protective measures that logically stem from simple mechanics.

### Rapidly fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia and group A Streptococcus serotype M1 [^114EjqqN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A total of 1.3%–23.8% invasive GAS infections involve pneumonia, but these infections are more common in developing countries. Successful management depends on early diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment. However, despite early aggressive supportive care and empirical antimicrobial drug therapy, which was later confirmed to be appropriate by antibiogram results, all 3 patients we describe died within 8–12 h of symptom onset from massive pulmonary bleeding and acute respiratory failure. Initial presentations were fairly nonspecific, and diagnoses were made postmortem. The roles of GAS in the rapid progression of disease were highlighted by the abundance of GAS found the lungs, extensive and severe pulmonary damage, and virulence factor profiles of the isolates, all of which included sda1, smeZ, speA, speB, speG, speJ, and emm-1 genes.

Invasive bacterial disease requires virulence factors that facilitate interactions of the microbe with host tissues and subvert defenses of the immune system. In the emm1 GAS clone, progression to systemic infection is also favored by mutations in the 2-component control of virulence regulatory system, which enhances resistance to subepithelial immune defenses and facilitates deep-tissue penetration. These mutations markedly alter transcription profiles of invasive GAS isolates than those of pharyngeal mucosal isolates (–,), strongly upregulating sda1 transcription and markedly downregulating expression of the gene encoding cysteine protease SpeB. The sda1 gene facilitates avoidance of neutrophil extracellular traps by the pathogen and serves as a selective force for a control of virulence regulatory system mutation. SpeB protease enables accumulation and activation of broad-spectrum host protease plasmin on the microbial cell surface, thereby promoting infection spread to normally sterile sites. Invasive GAS strains also produce increased levels of toxins, including some that destroy immune cells, and superantigens (e.g. SpeA, SpeJ) that dysregulate the immune response of the host.

Host factors also affect clinical presentation and disease progression, which explains why diseases of different severity can be caused by genetically indistinguishable emm1 strains with no evidence of regulatory gene mutation. Elucidation of these host and bacterial factors involved in the pathogenesis of these rare but life-threatening infections may be useful for improving disease prognosis.

### Changing bacteriology of adult community-acquired lung abscess in Taiwan: Klebsiella pneumoniae versus anaerobes [^111h8Uq7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most literature regarding lung abscess focuses on anaerobic bacterial lung abscess, and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infection is less frequently discussed. This study was conducted to investigate the bacteriology of community-acquired lung abscess and to improve the empirical therapeutic strategy for adults with community-acquired lung abscess.

Methods

We reviewed and analyzed data on 90 consecutive adult cases of bacteriologically confirmed community-acquired lung abscess treated during 1995–2003 at a tertiary university hospital in Taiwan.

Results

We found that a high proportion (21%) of cases of lung abscess were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, which differs from the findings of previous studies. Lung abscess due to K. pneumoniae was associated with underlying diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–18.4; p = 0.039) and negatively correlated with a time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of > 30 days (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.7; p = 0.008). A higher percentage of patients with K. pneumoniae lung abscess had concomitant bacteremia (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.1–81.9; p = 0.032), delayed defervesence (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.8–47.8; p = 0.004), and multiple cavities noted on radiographs (OR, 11.0; 95% CI, 1.3–94.9; p = 0.015), compared with patients with anaerobic bacterial lung abscess. The rate of nonsusceptibility to clindamycin and penicillin among anaerobes and Streptococcus milleri group isolates increased.

Conclusion

K. pneumoniae has become a more common cause of lung abscess than before, and a high proportion of anaerobes and S. milleri strains have become resistant to penicillin and clindamycin. A beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or second- or third-generation cephalosporin with clindamycin or metronidazole is suggested as empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired lung abscess.
