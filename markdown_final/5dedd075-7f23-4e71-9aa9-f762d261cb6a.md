## Question

Risks of receiving contrast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of receiving contrast media and how to stratify, prevent, and manage those risks across iodinated and gadolinium agents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the two main classes of contrast and their distinct toxicities. Then, I should verify eGFR-based risk stratification for iodinated contrast and clarify intra-arterial vs intravenous risk. Next, I will check modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and the dose/route/osmolarity issues. After that, I need to review prevention strategies: hydration, drug management, contrast selection, dosing, and alternatives. I will then examine GBCA‑specific risks, including NSF prevention and agent choice. Finally, I should reconcile guideline concordance versus controversies, articulate decision algorithms for elective and emergency settings, and close with special populations and practical pearls, ensuring I cross-check key statements against KDIGO, CAR, ESUR, and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental distinction: iodinated contrast media (ICM) for CT/angiography are primarily linked to contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI, historically CIN), driven by tubular toxicity and medullary ischemia, whereas gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) for MRI raise concern for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in advanced kidney dysfunction; I should note that nephrotoxicity with GBCA is far less clearly established than with ICM, but vigilance remains prudent in CKD, especially at low eGFR thresholds [^1179pLeB] [^113Jf1Ck] [^113wL23k] [^115BdS1n].

> I need to ensure the ICM risk tiers are framed correctly by kidney function and route of administration: for IV ICM, risk is negligible when eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², intermediate at 30–44, and highest at < 30 or with AKI; risk increases further with diabetes and when intra-arterial contrast is delivered with first-pass renal exposure, so I should flag coronary and suprarenal aortic injections as higher risk scenarios compared with IV administration or second-pass IA routes [^113uL1Hy] [^111qgj3U].

> Wait, let me verify dose effects and cumulative exposure before moving on: CA-AKI risk rises with higher total iodine dose and with closely spaced repeat exposures, so using the lowest effective dose and avoiding elective repeats within 48 hours in high-risk patients are sensible guardrails, while recognizing that the absolute IV risk in modern practice appears lower than traditionally estimated [^113Jf1Ck] [^1151HRr9] [^111MYCZR].

> Next, I should review risk factors to avoid missing modifiable contributors: nonmodifiable risks include CKD, advanced age, diabetes, and heart failure; modifiable risks include intravascular volume depletion, concurrent nephrotoxins (for example NSAIDs, aminoglycosides), hemodynamic instability, and short-interval repeat dosing; procedure factors matter too — IA first-pass exposure carries more risk than IV, high-osmolar agents more than low- or iso-osmolar, and higher contrast volumes increase risk [^116wjX2k] [^113Jf1Ck] [^111qgj3U] [^112HpheK].

> Hold on, I should confirm the risk assessment workflow for elective vs emergency imaging so we don't delay care unnecessarily: for stable elective patients, use a simple screening tool and obtain eGFR within about 3 months if risk is flagged, or within 3–7 days if acute illness is present; in emergencies such as stroke, PE, or acute aortic syndrome, do not delay indicated contrast-enhanced imaging to obtain eGFR, as the diagnostic benefit outweighs the small absolute IV risk in most cases [^113ZhsWp] [^115z6Pwf] [^116nGuk6] [^115nocZ3].

> Let me consider contrast selection now, but I should double-check a common misconception: guidelines consistently favor using low- or iso-osmolar ICM over high-osmolar agents in patients at risk, yet contemporary evidence does not support routinely preferring iso-osmolar over low-osmolar solely to reduce AKI risk, so cost, availability, and image performance should guide selection among low- and iso-osmolar options [^1145WDuZ] [^112HpheK] [^114QxYM6] [^116eEpCP].

> I need to check dosing and image quality trade-offs, because under-dosing can compromise care: use the lowest diagnostic dose, consider dose-to-GFR concepts for IA procedures, but avoid empiric dose reductions for IV CT that degrade enhancement and may prompt repeat scans; in higher-risk patients, strategic minimization is valuable, but diagnostic efficacy remains paramount [^116UQZYx] [^115smFd6] [^116ytynq] [^113HwvM1].

> Let me verify hydration recommendations carefully, as guidance varies by risk and route: in high-risk patients, KDIGO and ESUR support prophylactic IV isotonic saline or bicarbonate, whereas CAR 2022 finds insufficient evidence to mandate hydration for eGFR ≤ 30 receiving IV ICM; intermediate-risk outpatients may be managed with oral hydration, while low-risk patients do not require routine prophylaxis; where used, isotonic saline or bicarbonate appear similarly effective [^1149Dbv5] [^116nGuk6] [^116g7atw] [^114uqP6J].

> I should confirm medication adjustments: pause nephrotoxic agents when feasible and hold metformin at or before contrast in eGFR ≤ 30 or AKI, resuming after 48 hours only if renal function is stable; N-acetylcysteine should not be used alone and, if considered, only as an adjunct to appropriate volume expansion given mixed evidence [^113Jf1Ck] [^116wjX2k] [^116sypzY] [^112cjp3a].

> But wait, what if iodinated contrast truly isn't necessary? I need to ensure alternatives are considered: depending on the clinical question, noncontrast CT, ultrasound, or MRI without GBCA can be suitable substitutes, recognizing that suboptimal imaging can carry its own risks if it delays or obscures critical diagnoses [^115y6DtE] [^114UfEJU].

> Now, I will examine GBCA-specific risks and prevention with a focus on NSF: the highest NSF risk occurs with eGFR < 30 or AKI, where avoidance is advisable unless essential; when GBCA is needed, macrocyclic agents at the lowest effective dose are preferred, and routine changes to dialysis schedules are not required; modern macrocyclic use has driven NSF incidence to near-zero in severe CKD, though clinicians remain vigilant about tissue gadolinium deposition [^114dCniK] [^113wL23k] [^114UfEJU] [^116g7atw].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacokinetics and scheduling considerations: GBCA and ICM half-lives lengthen as eGFR decreases, so spacing repeat doses is sensible, particularly in severe CKD; combined same-day ICM and GBCA in oncology can affect each modality's results, so coordination and documentation of agent, dose, and timing are essential [^112e5eSZ] [^112jNaBZ].

> Next, I should review guideline concordance versus controversies to avoid over- or underestimating risk: major societies converge on eGFR < 30 as the key high-risk threshold, preference for low-/iso-osmolar ICM over high-osmolar, targeted hydration in higher-risk patients, no routine post-contrast dialysis, and no delays in emergency imaging; however, propensity-matched data suggest IV ICM may confer little to no excess AKI risk, iso- vs low-osmolar differences are minimal, NAC data are conflicting, and the benefit of hydration for severe CKD receiving IV ICM remains debated [^113ZJYcC] [^1145WDuZ] [^113yLo7H] [^111MYCZR].

> I will now synthesize practical algorithms so nothing critical is missed: for elective imaging, screen for CKD risk, obtain eGFR when indicated, stratify by eGFR and route, mitigate with hydration in higher-risk patients, hold nephrotoxins and metformin when appropriate, select low-/iso-osmolar ICM at the lowest diagnostic dose, and consider postprocedure creatinine only in high-risk IA exposures; for emergencies, proceed without delay when imaging is indicated, and apply mitigation opportunistically without compromising time-sensitive care [^113ktp1P] [^1131jv9h] [^115nocZ3] [^116sypzY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought immediate hemodialysis might be beneficial after contrast in advanced CKD, but I should correct that: routine dialysis solely to remove contrast does not prevent CA-AKI or NSF and is not recommended; likewise, in chronic dialysis patients, indicated ICM studies should proceed without altering the dialysis schedule, and residual renal function preservation by immediate dialysis has not been demonstrated [^113yLo7H] [^112t2Wpy].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overlook unique harms: in pediatric patients, CA-AKI incidence is variable and risk stratification mirrors adults with attention to CKD and comorbidities, while iodinated agents can cause hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression in children 0–3 years, warranting awareness and follow-up; for hepatobiliary GBCAs, severe renal impairment substantially prolongs clearance, reinforcing dose minimization and careful scheduling [^115XTdqB] [^116cYvJn] [^112e5eSZ].

> Finally, I should distill clinical pearls and reconcile risk perception with reality: risk is real but contextual and often overestimated for IV ICM; use the lowest diagnostic dose, avoid high-osmolar agents, hold metformin in eGFR ≤ 30 or AKI, focus hydration on truly high-risk scenarios, avoid short-interval elective repeats in high-risk patients, and never delay emergent imaging for eGFR when the diagnosis is time-critical; above all, balance CA-AKI risk against the potentially greater harm of missed or delayed diagnoses [^113uL1Hy] [^1151HRr9] [^116sypzY] [^115nocZ3].

The main risks of receiving contrast are **contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI)** [^112pyhCP], especially in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or acute kidney injury, and **nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)** with gadolinium-based agents in severe renal impairment [^114UfEJU]. Additional risks include **allergic reactions**, **thyroid dysfunction** [^116cYvJn], and rare neurologic or cardiovascular events. Risk is minimized by using the lowest effective dose [^112pyhCP], preferring low- or iso-osmolar iodinated agents [^112HpheK], and avoiding high-risk gadolinium agents in severe CKD [^114UfEJU]. Hydration is recommended for **high-risk patients** [^112pyhCP] [^115sfPWY] [^1149Dbv5], and **metformin should be held** if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI is present [^116sypzY] [^116g7atw].

## Renal risks

### Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI)

- **Incidence**: CA-AKI is a transient decline in renal function after iodinated contrast [^112pyhCP], with higher risk in pre-existing renal impairment, diabetes, heart failure, dehydration [^113uL1Hy], and high contrast doses [^112VwNBt].

- **Risk factors**: eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112pyhCP], diabetes, heart failure, dehydration, high contrast volume [^112VwNBt], and intra-arterial administration [^111qgj3U].

- **Clinical significance**: CA-AKI is linked to longer hospital stay [^112pyhCP], higher costs [^112VwNBt], and increased morbidity and mortality [^117WibGy].

---

### Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)

**Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)** is a rare, severe fibrosing disorder associated with gadolinium-based agents in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^114UfEJU] [^115BdS1n]. For **risk reduction**, prefer macrocyclic gadolinium agents [^114UfEJU] and avoid high-risk linear agents in severe CKD [^112jNaBZ].

---

## Allergic and hypersensitivity reactions

- **Incidence**: Allergic reactions occur in 0.2–0.7% of iodinated contrast exposures, ranging from mild urticaria to severe anaphylaxis.

- **Risk factors**: Prior contrast reaction, atopy, asthma, and multiple allergies increase risk.

- **Prevention**: Premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines is recommended for patients with prior reactions.

---

## Thyroid dysfunction

Regarding thyroid dysfunction, in **hyperthyroidism**, iodinated contrast can precipitate hyperthyroidism or thyroid storm in patients with existing hyperthyroidism or autonomously functioning nodules [^116cYvJn]. In **hypothyroidism**, transient hypothyroidism can occur, particularly in neonates and infants [^116cYvJn].

---

## Neurologic and cardiovascular risks

Neurologic risks include **seizures**, **encephalopathy**, and transient neurologic symptoms; these events are rare but more likely in patients with pre-existing neurologic conditions or with high contrast doses. Cardiovascular risks include **arrhythmias**, **hypotension**, and **myocardial ischemia**, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease or hemodynamic instability.

---

## Long-term adverse outcomes

Regarding long-term outcomes, **chronic kidney disease**: CA-AKI may accelerate CKD progression and increase long-term morbidity and mortality [^112pyhCP]. Mortality: CA-AKI is associated [^112pyhCP] with higher short- and long-term **mortality**, though causality remains debated [^117WibGy].

---

## Risk mitigation strategies

- **Patient selection**: Assess renal function (eGFR) and overall risk before contrast administration [^113nGy3C].

- **Contrast agent selection**: Use [^112pyhCP] low- or iso-osmolar iodinated agents [^112HpheK]; prefer macrocyclic gadolinium agents in severe CKD [^114UfEJU].

- **Hydration**: Provide intravenous isotonic fluids for high-risk patients to reduce CA-AKI risk [^114Anr3s].

- **Medication management**: Hold metformin in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or AKI; avoid nephrotoxic drugs when possible [^116sypzY] [^116g7atw].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum creatinine 48–72 hours after contrast in high-risk patients [^113ktp1P].

---

Contrast media carry risks including **CA-AKI**, **NSF**, allergic reactions, thyroid dysfunction, and rare neurologic or cardiovascular events. These risks are mitigated by **careful patient selection**, **appropriate contrast choice**, **hydration**, and **monitoring**.

### Current status of gadolinium toxicity in patients with kidney disease [^113wL23k]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) agents have recently been the subject of intense interest for physicians across numerous specialties. These agents are widely used as contrast for magnetic resonance imaging and have been generally considered safe. Early on, phase III trials and small studies in low-risk patients suggested a benign renal profile; however, more recent studies raised the possibility of nephrotoxicity, although it is not clear whether it approaches the incidence of nephropathy associated with iodinated radiocontrast.

In 2006, reports of a rare systemic fibrosing condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) were recently linked to exposure of patients with advanced kidney disease to GBC agents. Analysis of the data suggests that certain GBC agents are more likely to be associated with NSF. Also, not all patients with kidney disease are at risk for developing NSF, only those with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease. Avoidance of GBC exposure is the best approach for high-risk patients. When GBC is required to obtain optimal images, use of low dosages of more stable macrocyclic agents is safer and preferred.

This article reviews the status of GBC agents as nephrotoxins and causes of NSF and provides opinions on how to use these agents in patients with underlying kidney disease.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^116nhT26]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

We included all the guidelines on intravenous contrast media (ICM) in patients with kidney disease. The guidelines were defined as documents that self-identified as a guideline or a guidance document with recommendations, including consensus, appropriateness criteria, and manual, among others. We restricted the publication time from January 1, 2018, onwards to present recent developments on this topic. Only guidelines written in English and Chinese were included.

- **Exclusions included**:
	- Guidelines developed from the perspective of a medical specialty, where contrast media were discussed as one of several risk factors for kidney injury
	- Guidelines on intra-arterial contrast media administration, due to unique considerations that do not apply to the intravenous route of administration
	- Previous versions of updated guidelines or guidelines under development
	- Study protocols, primary studies, comments on guidelines, conference abstracts, or other non-guidance documents
	- Duplications

The titles and abstracts of unique records were screened, and their eligibility was confirmed by reading the full texts and supplementary materials. The supplementary materials included, but were not limited to, protocol, conflict of interest declaration, evidence summary, and dissemination materials. For guidelines published across multiple journals, all available materials were evaluated as a whole. The search strategy and guideline selection process are presented in Supplementary Note 3.

### Preventing contrast-induced nephropathy: Problems, challenges and future directions [^1179pLeB]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute kidney injury associated with both short- and long-term adverse outcomes, including the need for renal replacement therapy, increased length of hospital stay, major cardiac adverse events, and mortality. Since there is no effective therapy once injury has occurred, prevention is the cornerstone for all patients at risk for acute kidney injury. There is a small but growing body of evidence that prevention of the acute kidney injury is associated with a reduction in those later adverse outcomes. The article by Meier and colleagues, published this month in BMC Medicine, examines the prophylactic treatment of CIN using intravenous bicarbonate for prevention of CIN and the impact of such therapy on long-term adverse events.

CIN involves at least two complementary pathophysiologic processes. First, contrast media is directly toxic to renal tubule cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and programmed cell death. Second, contrast media reduces medullary blood flow, further compromising a very tenuous balance between oxygen consumption and tissue oxygen availability in this critical area of the kidney. It is this part of the kidney that contains the last part of the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of Henle, where a large proportion of sodium reabsorption occurs through active transport.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy — prevention and risk reduction [^113Jf1Ck]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a serious but potentially preventable adverse event associated with the use of iodinated contrast media (CM). Studies suggest that the occurrence of CIN is directly related to the number of pre-existing patient risk factors such as pre-existing renal insufficiency (RI) with or without diabetes, advanced age, congestive heart failure, and dehydration. Because the risk factors for CIN are common and the consequences serious or even life-threatening, it is important for physicians to implement preventive strategies.

- **Identifying patients at risk**: Although the optimal strategy for preventing CIN has not been fully established, it is important to first identify patients at risk. Commonly used methods for this include patient questionnaires, review of medical history, and measurement of serum creatinine levels prior to the administration of CM. Additionally, estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) before CM administration should be encouraged.

- **Preventive measures**: To prevent the development of CIN, patients should be well-hydrated, and nephrotoxic medications should be withdrawn at least 24 hours prior to CM administration. It is recommended to use the minimal necessary CM dose, as the nephrotoxic effect of CM is dose-dependent. Furthermore, appropriate selection of CM is important. The incidence of CIN has been shown to be lower when an iso-osmolar CM rather than a low-osmolar CM (e.g. iohexol) is used in patients with RI and diabetes.

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Pharmacological interventions with calcium channel blockers, dopamine, and N-acetylcysteine have not consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of CIN.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for contrast-induced nephropathy, specifically in terms of risk assessment, the CAR 2022 guidelines recommend using a simple screening questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed to detect stable outpatients who do not have a current estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on file (within 3–6 months, depending on institutional preference) and lack a provided history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the requisition. Its purpose is to identify patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or severe CKD.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^115BdS1n]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with renal impairment. The majority of studies reporting on their use in this population were published before the alerts on NSF were issued. This association has led public health advisory bodies to release guidelines and best practice recommendations regarding its use in renal insufficiency. Consequently, this has significantly slowed the rapid progression and uptake of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these patients since the early to mid-2000s.

Understanding the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and highlight the implications of using GBCAs in daily imaging practice. We conducted an electronic database search using PubMed/Medline and EMBASE to gather evidence from published literature on the occurrence of NSF in patients with renal impairment. A forward citation and bibliographic search of the identified studies was also performed. Published studies were reviewed for reported pathophysiological and clinical manifestations, proposed diagnostic pathways, treatment options, and reported incidence. We further reviewed practice recommendations, guidelines, and published manuals related to contrast safety.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^113a78iG]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

To appraise the quality of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) use in patients with kidney disease and to compare the recommendations among them, we searched four literature databases, eight guideline libraries, and ten homepages of radiological societies. The focus was on identifying English and Chinese guidelines published between January 2018 and June 2023. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the Scientific, Transparent, and Applicable Rankings (STAR) tool.

Ten guidelines were included, with a median STAR score of 46.0 (range 28.5–61.5). The guidelines performed well in the "Recommendations" domain (31/40, 78%) but poorly in the "Registry" (0/20, 0%) and "Protocol" domains (0/20, 0%). Nine guidelines recommended an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as the cutoff for referring patients to discuss the risk-benefit balance of ICM administration. Three guidelines further suggested that patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and high-risk factors also require referral. Variable recommendations were seen regarding the acceptable time interval between a renal function test and ICM administration, and between scans and repeated scans. Nine guidelines recommended using iso-osmolar or low-osmolar ICM, while no consensus has been reached for the dosing of ICM. Nine guidelines supported hydration after ICM use, but their protocols varied. Drugs or blood purification therapy were not recommended as preventative means.

### Preventing complications of radiographic contrast media: Is there a role for dialysis [^113yLo7H]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Nephrologists are often called upon to provide hemodialysis to remove radiographic contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), usually but not exclusively, those with end-stage renal disease. The reasons for this request vary from concerns over the volume load associated with the administration of a hyperosmolar solution to the renal and extra-renal toxicities of the contrast itself. Simple calculations demonstrate that the increase in extracellular volume following a typical contrast load is minimal. Data supporting the extra-renal toxicity of contrast in patients maintained on dialysis are lacking.

Iodinated contrast agents have molecular weights of 700–1500. This relatively small size, as well as their lack of protein binding, makes them well suited for removal with extracorporeal renal replacement therapies. Thus, provision of hemodialysis immediately following a contrast load is often utilized in an attempt to prevent further renal damage in patients with advanced stages of CKD. A number of trials have failed to demonstrate that this maneuver is effective. Hemofiltration (HF) has been reported to decrease the risk of acute renal failure in patients with CKD receiving a contrast load, but the studies are methodologically flawed. Therefore, there is currently no sound basis for routinely recommending hemodialysis (or HF) in patients at high risk for contrast media-associated complications.

### Use of radiocontrast agents in CKD and ESRD [^114dCniK]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Contrast exposure in a population with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires additional consideration given the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after exposure to iodinated contrast, as well as systemic injury with exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). Strategies to avoid CIN and manage patients after exposure, including extracorporeal removal of contrast media, may differ among an advanced CKD population compared to a general population. There is strong evidence to support the use of isotonic volume expansion and the lowest dose of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media possible to decrease CIN.

The literature on other newer prophylactic strategies, such as statins, remote ischemic preconditioning, discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, and RenalGuard, is limited; thus, these strategies cannot currently be recommended as routine prophylaxis for CIN. The use of extracorporeal removal of contrast agents as prophylaxis to reduce CIN has been the subject of multiple studies; however, data do not support a beneficial effect in reduction in CIN. Immediate removal of contrast by dialysis in a maintenance dialysis population is also not recommended unless an individual's cardiopulmonary status is dependent on strict volume management.

In patients with reduced renal function, GCBA exposure increases the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). For patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), CKD stage 3 or greater (eGFR < 30 ml/minute/1.73 m²), or patients on dialysis, we do not recommend the use of GBCA, and alternative imaging modalities should be considered.

### Con: Contrast-induced nephropathy-should we try to avoid contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115ZNorx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to iodinated contrast has been overestimated, leading clinicians to withhold potentially life-saving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. There is mounting evidence that iodinated contrast plays only a minor role in the development of AKI compared to more significant risk factors such as pre-existing renal dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, and exposure to nephrotoxic drugs. We will present data challenging the dogma of avoiding iodinated contrast in patients with reduced renal function. Based on a rational and individualized risk-benefit analysis, we believe it is preferable to utilize iodinated contrast if alternative diagnostic or therapeutic options are comparatively ineffective or hazardous.

### Contrast-associated acute kidney injury: An update of risk factors, risk factor scores, and preventive measures [^116wjX2k]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

As lifespans lengthen, age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are becoming more prevalent. Correspondingly, the use of contrast agents for medical imaging is also becoming more common, and there is increasing awareness of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). There is no specific treatment for CA-AKI, and clinicians currently focus on prevention, interventions that alter its pathogenesis, and identification of risk factors. Although the incidence of CA-AKI is low in the general population, the risk of CA-AKI can reach 20% to 30% in patients with multiple risk factors.

Many models have been applied in the clinic to assess the risk factors for CA-AKI, enable identification of high-risk groups, and improve clinical management. Hypotonic or isotonic contrast media are recommended to prevent CA-AKI in high-risk patients. Patients with risk factors should avoid using contrast media multiple times within a short period. All nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped at least 24 hours before the administration of contrast media in high-risk populations, and adequate hydration is recommended for all patients.

This review summarizes the pathophysiology of CA-AKI and the progress in diagnosis and differential diagnosis; updates the risk factors and risk factor scoring systems; reviews the latest advances related to prevention and treatment; discusses problems in epidemiological studies; and highlights the importance of identifying high-risk subjects to control modifiable risk factors and use a rating scale to estimate the risk.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, specifically with respect to N-acetylcysteine, the ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend considering the administration of oral N-acetylcysteine only in patients receiving appropriate fluid and salt loading. It is advised not to use oral N-acetylcysteine as the sole method for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy, restriction of contrast medium use is recommended. The CAR 2022 guidelines advise assessing the overall risk of worsening AKI with contrast against the benefits of improved diagnostic capability and therapeutic intervention for the use of IV or intra-arterial contrast in the setting of preexisting AKI.

- **Question 3**: What is the evidence that contrast media are truly a causative factor in AKI and what are the eGFR values below which there is a risk of PC-AKI?

Contrast-induced nephropathy was accepted for many years, but more recently it has been questioned whether contrast media (CM) causes the deterioration in renal function that may occur after CM administration. There are important limitations in many studies that assess whether CM causes acute kidney injury (AKI). Most studies evaluate the use of intra-arterial (IA) CM in coronary angiography (CA) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with significant co-morbidities; therefore, they may not be relevant for intravenous administration. Additionally, most studies do not have adequate control groups.

### Radiographic contrast media and the kidney [^112pyhCP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential complication of intravascular iodinated contrast exposure. Contrast-associated AKI typically manifests as small and transient decrements in kidney function that develop within several days of contrast administration. It is associated with serious adverse outcomes, including progressive kidney dysfunction and death. However, a causal link between the small increases in serum creatinine, which characteristically occur with contrast-associated AKI, and serious adverse outcomes remains unproven. This is important given mounting evidence that clinically indicated, potentially lifesaving radiographic procedures are underutilized in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This underutilization has been hypothesized to be related to provider concern about precipitating contrast-associated AKI.

Intravascular gadolinium-based contrast, an alternative to iodinated contrast administered with magnetic resonance imaging, has also been linked with potential serious adverse events, notably the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severe impairment in kidney function. Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit frequently have clinical indications for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that involve the intravascular administration of contrast media. Accordingly, critical care providers and others treating critically ill patients should possess a sound understanding of the risk factors for and incidence of such outcomes. They should also have the ability to perform evidence-based risk-benefit assessments regarding intravascular contrast administration and knowledge of empirical data on the topic.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^116zjdB1]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

There were several controversial recommendations that must be considered in future studies. The Choyke questionnaire may work well for the selection of patients to undergo serum creatinine testing. However, many hospitals measure serum creatinine in all patients scheduled for intravenous ICM use, as eGFR can detect more patients with kidney diseases than questionnaires alone. On the other hand, many risk models and tools have been developed for PC-AKI prediction. Validation studies are still lacking for the selection of these risk models to guide renal function testing.

It is still dependent on clinical judgment whether repeated renal function testing is necessary or if emergency contrast-enhanced CT without renal function results is appropriate. In non-emergency situations, the acceptable time interval between renal function tests and ICM administration is either not mentioned or varies between guidelines. There is a need to establish a shared consensus on this issue to guide clinical practice. Currently, the recommendations from the European Society of Urogenital Radiology are the most widely accepted.

The shortest available time interval between repeated scans is also undetermined. The American College of Radiology recommended that the time interval of repeated ICM injections be at least 24 hours, which is the shortest among the guidelines that include this. The most conservative suggestion was provided by the Chinese Society of Radiology, which recommended avoiding repeated ICM injections within 72 hours. Guidelines still value clinical judgment.

### Absolute and relative GFR and contrast medium dose/GFR ratio: Cornerstones when predicting the risk of acute kidney injury [^116UQZYx]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the best overall index of kidney function in health and disease, and its use is recommended to evaluate the risk of iodine contrast medium-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) either as a single parameter or as a ratio between the total contrast medium dose (gram iodine) and GFR. GFR may be expressed in absolute terms (mL/min) or adjusted/indexed to body surface area, known as relative GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²).

Absolute and relative GFR have been used interchangeably to evaluate the risk of CI-AKI, which may be confusing and a potential source of errors. Relative GFR should be used to assess the GFR category of renal function as a sign of the degree of kidney damage and sensitivity for CI-AKI. Absolute GFR represents the excretion capacity of the individual and may be used to calculate the gram-iodine/absolute GFR ratio, an index of systemic drug exposure (amount of contrast medium in the body) that relates to toxicity. It has been found to be an independent predictor of AKI following percutaneous coronary angiography and interventions but has not yet been fully validated for computed tomography (CT).

Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the optimal gram-iodine/absolute GFR ratio to predict AKI at various stages of renal function at CT. Only GFR estimation (eGFR) equations based on standardized creatinine and/or cystatin C assays should be used. An eGFR cystatin C/eGFR creatinine ratio < 0.6, indicating selective glomerular hypofiltration syndrome, may have a stronger predictive power for post-contrast AKI than creatinine-based eGFR.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy: What are the true clinical consequences [^117WibGy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Observational studies have demonstrated that short- and long-term mortality is increased in patients who develop contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The more clinically relevant questions, and the objectives of this review, are whether CIN is causally related to mortality, and to what extent could mortality in patients undergoing contrast procedures be reduced by preventing CIN.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: A literature review was conducted, focusing on observational studies that assessed factors associated with mortality in patients with CIN.

- **Results**: The deaths of some patients with CIN are complicated by factors that cannot be directly related to CIN, such as liver disease, sepsis, respiratory failure, and bleeding. However, it is plausible that CIN contributes to cardiovascular causes of death in patients with CIN.

- **Conclusions**: At the very least, CIN is a marker for increased mortality. More carefully designed prospective studies are needed to fully elucidate the relationship between CIN and death. In the absence of data disproving a causal relationship between CIN and death in all subgroups, reducing its incidence should remain a goal in clinical practice as well as a target for future research.

The CAR 2022 guidelines emphasize the importance of timely imaging in the prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, particularly in emergent situations. For conditions such as suspected acute stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute aortic syndrome, bowel ischemia, or perforation, contrast-enhanced imaging should be obtained without delay. Risk assessment should not interfere with immediate patient care. Emergent imaging should not be postponed for eGFR measurement, nor should needed contrast be withheld, as these may affect the accurate diagnosis of critical pathologies.

- **Kidney injury risk categories**: Based on the calculated safe contrast volume limit, one-tenth of patients are at high risk of kidney injury regardless of the amount of contrast used. One-quarter have a modifiable risk and should receive a contrast volume less than the calculated contrast limit. About two-thirds of patients are at low risk and can likely receive most volumes of contrast without developing kidney injury.

Note: The pragmatic full model was used for defining contrast limits. Results were similar if using full or pragmatic minimum models. CA-AKI indicates contrast-associated acute kidney injury; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

It is advised to hold metformin at the time of or before the administration of iodinated contrast media in patients with an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or acute kidney injury (AKI). Metformin should not be restarted for at least 48 hours and only if kidney function remains stable, defined as less than a 25% increase compared with baseline creatinine levels. Moreover, the continued use of metformin should be re-evaluated by the patient's clinical team to ensure safety.

Part 2: Risk stratification, role of hydration and other prophylactic measures, patients taking metformin and chronic dialysis patients: Recommendations for updated ESUR contrast medium safety committee guidelines [^116g7atw]. European Radiology (2018). High credibility.

The Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) has updated its 2011 guidelines on the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). The results of the literature review and the recommendations based on it, which were used to prepare the new guidelines, are presented in two papers.

- **Areas covered in part 2**: Topics reviewed include stratification of PC-AKI risk, the need to withdraw nephrotoxic medication, PC-AKI prophylaxis with hydration or drugs, the use of metformin in diabetic patients receiving contrast medium, and the need to alter dialysis schedules in patients receiving contrast medium.

- **Key points**:
	- In CKD, hydration reduces the PC-AKI risk.
	- Intravenous normal saline and intravenous sodium bicarbonate provide equally effective prophylaxis.
	- No drugs have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of PC-AKI.
	- Stop metformin from the time of contrast medium administration if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m².
	- Dialysis schedules need not change when intravascular contrast medium is given.

### Risk of acute kidney injury after contrast-enhanced computerized tomography: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 propensity score-matched cohort studies [^111MYCZR]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Our findings reverberate the conflicting data in the adult literature regarding renal risks after intravenous CM administration and prompt a differential analysis for patients with high disease burden.

Assessing a broad range of comorbidities, no other association with higher AKI risk was found. This is particularly noteworthy considering that our study populations featured critically and chronically ill patients. In daily clinical practice, these patients are most likely to experience exclusion from CM–enhanced procedures out of fear of causing contrast-induced AKI. Our findings do not support the clinical avoidance of CM where otherwise indicated. Similarly, van der Molen et al. recently demonstrated no need for emergency haemodialysis after administration of iodine-based CM in patients with dialysis-requiring CKD. The observed shift in the medical literature may be explained by adjustments in CM osmolality and administered volumes in recent years.

Similar to other authors, we observed a trend towards lower risk for renal impairment after CM exposure. Puchol et al. explained this with the hydration occurring in the course of administering the CM volume and its subsequent osmotic diuretic effects. Since CM is not nephroprotective, we assume the presence of factors affecting the AKI incidence. These are not easily measurable and, as it seems, not entirely rectified by PSM. Investigators who applied PSM models have reported similar results. Studies cannot consider factors that conceivably bias the decision to administer CM in the first place.

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m²), the renal elimination half-lives increase to 4–7 hours, requiring up to 42 hours for near-complete clearance and 14 hours for 75% clearance. As the residual excretion depends on thermodynamic stability, it will not be significantly prolonged.

For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), renal elimination half-lives increase to between 10 and 30 hours, requiring 60 hours (2.5 days) for 75% clearance and 180 hours (7.5 days) for near-complete clearance. It remains unclear whether the residual excretion is prolonged in these patients.

- **Approved linear hepatobiliary GBCA**:
	- **Moderate renal impairment**: Leads to an increase in renal elimination half-lives of 2–5 hours, corresponding to 30 hours for near-complete clearance and 10 hours for 75% clearance.
	- **Severe renal impairment**: Leads to an increase in renal elimination half-lives of 10–20 hours, corresponding to 60–120 hours for near-complete clearance and 20–40 hours for 75% clearance. Residual excretion half-lives are in the order of 25 hours.

- **Combined enhanced imaging with an ICM and a GBCA**:
	- In oncology, contrast-enhanced MRI examinations with GBCA and contrast-enhanced CT examinations with ICM are often combined, sometimes on the same day. The presence of ICM can influence the results of the MRI examination, and the presence of GBCA can affect the results of the CT examination.

### Strategies for the prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury [^116eEpCP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media for diagnostic imaging is a common cause of acute kidney injury and a leading cause of iatrogenic renal disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the principal risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury and to summarize recent data describing the efficacy of various preventive interventions for this condition.

- **Recent findings**: Whereas earlier studies suggested that certain low-osmolal contrast agents, including iohexol and ioxaglate, are more nephrotoxic than iso-osmolal iodixanol, recent clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing other low-osmolal contrast agents with iodixanol have found little difference in risk. The provision of prophylactic renal replacement therapy does not ameliorate the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury and likely poses undue risk. Despite some research supporting a benefit of atrial natriuretic peptide, statins, and prostaglandin analogs, additional data from large, adequately powered studies are needed before these agents can be recommended. N-Acetylcysteine and isotonic intravenous bicarbonate have been investigated intensely; yet the data on these interventions are conflicting due to methodological limitations in past studies.

- **Summary**: Prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury involves the identification of high-risk patients, consideration of alternative imaging procedures that do not involve the administration of iodinated contrast, and integration of the cumulative data available on preventive interventions in high-risk patients.

### Acute kidney injury with iodinated contrast [^111ZmHg5]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and interventional radiographic procedures in critically ill patients commonly rely on iodinated contrast media, which consequently poses the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). This significant complication accounts for numerous cases of hospital-acquired renal failure, adversely affecting prognosis and healthcare costs.

- **Epidemiology and pathogenesis**: The epidemiology and pathogenesis of contrast-induced AKI, baseline renal function measurement, risk assessment, identification of high-risk patients, contrast medium use, and preventive strategies are explored in this article.
- **Algorithm for risk stratification and management**: An algorithm is suggested for the risk stratification and management of contrast-induced AKI in patients undergoing iodinated contrast exposure during critical illness.

Contrast-induced AKI is likely to continue being a substantial challenge for intensivists as the patient population ages and the incidence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes increases.

- **Definition of terms**: The term intravenous CM administration indicates that CM reaches the renal arteries after dilution by circulation through the right heart and pulmonary circulation or a systemic capillary bed.

- **Intra-arterial CM administration**: The same is true for intra-arterial CM administration with second-pass renal exposure, such as via catheters into the right heart and pulmonary arteries, and via catheters directly in the carotid, subclavian, brachial, coronary, and mesenteric arteries, as well as into the infrarenal aorta and the iliac, femoral, and crural arteries. Note: Because of backflow during this type of IA injection, small doses of CM may reach the kidney in a relatively undiluted form.

- **Intra-arterial CM administration with first-pass renal exposure**: This indicates that CM reaches the renal arteries during its first pass in a relatively undiluted form, depending on the distance of the site of injection from the renal arteries. This occurs with injections through catheters into the left heart, the thoracic and suprarenal abdominal aorta, and selectively into the renal arteries. Note: In suprarenal aortic injections, some of the injected CM escapes via suprarenal aortic side-branches and reaches the kidney after dilution in the circulation.

Results in human studies — renal and hepatobiliary insufficiency

In patients with renal impairment, the half-lives of the extracellular GBCA increase progressively. As in ICM, the summarized data depend on study populations and settings and should be taken as a relative indication. In patients with mild renal insufficiency (eGFR 60–90 mL/min/1.73 m²), only data for the new GBCA gadopiclenol was available. The half-life already increased to 3.2 hours. In moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m²), the increase in half-lives was between 3.8 and 6.9 hours, depending on the degree of renal impairment, with higher values for lower eGFR. This is equivalent to 2.5–3.5 times that of volunteers with normal renal function. In severe renal insufficiency (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), excluding dialysis, half-lives are between 9.5 and 30 hours, equivalent to 6–18 times the value of volunteers with normal renal function.

In the hepatobiliary GBCA, a combination of renal and hepatic impairment has been studied, as bile duct excretion is able to compensate for some renal function deterioration. Moderate hepatic impairment did not change the plasma half-life, but severe hepatic impairment (Child–Pugh C cirrhosis) led to slight increases to 2.6 hours for gadoxetate and to 2.2 hours for gadobenate. For gadoxetate, moderate renal impairment could be compensated with a half-life of 2.2 hours, while severe renal impairment led to a half-life of 20 hours. In gadobenate, moderate renal impairment increased the half-life to 5.6 hours and severe impairment to 9.2 hours.

### Acute kidney injury: Prevention, detection, and management. Summary of updated NICE guidance for adults receiving iodine-based contrast media [^116nGuk6]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recently updated the guideline for acute kidney injury: Prevention, detection, and management (NG148), providing new recommendations on preventing acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults receiving intravenous iodine-based contrast media. The association between intravenous iodinated contrast media and AKI is controversial, particularly with the widespread use of iso-osmolar agents. Associations between contrast media administration and AKI are largely based on observational studies, with inherent heterogeneity in patient populations, definitions applied, and timing of laboratory investigations.

In an attempt to mitigate risk, kidney protection has typically been employed using intravenous volume expansion and/or oral acetylcysteine. Such interventions are in widespread use, despite lacking high-quality evidence of benefit. In the non-emergency setting, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurements should be obtained within the preceding 3 months before offering intravenous iodine-based contrast media. In the acute setting, adults should also have their risk of AKI assessed before offering intravenous iodine-based contrast media; however, this should not delay emergency imaging.

Based on the evidence available from randomised controlled trials, the NICE committee recommends that oral hydration should be encouraged in adults at increased risk of AKI and that volume expansion with intravenous fluids should only be considered for inpatients at particularly high risk.

### The controversy of contrast-induced nephropathy with intravenous contrast: What is the risk [^113uL1Hy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has long been observed in both experimental and clinical studies. However, recent observational studies have questioned the prevalence and severity of CIN following intravenous contrast exposure. Initial studies of acute kidney injury following intravenous contrast were limited by the absence of control groups or contained control groups that did not adjust for additional acute kidney injury risk factors, including prevalent chronic kidney disease, as well as accepted prophylactic strategies. More contemporary use of propensity score-adjusted models has attempted to minimize the risk for selection bias, although bias cannot be completely eliminated without a prospective randomized trial.

Based on existing data, we recommend the following CIN risk classification: Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m² are at negligible risk for CIN, while patients with eGFRs < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² are at high risk for CIN. Patients with eGFRs between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m² are at intermediate risk for CIN unless diabetes mellitus is present, which would further increase the risk. In all patients at any increased risk for CIN, the risk for CIN needs to be balanced by the risk of not performing an intravenous contrast-enhanced study.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^113ZJYcC]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

To appraise the quality of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media (ICM) use in patients with kidney disease, and to compare the recommendations among them, a comprehensive search was conducted. Four literature databases, eight guideline libraries, and ten homepages of radiological societies were explored to identify English and Chinese guidelines published between January 2018 and June 2023. The guidelines' quality was assessed using the Scientific, Transparent, and Applicable Rankings (STAR) tool.

Ten guidelines were included, with a median STAR score of 46.0 (range 28.5–61.5). The guidelines performed well in the "Recommendations" domain (31/40, 78%), while they performed poorly in the "Registry" (0/20, 0%) and "Protocol" domains (0/20, 0%). Nine guidelines recommended an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as the cutoff for referring patients to discuss the risk-benefit balance of ICM administration. Additionally, three guidelines suggested that patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and high-risk factors also need referring. There were variable recommendations regarding the acceptable time interval between renal function tests and ICM administration, and between scans and repeated scans.

Nine guidelines recommended the use of iso-osmolar or low-osmolar ICM; however, no consensus has been reached regarding the dosing of ICM. Nine guidelines supported hydration after ICM use, though their protocols varied. Drugs or blood purification therapy were not recommended as preventive means.

### Risk of acute kidney injury following intravenous iodinated contrast exposure among pediatric population: a narrative review [^115XTdqB]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a significant concern in pediatric populations following the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast media. This narrative review aims to systematically evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria associated with contrast-induced acute kidney injury in children, addressing the variability in reported rates and the implications for clinical practice.

The rationale for this review stems from the need to clarify the relationship between iodinated contrast media exposure and acute kidney injury, particularly in high-risk pediatric patients, as existing literature presents inconsistent findings. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scientific Direct, and Google Scholar databases, focusing on studies published between 2020 and 2025 that addressed contrast-induced acute kidney injury in children.

- **Key findings**: The review identified that contrast-induced acute kidney injury incidence ranges from 1.4–35%, influenced by factors such as chronic kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rates, age, and gender.

- **Implications**: The findings emphasize the need for standardized diagnostic criteria and protocols to improve the assessment and management of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in children. Additionally, there is a gap in robust randomized controlled trials, highlighting the necessity for future multicenter studies to explore novel biomarkers for early detection and effective preventive strategies.

This review advocates for a balanced approach to using iodinated contrast media in pediatric patients.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, specifically concerning the restriction of contrast medium use, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Repeat contrast doses in lower-risk patients**: Do not restrict repeat contrast doses in lower-risk patients (eGFR > 30, no AKI, IV route) and do not withhold repeat doses for emergency or inpatients with life-threatening or acute presentations of illness.

- **Contrast exposure for higher-risk patients**: Avoid repeated contrast exposures within 48 hours for elective procedures if the patient is at higher risk of contrast-associated AKI (eGFR ≤ 30, AKI, intra-arterial iodinated contrast media administration).

### The use of iodinated contrast media in patients with end-stage renal disease [^112d27V4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Iodinated contrast agents are well tolerated in ESRD patients. Certain types of iodinated contrast media (ICM), such as low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) and nonionic agents, are associated with better safety profiles. Although the available evidence is not optimal, it does not support the need for additional hemodialysis for ICM removal to preserve residual renal function or to treat other potential toxicities of ICM. However, limiting exposure to ICM is a prudent measure in ESRD patients, given ICM's potential toxicity. Close monitoring of patients with poor cardiac function is also recommended for subjects receiving higher doses of ICM, especially those receiving high-osmolar contrast media (HOCM).

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically in the context of preventing contrast-induced nephropathy, the 2022 guidelines from the Canadian Association of Radiologists recommend restricting the use of contrast medium. An indicated contrast imaging should be obtained if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and there are no signs or symptoms of acute kidney injury (AKI) in non-emergent, stable outpatients, inpatients, and emergency patients when eGFR is available.

It is essential to ensure an individual patient decision involving the caring team or patient/patient decision-maker to explain and balance the risks of contrast-associated AKI against the risks and uncertainties of delayed or suboptimal imaging if the eGFR is less than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or if AKI is suspected.

### Post-contrast acute kidney injury. Part 2: Risk stratification, role of hydration and other prophylactic measures, patients taking metformin and chronic dialysis patients: Recommendations for updated ESUR contrast medium safety committee guidelines [^115sfPWY]. European Radiology (2018). High credibility.

The Contrast Media Safety Committee (CMSC) of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) has updated its 2011 guidelines on the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). The results of the literature review and the recommendations, which were used to prepare the new guidelines, are presented in two papers.

- **Areas covered in part 2**: Topics reviewed include stratification of PC-AKI risk, the need to withdraw nephrotoxic medication, PC-AKI prophylaxis with hydration or drugs, the use of metformin in diabetic patients receiving contrast medium, and the need to alter dialysis schedules in patients receiving contrast medium.

- **Key points**:
	- In CKD, hydration reduces the PC-AKI risk.
	- Intravenous normal saline and intravenous sodium bicarbonate provide equally effective prophylaxis.
	- No drugs have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of PC-AKI.
	- Stop metformin from the time of contrast medium administration if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m².
	- Dialysis schedules need not change when intravascular contrast medium is given.

### Is intravenous contrast associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury [^1164GhwH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is a common imaging modality used in the emergency department. Intravenous (i.v.) contrast can assist with visualization of pathology, particularly for inflammatory conditions and vascular structures. However, i.v. contrast has historically been associated with the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

- **Clinical question**: Is i.v. contrast associated with an increased risk of AKI?

- **Evidence review**: Studies retrieved included four systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of i.v. contrast for CT and association with AKI, need for kidney replacement therapy, and mortality. These studies provide estimates of the potential association of AKI with use of i.v. contrast for CT.

- **Conclusion**: Based upon the available literature, the use of i.v. contrast for CT imaging does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of AKI.

### Preventing contrast-induced nephropathy: Problems, challenges and future directions [^1168gqud]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy is an injury to the kidney occurring as a result of exposure to intravascular contrast media, leading to both short- and long-term adverse events, including mortality. Since treatment of the injury after it has occurred is ineffective, efforts to prevent the injury are the focus of investigators and clinicians alike. This commentary reviews the pathogenesis and clinical relevance of contrast-induced nephropathy. Prophylactic strategies, particularly the use of meta-analysis of small single-center trials, are discussed.

### An interdisciplinary consensus on the management of bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma [^114VYrBx]. Nature Reviews. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) from intravenous contrast medium in patients undergoing CT imaging with and without intravenous contrast agent for various indications, including metastatic RCC. The risks of AKI, death, and dialysis were similar for both groups (relative risk (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.62–1.02; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.55–1.67; and RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.23–3.43, respectively). This pattern was observed regardless of contrast medium type or whether patients had renal insufficiency, indicating that patients with RCC do not have an increased risk of AKI from intravenous contrast medium. Individual factors other than the use of contrast medium are more likely to contribute to the development of AKI. Patients at low risk (serum creatinine level (SCr) ≤ 1.5 mg/dl) and intermediate risk (SCr 1.6–2.0 mg/dl) can be safely scanned with intravenous contrast medium, as they do not have a substantial risk of AKI. Generally, CT and MRI scans should be acquired with intravenous contrast medium unless patients have substantial impairment of renal function (SCr > 2.0 mg/dl).

- **Summary of evidence**: Bone scintigraphy has low sensitivity to detect bone metastases (LoE: 3). CT imaging is a powerful tool to assess bone structure for detection of bone metastases, with a higher sensitivity than bone scintigraphy (LoE: 4). MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity to detect bone metastases (LoE: 4). PET has high specificity, and its sensitivity depends on the applied radiotracer (LoE: 3).

### Risks and options with gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with CKD: A review [^114UfEJU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) improve the diagnostic capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging. Although initially believed to be without major adverse effects, GBCA use in patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been demonstrated to cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Restrictive policies of GBCA use in CKD and selective use of GBCAs that bind free gadolinium more strongly have resulted in the virtual elimination of NSF cases. Contemporary studies of the use of GBCAs with high binding affinity for free gadolinium in severe CKD demonstrate an absence of NSF. Despite these observations and the limitations of contemporary studies, physicians remain concerned about GBCA use in severe CKD.

Concerns of GBCA use in severe CKD are magnified by recent observations demonstrating gadolinium deposition in the brain and a possible systemic syndrome attributed to GBCAs. Radiologic advances have resulted in several new imaging modalities that can be used in the severe CKD population and that do not require GBCA administration. In this article, we critically review GBCA use in patients with severe CKD and provide recommendations regarding GBCA use in this population.

### Contrast-induced kidney injury: focus on modifiable risk factors and prophylactic strategies [^114Jufn1]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy, also known as contrast-induced acute kidney injury, is associated with a rapid and often irreversible decline in kidney function following the administration of iodinated contrast agents. It is the third leading cause of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients and substantially increases mortality, morbidity, and length of hospitalization. This condition follows a predictable time of onset and is potentially preventable. Numerous studies have focused on the characteristics of populations at risk and prophylactic strategies.

This evidence-based review summarizes recent literature and provides a nephrologist's perspective on contrast-induced nephropathy, focusing on the following areas:

- **Pathophysiology of contrast-induced nephropathy**: Understanding the underlying mechanisms and progression of the condition.
- **Identification of populations at risk**: Highlighting groups that exhibit increased vulnerability to contrast-induced kidney injury.
- **Correlation between contrast-induced nephropathy and the type of contrast agent used**: Examining how different contrast agents influence the risk and severity of nephropathy.
- **Measures to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy**: Covering preventive strategies such as the use of intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, N-acetylcysteine, and hemofiltration/hemodialysis.

### Just give the contrast? Appraisal of guidelines on intravenous iodinated contrast media use in patients with kidney disease [^115z6Pwf]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

To identify whether the patient needs renal function testing, most guidelines emphasized the history of kidney disease. Other potential risk factors that should be considered include diabetes, metformin use, hypertension, heart failure, proteinuria, and gout. Aging was considered a factor for renal function testing by two guidelines; however, another guideline was against this, treating renal function reduction as normal physiological changes associated with aging. Questionnaires, risk models, and stratification tools exhibited good performance in predicting the risk of PC-AKI, but consensus on which tool to use in clinical practice was not achieved.

The acceptable interval between renal function testing and ICM administration varied among guidelines. Three guidelines recommended renal function testing within seven days for patients with an acute disease and within three months for patients with chronic disease with stable renal function, based on earlier guidelines. Other guidelines suggested 7 days to 6 weeks, depending on clinical judgment. Nine guidelines agreed that patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² are at risk for PC-AKI or need referral and further treatment. Additionally, three guidelines considered patients in intensive care units or with high-risk factors and an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² to be at risk for PC-AKI. The calculation of eGFR based on serum creatinine was noted as the commonly available method.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy: Identifying the risks, choosing the right agent, and reviewing effective prevention and management methods [^112VwNBt]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With the rise in the use of intravenous iodinated contrast media for both computed tomography scans and angiographic studies, there is a greater likelihood of complications. One of the most well-known adverse effects is contrast-induced media nephropathy, also known as contrast-induced acute kidney injury. This is the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure and is associated with an increase in morbidity, mortality, and a greater financial burden on the healthcare system. Because of these factors, it is important for radiologists to recognize risk factors and signs and symptoms, as well as to know how to manage patients appropriately.

### Revisiting the risks of MRI with gadolinium based contrast agents-review of literature and guidelines [^112jNaBZ]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) have been linked to the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with renal impairment. The exact interaction between the various available formulations and the occurrence of NSF is not completely understood, but it has been postulated. This association has prompted public health advisory bodies to issue guidelines and best practice recommendations on its use, which have contributed to a decline in the reported incidence of NSF and the published use of GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with renal impairment. Understanding the events that led to these recommendations can increase clinical awareness and the implications of their usage. We present a review of the published literature and an overview of practice recommendations, guidelines, and manuals on contrast safety to aid everyday imaging practice.

- **Teaching points**:
	- Low-risk gadolinium based contrast agents should be the choice in cases of renal insufficiency.
	- Higher doses have been linked to the development of NSF, and doses should be kept as low as possible.
	- Clear documentation of the date, dose, and type of formulation used should be maintained.
	- Post-scan dialysis should be arranged as soon as possible when feasible.
	- A pre-existing inflammatory state is a risk factor; however, liver insufficiency is not a contraindication.

### Negligible risk of acute renal failure among hospitalized patients after contrast-enhanced imaging with iodinated versus gadolinium-based agents [^115rsxV9]. Investigative Radiology (2019). High credibility.

The potential adverse renal outcome among patients undergoing iodine-based contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) has been questioned recently, given the caution undertaken in patients' selection, hydration protocols, and the low radiocontrast volume used with advanced imaging equipment.

- **Materials and methods**: This study is a retrospective assessment of renal outcome in 12,580 hospitalized patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT, compared with 754 patients subjected to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging. Subsequent propensity matching was conducted for clinical characteristics and potential risk factors.

- **Results**: The risk of postcontrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) was found to be negligible as compared with patients undergoing enhanced magnetic resonance imaging studies, before and after propensity matching. The rates of AKI were 8% in the nonmatched iodine-based contrast agents (IBCAs) and 7.3% in gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), respectively (P = 0.3), and 7% in the matched IBCA group (P = 0.9). Comparisons among subgroups with well-defined risk factors such as chronic renal failure, diabetes, older age, and hypertension showed similar results. However, lower systolic blood pressure before imaging was associated with a higher risk to develop PC-AKI after IBCA administration but not with GBCA. For systolic blood pressure lower than 110 mm Hg, the odds ratio for AKI after IBCA was 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.88), and after GBCA, the odds ratio was 0.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.003–0.73).

- **Conclusions**: With the precautions undertaken, the real-life risk of PC-AKI remains minimal in the context of advanced imaging techniques and careful patient management, as demonstrated by this study's findings.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for contrast-induced nephropathy, particularly with respect to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the CAR 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining the indicated contrast-enhanced imaging without delay if the patient presents emergently. This includes situations such as suspected acute stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute aortic syndrome, bowel ischemia or perforation, and other urgent conditions. Emergent imaging should not be delayed to obtain an eGFR measurement, nor should contrast be withheld if it is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of the emergent pathology.

### Conray [^116cYvJn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Acute renal failure has been reported in diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy and in susceptible non-diabetic patients (often elderly with pre-existing renal disease) following the administration of iodinated contrast agents. Therefore, careful consideration of the potential risks should be given before performing this radiographic procedure in these patients.

Caution should be exercised in performing contrast medium studies in patients with endotoxemia and/or those with elevated body temperatures.

Reports of thyroid storm occurring following the intravascular use of iodinated radiopaque agents in patients with hyperthyroidism or with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule suggest that this additional risk should be evaluated in such patients before use of this drug. Iodine-containing contrast agents may alter the results of thyroid function tests which depend on iodine estimation, e.g. PBI and radioactive iodine uptake studies. Such tests, if indicated, should be performed prior to the administration of this preparation.

- **Thyroid dysfunction in pediatric patients 0 to 3 years of age**: Thyroid dysfunction, characterized by hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression, has been reported after both single exposure and multiple exposures to iodinated contrast media (ICM) in pediatric patients 0 to 3 years of age. Younger age, very low birth weight, prematurity, underlying medical conditions affecting thyroid function, admission to neonatal or pediatric intensive care units, and congenital cardiac conditions are associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism after exposure to ICM.
