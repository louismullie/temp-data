## Question

What is the most frequent etiology of cough in an adolescent?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most frequent etiology of cough in an adolescent. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about age-specific definitions of cough duration in adolescents. Then, I should verify the leading causes of acute cough and their expected course. Next, I will assess subacute and postinfectious cough. After that, I need to delineate the main etiologies of chronic cough in adolescents, noting where pediatric and adult patterns diverge. Finally, I should consider diagnostic pitfalls, red flags, and guideline-based management anchors that apply to this age group.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Adolescents bridge pediatric and adult paradigms; pediatric guidance typically defines chronic cough as longer than four weeks, whereas adult guidance uses eight weeks, so I need to be explicit about which convention I apply and remain consistent across recommendations [^115ThUt5] [^116TqsqE]. Hold on, I should verify whether adolescent-focused primary care data align better with pediatric cut points; several pediatric-focused reviews adopt the four-week threshold based on URTI natural history in children, which likely fits adolescents in most primary care contexts, though some adult algorithms begin to apply from around age 14, so I will keep both perspectives in mind [^112trKFm] [^115ThUt5].

> Next, I will examine acute cough etiologies in adolescents. Wait, let me verify the dominant cause. Across guideline syntheses and epidemiology, viral upper respiratory tract infections, i.e., the common cold, are consistently the most common cause of acute cough, typically resolving within two weeks to three weeks in most cases, with symptom duration varying by pathogen and host factors [^1137iP5j] [^113opdM8]. I should also note that in outpatient LRTI cohorts, viruses are frequently detected and are associated with slightly shorter cough duration than bacterial detections, again underscoring viral predominance in the acute time window, although mixed detections are common and colored sputum does not prove bacterial infection in isolation [^113opdM8] [^113opdM8]. Let me also consider pediatric frequency data; children have more URTI-associated acute cough episodes per year than adults, with adolescents trending toward lower frequencies than younger children, which still supports viral etiologies as the leading cause for acute cough in this age band [^116pRmnY] [^112trKFm].

> I will now examine important acute and subacute infectious considerations that can masquerade as "just a cold". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; pertussis remains an underrecognized cause of prolonged cough in adolescents, often with paroxysms, post-tussive emesis, and sometimes inspiratory whoop, and the CHEST guideline emphasizes making the clinical diagnosis and initiating therapy without waiting for confirmatory testing when suspicion is high [^112QvZaw]. Let me check the adolescent epidemiology and burden; adolescents and adults are key reservoirs with substantial morbidity, and waning immunity contributes to outbreaks, which is why booster strategies were adopted in several countries [^1138m6W7] [^115u91xF]. But wait, what if we focus on primary care cohorts? In UK school-age children with persistent cough, a substantial proportion had evidence of recent pertussis despite prior vaccination, supporting a high index of suspicion in prolonged cough of weeks' duration, especially with classic features or exposure history [^116DMV9s] [^111UAt65]. I should also remember that typical features in adults have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, so absence of whoop does not exclude the diagnosis, which further justifies early empiric treatment when pretest probability is moderate to high [^112QvZaw] [^111D87Ep].

> Let me consider subacute cough, often in the 3–8 week window. Postinfectious cough is common after URTIs and usually resolves spontaneously, with proposed mechanisms including transient epithelial disruption, mucus hypersecretion, and heightened cough reflex sensitivity; optimal therapy is uncertain and supportive care is reasonable in the absence of red flags [^114iQQJf]. I should double-check whether algorithmic approaches advocate early bronchoprovocation; in subacute cough, many patients improve without specific interventions, and unless asthma is strongly suspected, delaying bronchoprovocation while offering symptomatic care is reasonable, given frequent spontaneous resolution [^116VA4Mz].

> Now, I need to delineate chronic cough causes in adolescents. Initially, I was going to apply the adult triad of upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and GERD as the dominant etiologies. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify how closely adolescents follow adult versus pediatric patterns. Adult-focused evidence and consensus emphasize UACS, asthma, NAEB, and GERD as common causes, but pediatric literature suggests that GERD and postnasal drip are less commonly causal in children and that diagnoses should be guided by pediatric-specific algorithms rather than adult heuristics alone, so I must adjust my weighting accordingly for younger adolescents, while noting that mid-to-late adolescents can phenotypically resemble adults more closely [^116jexAF] [^116VjLoM]. Let me reconsider and integrate current primary care viewpoints; recent family practice guidance continues to emphasize asthma spectrum and upper airway contributors among the most likely causes while also noting pediatric entities such as protracted bacterial bronchitis that are less prominent in adults, reinforcing a blended approach in adolescents [^116q3BMN] [^112WQSuS].

> I will now focus on asthma-spectrum etiologies, including cough-variant asthma and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, which are prominent chronic cough causes in adults and adolescents. I need to ensure management aligns with current guidelines; CHEST 2020 recommends inhaled corticosteroids as first-line therapy for cough-variant asthma and for NAEB, with escalation of ICS dose and addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist if response is incomplete, and in selected cases considering addition of a beta-agonist with ICS, particularly when cough is a manifestation of asthma [^114H9bT1] [^116yzMa2] [^116xJsdq]. Hold on, I should verify whether noninvasive markers guide therapy; induced sputum eosinophils and FeNO can identify eosinophilic inflammation and may predict steroid responsiveness, though evidence of outcome benefit in chronic cough populations is limited, so these tests can be adjunctive rather than obligatory in adolescents when available [^112Fobu6] [^114H9bT1]. I should confirm the caveat that cough alone is not sufficient to diagnose asthma, and if empiric therapy fails, clinicians should reconsider the diagnosis rather than escalating indefinitely, which is particularly important in pediatric populations to avoid overtreatment [^112PvSyT] [^112utxmB].

> Next, I should evaluate upper airway contributions. Let me think about rhinitis and sinus-related symptoms; adult data consistently list upper airway cough syndrome as a leading chronic cough cause, and population data show associations between rhinitis and nocturnal or productive cough, suggesting that in adolescents with allergic rhinitis, an upper airway mechanism may contribute to cough symptoms, even if "postnasal drip" per se is debated in children [^116jexAF] [^1113KQms]. Wait, let me verify the pediatric controversy; pediatric reviews argue that the concept of postnasal drip as a standalone cough cause is poorly defined and likely overapplied, so in younger adolescents, I should anchor management in demonstrable rhinitis control and objective findings rather than attributing cough to "drip" alone without supportive evidence [^117EE8BC].

> I will now consider gastroesophageal reflux. I need to check whether GERD is truly a common cause in this age group; adult guidelines emphasize GERD as a frequent contributor and endorse empiric antireflux therapy in selected profiles, but pediatric CHEST guidance found no benefit of empiric proton pump inhibitors for chronic cough without GI symptoms and highlighted increased adverse events, so in adolescents without reflux symptoms I should avoid blind PPI trials and instead evaluate selectively when clinical features suggest reflux-related cough [^11719PEL] [^112WQSuS]. Hold on, I should verify the silent GERD point; even when reflux cough is present, GI symptoms can be absent, but in children and adolescents, objective testing or clearer phenotypic signals should guide therapy to minimize unnecessary exposure to PPIs [^11719PEL] [^112WQSuS].

> Let me not forget pediatric-predominant bacterial etiologies that can persist into adolescence. Protracted bacterial bronchitis presents with chronic wet cough and typically responds to an antibiotic course; ERS pediatric guidance supports a trial of antibiotics for chronic wet cough when chest radiograph and spirometry are normal and no warning signs are present, with further workup for bronchiectasis if cough recurs or persists despite appropriate therapy [^115L2rn7]. I should confirm imaging indications; for chronic cough beyond eight weeks or persistent symptoms despite initial empiric management, obtaining chest radiography is appropriate, with chest CT considered when red flags or refractory courses suggest structural disease such as bronchiectasis [^116axL4A] [^116cgviq].

> Next, I should review exposures and medications. I need to check for ACE inhibitor use, vaping, smoke exposure, and environmental or occupational irritants that can perpetuate cough; despite guideline recommendations, detailed exposure assessments are often omitted in practice, yet they can be critical in adolescents who may have new exposures such as vaping or workplace irritants in part-time jobs [^1162Y6wy] [^112WfB2x]. Hold on, I should verify that addressing triggers is standard; all major frameworks emphasize removing cough-evoking irritants like tobacco smoke as part of foundational management, which applies across age groups including adolescents [^115ThUt5].

> If cough persists despite targeted treatment, I need to consider cough hypersensitivity and refractory phenotypes. Let me consider neuromodulator evidence; ERS 2020 suggests gabapentin or pregabalin trials for adults with chronic refractory cough, reflecting a cough hypersensitivity model, but in adolescents I should be cautious and typically reserve such approaches to specialist settings given limited pediatric data and the need to exhaust treatable traits first [^1136XdHs] [^111iNfDa]. I should confirm that adult-specific opioid trials are not standard for adolescents; low-dose morphine is recommended by ERS for adults with refractory cough, but this does not translate to pediatric or adolescent primary care and would require specialist oversight if considered at all [^114P88QZ].

> Finally, I will consider functional cough diagnoses after excluding organic disease. Somatic or tic cough should be diagnosed only after comprehensive negative evaluation, looking for core tic features such as suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and a premonitory sensation; management is primarily nonpharmacologic and benefits from behavioral strategies, which is important to recognize to avoid unnecessary medications and procedures [^114SFKZ6] [^113A7V65]. I should double-check that this is not conflated with psychogenic asthma; the literature emphasizes the risk of mislabeling and overtreatment if cough alone is used to drive asthma therapy despite lack of objective support [^112PvSyT].

> In summary, when I synthesize adolescent cough etiologies by duration, acute cough is most often viral URTI with expected resolution in two to three weeks, with vigilance for pertussis in prolonged or classic presentations, especially during outbreaks or known exposures [^1137iP5j] [^113opdM8] [^112QvZaw]. Subacute cough commonly represents postinfectious cough and may remit spontaneously, though emerging asthma should remain on the radar when features suggest bronchial hyperresponsiveness [^114iQQJf] [^116VA4Mz]. For chronic cough beyond four to eight weeks, I should prioritize asthma-spectrum causes including cough-variant asthma and NAEB, manage allergic rhinitis and upper airway contributors with evidence-based therapy, approach GERD cautiously without empiric PPIs in the absence of GI symptoms, consider protracted bacterial bronchitis in chronic wet cough with normal imaging and spirometry, and always reassess exposures and red flags to guide imaging and referral when indicated [^114rNFWC] [^116xJsdq] [^117EE8BC] [^115L2rn7] [^116axL4A] [^116cgviq].

---

The most common cause of cough in adolescents is **upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs)** — such as the common cold and acute bronchitis — which account for most acute cough episodes [^1137iP5j] [^112rYbW8]. For chronic cough (> 8 weeks), the leading causes are **asthma (including cough-variant asthma)** [^112f21xq], **upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)** [^116jexAF], and **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** [^115ThUt5]. Pertussis should be considered in persistent cough, especially if paroxysmal or accompanied by post-tussive vomiting [^112QvZaw] [^116DMV9s]. Evaluation should be guided by cough duration, associated symptoms, and response to empiric therapy [^115GsoSY]; chest radiography and spirometry are appropriate initial tests for chronic cough.

---

## Acute cough (≤ 3 weeks)

Acute cough in adolescents is most commonly caused by **URTIs**, including the common cold and acute bronchitis [^1137iP5j]. These infections are typically self-limited and resolve within a few weeks [^114DPzUa].

- **URTIs**: The most frequent cause of acute cough in adolescents, accounting for approximately 62.4% of cases [^112rYbW8].

- **Acute bronchitis**: Another common cause, accounting for approximately 33.3% of acute cough cases [^1137iP5j] [^112rYbW8].

- **Pertussis**: Although less common, pertussis (whooping cough) is an important consideration, particularly in adolescents with prolonged or paroxysmal cough [^111UAt65] [^112QvZaw].

---

## Subacute cough (3–8 weeks)

Subacute cough in adolescents is often due to **post-infectious inflammation** following a recent URTI or bronchitis [^114iQQJf]; **post-infectious cough** accounts for approximately 27.7% of cases [^112rYbW8]. **Pertussis** also remains a significant cause, responsible for approximately 37.2% of subacute cough cases in adolescents and typically presenting with prolonged paroxysmal cough [^112rYbW8] [^116DMV9s].

---

## Chronic cough (> 8 weeks)

Chronic cough in adolescents is defined as cough lasting longer than eight weeks. The most common causes in this age group include **asthma**, **upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)**, and **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** [^116jexAF].

---

### Asthma

Asthma, including cough-variant asthma, is a leading cause of **chronic cough in adolescents**. Asthma-related cough is typically associated with airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.

- **Prevalence**: Asthma accounts for approximately 50.4% of chronic cough cases in adolescents [^112rYbW8] [^114H9bT1].

- **Clinical features**: Cough-variant asthma presents primarily with chronic cough, often without wheezing or dyspnea [^1171qkfh] [^112utxmB].

- **Management**: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as first-line therapy for asthma-related chronic cough [^112f21xq] [^114rNFWC].

---

### Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)

UACS, previously referred to as **postnasal drip syndrome**, is another common cause of chronic cough in adolescents, often associated with allergic rhinitis or sinusitis [^116jexAF]. Typical features include chronic cough with nasal congestion, throat clearing, and postnasal drip. Management includes antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids, along with treatment of underlying allergic rhinitis or sinusitis [^115ThUt5].

---

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

GERD is a common cause of **chronic cough in adolescents** — often presenting without classic gastrointestinal symptoms — and accounts for approximately 2.3% of cases. Clinical features may include chronic cough with heartburn or regurgitation, although these may be absent [^11719PEL]. Empiric treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and lifestyle modifications is recommended [^115ThUt5].

---

## Less common causes of cough in adolescents

While the above conditions account for the majority of cough cases in adolescents, other **less common causes** should be considered, particularly in chronic or refractory cases:

- **Pertussis**: Persistent cough with paroxysmal episodes and post-tussive vomiting [^111UAt65] [^111D87Ep].

- **Habit cough**: Psychogenic or tic cough, characterized by a loud, honking cough [^113A7V65] [^114SFKZ6].

- **Environmental exposures**: Tobacco smoke, pollutants, and occupational exposures [^112WfB2x].

- **Chronic bronchitis**: Associated with smoking or environmental exposures [^112HFeGf].

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic productive cough, often associated with recurrent infections [^1121d4mj].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Evaluation of cough in adolescents should be guided by symptom duration, associated clinical features, and response to initial empiric therapy [^115GsoSY]. For chronic cough, initial tests include **chest radiography and spirometry**.

---

## Conclusion

The most common cause of cough in adolescents is **upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs)**, including the common cold and acute bronchitis [^1137iP5j]. For chronic cough, **asthma**, **upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)**, and **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** are the most frequent etiologies [^116jexAF]. A thorough clinical evaluation — including **history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing** — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^116q3BMN].

### Overview of common causes of chronic cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116jexAF]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the literature on the most common causes of chronic cough.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE was searched through May 2004 for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "causes of cough", and "etiology of cough". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected for review. Additionally, any pertinent references from these studies were obtained.

- **Results**: Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) due to a variety of rhinosinus conditions, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are the most common causes of chronic cough. Each of these diagnoses may be present alone or in combination and may be clinically silent apart from the cough itself.

- **Conclusion**: In the absence of evidence for the presence of another disorder, an approach focused on detecting the presence of UACS, asthma, NAEB, or GERD, alone or in combination, is likely to have a far higher yield than routinely searching for relatively uncommon or obscure diagnoses.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112f21xq]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

When managing specific circumstances for chronic cough, particularly in patients with asthma, the ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) as first-line therapy. This applies to both adult and adolescent patients who experience chronic cough as a unique symptom, also known as cough variant asthma.

### Cough and the common cold: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1137iP5j]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review the literature on cough and the common cold, a comprehensive MEDLINE search was conducted through May 2004. This search focused on studies published in English since 1980, specifically on human subjects, using the medical subject headings "cough" and "common cold". Selected case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were reviewed, along with additional relevant references from these studies.

Results indicate that, based on extrapolation from epidemiologic data, the common cold is believed to be the single most common cause of acute cough. The most likely mechanism for this is direct irritation of upper airway structures. There is evidence that viral infections of the upper respiratory tract, which produce the common cold syndrome, frequently result in rhinosinusitis. In cases of colds, abnormalities on sinus roentgenograms or CT scans are often due to viral infection and are not diagnostic of bacterial sinus infection.

Cough due to the common cold is likely the most common cause of acute cough. A significant subset of patients with "postinfectious" cough likely experience an inflammatory response triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection, such as the common cold. This leads to a subacute or chronic cough, considered to be caused by an upper airway cough syndrome, previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome. This condition can self-perpetuate unless actively treated.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^112rYbW8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

For evidence-based decision-making, primary care physicians need specific and reliable information on the pre-test probabilities of underlying diseases and a symptom's course. We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies in primary care, addressing three research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care physicians? (2) What are the underlying aetiologies of cough and their respective frequencies? (3) What is the prognosis of children with cough?

- **Methods**: Following a pre-defined algorithm and independent double reviewer ratings, we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. All quantitative original research articles in English, French, or German were included if they focused on unselected study populations of children consulting a primary care physician for cough. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis in subgroups, if justifiable in terms of heterogeneity.

- **Results**: We identified 14 eligible studies on prevalence, five on aetiology, and one on prognosis. Prevalence estimates varied between 4.7% and 23.3% of all reasons for an encounter, or up to estimates of 60% when related to patients or consultations. Cough in children is more frequent than in adults, with the lowest prevalences in adolescents and in summer. Acute cough is mostly caused by upper respiratory tract infections (62.4%) and bronchitis (33.3%); subacute or chronic cough by respiratory tract infection (27.7%), asthma (up to 50.4% in cough persisting more than three weeks), and pertussis (37.2%).

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^115GsoSY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with chronic cough (i.e. of more than eight weeks' duration) should include a focused history and physical examination, and in most patients, chest radiography. Patients who are taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should switch to a medication from another drug class. The most common causes of chronic cough in adults are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, alone or in combination.

- **Upper airway cough syndrome**: If suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted.
- **Asthma diagnosis**: Should be confirmed based on clinical response to empiric therapy with inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids.
- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease**: Empiric treatment should be initiated in lieu of testing for patients with chronic cough and reflux symptoms.

Patients should avoid exposure to cough-evoking irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography, and referral to a pulmonologist may be indicated if the cause of chronic cough is not identified. In children, a cough lasting longer than four weeks is considered chronic. The most common causes in children are respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Evaluation of children with chronic cough should include chest radiography and spirometry.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

- **Methods**: The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the key clinical question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

- **Results**: In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only four clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and post-tussive vomiting had low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]).

### The relationship between psychogenic cough and the diagnosis and misdiagnosis of asthma: a review [^112PvSyT]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnoses of persistent nonproductive cough include numerous pulmonary and nonpulmonary organic disorders, as well as functional illnesses. Many diseases can cause cough, and several studies have shown asthma to be among the most common etiologies associated with chronic cough in adult nonsmokers, as well as in children. The relationship between psychogenic cough and asthma, along with other asthma-like illnesses, is complex since distinct maladies with similar features may coexist individually or in combination in any given patient.

While chronic cough may occur as a sole presenting manifestation of bronchial asthma in all age groups, recent findings suggest that most children with persistent cough without other respiratory symptoms do not have asthma. Since several organic, as well as functional diseases, may present with persistent cough as their sole manifestation in either adults or children, cough should not be used as a single or major determinant to diagnose and treat asthma, especially when empirically focused therapy trials fail. Given the range of illnesses causing cough, no single management guideline can be expected to be universally effective.

### Guidelines for evaluating chronic cough in pediatrics: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116TqsqE]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review relevant literature and present evidence-based guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough, the following methodology was employed. The Cochrane, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, along with review articles and reference lists of relevant articles, were searched and reviewed by a single author. The last comprehensive search date was December 5, 2003, and for the Cochrane database, it was November 7, 2004. Additional articles were identified through the authors' own databases and expertise.

Pediatric chronic cough, defined as cough in children aged 4 weeks, was examined. This time frame was chosen based on the natural history of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in children and differs from the definition of chronic cough in adults. In this guideline, only chronic cough will be discussed. Chronic cough is subdivided into specific cough, which is associated with other symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated or underlying problem, and nonspecific cough, which is a dry cough without an identifiable respiratory disease of known etiology. The majority of this section focuses on nonspecific cough, as specific cough encompasses the entire spectrum of pediatric pulmonology.

A review of the literature revealed few randomized controlled trials for the treatment of nonspecific cough. Management guidelines are summarized in two pathways. Recommendations are derived from a systematic review of the literature and were integrated with expert opinion. They are intended as general guidelines only.

### The approach to pediatric cough [^116NLqy5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

To provide an overview of pediatric cough, with specific emphasis on various causes, aiding in diagnosis and treatment.

- **Data sources**: Relevant articles and references published between January 1, 1961, and May 1, 2009, were found through a PubMed search using the following keywords: pediatric cough and cough in children.

- **Study selection**: All key relevant articles and textbook sections were reviewed, and the most relevant were selected for inclusion in this review.

- **Results**: Although asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and postnasal drip can be causes of cough in children, it is important to consider other potential causes, such as bronchitis, postviral cough, and foreign-body inhalation. Testing and treatment for cough will vary depending on the presentation and diagnosis. Just as in adults, the cause of cough in children can be multifactorial.

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric cough is commonly encountered by primary care physicians and allergists. Physicians should be aware of the various potential causes of cough in children to properly determine the cause so that testing and treatment can proceed appropriately.

### Whooping cough: The current scene [^115u91xF]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Pertussis, a highly contagious disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, is making a comeback globally despite good immunization coverage. Developed countries have also shown a shift in the epidemiology of the disease to the adolescent and adult age groups, leading to a revision of their vaccination policies. The disease epidemiology in the South East Asian region seems poised for a similar change, as outbreaks have been reported among children and adults in countries such as Afghanistan, Israel, and Taipei.

This anticipation and early recognition of changes in epidemiology are crucial because affected adolescents and adults act as reservoirs of the disease for the vulnerable infant population, for whom pertussis can be life-threatening. The clinical presentation can be atypical in adolescents, leading to frequent misdiagnoses. Diagnostic advancements, such as polymerase chain reaction and serology, now allow the disease to be diagnosed later in its course when culture results are often negative.

The introduction of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease, but it fell into disrepute due to rare serious neurological side effects, leading to the development of the acellular pertussis vaccine. This new vaccine led to fewer adverse reactions and proved safe and effective as a booster for adolescents. However, its cost may be prohibitive for widespread use in developing nations in the South East Asian region.

### Acute and chronic cough [^116VjLoM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a normal protective mechanism that occurs many times every day. Cough associated with a viral infection lasts up to 2 weeks in 70–80% of children. Cough persisting for more than 4 weeks may be attributed to a recognized specific cause or may be non-specific and considered protracted bronchitis. Chronic cough in children differs from that in adults and is rarely a result of gastroesophageal reflux, postnasal drip, or asthma. Treatment is focused on addressing the specific cause, and symptomatic treatment is rarely needed or effective.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^114DPzUa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We know from secondary care studies that acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection (RTI) lasts about 5.18 days (follow-up 6 days) in children. In the primary care setting, acute cough seems to resolve in half of children within one week, and in 10–20% of children by three weeks. The methodological quality of these studies is low. Terms like "acute cough", "acute bronchitis", or "chest infection" are often used simultaneously for different signs and symptoms. To improve evidence regarding a wait-and-see strategy or observation phase, authors advocate for more prognostic studies in primary care based on symptoms, with a sufficiently long follow-up period and an unselected patient population.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^114dutDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies. Based on the PRISMA statement and the recommendation of Donner-Banzhoff et al, methods were pre-specified in a protocol. Our working group applied the same methods to abdominal pain, tiredness, chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnoea.

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE in June 2012, updated our search in 2019, and EMBASE in January 2015, updating again in 2020. The reference lists of all relevant papers were screened using a snowball search. Our search was limited to publications in English, French, and German. The search syntax included the term "cough" in various wordings in the title/abstract or as a MeSH Term, and the term "primary care" in different wordings in the title/abstract, mailing address, author's institute name, as a MeSH Term, or in journals representing primary care research. This search included general practice/family medicine and pediatric primary care. For the full search syntax, see Additional File 2.

- **Study selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria**: We initially screened titles and abstracts according to (1) original research articles, (2) primary care as the study setting, and (3) "cough" as the reason for encounter, whether primary or secondary. Full-text publications were assessed for our inclusion criteria, plus (4) an unselected study population regarding the likelihood of the underlying aetiology and (5) availability of data on incidence, prevalence, underlying diagnoses, or prognosis of cough.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114AR4Ko]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In relation to asthma, particularly concerning patients with chronic cough, the ACCP 2020 guidelines suggest considering an increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Additionally, they recommend administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reevaluating alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients. This approach is advised if the response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if the cough remains the sole symptom in patients experiencing cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFLÙ in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): A pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116pRmnY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Coughing and irritation of the mucosa are mainly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. In young children, respiratory tract infections are extremely common and frequently recurrent. Pathogens often colonize the upper respiratory tract (nose or mouth) before causing lower respiratory infections or invasive diseases. The oral mucosa and epithelium play a protective role against the entry of microorganisms into the body. This mucosa is the main target tissue of microorganisms, such as viruses. Normally, primary infection results in viral replication at mucosal surfaces.

Upper respiratory tract infection is very frequent. Adult subjects experience 2 to 5 episodes per year, whereas schoolchildren suffer 7 to 10 episodes per year, coughing up 140 days per year. Children are almost 4 times more likely to experience upper respiratory infection-associated acute coughs than adults. In this context, coughing is the most common symptom of many inflammatory diseases.

Coughing is a physiological response to airway irritation. It has two main functions: (1) to prevent the entry of food and fluids into the lower airways and (2) to favor the removal of material that exceeds the transport capacity of the mucociliary system. Coughing can be initiated by pharyngeal stimulation or mucosal dehydration. A cough may be classified according to its duration and characteristics. It is considered to be occasional when it lasts less than 3 days. Persistent coughs that last more than 7 days are usually treated with medicinal products.

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^116q3BMN]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic cough, specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating and managing adult patients with chronic cough based on the most common causes, including upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, GERD, and laryngopharyngeal reflux.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Whooping cough in adults: An update on a reemerging infection [^111D87Ep]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, which is commonly thought of as a pediatric illness, is an underappreciated adult pathogen. Recent outbreaks highlight the significance of pertussis in adults and the risk of transmission to at-risk infants who are most susceptible to complications, including death. This article describes the recent epidemiologic shifts and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pertussis. New vaccination recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in response to recent outbreaks and infant deaths are highlighted.

### Cough and asthma [^112utxmB]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between cough and asthma is complex. Epidemiological studies suggest that most children with a recurrent cough who do not wheeze do not have asthma. These children are commonly described as having a non-specific cough that appears to be due to increased cough receptor sensitivity during the coughing episode. Children with asthma who cough have also been shown to have increased cough receptor sensitivity during an acute exacerbation.

- **Cough severity**: It does not generally correlate with asthma severity. Apart from wheeze and dyspnoea, there are no clear distinguishing features to separate asthma from a non-specific cough.

At the time of writing, no specific treatment has been clearly shown to benefit children with a non-specific cough. Although a trial of asthma treatment may be justified in these children, it is preferable to cease rather than escalate treatment if there is no response. In children with asthma who cough, cough should not be used as the predominant symptom to direct asthma therapy.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^1111Lvas]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Cough is a frequent reason for encounters for both children and adults in ambulatory care, often causing serious concern to parents. When prolonged, cough impairs daily activities or sleep and affects the quality of life of both children and caregivers. As a result, 30 to 40% of children with a cough consult a physician.

General practitioners (GPs), family physicians, or pediatricians triage self-limiting, prolonged, and potentially life-threatening conditions. In this context, assumed or research-based pre-test probabilities and prognosis guide GPs' decision-making and actions.

Guideline recommendations are mainly based on secondary or tertiary care studies, which may not align with the situation in primary care. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review, focusing on the following research questions:

- **Prevalence of cough in children**: What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care practices, or how often do children in general practice or pediatric practices consult for cough?
- **Underlying diagnoses**: What are the underlying diagnoses and their respective frequencies?
- **Prognosis**: What is the usual course of disease or prognosis for these children?

### Evaluation of occupational and environmental factors in the assessment of chronic cough in adults: A systematic review [^1162Y6wy]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Several recent cough guidelines have advised consideration of occupational or environmental causes for chronic cough, but it is unclear how frequently this recommendation has been routinely applied. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review to address this aspect.

- **Methods**: Cough guidelines and protocols were reviewed to identify recommendations for assessment of occupational and environmental aspects of chronic cough. The systematic search previously used to identify intervention fidelity to the use of protocols for diagnosis and management of chronic cough in adults was used for this review after extension to June 2015. PubMed, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library were searched using the same search terms and inclusion criteria as previously. Papers that met our criteria were then reviewed to identify methods used to assess occupational and environmental aspects of chronic cough and the outcomes of these assessments.

- **Results**: Among the 10 general chronic cough guidelines and protocols identified, only the three published since 2006 included details advising detailed occupational and environmental assessments. One additional cough statement focused entirely on occupational cough. Of the 28 cohort studies of patients with chronic cough that specifically noted that they followed guidelines or protocols, none provided details of occupational and environmental assessments.

- **Conclusions**: Despite published recommendations, it is not apparent that occupational and environmental causes for chronic cough are addressed in detail during assessments of patients with chronic cough.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute and chronic cough in adults [^113WHqoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Persistent cough is a common clinical problem. Despite thorough investigation and empirical management, a considerable proportion of people with subacute and chronic cough have an unexplained cough, for which treatment options are limited. While guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the research evidence for this intervention is conflicting.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of ICS for subacute and chronic cough in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov in December 2012 and conducted hand searches.

- **Selection criteria**: Two authors independently assessed all potentially relevant trials. All published and unpublished randomized comparisons of ICS versus placebo in adults with subacute or chronic cough were included. Participants with known chronic respiratory disease and asthma were excluded. Studies of cough-variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis were eligible.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data pertaining to predefined outcomes. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical cure or significant improvement (over 70% reduction in cough severity measure) at follow-up (clinical success). The secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure at follow-up, mean change in cough severity measures, complications of cough, biomarkers of inflammation, and adverse effects.

### Trajectories of cough without a cold in early childhood and associations with atopic diseases [^112rrQQ9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

Although children can frequently experience a cough that affects their quality of life, few epidemiological studies have explored cough without a cold during childhood.

- **Objectives**: The objective of the study was to describe the latent class trajectories of cough from ages one to ten years old and analyze their association with wheezing, atopy, and allergic diseases.

- **Methods**: Questions about cough, wheeze, and allergic diseases were asked at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 years of age in the European prospective cohort of Protection against Allergy: Study in Rural Environment (PASTURE). Specific IgE assays were performed at 10 years of age. Questions regarding a cough without a cold were used to build a latent class model of cough over time.

- **Results**: Among the 961 children included in the study, apart from the never/infrequent trajectory (59.9%), eight trajectories of cough without a cold were identified: five grouped acute transient classes (24.1%), moderate transient (6.8%), late persistent (4.8%), and early persistent (4.4%). Compared with the never/infrequent trajectory, the other trajectories were significantly associated with wheezing, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. For asthma, the strongest association was with the early persistent trajectory (OR a = 31.00 [14.03–68.51]), which was inversely associated with farm environment (OR a = 0.39 [0.19–0.77]) and had a high prevalence of cough triggers and unremitting wheeze. Late and early persistent trajectories were also associated with food allergy. Atopic sensitization was only associated with the late persistent trajectory.

### Taming chronic cough [^111WXFgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the available evidence on treating chronic cough to relay a thoughtful, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using the following keywords: cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, rhinitis (allergic, seasonal), postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, lung disease (interstitial), bronchiectasis, and bronchoscopy.

- **Study selection**: Studies were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. Due to a lack of randomized prospective studies, nonrandomized and retrospective studies were considered, with their strengths and limitations noted.

- **Results**: Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. Several prospective noncontrolled trials for adults with chronic cough found a high percentage of cough resolution when using an approach that focused on the diagnosis and treatment of the most common causes: asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough syndrome. Preliminary studies in children support an approach that distinguishes between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigation of any specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness.

- **Conclusion**: Allergists, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway disorders, are uniquely poised to diagnose and treat chronic cough.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^11719PEL]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to critically review and summarize the literature on cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and to make evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough due to GERD.

The design/methodology involved an Ovid MEDLINE literature review (through March 2004) for all studies published in the English language and selected articles published in other languages such as French since 1963, using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "gastroesophageal reflux", and "gastroesophageal reflux disease".

The results indicate that GERD, either alone or in combination with other conditions, is one of the most common causes of chronic cough. In patients with normal chest radiographic findings, GERD most likely causes cough by stimulation of an esophageal-bronchial reflex. When GERD causes cough, there may be no gastrointestinal symptoms up to 75% of the time. While 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is the most sensitive and specific test in linking GERD and cough in a cause-effect relationship, it has its limitations. Furthermore, there is no general agreement on how to best interpret the test, and it cannot detect non-acid reflux events. Therefore, when patients fit the clinical profile that has a high likelihood of predicting that GERD is the cause of cough, antireflux medical therapy should be empirically instituted. While some patients improve with minimal medical therapy, others require more intensive regimens. When empiric treatment fails, GERD cannot be ruled out conclusively as a cause of chronic cough. An objective investigation for GERD is then recommended.

### Whooping cough in school age children presenting with persistent cough in UK primary care after introduction of the preschool pertussis booster vaccination: prospective cohort study [^116DMV9s]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases, causing nearly 300,000 deaths a year in children worldwide. An accelerated schedule of primary pertussis vaccinations at 2, 3, and 4 months was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1990, and primary vaccine coverage has been more than 90% since 1992. However, immunity following vaccination is reported to last for only four to 12 years, and immunity after infection lasts for seven to 20 years. Pertussis in adolescents is recognized as a source of considerable socioeconomic burden. In the United States, pertussis was associated with a mean medical cost of $242 (£144; €177) and caused absence from school in 83% of adolescents for a mean of 5.5 days over a two-year period.

Between 2001 and 2005, evidence of recent pertussis infection was reported in 37% of UK school-age children presenting with persistent cough in primary care. A preschool pertussis booster vaccination was introduced in the UK in October 2001. UK recommendations are that children should receive a preschool pertussis booster vaccination containing a three-component (Infanrix-IPV) or five-component (Repevax) acellular pertussis vaccine three years after completion of the primary vaccination course or soon afterward. Compared with children who receive only a three-dose course of primary vaccinations, the risk of pertussis is approximately halved in children who also receive the preschool pertussis booster vaccination (vaccine effectiveness 46%, 95% confidence interval –7% to 71%).

### Prevalence of chronic cough in China: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139wVQt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of chronic cough in China is 7.11% (6.22% in adults and 7.67% in children), suggesting that more than 90 million individuals in China are suffering from this condition (Additional file 6: Fig. S24). Chronic cough continues to be a major public health issue in China and worldwide, and should not be ignored. Although a meta-analysis reported a global prevalence of chronic cough of 9.6% (95% CI 7.6–11.7%), this previous study did not analyze the prevalence in China separately. Considering the role of host-environment interactions in coughing, we believed that the prevalence of chronic cough in China might be different from the global prevalence. Therefore, data on global prevalence might be of limited value for the management of chronic cough in China.

### Does post-nasal drip cause cough in childhood [^117EE8BC]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The proposition that post-nasal drip (PND) is a common cause of cough in childhood is controversial. The concept of PND as a common cause of cough is derived primarily from the adult literature. The definition of what constitutes PND is variable, and it is unclear whether it is a symptom, a sign, or both. Examination of the specificity of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of PND syndrome further confuses the issue. A definitive diagnosis of cough induced by PND cannot be made from history and physical examination alone. The concept is inconsistent both with the meaning of the word "drip" and the science of rheology. The most plausible explanation for the occurrence of cough in children identified with increased post-nasal secretions is that both reflect co-existent airways pathologies. In considering causes of chronic cough in childhood, it is now time to abandon the concept of PND and the associated PND syndrome.

### Chronic cough and OSA: A new association [^111C5pDi]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting more than two months. Common causes for chronic cough in nonsmokers with normal chest radiographs and pulmonary functions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cough-variant asthma (CVA), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). Guidelines recommend diagnosing the etiology of chronic cough based upon the results of therapy for suspected GERD, CVA, and UACS. Despite following recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, the cause for a significant proportion of chronic cough remains unexplained. Recent reports indicate the resolution of chronic cough following treatment of concomitantly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Whether this represents a co-occurrence of two commonly prevalent disorders or a pathophysiological relationship between OSA and cough remains unknown.

This review offers insights into a pathophysiological link between OSA and the commonly purported etiologies for cough, namely, GERD, UACS, and CVA. In addition, evidence for a relationship between airway inflammation that can trigger or perpetuate cough and OSA is discussed. This review explores mechanisms by which nocturnal continuous positive airway therapy resolves cough by improving underlying airway inflammation secondary to OSA and impacts upon GERD, CVA, and UACS.

### Cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough [^111iNfDa]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is globally prevalent across all age groups. This disorder is challenging to treat because many pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can present with chronic cough, and cough can also be present without any identifiable underlying cause or be refractory to therapies that improve associated conditions. Most patients with chronic cough have cough hypersensitivity, which is characterized by increased neural responsivity to a range of stimuli that affect the airways and lungs, and other tissues innervated by common nerve supplies.

Cough hypersensitivity presents as excessive coughing, often in response to relatively innocuous stimuli, causing significant psychophysical morbidity and affecting patients' quality of life. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing in different patient populations and across the lifespan is advancing and has contributed to the development of new therapies for chronic cough in adults. Owing to differences in the pathology, the organs involved, and individual patient factors, treatment of chronic cough is progressing towards a personalized approach. In the future, novel ways to endotype patients with cough may prove valuable in management.

### Cough [^117H4Xxr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires careful evaluation and distinct management from that of adults because the etiological factors and treatments for children differ significantly from those for adults. For all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be identified, and interventions for cessation should be advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Determinants of cough in young adults participating in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey [^1113KQms]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Cough is a common symptom affecting a large proportion of the general population. This investigation aimed to identify determinants of nocturnal, nonproductive, and productive cough in population samples from different countries. In a cross-sectional international population survey, 18,277 subjects (ages 20–48) from 16 countries answered an interview-led questionnaire. Total and specific immunoglobulin-E levels were measured, and spirometry was performed. Three types of cough were defined: nocturnal, nonproductive, and productive cough. The relation of independent variables to cough was estimated using logistic regression for each center or country and combined across centers or countries by random-effects meta-analysis. The median prevalence of nocturnal, nonproductive, and productive cough in the different centers was 30.7%, 10.2%, and 10.2%, respectively.

- **Gender and cough types**: Nocturnal and nonproductive cough were related to female sex, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 2.08 and 1.27, respectively.

- **Rhinitis and cough types**: Nocturnal and productive cough were related to rhinitis, with ORs of 1.46 and 1.61, respectively.

All three types of cough were associated with asthma, tobacco smoking, environmental tobacco smoke, and obesity. Females are more likely to report nocturnal and nonproductive cough than males. Cough was related to treatable disorders, like asthma and rhinitis, as well as avoidable factors, such as tobacco smoking and environmental tobacco smoke.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^111oDZc6]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

For each publication, we extracted bibliographic information, including author, publication year, title, and journal, as well as country, inclusion/exclusion criteria, definition of cough, characteristics of physicians and practices, type of recruitment, information on study population (sample size, age, gender distribution), and study duration.

For prevalence/incidence data, we extracted the number of cough cases and the number and type of the reference study sample. For aetiology, we registered all diagnostic categories with their relative and absolute frequencies and extracted any prognostic data. We analyzed all available publications of each study and, in cases of doubt, contacted the authors personally (n = 7).

- **Assessment of methodical quality and risk of bias**: Our working group developed a literature-based tool for evaluating risk of bias and clinical heterogeneity in symptom studies. A validation study is still ongoing. Two reviewers (KH, MB) independently assessed 16 items in four key domains (see Additional File 3) and rated the risk of bias in patient selection, data collection/patient flow, and diagnostic and prognostic work-up. The risk of substantial variation/clinical heterogeneity was judged.

- **Statistics**: The proportions of prevalence/incidence and underlying aetiologies plus 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Study outcomes vary in nominators and denominators of the frequency measure. For example, some studies counted consultations for cough in relation to all consultations, while others referred to reasons for encounters or all patients consulting a physician with cough as a symptom.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with somatic or tic cough (diagnosis), the ACCP 2015 guidelines recommend diagnosing tic cough disorder in adult and pediatric patients with chronic cough that has remained medically unexplained following a comprehensive evaluation when the patient manifests the core clinical features of tics. These features include suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and the presence of a premonitory sensation, whether the cough is single or one of many.

### Health burden of pertussis in adolescents and adults [^1138m6W7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Pertussis in adolescents and adults is common, endemic, and epidemic worldwide, and its incidence is reportedly increasing. Although some individuals suffer only a mild cough, many others experience symptoms typical of pertussis, causing prolonged cough illness, frequent use of health care resources, missed work, and a variety of complications.

Symptoms experienced by adolescents and adults include sleep disturbance, weight loss, pharyngeal discomfort, influenza-like symptoms, sneezing attacks, hoarseness, sinus pain, headaches, and sweating attacks. Even when symptoms are typical of pertussis, the diagnosis is often not considered in adolescents and adults due to low awareness of the disease in these age groups.

Contrary to common perceptions, complications of pertussis, including some serious ones, are not infrequent in adolescents and adults. These include urinary incontinence, rib fracture, pneumothorax, inguinal hernia, aspiration, pneumonia, seizures, and otitis media. Despite underreporting, hospitalization of adults and adolescents does occur.

Many believe that adolescents and adults are the groups most commonly infected with pertussis and are now the major source of contagion to infants and young children. Due to the considerable health burden, there is a need for improved vaccination strategies to prevent disease in adolescents and adults and to reduce the risk of transmission to vulnerable infants.

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^115ThUt5]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic cough:

- **Definition**: Chronic cough is defined as a cough symptom that persists for longer than eight weeks.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of cough include upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

- **Disease course**: Cough persistence may lead to symptoms such as vomiting, muscle pain, urinary incontinence, tiredness, syncope, and depression.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic cough is not associated with an increase in mortality in the absence of a serious underlying disease.

### Risk factors for chronic cough among 14,669 individuals from the general population [^1121d4mj]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Risk factors for chronic cough in the general population have not been described systematically. We identified and ranked chronic cough risk factors at the individual and community levels using data from 14,669 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study.

- **Methods**: Severity of chronic cough was assessed using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). We ranked chronic cough risk factors based on the magnitude of age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) at the individual level and the population attributable risks (PARs) at the community level.

- **Results**: The prevalence of chronic cough in the general population was 4% overall, 3% in never smokers, 4% in former smokers, and 8% in smokers. The median score of the LCQ was 5.8 (25th-75th percentile, 5.0–6.3) for the physical domain, 5.6 (25th-75th percentile, 4.6–6.3) for the psychological domain, 6.3 (25th-75th percentile, 5.5–6.8) for the social domain, and 17.3 (25th-75th percentile, 15.4–18.9) in total.

	- At the individual level, the age-adjusted ORs for the three top-ranked risk factors were 5.0 (95% CI, 1.4–18) for bronchiectasis, 2.6 (95% CI, 1.7–3.9) for asthma, and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5–3.4) for gastroesophageal reflux disease in never smokers, 7.1 (95% CI, 2.6–20) for bronchiectasis, 3.1 (95% CI, 2.2–4.4) for asthma, and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5–3.2) for occupational exposure to dust/fumes in former smokers, and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3–2.9) for airflow limitation in smokers.

	- At the community level, the three top-ranked risk factors were female sex (PAR, 19%), asthma (PAR, 10%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (PAR, 8%) in never smokers.

### Children with chronic cough: When is watchful waiting appropriate? Development of likelihood ratios for assessing children with chronic cough [^113dYv4e]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is associated with poor quality of life and may signify a serious underlying disease. Differentiating nonspecific cough (when watchful waiting can be safely undertaken) from specific cough (when treatment and further investigations are beneficial) would be clinically useful. In 326 children, the study aimed to determine how well cough pointers, used in guidelines, differentiate specific from nonspecific cough, and describe the clinical profile of children whose cough resolved without medications (spontaneous resolution).

- **Methods**: A dataset from a multicenter study involving children newly referred for chronic cough (median duration, 3–4 months) was utilized. It determined the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of cough pointers — symptoms, signs, and simple investigations (chest radiography, spirometry) — as recommended in guidelines.

- **Results**: The pretest probability of specific cough was 88%. The absence of false-positive results indicated that most pointers had strongly positive LRs. The most sensitive pointer (wet cough) showed a positive LR of 26.2 (95% CI, 3.8–181.5). Though the absence of other individual pointers did not change the pretest probability significantly (negative LR close to 1), the absence of all pointers had a strongly negative LR of 0 (95% CI, 0–0.03). Children in the group whose cough resolved spontaneously were significantly more likely to be older, non-Indigenous, have a dry cough, and a normal chest radiograph.

- **Conclusions**: Children with chronic dry cough without any cough pointers can be safely managed using a watchful waiting strategy, ensuring care and observation without immediate medical intervention.

### Causes and clinical features of subacute cough [^116VA4Mz]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Cough lasting more than three weeks has traditionally been defined as a chronic cough. However, it may be more effective to categorize cough into two distinct stages: subacute, lasting three to eight weeks, and chronic, lasting more than eight weeks. We conducted a study to evaluate the causes and clinical courses of subacute cough, as well as the value of the bronchoprovocation test and induced sputum examination (IS).

- **Methods**: Nonsmoking patients with a cough lasting three to eight weeks were enrolled in the study. Patients displaying dyspnea, a basal FEV1 of less than 70% predicted, or abnormal findings on a standard chest radiograph or physical exam were excluded. An antihistamine-decongestant was prescribed for patients suspected to have postinfectious cough or postnasal drip. For those with positive results on a bronchoprovocation test or IS, therapy with inhaled corticosteroids was utilized based on an algorithmic approach.

- **Results**: A total of 184 patients (77 men and 107 women), with a mean age of 47.5 years, were evaluated. Eighty-nine out of 184 patients had postinfectious cough, with the cough resolving without treatment in 62 patients. Among the 43 patients with positive bronchoprovocation test results, 29 were found to have cough-variant asthma.

- **Conclusions**: Postinfectious cough emerged as the most common cause of subacute cough. Spontaneous resolution occurred frequently in patients with subacute cough. Unless asthma is strongly suspected, performing the bronchoprovocation test can be postponed until after empirical treatment has been administered.

### Occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults: Chest expert panel report [^112WfB2x]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In response to occupational and environmental exposures, cough can be an isolated symptom reflecting exposure to an irritant with little physiological consequence, or it can be a manifestation of more significant disease. This document reviews occupational and environmental contributions to chronic cough in adults, focusing on aspects not previously covered in the 2006 ACCP Cough Guideline or our more recent systematic review, and suggests an approach to the investigation of these factors when suspected.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and TOXLINE literature searches were supplemented by articles identified by the cough panel occupational and environmental subgroup members to identify occupational and environmental aspects of chronic cough not previously covered in the 2006 ACCP Cough Guideline. Based on the literature reviews and the Delphi methodology, the cough panel occupational and environmental subgroup developed guideline suggestions that were approved after review and voting by the full cough panel.

- **Results**: The literature review identified relevant articles regarding mechanisms, allergic environmental causes, chronic cough and the recreational and involuntary inhalation of tobacco and marijuana smoke, nonallergic environmental triggers, laryngeal syndromes, and occupational diseases and exposures. Consensus-based statements were developed for the approach to diagnosis due to a lack of strong evidence from published literature.

- **Conclusions**: Despite increased understanding of cough related to occupational and environmental triggers, there remains a gap between the reco

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Fobu6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining noninvasive measurement of airway inflammation in adult and adolescent patients with chronic cough due to asthma. Recognize that the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation is likely to be associated with a more favorable response to corticosteroids.

### Psychological considerations of the child with asthma [^114Uxqq8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma, the most common chronic disease in children and adolescents in industrialized countries, is typified by airway inflammation and obstruction leading to wheezing, dyspnea, and cough. However, the effect of asthma does not end with pulmonary changes. Research has shown a direct link between asthma and stress and psychiatric illness, which, if untreated, results in heightened morbidity and effects on society. The link between asthma and psychiatric illness is often underappreciated by many pediatric and child mental health professionals. This article reviews the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, as well as the correlation between asthma and psychiatric illness in children, in an effort to improve management and treatment strategies for this prevalent disease.

### Habit cough [^113A7V65]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

To review habit cough and its treatments to raise awareness of this condition as a potential cause of chronic cough, relevant articles and references published between January 1, 1962, and April 30, 2008, were identified through a PubMed search using the following keywords: habit cough, psychogenic cough, chronic cough, and tic cough.

All key relevant articles were reviewed, and the most pertinent ones were selected for inclusion in this review. Habit cough is a diagnosis of exclusion and can occur in children and adults with chronic cough. It is characterized by a loud honking or barking cough, disruption of normal activities, and often includes a secondary gain, such as school absence. Successful treatment has been described in several case reports and predominantly involves nonpharmacologic measures.

It is important to consider habit cough in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough because early diagnosis can help to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and potential iatrogenic complications.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^112trKFm]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Reviews indicate that coughing is one of the most common reasons for consultation in routine pediatric and family practice. The majority of children experience 5 to 8 episodes of cough lasting one week each throughout the year. However, these studies primarily rely on secondary or tertiary care data, or they are population-based. Age influences the development of the respiratory system in general, which explains the change in prevalence over a lifetime. Our study shows distinctive age-related patterns, with the lowest cough prevalence seen mainly in older children (51.2% of children aged 15 to 19 years). This aligns with guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians, which sets the cut-off age for applying adult protocols at 14 years.

- **Distinction between acute, subacute, and chronic cough**: The definition differs between children and adults. US and Australian-New Zealand guidelines define acute cough in children as lasting up to 4 weeks, based on the natural course of upper respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children differing from adults, where it lasts up to 8 weeks. Triaging patients according to the duration of cough is the first step in the diagnostic process. Thus, aetiological data for both acute and chronic cough are required. However, categorizations in the identified studies differed from those suggested in the cough guidelines, limiting their impact for guideline development or validation.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^114yVZDt]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Our systematic review identified 19 eligible studies. Prevalence estimates in Western countries varied widely, ranging from 12% of all reasons for encounter to up to 45% of patients consulting their physician. We observed differential effects with lower prevalence in summer and among older children. Acute cough is predominantly caused by infectious diseases such as upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) or bronchitis. In cases of chronic cough, the most important diagnoses identified are RTIs, asthma, and pertussis. Potentially serious diseases like pneumonia or tuberculosis are rare. The duration of cough varies widely; spontaneous relief within a short period seems unlikely in cases of subacute or chronic cough, with 62.3% of children still experiencing cough after two months.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic cough [^113ABCH6]. Allergy and Asthma Proceedings (2006). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, chronic cough can be attributed to a variety of conditions:

- **Respiratory diseases**: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, upper airway cough syndrome, diffuse panbronchiolitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

- **Infectious diseases**: whooping cough, pulmonary tuberculosis, paragonimiasis, lung abscess, Mycobacterium avium complex disease.

- **Environmental and lifestyle factors**: tobacco use, passive smoking.

- **Rhinitis and sinusitis conditions**: allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa.

- **Metabolic and hematological disorders**: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.

- **Interstitial and occupational lung diseases**: hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis.

- **Neoplasms and tumors**: lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, vocal cord dysfunction.

- **Structural and functional abnormalities**: obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, esophageal diverticulum, tracheobronchomalacia.

- **Heart-related conditions**: heart failure.

- **Gastrointestinal conditions**: gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Additionally, chronic cough can be caused by medications such as sitagliptin, as well as other conditions like habitual cough, cystic fibrosis, and vocal cord dysfunction.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112WQSuS]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Whether gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or GER disease (GERD) causes chronic cough in children is controversial. Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format, we undertook four systematic reviews. For children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease, we explored several questions:

1. Should empirical treatment for GERD be used in children who do not have gastrointestinal GER symptoms?
2. Does treatment for GERD resolve the cough in children with gastrointestinal GER symptoms?
3. What GER-based therapies should be used, and for how long, in children with or without gastrointestinal GER symptoms?
4. If GERD is suspected as the cause, what investigations and diagnostic criteria best determine GERD as the cause of the cough?

- **Methods**: We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Delphi methodology was employed to obtain consensus.

- **Results**: Few randomized controlled trials addressed the first two questions, and none addressed the other two. The single meta-analysis (two randomized controlled trials) showed no significant difference between the groups (any intervention for GERD vs placebo for cough resolution; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; p = 0.78). Proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. Qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

### Cystic fibrosis: A diagnosis in an adolescent [^111kKoYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop multisystemic clinical manifestations, with a minority experiencing mild or atypical symptoms. We describe an adolescent with a chronic cough and purulent rhinorrhea since the first year of life, previously diagnosed with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite therapy with long-acting bronchodilators, antihistamines, inhaled corticosteroids, antileukotrienes, and several courses of empirical oral antibiotic therapy, there was no clinical improvement. There was no reference to gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to clinical worsening, extended investigations were initiated, revealing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum culture, a positive sweat test, and heterozygosity for F508del and R334W mutations in a genetic study, which confirmed the diagnosis of CF. In this case, heterozygosity with a class IV mutation can explain the atypical clinical presentation. It is very important to consider this diagnosis when chronic symptoms persist, despite optimized therapy for other respiratory pathologies and in the case of isolation of atypical bacterial agents.

### Prevalence of chronic cough, its risk factors and population attributable risk in the burden of obstructive lung disease (BOLD) study: a multinational cross-sectional study [^114cg1pk]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

- **Prevalence of chronic cough**: The study assessed the prevalence of chronic cough across 41 sites of the BOLD study, categorized by gross national income.

- **Characteristics of study participants**: Among all participants with chronic cough (CC), slightly more than a quarter (27.4%) reported having CC for less than two years, 29% for two to five years, and 43.6% for over five years. The region with the highest proportion of participants experiencing cough for over five years was Western Europe (59.6%, 95% CI 52.1%–67.1%). Among the study sites, Bergen in Norway had the highest proportion (70.7%).

- **Gender distribution of CC**: Southern Africa had the highest proportion of females experiencing CC (56.1%, 95% CI 53.1%–59%), while the lowest proportion was found in Central Africa (40.6%, 95% CI 35%–46.2%).

- **Age distribution of CC**: Regions with a higher proportion of younger participants with CC were primarily located in Africa and Asia, where most participants with CC were under 49 years old. The highest proportion of participants with CC aged 70 years or over were found in regions with primarily high-income study sites, such as Australia (24.6%), Western Europe (21.3%, 95% CI 17.9%–24.8%), and North America (19.7%, 95% CI 17.1%–22.3%).

- **Education level among participants with CC**: The proportion of participants with a lower level of education (none or primary school) among those with CC was highest in North Africa/Middle East (69%, 95% CI 64.7%–73.3%), East Africa (60.7%, 95% CI 54.6%–66.8%), and Central Africa (57.1%, 95% CI 51.5%–62.8%).

### Acute cough in outpatients: What causes it, how long does it last, and how severe is it for different viruses and bacteria [^113opdM8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Low credibility.

To describe the symptoms, duration, severity, and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in outpatients, a prospective cohort study of adults in US primary or urgent care was conducted with a chief complaint of cough and symptoms consistent with LRTI. Baseline data included demographics, signs, symptoms, and PCR for 46 viruses and bacteria. The severity of symptoms was reported for up to 28 days of follow-up via diary and text message. The bronchitis severity score assessed initial severity, while overall severity was defined as the area under the symptom severity curve.

Results from 718 patients with complete baseline data indicate that 618 had valid PCR results, and 443 were monitored until symptoms resolved. Of those with valid PCR results, 100 (16.2%) had one or more viruses detected, 211 (34.1%) had one or more bacteria, and 168 (27.2%) had both. Symptoms more likely with viral or mixed infection included feverishness (36.7–38.4% vs. 18.5%), chills or sweats (36.0–38.1% vs. 17.9%), general malaise (78.2–81.3% vs. 64.9%), and myalgias (42.7–48.2% vs. 28.6%). Colored sputum was more common with bacterial infection (42.9% vs. 23.2–29.5%).

The mean duration of cough was 14.7 days with viruses (95% CI: 13.2–16.2), 17.3 days with bacteria (95% CI: 15.9–18.6), 16.9 days with mixed infections (95% CI: 15.2–18.6), and 18.4 days with no detection (95% CI: 16.1–20.8). Overall severity of cough was lower for viral infections (20.9 points, 95% CI: 18.6–23.3) compared to other groups (ranging from 24.2 to 26.3 points). The most common potential bacterial pathogens identified were Haemophilus influenzae (28.0%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (16.2%).

### Acute cough in outpatients: What causes it, how long does it last, and how severe is it for different viruses and bacteria [^114quYjx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, acute cough can be caused by a variety of conditions:

- **Respiratory conditions**: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, upper airway cough syndrome, bronchiectasis exacerbation, lower respiratory tract infections, acute interstitial pneumonia, pneumothorax, asthma exacerbation, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- **Infectious diseases**: COVID-19 infection, upper respiratory tract infections, lung abscess, pertussis, tuberculosis, pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis

- **Aspiration and inhalation issues**: Aspiration pneumonitis, foreign body aspiration, inhalation injury

- **Other medical conditions**: Pulmonary embolism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic rhinitis, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute decompensated heart failure

In addition, acute cough can be caused by medications such as:

- **Ace inhibitors and related drugs**: Lisinopril, enalapril, captopril

- **Other medications**: Gabapentin, fentanyl, elotuzumab, cyclophosphamide, fentanyl citrate, fentanyl ER

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114H9bT1]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) are among the most common causes of chronic cough in adults. We sought to determine the role of non-invasive measurements of airway inflammation, including induced sputum and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, in evaluating cough associated with asthma, and the best treatment for cough due to asthma or NAEB.

- **Methods**: We undertook three systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and observational trials involving adults and adolescents over 12 years of age with chronic cough due to asthma or NAEB. Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS and assessed for relevance and quality. Guidelines were developed and voted upon using CHEST guideline methodology.

- **Results**: Of the citations reviewed, 3/1,175, 53/656, and 6/134 were identified as eligible for inclusion in the three systematic reviews, respectively. In contrast to established guidelines for asthma therapies and the inclusion in some guidelines for a role of biomarkers of airway inflammation to guide treatment in severe disease, the evidence of specific benefit related to the use of non-invasive biomarkers in patients with chronic cough due to asthma was weak. The best therapeutic option for cough in asthma or NAEB is inhaled corticosteroids followed by leukotriene receptor antagonism.

- **Conclusions**: This guideline offers recommendations on the role of non-invasive measurements of airway inflammation and treatment for cough due to asthma or NAEB based on the available literature, and identifies gaps in knowledge.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^116eiaDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

For evidence-based decision-making, primary care physicians need specific and reliable information on the pre-test probabilities of underlying diseases and a symptom's course. We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies in primary care following three research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care physicians? (2) What are the underlying aetiologies of cough and the respective frequencies? (3) What is the prognosis of children with cough?

- **Methods**: Following a pre-defined algorithm and independent double reviewer ratings, we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. All quantitative original research articles in English, French, or German were included if they focused on unselected study populations of children consulting a primary care physician for cough. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis in subgroups, if justifiable in terms of heterogeneity.

- **Results**: We identified 14 eligible studies on prevalence, five on aetiology, and one on prognosis. Prevalence estimates varied between 4.7% and 23.3% of all reasons for an encounter, or up to estimates of 60% when related to patients or consultations. Cough in children is more frequent than in adults, with the lowest prevalences in adolescents and in summer. Acute cough is mostly caused by upper respiratory tract infections (62.4%) and bronchitis (33.3%); subacute or chronic cough by respiratory tract infection (27.7%), asthma (up to 50.4% in cough persisting more than 3 weeks), and pertussis (37.2%).

### Pediatric chronic cough: Allergies, environmental factors, and asthma-associated inflammation [^1171d8U8]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC) is a common respiratory symptom in children, often linked to allergic conditions, environmental exposures, and potentially indicative of underlying asthma.

- **Objective**: To investigate the relationships of CC in children with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and airway inflammatory markers.

- **Methods**: A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Data on cough duration, personal and family allergic histories, and environmental exposures were collected. Airway inflammation was assessed using fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO 50), and lung function was evaluated via spirometry.

- **Results**: Children with CC showed a higher prevalence of allergic conditions, including rhinitis (74.77% vs. 24.13%, OR = 9.312, p < 0.0001), food allergy (59.81% vs. 27.59%, OR = 3.907, p = 0.0017), eczema (55.14% vs. 31.03%, OR = 2.731, p = 0.0213), and family history of allergies (71.96% vs. 27.59%, OR = 6.738, p < 0.001). Environmental exposures, such as household smoking (55.14% vs. 20.69%, OR = 4.712, p = 0.001) and mold exposure (28.68% vs. 7.35%, OR = 3.442, p = 0.0251), were more common in the CC group. CC children exhibited elevated FeNO 50 (median: 18 vs. 14 ppb, p = 0.0153) and impaired small airway function (FEF75%pred: 53.84 ± 20.21 vs. 65.07 ± 28.52, p = 0.0170).

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric CC is strongly associated with allergic predispositions, environmental exposures, and eosinophilic airway inflammation, potentially reflecting an asthma-related phenotype.

### Pertussis is a frequent cause of prolonged cough illness in adults and adolescents [^111UAt65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although pertussis is increasingly recognized as a cause of prolonged cough illness in adolescents and adults, its prevalence is not well established. We evaluated pertussis infection in 442 adolescents and adults aged 12 years or older (mean age of 41.3 years) who had a cough-related illness lasting 7 to 56 days. For 4 patients (0.9%), results of nasopharyngeal culture or PCR were positive for Bordetella pertussis; for 10 patients (2.3%), either culture or PCR results were positive, or pertussis antibody titers increased fourfold. A total of 88 patients (19.9%) had either laboratory-confirmed pertussis or laboratory evidence of pertussis.

These patients experienced significantly longer durations of cough compared to patients without laboratory evidence of pertussis (56 days vs. 46 days), and a higher percentage experienced vomiting with cough (45.5% vs. 28.5%, respectively). Pertussis is a common cause of prolonged cough illness in adolescents and adults and is frequently associated with other symptoms of whooping cough.

### Cough-variant asthma: A review of clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathophysiology [^1171qkfh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is among the most common symptoms prompting medical care. Cough-variant asthma (CVA) is an asthma subset where cough is the primary symptom, without wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea. It is an important cause of chronic cough, estimated to account for 25% to 42% of cases but is likely underdiagnosed due to delayed recognition and pitfalls of diagnostic testing. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and delay its progression to more typical asthma. This review details the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of CVA, contrasting it with classic asthma and other causes of chronic cough.
