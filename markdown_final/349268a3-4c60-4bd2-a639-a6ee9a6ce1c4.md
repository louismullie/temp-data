## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify hypertriglyceridemia by severity and why that matters. Then, I should verify the initial workup for secondary causes and confirm the role of fasting versus nonfasting measurements. Next, I will consider lifestyle therapy as first-line and quantify its expected impact. After that, I need to align pharmacotherapy to severity and goals, distinguishing pancreatitis prevention from ASCVD risk reduction. Finally, I should review special populations, monitoring, and synthesize a practical algorithm with attention to controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the severity classification because treatment hinges on it. The Endocrine Society defines normal fasting triglycerides as less than 150 mg/dL, mild as 150–199 mg/dL, moderate as 200–999 mg/dL, severe as 1000–1999 mg/dL, and very severe as 2000 mg/dL or higher, and this framework guides whether the priority is ASCVD risk reduction or pancreatitis prevention [^111SgaFC]. I should also verify that the clinical implications track with this: levels at or above 500 mg/dL, and especially 1000 mg/dL, confer increased risk of acute pancreatitis, whereas levels in the 150–499 mg/dL range primarily raise ASCVD risk concerns, which aligns with contemporary reviews and guidelines [^115yBtXB] [^112E3Mnu].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation steps before jumping to treatment. I need to ensure a fasting lipid panel is obtained to diagnose hypertriglyceridemia, screen for secondary causes such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol use, hypothyroidism, renal or liver disease, and review medications that raise triglycerides, and I should assess family history for genetic dyslipidemias and pancreatitis risk, as recommended by the Endocrine Society and echoed by primary care guidance [^111ih4iB] [^113xRf2q] [^111AU7b3]. Hold on, I should also confirm that nonfasting samples can be misleading; diagnosis and severity grading should be based on fasting triglycerides when feasible to avoid misclassification and to guide therapy appropriately [^111ih4iB].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy as foundational for all severities. Let me think about the magnitude of benefit: weight loss of 5–10% can lower triglycerides by about 20–30%, reducing refined carbohydrates and added sugars, especially fructose, and limiting alcohol are impactful, and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity improves clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; in severe hypertriglyceridemia, a very low-fat diet with less than 15% of calories from fat is often necessary to reduce chylomicron burden and pancreatitis risk [^115bersp] [^113EYkox] [^116TRXB8]. I should double-check that these measures are recommended before or alongside pharmacotherapy, and yes, guidelines consistently position lifestyle as first-line across severities [^115yBtXB] [^111MLWer].

> Now, for triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL, I need to ensure the therapeutic goal is ASCVD risk reduction rather than pancreatitis prevention. Statins are first-line when ASCVD risk is elevated, with typical triglyceride reductions of about 10–30% depending on baseline and statin intensity, and I should target non-HDL cholesterol or ApoB when LDL-C is less reliable due to elevated triglycerides, consistent with Endocrine Society and AHA/ACC guidance [^115Xcrpc] [^115RKokL] [^116JBMw9]. Hold on, I should verify the role of icosapent ethyl here; REDUCE-IT supports adding EPA 4 g/day to statins in high-risk patients with triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, and contemporary guidelines suggest adding EPA in appropriate high-risk patients after shared decision-making, while recommending against EPA+DHA combinations for this purpose due to limited benefit and more adverse effects in meta-analyses [^113ND9fZ] [^111wN8XH] [^111pXDdH]. But wait, what if the patient is low risk and triglycerides are only mildly elevated? In that scenario, intensifying lifestyle and monitoring is reasonable, reserving pharmacotherapy for those who remain high risk or fail lifestyle alone [^114rv7WJ].

> For triglycerides 500–999 mg/dL, I should confirm that pancreatitis risk rises and that both pancreatitis prevention and ASCVD risk reduction become priorities. Let me consider the sequence: address secondary causes aggressively, implement a very low-fat diet, and if triglycerides remain elevated, add a triglyceride-lowering agent such as fenofibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids, while simultaneously optimizing statin therapy in those with ASCVD risk factors or diabetes, as outlined by ACC and AHA/ACC pathways [^111MLWer] [^114rv7WJ]. I need to ensure I note that fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil when combined with statins due to lower interaction risk, and that prescription omega-3s at 2–4 g/day of EPA ± DHA lower triglycerides by roughly 20–50% depending on baseline and formulation, with EPA-only avoiding LDL-C elevation seen with some EPA+DHA products in very high triglycerides [^1119xTS4] [^113ND9fZ] [^11478fqb].

> For triglycerides 1000 mg/dL or higher, I should double-check that pancreatitis prevention is the immediate priority and that statin monotherapy is inadequate. Fibrates are first-line to rapidly reduce triglycerides, with prescription omega-3s as adjuncts; a very low-fat diet under 15% of calories, strict alcohol abstinence, and tight glycemic control in diabetes are essential, and if triglycerides remain severely elevated despite these measures, I should consider genetic testing for familial chylomicronemia syndrome and referral to a lipid specialist for advanced therapies such as apoC-III inhibitors in appropriate cases [^117F1Bvi] [^115gihQt] [^111Fwv74]. Hold on, I should verify that plasmapheresis is not first-line outside of acute severe pancreatitis; indeed, endocrine guidance advises against routine plasmapheresis and instead emphasizes addressing causes and instituting fibrate-based therapy with dietary fat restriction [^1135mzbs] [^117Cy1Qw].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In acute hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, insulin infusion can lower triglycerides via suppression of lipolysis, and plasmapheresis may be considered only in life-threatening situations with refractory hypertriglyceridemia, ideally in expert centers, while long-term prevention hinges on fibrate therapy and very low-fat diet to keep triglycerides below 1000 mg/dL and preferably below 500 mg/dL to reduce recurrence risk [^111AU7b3] [^112E3Mnu]. For women of reproductive potential, I need to ensure teratogenic drug avoidance and prioritize lifestyle and statins when appropriate, escalating to specialist-directed therapy if triglycerides remain severely elevated despite conservative measures [^114ZrMfT]. In pediatrics, persistent hypertriglyceridemia or severe elevations warrant specialist evaluation and consideration of omega-3s or fibrates alongside strict dietary management, reflecting the higher likelihood of genetic etiologies in youth [^113vmK4U].

> Next, I should review monitoring and targets to close the loop. Let me verify that for moderate hypertriglyceridemia the clinical target is non-HDL cholesterol or ApoB rather than triglycerides per se, whereas for severe hypertriglyceridemia the immediate target is to reduce triglycerides below 500 mg/dL to mitigate pancreatitis risk, with reassessment in 4–12 weeks after initiating or intensifying therapy and periodic lipid panels thereafter to ensure durability and safety [^115RKokL] [^117Cy1Qw] [^111MLWer]. I need to ensure I also check for adverse effects: fenofibrate is generally preferred with statins over gemfibrozil, omega-3s can increase bleeding risk at high doses, and niacin is now discouraged given limited benefit and notable side effects in contemporary guidance, so I should tailor choices to comorbidities and tolerability [^1119xTS4] [^1119irYG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combination therapy and outcome data. I should confirm that while triglyceride lowering is mechanistically attractive, outcome benefits are most robust for statins and, in selected high-risk patients, the addition of EPA, whereas fibrate and niacin outcome data are mixed and often neutral unless specific high-risk phenotypes are present, reinforcing the need to individualize therapy and set expectations during shared decision-making [^113ND9fZ] [^113VoWBc] [^113XzRaG]. Let me reconsider cost and access as well; icosapent ethyl has demonstrated cost-effectiveness at common U.S. price points in high-risk statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia, which can support coverage discussions when appropriate [^112dN4gc].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against major guidelines. Start with fasting triglycerides and secondary cause evaluation, implement lifestyle therapy universally, then stratify: if triglycerides are 150–499 mg/dL, prioritize ASCVD risk reduction with statins and consider adding EPA in high-risk patients; if triglycerides are 500–999 mg/dL, add fibrate or prescription omega-3 and intensify statin when ASCVD risk is present; if triglycerides are 1000 mg/dL or higher, initiate fibrate and very low-fat diet urgently, add omega-3s, optimize glycemic control, and consider genetic testing and specialty referral, reassessing every 4–12 weeks until triglycerides are safely below 500 mg/dL and then pivot to ASCVD risk reduction targets thereafter [^111MLWer] [^114rv7WJ] [^111wN8XH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply the same EPA recommendation to severe hypertriglyceridemia, but I should correct that: contemporary guidance issues no recommendation for EPA in severe hypertriglyceridemia due to insufficient evidence for pancreatitis prevention, so EPA's role remains in moderate hypertriglyceridemia with ASCVD risk on statins, not as a pancreatitis-prevention strategy in severe disease [^111wN8XH] [^111pXDdH].

---

Hypertriglyceridemia management centers on **lifestyle first** [^113EYkox] and **risk-based pharmacotherapy** [^115yBtXB]. For TG 150–499 mg/dL, prioritize weight loss, reduced refined carbs and alcohol, and regular exercise [^115bersp]; add statins if ASCVD risk is elevated [^1178237d], and consider icosapent ethyl [^113ND9fZ] for high-risk patients on statins [^111wN8XH]. For TG ≥ 500 mg/dL, implement a very low-fat diet [^116TRXB8], strict alcohol abstinence, and tight glycemic control [^111MLWer]; initiate fibrates [^117F1Bvi] or high-dose omega-3s [^1119xTS4] to reduce pancreatitis risk, and add statins if ASCVD risk is high [^111MLWer]. Address secondary causes [^113yTaFD] and monitor for adverse effects; consider apoC-III inhibitors [^111Fwv74] for refractory cases or familial chylomicronemia syndrome.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are **first-line** [^113EYkox] and reduce TG by 20–50% [^notfound].

- **Dietary changes**: Reduce saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars; increase omega-3 intake; limit alcohol [^112g2Ubw] [^116TRXB8].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss to lower TG and improve insulin sensitivity [^115bersp].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise [^115bersp].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is added when lifestyle is insufficient or TG ≥ 500 mg/dL [^111MLWer].

| **Drug class** | **Indication** | **TG reduction** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Statins | TG 150–499 mg/dL with ASCVD risk | 15–30% | First-line for ASCVD risk; modest TG lowering [^1178237d] [^117MxcDT] |
| Fibrates | TG ≥ 500 mg/dL or persistent TG 200–499 mg/dL | 30–50% | First-line for severe HTG; monitor for myopathy, hepatotoxicity [^117F1Bvi] [^113Ef1s8] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) | TG ≥ 500 mg/dL or persistent TG 200–499 mg/dL | 20–45% | 2–4 g/day; monitor for bleeding, GI effects [^113ND9fZ] [^112g2Ubw] |
| Niacin | Persistent TG 200–499 mg/dL | 20–30% | Limited use due to side effects; avoid in severe HTG [^113VoWBc] [^1119irYG] |

---

## Management by triglyceride level

| **Triglyceride level** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|
| 150–199 mg/dL | Lifestyle modifications; consider statins if ASCVD risk elevated [^112kqCDN] |
| 200–499 mg/dL | Lifestyle + statins; add fibrates or omega-3s if TG persists [^115c7zLF] [^113ND9fZ] |
| ≥ 500 mg/dL | Very low-fat diet, alcohol abstinence, tight glycemic control; fibrates or omega-3s; add statins if ASCVD risk high [^116TRXB8] [^117F1Bvi] [^113Ef1s8] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Secondary causes**: Address diabetes, obesity, alcohol, medications, and endocrine disorders [^113yTaFD] [^113xRf2q].
- **Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS)**: Consider apoC-III inhibitors (volanesorsen, olezarsen) for refractory cases [^111Fwv74].
- **Acute pancreatitis**: Use insulin infusion or plasmapheresis if TG > 1000 mg/dL despite conservative therapy [^111AU7b3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess fasting lipids **4–12 weeks** [^notfound] after interventions, then every 3–6 months. Monitor for myopathy with fibrates, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding with omega-3s, and reinforce adherence and lifestyle at each visit.

---

Hypertriglyceridemia management is **stepwise**: lifestyle first, then risk-based pharmacotherapy, with fibrates or omega-3s for severe elevations and statins for ASCVD risk. Address secondary causes, monitor closely, and escalate to specialized therapies when needed.

### Contemporary and novel therapeutic options for hypertriglyceridemia [^114cee2p]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this review was to outline the current and emerging therapeutic options for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, with an emphasis on emerging therapies.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted with the use of PubMed and Embase for articles on hypertriglyceridemia, with a focus on therapeutics, pharmacology, and management. Abstracts from recent international meetings were also reviewed for presentations of Phase I and II data on agents with triglyceride-lowering effects. A further review of the references identified from these articles was also performed.

Findings

Consistent with the multifactorial cause of hypertriglyceridemia, the therapeutic options are broad and numerous. This review explores the current and potential therapeutic options for treating hypertriglyceridemia and outlines the potential mechanisms of action. However, the mechanism of triglyceride reduction is complex, multifactorial, or not fully elucidated for some of these agents. The magnitude of triglyceride reduction and findings of outcome studies are described.

Implications

Management of hypertriglyceridemia is about to enter an exciting phase, with multiple emerging therapies in the final stages of development. However, caution is warranted, because studies of therapeutic agents over the previous decade have often not found cardiovascular outcome benefits despite encouraging effects on triglyceride concentrations.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, e-mail discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. The initial treatment should be lifestyle therapy; a combination of diet modification and drug therapy may also be considered. In patients with severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, a fibrate should be used as a first-line agent.

### Pharmacologic approaches for the management of patients with moderately elevated triglycerides (150–499 mg / dL) [^113W7PjX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglyceride (TG) levels > 150 mg/dL, now affects over one-quarter of the US adult population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Available guidelines for managing hypertriglyceridemia vary with respect to TG thresholds and severity of disease. Lifestyle modifications and management of secondary causes (eg, diabetes) remain the first step in managing hypertriglyceridemia, with pharmacotherapy reserved to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and/or further reduce TG levels. Several classes of lipid-lowering agents are available with variable TG-lowering efficacy. Although there is no consensus regarding the choice of initial TG-lowering pharmacotherapy, there is general agreement that the decision depends on the degree of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This review will discuss available and emerging lipid-lowering therapies for the management of moderately elevated TG, defined as TG 150 to 499 mg/dL.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^115yBtXB]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as current management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.

### Treatment options for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: strategies based on the best-available evidence [^115F7sgQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

A severe elevation in triglycerides (TG; ≥ 500 mg/dL) increases the risk for pancreatitis. TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL are associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). However, no outcomes trials exist to assess the efficacy of TG lowering for preventing pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, no completed prospective outcomes trial exists to support or refute a reduction in CHD risk resulting from lipid-altering therapy in patients specifically selected for the presence of hypertriglyceridemia. This review examines the available evidence for the use of statins, omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin in the management of hypertriglyceridemic patients. Results from CHD outcomes trials support statins as the first-line lipid-altering drug therapy to reduce CHD in hypercholesterolemic patients, and subgroup analyses suggest statins are efficacious in hypertriglyceridemic patients with fasting TG levels < 500 mg/dL. Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates are reasonable first drug options for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL and often are used to lower TG levels with the objective of reducing pancreatitis risk, although a statin or niacin may also be reasonable options. Combination lipid drug therapy may be needed to achieve both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals for CHD prevention in patients with elevated TG levels, particularly those with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Additional clinical outcomes data are needed to provide a more evidence-based rationale for clinical lipid management of hypertriglyceridemic patients.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^111wN8XH]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or are at increased risk for ASCVD, AACE suggests for the use of EPA (IPE) in addition to statins (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of EPA (IPE) in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (no recommendation, insufficient evidence). For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have ASCVD or are at increased risk for ASCVD, AACE suggests against the use of EPA plus DHA in addition to statin therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of EPA plus DHA in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (no recommendation, insufficient evidence).

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111ih4iB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society summary of recommendations — screening and diagnostic basis states that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia increase the risk for pancreatitis, whereas mild or moderate hypertriglyceridemia may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease; therefore, similar to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidance, we recommend screening adults for hypertriglyceridemia as part of a lipid panel at least every 5 yr, and we recommend basing the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia on fasting triglyceride levels and not on nonfasting triglyceride levels.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Xcrpc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### Cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment [^112dN4gc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl from a US health care perspective for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment?

Findings

This economic evaluation including 8179 patients found that icosapent ethyl at a cost of $4.16 to $9.28 per day had a high probability of costing less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. At the lower cost, treatment with icosapent ethyl may be a dominant strategy, offering better outcomes at lower cost.

Meaning

This study suggests that, for high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment, icosapent ethyl may be cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides are a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level < 150 mg/dL is accepted widely as the upper limit of normal range. Guidelines for hypertriglyceridemia are variable without a global consensus on classification and goals for triglyceride levels. A general classification of hypertriglyceridemia is mild < 200 mg/dL, moderate = 200 to 500 mg/dL, moderate to severe = 500 to 1000 mg/dL, and severe > 1000 mg/dL. Because moderate hypertriglyceridemia does increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, it is important to determine the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management. This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, based on 3 common scenarios encountered in clinical practice. Initial steps in management include evaluating for secondary contributors, especially diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions include lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption and use of statin and nonstatin therapies.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113F5L9m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — management of hypertriglyceridemia recommends lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia; for severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis; we recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines; we recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis; we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels; and we recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, although statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115RKokL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — treatment targets in moderate hypertriglyceridemia: We recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-HDL cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines. Non-HDL cholesterol (total serum cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) reflects the amount of cholesterol in all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, and measurement of non-HDL cholesterol is recommended in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia both for risk stratification and as a secondary target for therapy. Alternatively, the blood level of atherogenic lipoprotein particles can be assessed by measuring the concentration of apoB, and because measurement of apoB is helpful in the differentiation of FCHL from FHTG, apoB levels may be measured during an initial evaluation of a hypertriglyceridemic patient; non-HDL cholesterol can then be followed as the therapeutic target.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VoWBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

National Lipid Association Chart 4 — management of hypertriglyceridemia: For patients with very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower the triglyceride level to < 500 mg/dL to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, whereas for patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower levels of non–HDL-C and LDL-C to reduce risk for an ASCVD event. Lifestyle interventions are key to efforts to reduce triglycerides, and when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides should be considered for patients with triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin may be reasonable for patients with triglycerides 500–999 mg/dL, and a statin should generally be the first-line drug therapy for patients with triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL.

Hypertriglyceridemia — severe and very severe management: For severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Determination and treatment of underlying causes of very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be considered first. Restriction of both saturated and unsaturated dietary fat, particularly at initiation of therapy and in LpL deficiency, assists in lowering triglyceride acutely, and design of the dietary intervention may benefit from input from nutrition specialists; regain of weight loss might exacerbate pancreatitis risk.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^113ND9fZ]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2–4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders. Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although this has not been studied in clinical trials. For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: impact and treatment [^116vK6ST]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is standard medical practice supported by conclusive outcome data. Less definitive information exists for hypertriglyceridemia. Only in the setting of severe hyperchylomicronemia is the benefit of triglyceride lowering clear: it is a means to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. The relationship of triglycerides and cardiovascular disease is still unclear. Moreover, the cardiovascular benefits of reducing triglycerides and of using triglyceride-lowering medications remain unproved. Nonetheless it has become almost standard to reduce the levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are a major component of plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Management of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117CageT]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is highly prevalent globally, and its prevalence is rising, with a worldwide increase in the incidence of obesity and diabetes. This review examines its current management and future therapies.

Methods

For this review, HTG is defined as mild-to-moderate elevation in the levels of triglyceride (TG): a fasting or nonfasting TG level of ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL. We reviewed scientific studies published over the last 30 years and current professional society recommendations regarding the evaluation and treatment of HTG.

Results

Genetics, lifestyle, and other environmental factors impact TG levels. In adults with mild-to-moderate HTG, clinicians should routinely assess and treat secondary treatable causes (diet, physical activity, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and reduction or cessation of medications that elevate TG levels). Because atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk is the primary clinical concern, statins are usually the first-line treatment. Patients with TG levels between ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is treated adequately with statins (at "maximally tolerated" doses, per some statements) and have either prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus along with at least 2 additional cardiovascular disease risk factors should be considered for added icosapent ethyl treatment to further reduce their cardiovascular disease risk. Fibrates, niacin, and other approved agents or agents under development are also reviewed in detail.

Conclusion

The treatment paradigm for mild-to-moderate HTG is changing on the basis of data from recent clinical trials. Recent trials suggest that the addition of icosapent ethyl to background statin therapy may further reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with moderate HTG, although a particular TG goal has not been identified.

### Hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction [^114EW36S]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are prevalent among the US population, often occurring in persons who are overweight or obese, or who have type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. There is evidence that elevated TG levels may be a significant independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in women.

Objective

This article reviews data on the epidemiology, associated risks, treatment, and prevention of hypertriglyceridemia, including recommended TG goals and available TG-lowering agents.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1990 through 2006 using the terms hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease, with subheadings for risk, statins, niacin, fibrates, thiazolidinediones, and omega-3 fatty acids. The reference lists of relevant articles were examined for additional citations. Publications discussing the epidemiology of hypertriglyceridemia, CHD risk, treatment guidelines for lipid management, clinical trials involving TG-lowering drugs, and outcomes for lipid-modifying therapies were selected for review.

Results

Concern over the increasing rate of hypertriglyceridemia and its deleterious health consequences is reflected in the most recent National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Several lipid-lowering agents are available, including statins, fibrates, niacin, thiazolidinediones, and prescription omega-3 fatty acids. Clinical trials of these drugs have reported lowering of TG by 7% to 50%. Along with lifestyle changes, the use of combination pharmacotherapy to reduce lipid levels (including TG) may be an effective strategy in patients with dyslipidemia.

Conclusion

Use of strategies to manage TG levels, along with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, is warranted to help reduce the risk of CHD.

ACC 2021 severe hypertriglyceridemia algorithm — adults aged ≥ 20 years with triglycerides (TG) ≥ 500 mg/dL are stratified as TG 500–999 mg/dL or TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL; for TG 500–999 mg/dL, actions are to rule out secondary causes, optimize diet and lifestyle, and optimize glycemic control (in diabetes). For TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL, steps are to rule out secondary causes, implement very low-fat diet and optimize lifestyle, optimize glycemic control, and consider fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis, with consideration of statin initiation or intensification in appropriate patient management groups. In adults aged 40–75 years with TG 500–999 mg/dL and with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5%, ASCVD, or diabetes mellitus, the pathway states to initiate or increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence.

### Investigation and management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^1139s6tz]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

While the precise definition of hypertriglyceridaemia remains contentious, the condition is becoming more common in western populations as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus rise. Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is has been difficult to demonstrate this by drug intervention studies, as drugs that reduce triglycerides also raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Precise target values have also been difficult to agree, although several of the new guidelines for coronary risk management now include triglycerides. The causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are numerous. The more severe forms have a genetic basis, and may lead to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Several types of hypertriglyceridaemia are familial and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are also numerous and it is important to exclude these before starting treatment with specific triglyceride-lowering agents. Lifestyle management is also very effective and includes weight reduction, restricted alcohol and fat intake and exercise.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) management algorithm — in all individuals with HTG > 150 mg/dL or > 1.7 mmol/L, perform clinical assessment and fasting lipids, address 2° causes, institute lifestyle intervention (diet, weight loss), and optimize cardiovascular risk factors. For TG ≥ 885 mg/dL or ≥ 10 mmol/L, the goal is pancreatitis prophylaxis with Rx: low fat diet, fibrate and/or omega-3 FA, then reassess in 8–12 weeks; if persistent TG ≥ 885 mg/dL or ≥ 10 mmol/L, consider DNA testing for FCS. For TG 150–884 mg/dL (1.7–9.9 mmol/L), the goal is CVD risk reduction; evaluate global cardiovascular risk. If high/intermediate risk, start statin and monitor LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) or non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) or Apo B (apolipoprotein B), reassess in 8–12 weeks, and ask "LDL-C target attained?" If yes, consider icosapent ethyl for TG 150–500 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L); if no, follow LDL-C algorithm. Low-risk individuals focus on lifestyle behavior changes.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1135ETkY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy selection by triglyceride level — states that when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (fibric acids, high-dose [2–4 g/d] long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid) should be the first-line agent if the fasting triglyceride concentration is ≥ 1000 mg/dL. For patients with triglycerides of 500 to 999 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin (if no history of pancreatitis) may be reasonable first-line drug options. For patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), a statin will generally be first-line drug therapy, and if maximum tolerated statin therapy does not lower non–HDL-C below goal levels in patients with triglycerides 200 to 499 mg/dL, adding an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and VLDL-C may help to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals. Subgroup analyses from cardiovascular outcome studies provide suggestive evidence of reduced ASCVD event risk with the addition of a triglyceride-lowering agent to statin therapy, particularly in patients with the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.

### Hypertriglyceridemia [^114bw22e]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a commonly encountered lipid abnormality frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic derangements. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends obtaining a fasting lipid panel in adults over the age of 20. The discovery of hypertriglyceridemia should prompt an investigation for secondary causes such as high fat diet, excessive alcohol intake, certain medications, and medical conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). In addition, patients should be evaluated for other components of the metabolic syndrome. These include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high triglyceride, and hypertension. Hypertriglyceridemia is classified as primary hypertriglyceridemia when there are no secondary causes identified. Primary hypertriglyceridemia is the result of various genetic defects leading to disordered triglyceride metabolism. It is important to treat hypertriglyceridemia to prevent pancreatitis by reducing triglyceride levels to < 500 mg/dL. Furthermore, lowering triglycerides while treating other dyslipidemias and components of the metabolic syndrome will reduce coronary events. However, it is controversial how much isolated hypertriglyceridemia correlates directly with coronary artery disease and further studies are needed to clarify whether treatment for this condition leads to meaningful clinical outcomes. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are the first line of treatment for hypertriglyceridemia. These changes include a low saturated fat, carbohydrate-controlled diet, combined with alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and regular aerobic exercise. High doses of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil supplements will lower triglyceride levels significantly. When patients do not reach their goals by TLC, drug therapy should be started. In cases of isolated hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates are initially considered. When elevated low-density lipoprotein levels accompany hypertriglyceridemia, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are preferred. In patients with low HDL levels and hypertriglyceridemia, extended release niacin can be considered. A combination of the medicines may be necessary in recalcitrant cases.

Management of hypertriglyceridemia — for very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower triglycerides to < 500 mg/dL to reduce pancreatitis risk; for high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), the primary objective is to lower atherogenic cholesterol (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) to reduce ASCVD risk. Lifestyle measures include weight loss targeting 5%–10% of body weight, physical activity ≥ 150 min/wk of moderate or higher intensity, and restriction of alcohol and sugar or refined carbohydrate intakes. With very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), chylomicronemia will often be present, and essentially all patients with fasting triglycerides of ≥ 750 mg/dl will demonstrate chylomicronemia; for such patients, a low-fat diet (< 15% of energy) may help reduce entry of new chylomicron particles into the circulation.

Supporting evidence notes it is not necessary to measure LDL size or density; however, measurement of non-HDL cholesterol and/or apoB levels can indicate the presence of increased numbers of LDL particles, and several reports also show that measurement of apoB is superior to measurement of LDL or even non-HDL cholesterol as an indicator of global CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have not provided conclusive evidence that measurement of HDL size contributes to risk prediction, and for these reasons, assessment of lipoprotein heterogeneity is not recommended in the assessment of hypertriglyceridemia. Regarding Lp(a), studies over the past decade have confirmed and more robustly demonstrated a risk factor role for cardiovascular disease; however, there are limited treatment options to alter its level and a current lack of outcome evidence supporting its use as a specific therapeutic target.

### Effectiveness of a novel ω-3 krill oil agent in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia: a randomized clinical trial [^114LEFB7]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ω-3–phospholipid/free fatty acid (ω-3–PL/FFA), a naturally derived krill oil with both free fatty acid and phospholipid ω-3s, an effective and safe treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia?

Findings

In pooled data from 2 randomized clinical trials including 520 patients, blood triglyceride levels were reduced by 26.0% in the ω-3–PL/FFA group and 15.1% in the placebo group at 12 weeks, for a significant mean treatment difference that persisted at 26 weeks. ω-3–PL/FFA was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.

Meaning

This study found that ω-3–PL/FFA reduced triglyceride levels and was safe and well tolerated in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

ACC 2021 persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia 500–999 mg/dL — management includes emphasizing a low-fat diet and that it is reasonable to consider a very low-fat diet in select patients, with consideration of fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis; for the right-column pathway, actions also include to increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence while continuing the same diet and triglyceride-lowering options. Fenofibrate is specified as the preferred fibrate due to safety and interaction profile, and the narrative notes it is reasonable to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very-low-fat diet (10% to 15%), avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and prescription omega-3. The text also states that the initial step in guideline-based management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is to provide lifestyle counseling.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to PUFAs, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to advise consuming omega-3 fatty acids in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL; ≥ 5.7 mmol/L), especially with fasting triglycerides ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (≥ 11.3 mmol/L), if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing after addressing other causes of hypertriglyceridemia.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides as therapeutic targets for preventing and treating coronary artery disease [^1162fUyi]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic and clinical trials show that elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, adjustment for covariates frequently weakens or abolishes the predictive significance of triglycerides, whereas the evidence for HDL-C is more consistently strong. Data indicate that there is a 2% to 3% decrease in coronary risk for each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL-C, whereas the benefit of triglyceride lowering appears to occur largely in patients with the highest baseline levels. The 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for detecting and treating high blood cholesterol reflect our improved understanding of triglycerides and HDL as CHD risk factors. However, the guidelines place more emphasis on lowering triglycerides than on raising HDL-C by identifying non-HDL-C (ie, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] + very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [VLDL-C]) as a secondary target of therapy. In clinical practice, VLDL-C is the most readily available measure of atherogenic triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. On the basis of the available epidemiologic and clinical evidence, refinement of the NCEP guidelines to include more emphasis on raising HDL-C levels should be considered. Novel drugs are being developed that have the potential to increase HDL-C concentrations and/or improve the functionality of HDL.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^112zxmaw]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The Panel believes there is insufficient evidence to permit definition of targets for triglycerides or HDL-C for these high-risk patients. Instead, the Panel proposes that treatment should be tailored to the individual to achieve desirable levels below (for triglycerides or non-HDL-C) or above (for HDL-C) the recommended cut-offs (Box 6). The Panel acknowledges that other expert bodies recommend apo B as a secondary therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridaemic patients. but considers that the precise clinical yield of this approach has yet to be demonstrated. The Panel also recognizes the limitations of the current evidence base for fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, including the lack of hard outcome data for statin–niacin and statin–omega-3 fatty acid combination therapies. Clearly, there is a need for well-defined trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic combinations in high-risk patients at LDL-C goal with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL-C.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates and niacin as therapeutic options in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: a review of the literature [^111Dk1sF]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia affects approximately 33% of the US population. Elevated triglyceride levels are independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and severe hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Guidelines for the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 5.6 mmol/L [≥ 500 mg/dL]) recommend immediate use of triglyceride-lowering agents; however, statins remain the first line of therapy for the management of mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (1.7–5.6 mmol/L [150–499 mg/dL]). Statins primarily target elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but have also been shown to reduce mean triglyceride levels by up to 18% (or 43% in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 3.1 mmol/L [≥ 273 mg/dL]). However, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia may need additional reduction in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnant particles to further reduce residual CVD risk. A number of guidelines recommend the addition of fibrates, niacin, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids if elevated triglyceride or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels persist despite the use of high-intensity statin therapy. This review evaluates the impact of fibrates, niacin, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It also assesses the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions associated with these triglyceride-lowering agents, because although they have all been shown to effectively reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, they differ with regard to their associated benefit-risk profiles. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be a well-tolerated and effective alternative to fibrates and niacin, yet further large-scale clinical studies are required to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes and CVD risk reduction in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^111pXDdH]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA ± DHA) — For adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have CVD or are at increased risk for CVD and are taking statins, the task force issued a conditional recommendation for the use of EPA after shared decision-making because EPA monotherapy results in a small reduction in MI with some potential adverse effects, whereas in the same population it issued a conditional recommendation against EPA plus DHA due to trivial benefits and moderate adverse effects. Recommendations are grounded in trials evaluating doses of ≥ 1.8 g/day, approaching recommended prescribing doses in the range of 2 to 4 g/day, and should not be applied to doses < 1.8 g/day. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL), the task force notes a paucity of evidence and advises shared decision-making when considering EPA monotherapy or EPA plus DHA; no studies evaluated the prevention of pancreatitis in persons with severe hypertriglyceridemia.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^111Fwv74]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Management of adults with hypertriglyceridemia — when fasting triglyceride (TG) levels are elevated, ie, > 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), individuals with TG between 500 and 884 mg/dL (5.6–9.9 mmol/L) have increasing concern for metabolic deterioration predisposing to acute pancreatitis, for which secondary causes should be addressed, diets modified, and fibrates/omega-3 fatty acids initiated if levels do not improve. In those with a history of HTG-associated pancreatitis or with fasting TG remaining > 885 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) on repeat testing without an obvious and treatable secondary cause, treatment to protect against future pancreatitis episodes must be considered; first-line treatment includes a low-fat diet with strong consideration for a fibrate, and omega-3 fatty acids are also a consideration. For mild to moderate HTG (TG 150–499 mg/dL; 1.6–5.6 mmol/L), the primary concern is increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and the primary target must be low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in those with TG 500 to 884 mg/dL (5.6–9.9 mmol/L), ASCVD risk also warrants attention and other risk factors — hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and chronic stress — should be managed concurrently. If ASCVD risk is high or intermediate, medications with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as statins and ezetimibe, are preferred; when LDL-C is difficult to determine with persistently elevated TG on statin therapy, non–HDL-C and/or apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are alternative tests for treatment thresholds and monitoring. If ASCVD risk is low, lifestyle advice should be recommended with periodic lipid monitoring every 12 to 24 months, and statin treatment can be considered as the individual's situation evolves. For individuals with confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), clinicians may consider use of FDA-approved apolipoprotein CIII inhibitors, and access to investigational therapies for severe HTG can be explored through a specialty clinic.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^112n34Lp]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic and genetic studies have established that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and their remnants as important contributors to ASCVD while severe hypertriglyceridaemia raises risk of pancreatitis. While low-density lipoprotein is the primary treatment target for lipid lowering therapy, secondary targets that reflect the contribution of TRL such as apoB and non-HDL-C are recommended in the current guidelines. Reduction of severely elevated triglycerides is important to avert or reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Here we discuss interventions for hypertriglyceridaemia, including diet and lifestyle, established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid preparations and emerging therapies, including various biological agents.

Very severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis — treatment goals and measures are outlined as follows: concomitant fibrate therapy to maintain triglyceride levels below 2000 mg/dl is stated as beneficial to prevent recurrence, and a treatment goal of less than 1000 mg/dl is recommended; below this level the focus should shift to atherosclerosis prevention. The guideline states, "We do not recommend the use of heparin infusions or plasmapheresis" in this setting, and indicates that addressing underlying causes with dietary fat restriction and long-term fibrate therapy should suffice.

Who should promote and perform pragmatic cardiovascular outcome lipid trials?

The purpose of healthcare stakeholders of evolving toward personalized evidence‐based medicine calls for pragmatism in future lipid trials, in order to inform physicians and patients about the real cost‐effectiveness of a treatment in certain candidates for the treatment. The design of some new studies suggests that things are hopefully starting to move in this direction.

REDUCE‐IT 60 was aimed to evaluate the efficacy in reducing residual cardiovascular risk of a 4 g daily dose of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk on LDL‐C–lowering drugs with fairly well‐controlled LDL‐C levels (median 74 mg/dL) and baseline fasting TG levels between 150 and 500 mg/dL (median 216 mg/dL). Even though the effect of the therapy on TG levels was mild (18.3%; −39.0 mg per deciliter), the treatment produced, after 5 years, a 25% reduction of the primary cardiovascular end point. To what extent these effects are the result of TG lowering is not clear, as omega‐3 have many other putative cardioprotective pleiotropic effects. Yet, the trial pragmatically tested a coherent hypothesis in candidates suitable for the intervention in the real‐world clinical practice, responding to a frequent question of physicians: can we reduce residual risk in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia through omega‐3 fatty acids?

Propitiously, STRENGTH, 61 another pragmatic randomized placebo‐controlled trial with omega‐3 fatty acids in statin‐treated patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events, with well‐controlled LDL‐C, hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 180 to < 500 mg/dL), and low levels of HDL‐C (< 42 mg/dL in men or < 47 mg/dL in women) is ongoing, and the results are awaited by the end of 2019.

Another example of a pragmatic TG‐lowering trial in high‐risk patients is the ongoing PROMINENT trial, 62 a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled cardiovascular outcome trial with the novel fibrate compound Pemafibrate. The PROMINENT trial plans to recruit high‐risk patients with diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease, and, for the first time in fibrate outcome trials, all the patients will have TGs > 200 mg/dL and low HDL‐C despite best evidence‐based treatment, including high‐intensity statin therapy. The results of the PROMINENT trial are awaited by 2022.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^1117EUvd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years. However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridaemia are associated with a substantially increased long term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to reduction in HDL and increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms, such excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intensive lifestyle therapy is the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Statins are a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. If the primary goal is to lower TG levels, fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate for monotherapy, and in combination with statin; gemfibrozil only for monotherapy) could be the preferable drugs. Also ezetimibe has mild positive effects in lowering TG. Initial experience with en ezetimibe/fibrates combination seems promising. The recently released IMPROVE-IT Trial is the first to prove that adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe) to a statin lowers the risk of future CV events. In conclusion, the classical clinical paradigm of lipids-modifying treatment should be changed and high TG should be recognized as an important target for therapy in their own right. Hypertriglyceridemia should be treated.

### Recent national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III update: adjustments and options [^116ixYTH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the summer of 2004, an evidence-based update of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for management of hypercholesterolemia was published. This detailed assessment of 5 major clinical trials, published since the ATP III report in 2001, was designed to provide guidance for physicians in decision making for patients at high risk and very high risk. We have tried to summarize this assessment by suggesting the following to clinicians: (1) Calculate global risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) to determine an overall strategy for cholesterol management. (2) Emphasize the benefits of diet, exercise, and weight control or therapeutic lifestyle change, especially in those with lifestyle risk factors. (3) Use 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) as first-line drugs to reduce risk of CAD and stroke in those at moderate to high risk. (4) If statins are prescribed, use moderate doses that reduce plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by ≥ 30% to 40%. (5) Strongly consider statin therapy in those with diabetes (with the exception of severe hypertriglyceridemia). (6) Consider LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy for lipids in older patients at risk. (7) Consider adding either a fibrate or nicotinic acid in high-risk patients with elevated plasma triglyceride values or low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol after statin therapy has achieved the LDL cholesterol goal. (8) Continue to treat those at low risk in similar fashion as before. This update is to inform current physician judgment in this area. Further clinical trial data that may modify or extend these recommendations are eagerly awaited.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112TW1vB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia pathophysiology — production, clearance, and lipoproteins: Plasma triglyceride level reflects the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons), and the concentration of VLDL cholesterol and apoB is at least 10 times higher than the corresponding chylomicron concentration, even after consumption of a large amount of fat. Hypertriglyceridemia results from increased triglyceride production, or reduced triglyceride catabolism, or both, and clearance of VLDL from the circulation is reduced in many patients with hypertriglyceridemia, in part due to saturation of triglyceride clearance. Defective lipolysis is linked to genetic defects in LpL or apoC-II, impaired association of LpL with the vascular wall, or defective intracellular LpL processing, and severe hyperchylomicronemia also occurs when a secondary cause such as diabetes or pregnancy is superimposed on an underlying genetic defect. Hypertriglyceridemic VLDL particles are heterogeneous and often have a high apoC-III/apoE ratio, causing reduced clearance and increased conversion to LDL. The common forms of hypertriglyceridemia emerge as adults get older and become overweight and sedentary and develop insulin resistance.

n-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) — dose, effects, and indications specify that approximately 3 to 4 g/d of EPA plus DHA are necessary to reduce hypertriglyceridemia by 20–50%, with HDL cholesterol mildly increased by about 5% and potential LDL increases from VLDL conversion. No high-dose n-3 trials in hypertriglyceridemic patients have shown beneficial cardiovascular outcomes, though in an open-label study EPA added to statin therapy in subjects with cholesterol above 250 mg/dl produced a 19% relative reduction in major coronary events. Omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. Lovaza) may be considered for triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl; over-the-counter products vary, containing EPA and DHA ranging from 20–50%.

Hypertriglyceridemia severity thresholds and clinical implications: Moderate hypertriglyceridemia, i.e., 200–999 mg/dl, is due to excess circulating VLDL. In patients with severe or very severe triglyceride levels (≥ 1000 mg/dl), the LpL removal system is saturated, and triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dl can rapidly increase after a fat-rich meal. Very severe triglyceride levels (> 2000 mg/dl) are associated with lipemic serum and risk of pancreatitis in the chylomicronemia syndrome. Foods that contain potent substrates for triglyceride production such as simple sugars, fructose, and alcohol can substantially increase triglyceride levels in susceptible people.

Figure 2
Overview of Triglyceride Management Adapted From the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia

Used with permission of the publisher. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; TG = triglycerides.

Although this patient's triglycerides are the primary concern, his LDL-C is well below 100 mg/dL, which may reduce the urgency for statin therapy. However, if triglycerides remain elevated and the patient's ASCVD risk increases (ie, a 10-year risk ≥ 5% or a diagnosis of diabetes), statin therapy should be initiated or intensified and would likely provide the greatest benefit for ASCVD risk reduction. In such cases, statins are recommended to target appropriate LDL-C or non-HDL-C thresholds, as they offer protection against both cardiovascular events and further elevations in triglycerides. In the setting of hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C calculations may be less accurate (especially if the older Friedewald calculation is used), and a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk may require the usage of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB to help decide on the intensity of lipid lowering. In these cases, it is important to emphasize the role of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB as elevations in either should prompt consideration of statin therapy prior to triglyceride-specific lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111SgaFC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — fasting triglyceride classification: The Endocrine Society categorizes fasting triglyceride levels as Normal (< 150 mg/dl; < 1.7 mmol/liter), Mild hypertriglyceridemia (150–199 mg/dl; 1.7–2.3 mmol/liter), Moderate hypertriglyceridemia (200–999 mg/dl; 2.3–11.2 mmol/liter), Severe hypertriglyceridemia (1000–1999 mg/dl; 11.2–22.4 mmol/liter), and Very severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 2000 mg/dl; ≥ 22.4 mmol/liter); the guideline states it modified NCEP ATP III to add very severe hypertriglyceridemia (levels above 2000 mg/dl) and defines severe hypertriglyceridemia as 1000–1999 mg/dl, which indicates risk for development of very severe hypertriglyceridemia.

Triglycerides — treatment targets and pancreatitis risk are outlined as follows: The NLA Expert Panel agreed that an elevated triglyceride level is not a target of therapy per se, except when very high (≥ 500 mg/dL). When triglycerides are between 200 and 499 mg/dL, the targets of therapy are non–HDL-C and LDL-C. Fasting triglyceride levels of ≥ 500 mg/dL (and especially ≥ 1000 mg/dL) are associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis, and a threshold of ≥ 500 mg/dL was selected to define very high triglycerides. In > 65,000 subjects followed for 15 years, the risk of acute pancreatitis increased 4% for each 100 mg/dL increase in triglyceride level. Thus, when the triglyceride concentration is very high (≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially if ≥ 1000 mg/dL), reducing the concentration to < 500 mg/dL to prevent pancreatitis becomes the primary goal of therapy, although there are limited clinical trial data supporting benefits for reducing pancreatitis risk.

### Treatment for patients with the metabolic syndrome [^113wcKq5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome, or insulin resistance syndrome, is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and related mortality and has an estimated age-adjusted US prevalence of 23.7%. Dyslipidemia in the syndrome is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the context of normal/slightly elevated LDL cholesterol. Outcomes in treatment studies in or including diabetic patients suggest that a variety of therapies may be of benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with the metabolic syndrome, including physiologic therapies and pharmacologic treatments, such as aspirin, antihypertensive therapy, anti-ischemic therapy, and lipid-modifying therapies. The recently updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines identify the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of lipid-lowering therapy after LDL cholesterol reduction and recommend use of weight reduction and increased physical activity to address underlying risk factors as well as therapies to address specific lipid and nonlipid risk factors.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — adults aged 40 to 75 years: In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to reevaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy. In adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.7 mmol/L], and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L]), it is reasonable to identify and address other causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^113GJVTE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and acute pancreatitis. Along with lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lowering triglyceride levels in high-risk patients (e.g., those with cardiovascular disease or diabetes) has been associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although the management of mixed dyslipidemia is controversial, treatment should focus primarily on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Secondary goals should include lowering non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (calculated by subtracting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from total cholesterol). If serum triglyceride levels are high, lowering these levels can be effective at reaching non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Initially, patients with hypertriglyceridemia should be counseled about therapeutic lifestyle changes (e.g., healthy diet, regular exercise, tobacco-use cessation). Patients also should be screened for metabolic syndrome and other acquired or secondary causes. Patients with borderline-high serum triglyceride levels (i.e., 150 to 199 mg per dL [1.70 to 2.25 mmol per L]) and high serum triglyceride levels (i.e., 200 to 499 mg per dL [2.26 to 5.64 mmol per L]) require an overall cardiac risk assessment. Treatment of very high triglyceride levels (i.e., 500 mg per dL [5.65 mmol per L] or higher) is aimed at reducing the risk of acute pancreatitis. Statins, fibrates, niacin, and fish oil (alone or in various combinations) are effective when pharmacotherapy is indicated.

Niacin — AACE recommends against the use of niacin in adults with hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) who have ASCVD or are at increased risk for ASCVD in addition to usual care (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against niacin in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) (no recommendation, insufficient evidence).

Cardiometabolic state linked to hypertriglyceridemia — lifestyle-first and very-low-fat targets: If the glucometabolic state is the driver of the triglyceride (TG) disorder, improvement in glycemic control and reducing excess adiposity can potentially fully address hypertriglyceridemia, and lifestyle interventions, including exercise and a healthful eating plan individualized based on underlying causal factors, are the first line of treatment for all TG disorders; in severe genetic predisposition such as FCS, a very-low-fat diet is required to maintain TG levels < 500 mg/dL.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### Clinical considerations for the management of… [^116zUbsT]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Pitavastatin is a currently available therapy and a good choice as a last resort for patients who are otherwise intolerant of statins because it uses a less common clearance pathway, rendering it less susceptible to pharmacokinetic interactions. We discourage clinicians from prescribing the 80-mg dose of simvastatin because it has been shown to significantly increase muscle-related adverse events without benefit. Instead of a low-carbohydrate diet, patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome should be placed on a very low-fat diet. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with triglyceride levels greater than 1, 000 mg per dL without an obvious secondary cause; occurrence at a young age; and debilitating physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms.

2 Intensive therapies such as insulin infusions, plasmapheresis, or parenteral heparin are not standard care or sufficiently supported by the literature to recommend their use; these therapies also carry substantial risks and expense. As mentioned by Dr. Oh and colleagues, expert consultation is required in these cases. 1 For patients with significant hypertriglyceridemia leading to acute pancreatitis, we suggest that other medications be considered to reduce pancreatitis-associated morbidity and mortality. Insulin has been successfully used in the hospital setting and is supported in the literature. 2, 3 Physicians without experience using insulin and other intensive therapies for this indication should consult an expert. Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic condition that should be considered if hypertriglyceridemia is refractory to traditional management, including nutrition, exercise, and medication.

Lowering fat intake is important to consider in the management of familial chylomicronemia syndrome because of the inability of lipoprotein lipase to metabolize triglycerides and fat. 5 REDUCE-IT is the first study of its kind, demonstrating a reduction of mortality in high-risk patients who have elevated triglycerides despite statin therapy. However, another similarly designed study did not show benefit. 6 Additionally, drug therapy should always be the last resort. The most cost-effective therapy is a healthy diet, physical activity, and nonpharmaceutical interventions to lower cardiovascular risk.
