## Question

What are the guideline recommendations for using FibroScan in fatty liver?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guideline recommendations for using FibroScan in fatty liver. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who should be screened and why. Then, I should verify the recommended sequential testing algorithm beginning with blood-based scores and when to escalate to transient elastography. Next, I will review age-specific FIB-4 cutoffs, dual-threshold interpretation of FibroScan, and key performance limitations. After that, I will consider when to prefer MR elastography over FibroScan, special populations, and appropriate follow-up intervals. Finally, I should integrate thresholds into referral and management decisions and close with documentation and patient counseling points supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the target populations for case-finding and fibrosis risk assessment because the yield depends heavily on pretest probability; high-risk groups include those with obesity or metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes or prediabetes even with normal aminotransferases, imaging-detected steatosis, persistently elevated aminotransferases, or a family history of cirrhosis and more than mild alcohol intake, as emphasized by AACE/AASLD 2022, AASLD 2023, and EASL-EASD-EASO 2024 guidance [^114xw7u8] [^112wYGNz] [^115ZNXX8] [^1173p2jy] [^111vGuZy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using FibroScan first-line; I need to verify the recommended sequence, which consistently favors a tiered approach starting with a simple blood-based score (typically FIB-4), followed by imaging-based elastography only if FIB-4 is indeterminate or elevated, per AASLD 2023, EASL-EASD-EASO 2024, and AASLD 2025 blood-based guidance, with UK quality standards also endorsing two-step pathways in primary care where feasible [^111EWoPD] [^116ochts] [^116tSXS3] [^113DtiLm].

> I should double-check the FIB-4 cutoffs by age since misclassification is common in older adults; for those ≤ 65 years, < 1.3 rules out advanced fibrosis, 1.3–2.67 is indeterminate, and > 2.67 suggests high risk, whereas for those > 65 years, more conservative cutoffs (< 2.0 low risk, 2.0–3.25 indeterminate, > 3.25 high risk) are advisable, with low-risk patients generally managed in primary care and a documented very low short- to medium-term liver event rate, around 2.6 per 1,000 patient-years, justifying cardiovascular risk prioritization [^113ySWPf] [^1126AcTQ] [^114Maziq].

> Wait, let me verify the transient elastography thresholds and what they actually do; a dual-cutoff strategy improves clinical utility, with about 8.0 kPa optimized to rule out advanced fibrosis (sensitivity ~93%, high NPV) and about 12.0 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis (specificity ~88%), accepting that 25–30% of patients will fall into an indeterminate zone requiring additional testing such as ELF, MR elastography, or selective biopsy — importantly, I initially thought 8 kPa might "rule in", but that is incorrect; the lower threshold is for rule-out given its sensitivity and NPV, whereas the higher threshold is for rule-in given its specificity [^113snANe].

> I need to ensure we account for performance modifiers and limitations; obesity can impair VCTE reliability, ascites precludes transmission, and acute hepatic inflammation or cholestasis can artifactually elevate stiffness, contributing to the suboptimal PPV near 12 kPa and ~25% unreliable/uninterpretable rates in some obese cohorts, so FibroScan should not be used as a standalone arbiter of stage and must be interpreted in clinical context and alongside other tests when needed [^1171UTbE] [^1179MW9P].

> Next, I should review when to prefer FibroScan versus MR elastography; FibroScan is appropriate and widely available for second-line risk stratification and longitudinal use when body habitus and concomitant conditions permit, whereas MRE is preferred when accuracy is paramount, in severe obesity or indeterminate VCTE results, or when cross-sectional imaging is already indicated, consistent with AGA 2017 and AASLD 2025 imaging guidance recommending MRE when ultrasound-based elastography accuracy may be compromised [^1139z7xL] [^1113gag9].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases so I don't miss nuances; lean MASLD generally follows the same sequential algorithm but should prompt consideration of genetic or secondary causes if fibrosis is discordant, T2DM warrants screening even with normal transaminases, alcohol-related disease often uses higher VCTE thresholds (approximately 12–15 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis) and should be reassessed after at least four weeks of abstinence when inflammation is present, and pediatrics require NASPGHAN-directed, age-specific approaches rather than adult cutoffs [^111Rtjcv] [^111EWoPD] [^113xQUus] [^113QFrqt] [^112uqQgQ].

> I will now examine appropriate monitoring intervals and triggers because timing matters; low-risk patients by FIB-4 and/or VCTE can be reassessed every 1–3 years, with earlier re-evaluation for incident T2DM, worsening metabolic control, significant weight gain, rising aminotransferases, or new imaging steatosis, whereas higher-risk or pharmacotherapy-treated individuals merit 6–12 month follow-up, and I should not rely on FIB-4 in contexts of non-hepatic thrombocytopenia that would bias results [^113DtiLm] [^114zBqfj] [^112xzfAq].

> But wait, what if results are discordant; I should confirm referral and management thresholds pragmatically — consider hepatology referral for FibroScan > 12 kPa, FIB-4 > 3.25, or otherwise indeterminate results needing ELF, MRE, or biopsy, and initiate cirrhosis care pathways when appropriate for HCC surveillance every 6 months and variceal screening; importantly, structured pathways using the sequential approach have increased advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis detection while reducing unnecessary referrals substantially [^111EWoPD] [^111vEgcd] [^117YVd4r].

> Hold on, I should verify whether adjunct NITs add value in the gray zone; in patients with suspected NASH with at least F2 fibrosis, the FAST score and other composite tools can reduce unnecessary biopsies by enriching for clinically significant disease, acknowledging that an indeterminate proportion persists and decisions must be individualized to diagnostic uncertainty and therapeutic implications [^117Pi5QN].

> I need to ensure documentation and communication are explicit; record the pretest probability based on metabolic risks, the FIB-4 result justifying elastography, the exact liver stiffness and its interpretation using the dual cutoffs, a specific next step for indeterminate values such as ELF or MRE, and the follow-up interval; counsel that FibroScan is a powerful screening and risk-stratification tool with high rule-out value but is not a replacement for biopsy when histology will change management, and should not be used alone to assert regression or progression without supporting context [^113snANe] [^1179MW9P].

> Finally, let me reconsider prognostic use and longitudinal interpretation so I don't overstate precision; liver stiffness correlates with outcomes and can stratify risk, and serial changes can be meaningful, but per AASLD 2025, increases or decreases should be interpreted within an individualized clinical context accounting for modifiers rather than as a sole surrogate of progression or regression, with outcome-linked classifications also supporting prognostication in NAFLD cohorts [^1128m1d9] [^1165DBXe].

FibroScan is recommended for risk stratification [^114xw7u8] in fatty liver disease, especially in patients with T2DM [^112wYGNz], obesity [^115ZNXX8], or metabolic syndrome [^111vGuZy]. Use a two-step approach [^116ochts], starting with FIB-4 [^116c12jw], then performing FibroScan if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high [^111EWoPD]. For NAFLD, LSM [^116DSmpq] < 8 kPa rules out advanced fibrosis [^113snANe], 8–12 kPa is indeterminate, and > 12 kPa suggests advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Repeat FibroScan every 1–3 years [^113DtiLm] based on risk and clinical changes [^113cLbup]. Interpret results in context [^11619LYs], as obesity, inflammation, and alcohol can affect accuracy [^1171UTbE]; use MRE [^111g7uQY] or biopsy if results are inconclusive or discordant [^113DtiLm].

## Indications for fibroscan in fatty liver disease

FibroScan is indicated for risk stratification in fatty liver disease, especially in patients with metabolic risk factors [^116ochts]:

- **T2DM**: Even with normal liver enzymes [^114jBjVv] [^112wYGNz].
- **Obesity/metabolic syndrome**: Especially with abnormal LFTs or imaging steatosis [^114xw7u8] [^1173p2jy].
- **Abnormal LFTs**: Persistent elevation > 6 months [^1126AcTQ] [^114xw7u8].
- **High-risk groups**: T1DM with obesity/metabolic syndrome, elevated aminotransferases, or imaging steatosis [^115ZNXX8] [^111mAGMj].

---

## Recommended clinical pathway for fibrosis assessment

A two-step approach is recommended for fibrosis assessment in fatty liver disease [^113DtiLm]. Step 1 uses **FIB-4** [^116tSXS3] or the NAFLD fibrosis score [^116ochts] to stratify risk [^111EWoPD]. Step 2 entails performing **FibroScan** [^116ochts] when FIB-4 is indeterminate or high [^111EWoPD] to clarify fibrosis stage [^1126AcTQ]. This pathway improves accuracy and reduces unnecessary referrals [^117YVd4r].

---

## Fibroscan cutoff values for fibrosis staging

FibroScan uses **LSM** to stage fibrosis in NAFLD:

| **Fibrosis stage** | **LSM (kPa)** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| F0–F1 | < 8 | No/mild fibrosis |
| F2 | 8–10 | Significant fibrosis |
| F3 | 10–12 | Advanced fibrosis |
| F4 | > 12 | Cirrhosis |

---

A **dual-cutoff strategy** is recommended: use < 8 kPa to rule out advanced fibrosis [^113snANe] and > 12 kPa to rule in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.

---

## Frequency of fibroscan monitoring

FibroScan monitoring should be **individualized** by risk and clinical context: reassess low-risk patients every 2–3 years [^113DtiLm], intermediate-risk patients every 1–2 years, and high-risk patients annually or as clinically indicated [^112xzfAq]. Repeat testing is recommended with significant clinical changes or new risk factors [^114zBqfj].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Key **limitations and contraindications** include:

- **Obesity**: May reduce accuracy; consider XL probe or MRE [^1171UTbE] [^111g7uQY].
- **Inflammation**: Elevated ALT can overestimate stiffness [^113QFrqt].
- **Alcohol**: Recent intake can affect results [^113QFrqt].
- **Ascites**: Contraindicated due to unreliable measurements.
- **Pregnancy**: Generally avoided due to limited data.

---

## Integration with other noninvasive tests

FibroScan should be **combined with other noninvasive tests** [^112xzfAq] for comprehensive assessment: use FIB-4 or APRI for initial risk stratification [^112wYGNz] [^116c12jw]. If FIB-4 is indeterminate, the ELF test is an appropriate second-line option [^113DtiLm] [^1126AcTQ], and consider MRE [^111g7uQY] when FibroScan accuracy is compromised [^113n1tgz].

---

## Clinical decision-making based on fibroscan results

FibroScan results **guide clinical decisions**:

- **LSM < 8 kPa**: Low risk; manage in primary care with lifestyle and cardiovascular risk reduction [^113snANe].
- **LSM 8–12 kPa**: Indeterminate; refer to hepatology for further evaluation [^113DtiLm].
- **LSM > 12 kPa**: High risk; refer for specialist management, surveillance, and possible biopsy [^113snANe].

---

## Follow-up and management strategies

Follow-up and management **depend on fibrosis stage**: manage low-risk patients with lifestyle modification, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and periodic monitoring [^114WCTNs]; refer intermediate-risk patients for further testing and targeted interventions [^113DtiLm]; and for high-risk patients, provide specialist management, surveillance for complications, and consider pharmacotherapy or clinical trial enrollment [^115ZNXX8].

---

FibroScan is a **noninvasive tool** [^117Qbmga] for assessing fibrosis in fatty liver disease, and a two-step approach with FIB-4 followed by FibroScan is recommended [^116ochts]. Results should be interpreted in context, and management should be individualized based on fibrosis stage and risk factors [^112MRk9T].

Transient elastography (TE) is better at ruling out than ruling in advanced fibrosis. For instance, at a cutoff value of 8 kPa, TE has negative predictive values (NPVs) and sensitivities greater than 90% but suboptimal positive predictive values (PPVs) and specificities less than 70%, resulting in false-positive results in 30% to 40% of cases. The high NPV of TE is particularly important in facilitating the ability of primary care providers (PCPs) to identify patients not requiring specialty referral.

- **Figure explanation**: The negative predictive value (NPV) is better than the positive predictive value (PPV) for transient elastography (TE).

A dual cutoff strategy with a lower cutoff maximizing sensitivity and a higher cutoff maximizing specificity has been refined recently for NAFLD. In a large, individual-patient meta-analysis based on real-world data in 5648 patients with chronic liver disease, an 8 kPa cutoff had 93% sensitivity to rule out advanced fibrosis, while a 12 kPa cutoff had 88% specificity for ruling in advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD (n = 1073). However, this was at the expense of a significant number of unclassified patients (25% to 30%) falling between the two cutoffs in whom a liver biopsy would be necessary. In actual practice, a commonly used inflection point for considering liver biopsy by the panelists is 8.0 to 8.5 kPa, but decisions should be individualized based on factors such as diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. the need to exclude alternative liver diseases) or consideration of pharmacological treatment, including potential enrollment in clinical trials.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, adult patients, AACE/AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend considering screening for clinically significant fibrosis (stages F2-F4) using the FIB-4 index in patients with T2DM, even if they have normal liver enzyme levels.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^113DtiLm]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with NAFLD should undergo sequential use of a simple non-invasive test (e.g. FIB-4) and specialist non-invasive tests (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) to assess the severity of fibrosis. Ideally, an initial fibrosis assessment should be conducted in primary care, and patients with suspected advanced fibrosis should be referred to secondary care as they have the greatest risk of hepatic morbidity.

In secondary care, fibrosis stage should be confirmed, or second-line testing conducted with more specialist tests in individuals where simple non-invasive tests are indeterminate. The performance of biomarkers may be influenced by the prevalence of the target condition in the population being assessed, so clinicians should consider the likely disease prevalence in their practice setting and adopt suitable test thresholds to achieve the desired performance. In general, the use of simple non-invasive tests excludes the majority of cases with mild fibrosis. The addition of a second-line test (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) further reduces the number of cases with an indeterminate score, allowing liver biopsy to be reserved for use in a minority of patients where it adds additional useful information.

Such two-stage care pathways are currently considered to provide the most robust means for the risk stratification of patients with NAFLD. Ongoing regular non-invasive fibrosis reassessment should be considered every 1–3 years to monitor the response to treatment or for fibrosis progression.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically with respect to the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend using a multi-step approach in adult patients with MASLD:

- **Non-patented blood-based score**: Obtain an established non-patented blood-based score, such as the fibrosis-4 index, as the first step.

- **Established imaging techniques**: Obtain established imaging techniques, such as liver elastography, as the second step to further clarify the fibrosis stage if fibrosis is still suspected or in high-risk groups.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111EWoPD]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, particularly during the initial evaluation, the AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining vibration-controlled elastography, magnetic resonance elastography, or enhanced liver fibrosis tests to exclude advanced fibrosis if the FIB-4 index is ≥ 1.3.

---

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^111g7uQY]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the evaluation of fibrosis, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining either ultrasound-based elastography or magnetic resonance elastography to stage fibrosis in adult patients with chronic liver disease. Consider obtaining magnetic resonance elastography depending on local availability and expertise. This is particularly important when concomitant cross-sectional imaging is required or if the accuracy of ultrasound-based elastography might be compromised.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114jBjVv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

An algorithm for fibrosis assessment and monitoring is based on the discussion of the Clinical Assertion Statements. ELF indicates Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test; FAST, FibroScan-AST; FIB-4, Fibrosis-4; MRE, magnetic resonance elastography; NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NIT, noninvasive test; NFS, NAFLD Fibrosis Score; T2D, type 2 diabetes; TE, transient elastography.

- **Statement 5**: In patients with NAFLD and metabolic risks, the presence of hepatic fibrosis should be considered regardless of the level of transaminase elevation. This statement targets PCPs, who often do not consider the risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and metabolic risk factors, particularly in those with normal transaminases. "Consideration of hepatic fibrosis" may include diagnostic efforts, interventions, or eventual referral to a specialist. The statement may challenge deep-rooted PCP-referral patterns that rely heavily on transaminase elevation. Emerging literature suggests that an approach based on transaminase elevation likely will miss many patients with NASH and clinically significant fibrosis (≥ F2) — stages that correlate with adverse liver outcomes.

While organizations' guidelines agree that patients with NAFLD, cardiometabolic risk factors, and elevated transaminases should be evaluated for hepatic fibrosis, disagreement exists on how to proceed if transaminases are "normal" in the presence of the other two variables. Various guidelines recommend for, and against, routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends…

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^116c12jw]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The AASLD 2025 guidelines focus on the classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, with a particular emphasis on the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis. These guidelines recommend using simple, less costly, and readily available blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment tests, such as FIB-4 or NAFLD fibrosis score, over complex proprietary tests. This approach is advised for the detection of advanced fibrosis in patients with MASLD requiring fibrosis staging.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^1113gag9]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment tests to detect significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis in adult patients with MASLD.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114Maziq]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ideally, second-stage non-invasive testing should be delivered in the community to reduce unnecessary referrals to secondary care for some individuals with a false positive simple NIT. However, where these services are not available in the community, patients should be referred to secondary services for further workup.

The overwhelming majority of liver-related complications in patients with NAFLD occur in those with cirrhosis. NITs have high negative predictive values for advanced fibrosis, so they can reliably exclude the presence of cirrhosis. Moreover, long-term follow-up studies have shown that patients with low-risk NITs have a very low risk of liver-related events in the short to medium term, and their main morbidity is cardiovascular disease and non-hepatic malignancy. One recent long-term follow-up study of 1,057 patients showed that individuals with NAFLD and a FIB-4 score < 1.3 had a very low incidence rate for liver-related events of 2.6 per 1,000 patient-years. Therefore, for these patients, the focus should be on lifestyle advice and cardiovascular risk reduction with the aim of improving their overall quality and length of life.

NAFLD can progress to advanced fibrosis in a significant proportion of patients in the medium term, particularly those with, or who develop, T2DM and those who gain weight. Therefore, individuals with these risk factors should be targeted for more proactive lifestyle modification, optimization of treatment for T2DM, and cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1126AcTQ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, recent guidance by NICE on NAFLD proposed single testing with serum ELF measurements without recourse to algorithms or other diagnostic modalities, on the basis of cost-effectiveness analyses. This recommendation was noted and carefully considered during the drafting of this guideline. On balance, however, it was felt that the evidence for diagnostic tests, and their use in combination in NAFLD, was still evolving and thus this guidance took a broader view, setting out a pathway structure with a range of options. This view is endorsed by the EASL-ALEH guidelines for the non-invasive assessment of liver disease.

- **Recommendation 7**: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine their extent of liver fibrosis. First-line testing should use either FIB-4 or NAFLD Fibrosis Score — see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems (level 5, grade D). Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum ELF measurements or Fibroscan/ARFI elastography (level 2b, grade B). We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area figures 1 and 2.

- **Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD)**: Alcohol-related cirrhosis is the most common cause of liver-related mortality in Western populations. The majority of patients with this condition are heavy daily drinkers, with a median alcohol consumption of around 120 units/week. Notably, 25% of the population drink more than this amount.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^111GjRGP]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated advancing liver fibrosis as the key predictor of liver-related events and mortality in patients with NAFLD. Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (equivalent to Brunt fibrosis stage 3 or 4) are at increased risk of complications of chronic liver disease, decompensation, liver transplantation, and death in the short- to medium-term.

Since liver blood tests and ultrasound poorly discriminate fibrosis stage, primary care pathways for patients with NAFLD should assess for the presence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using validated non-invasive fibrosis tests. Accordingly, we suggest the finding of liver steatosis on ultrasound or unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should prompt risk assessment for liver fibrosis. Use validated widely available non-invasive tests with high negative predictive value to risk-assess for significant liver fibrosis in the community. Refer patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis to a hepatologist. For patients stratified as indeterminate risk, offer further discriminatory tests such as transient elastography or ELF test or refer for further evaluation.

Indirect biomarkers of liver fibrosis, such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis score, have been shown to have prognostic value for long-term outcomes and are validated against liver biopsy with good negative predictive value to rule out advanced liver fibrosis in NAFLD. They combine routinely applied laboratory measures and are essential in the management pathway.

### Fibroscan versus simple noninvasive screening tools in predicting fibrosis in high-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients from Western India [^117FKe4F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of Fibroscan versus noninvasive markers, i.e. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS); Aspartate-aminotransferase (AST)/platelet ratio (APRI); and AST/Alanine-aminotransferase (AAR) as a screening tool in NAFLD patients with a high risk of liver fibrosis.

- **Methods**: This is a single-center study carried out in patients attending the outpatient department for dyspepsia and diagnosed with fatty liver on ultrasound. Liver biopsy was advised in cases of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, body mass index > 30 kg/m², raised transaminases, and hypothyroidism. Fibroscan, APRI, AAR, and NFS were calculated. Area under the curve (AUROC), negative predictive values (NPV), and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for each diagnostic test.

- **Results**: Of the 1500 patients screened, 110 with the above-described risk factors underwent liver biopsy (stage 3/4 fibrosis = 38). Diabetes predicted severe fibrosis (stage 3/4). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUROC for Fibroscan at a value of 12 kPa were 0.9, 0.8, 0.70, 0.93, and 0.91, respectively, for predicting stage 3/4 fibrosis. With an increase in severity of liver fibrosis, there was a stepwise increase in Fibroscan values (P < 0.000038, Kruskal-Wallis test). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for AAR and NFS at cutoffs of 1.5 and 0.676 were 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92, and 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.92, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Fibroscan, NFS, and AAR are simple noninvasive markers of fibrosis that can be utilized as screening tools in patients with a high risk for fibrosis to determine the need for biopsy.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^112N8xqt]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend considering liver stiffness measurement obtained before initiating antiviral therapy as the most accurate longitudinal noninvasive liver disease assessment parameter for prognostication. This recommendation is based on limited evidence associating liver stiffness measurement with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved in patients with treated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD special interest group [^117YVd4r]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Exemplar pathways exist as recently reviewed. The Camden and Islington NAFLD pathway stratified fibrosis in over 1,450 patients with NAFLD over two years using FIB-4 in all patients and the ELF test in FIB-4 indeterminate cases. Patients identified as high-risk for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were re-assessed in secondary care, resulting in a five-fold increase in detection of advanced fibrosis, a three-fold increase in detection of cirrhosis, and an 81% reduction in referrals of patients with mild disease compared to the absence of any defined care pathway.

Numerous cost-effectiveness studies have demonstrated the benefit of such risk stratification strategies. The use of serum markers and elastography, either alone or in combination, has been shown to be clinically effective and cost-saving compared to standard care.

Patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, whose liver disease is not outweighed by comorbidities or performance status, should be referred to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease for further evaluation.

For patients stratified as indeterminate risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis using simple non-invasive tests (NIT), the result is neither sensitive nor specific enough to confidently rule in or rule out advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. A second-tier liver fibrosis test, such as a direct collagen biomarker (e.g. ELF) or elastography (e.g. transient elastography), should be offered. Although the optimum pathway has not yet been determined, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography is recommended.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^111vEgcd]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The management of chronic liver disease for patients with NAFLD who are at risk of developing liver-related complications, such as those with cirrhosis and significant advanced fibrosis, requires a secondary care setting. This approach is similar to the management of patients with other liver disease etiologies.

Regular surveillance of patients with cirrhosis through 6-monthly ultrasound is one of the quality standards established by NICE. This allows for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and prompt treatment, which can enhance individual survival. Regular monitoring also permits early detection and treatment of liver-related complications, such as ascites, varices, and hepatic encephalopathy, and allows timely referral for liver transplantation once clinical thresholds are met. The process should be individualized, counseling against active monitoring for those with significant comorbidities and poor performance status.

Individuals with NASH who have significant (F2), advanced fibrosis (F3), or cirrhosis (F4) are at risk of progression to end-stage liver disease and potential complications in the medium to long term. Therefore, secondary care follow-up may be appropriate for these individuals to consider specific treatment for NASH or investigational drugs. Accordingly, individuals with NAFLD who are at significantly increased risk of disease progression and potential liver-related complications should continue to be managed in the secondary care setting. This includes patients with cirrhosis or significant advanced fibrosis.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Controlling an emerging epidemic, challenges, and future directions [^1171UTbE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging techniques that measure liver stiffness, such as transient elastography (TE) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), have emerged as being more accurate in predicting liver fibrosis. TE can have conflicting results in obese patients, primarily because subcutaneous fatty tissue attenuates the elastic shear wave, reducing diagnostic reliability. Additionally, though TE represents a convenient and non-invasive test, approximately 25% of results are unreliable or uninterpretable. MRE is superior to TE and is excellent for identifying varying degrees of fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). MRE has a specificity of 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83–0.96) and a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.65–0.97) in identifying patients with advanced fibrosis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends the use of TE and MRE for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and evaluating inflammation or fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is limited by its invasiveness, cost, and sampling error. The lack of an accurate, non-invasive method for distinguishing non-alcoholic fatty liver from NASH with fibrosis remains one of the unmet needs in the management of patients with NAFLD. Other diagnostic methods show promising results in the use of hepatic collagen fractional synthesis rate (FSR), and plasma FSR, which correlates with hepatic fibrosis in humans. However, larger studies are required to validate these findings.

### Practice patterns in NAFLD and NASH: Real life differs from published guidelines [^114PMC6X]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Management guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, and American Gastroenterology Association published in 2012 for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) recommend weight loss, vitamin E, and pioglitazone as effective therapies for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed NASH. However, little is known about how physicians in the U.S. diagnose NASH or whether published guidelines are being followed.

- **Methods**: We assessed diagnostic and treatment patterns of the management of NAFLD and NASH among academic gastroenterologists and hepatologists in the U.S. using a standardized survey. This survey was developed to collect information regarding respondents' practice environments, diagnostic techniques, and medication usage in patients with NAFLD/NASH.

- **Results**: We invited 482 gastroenterologists and hepatologists, predominantly from academic centers, of whom 163 completed the survey. Only 24% of providers routinely perform liver biopsy, predominantly among patients with elevated serum aminotransferases. Vitamin E is prescribed regularly by 70%, while only 14% routinely prescribe pioglitazone. Despite recommendations to the contrary, approximately 25% prescribe pioglitazone or vitamin E without biopsy confirmation of NASH. Metformin is used as frequently as pioglitazone despite its proven lack of efficacy in NASH. Overall, 40–73% adhere to published guidelines, depending on the specific question. There was no significant difference seen in adherence to guidelines between gastroenterologists and hepatologists.

### A prospective cohort study of the use of the fatty liver index and Fibroscan to determine the prevalence of fatty liver disease in an Irish population [^111a1Drb]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Rates of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are increasing worldwide. The fatty liver index (FLI) is a noninvasive predictor of NAFLD. This prospective cohort study used the FLI to estimate the prevalence of NAFLD in patients attending an Irish Acute Medical Unit (AMU) and assessed the degree of fibrosis in this group using Fibroscan.

- **Methods**: Patients attending the AMU over a 3-month period were invited to participate. Patients with excess alcohol consumption or pre-existing liver disease were excluded. Using established FLI cut-offs, 414 participants were grouped into low (FLI ≤ 30), medium (30–60), and high risk of NAFLD. High-risk patients were offered review including liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score.

- **Results**: A total of 134 patients were at low risk, 96 at medium risk, and 184 at high risk of NAFLD. Male sex (P < 0.001) was associated with increased risk. In the high-risk group, 30.2% had a LSM > 7 kPa. Higher FLI scores were associated with higher CAP scores (P < 0.001), suggesting development of fibrosis.

### AGA clinical practice update: Diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in lean individuals: Expert review [^111Rtjcv]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized as a leading etiology for chronic liver disease, affecting more than 25% of the US and global populations. Up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although NAFLD is observed predominantly in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, an estimated 7%-20% of individuals with NAFLD have lean body habitus. Limited guidance is available to clinicians on appropriate clinical evaluation in lean individuals with NAFLD, such as for inherited/genetic disorders, lipodystrophy, drug-induced NAFLD, and inflammatory disorders. Emerging data now provide more robust evidence to define the epidemiology, natural history, prognosis, and mortality of lean individuals with NAFLD. Multiple studies have found that NAFLD among lean individuals is associated with increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality relative to those without NAFLD. This American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update provides best practice advice to assist clinicians in evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in lean individuals.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113ySWPf]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver fibrosis algorithm: For patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or liver disease of unknown etiology, the next step is to determine the likelihood of liver fibrosis. Initial assessment includes calculation of a FIB-4 or NAFLD fibrosis score, with values < 1.3 and ≤ 1.455, respectively, signifying a low risk of advanced fibrosis. Higher cut-off points, < 2.0 and < 0.12, should be used for patients aged over 65 years. Second-line tests that should be considered include serum markers such as enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and imaging modalities such as acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography/FibroScan.

For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendations. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and should be tailored to the device used. Definitions: ARFI - acoustic radiation force impulse; ELF - enhanced liver fibrosis; FIB-4 - fibrosis-4; HCC - hepatocellular carcinoma; NAFLD - non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NFS - NAFLD fibrosis score.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of noninvasive biomarkers in the evaluation and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Expert review [^112xzfAq]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the use of noninvasive tests (NITs) in the evaluation and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD affects nearly 30% of the global population and is a growing cause of end-stage liver disease and liver-related health care resource utilization. However, only a minority of all patients with NAFLD experience a liver-related outcome. It is therefore critically important for clinicians to assess prognosis and identify those with increased risk of disease progression and negative clinical outcomes at the time of initial assessment. It is equally important to assess disease trajectory over time, particularly in response to currently available therapeutic approaches.

The reference standard for the assessment of prognosis and disease monitoring is the histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens. There are, however, many limitations of liver biopsies and their reading that have limited their use in routine practice. The utilization of NITs facilitates risk stratification of patients and longitudinal assessment of disease progression for patients with NAFLD. This clinical update provides best practice advice based on a review of the literature on the utilization of NITs in the management of NAFLD for clinicians. Accordingly, a combination of available evidence and consensus-based expert opinion, without formal rating of the strength and quality of the evidence, was used to develop these best practices.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117CHg7V]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Approach to common conditions: NAFLD

NAFLD is diagnosed by the presence of an echobright liver on ultrasound in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. For adults with NAFLD, it is recommended that a first-line, non-invasive assessment, such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), is undertaken to identify patients with advanced fibrosis. Patients with a low FIB-4 (≤ 65 years) or low NFS (≤ 65 years) can be managed in primary care. Presently, the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD is to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity with the aim of inducing gradual and long-term weight loss.

- **Non-invasive algorithms**: For patients with indeterminate FIB-4 (1.3–3.25) or NFS scores (−1.455 to 0.675), further testing with a second-line test such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is advised. The decision to use Fibroscan or ARFI should be based on local expertise and the availability of respective devices. Consider referral to a specialist clinic for patients with serum ELF measurements > 9.5 or Fibroscan > 7.8 kPa. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and thus should be tailored to the device used.

Finally, those patients with elevated FIB-4 (> 3.25) or NFS (> 0.675) should be considered for referral to a specialist clinic irrespective of second-line tests.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^1141fY4d]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the general population. The evidence base for the investigation and management of NAFLD is large and growing, but there is currently little practical guidance to support the development of services and delivery of care.

To address this, we produced a series of evidence-based quality standards and recommendations for the management of NAFLD, with the aim of improving patient care. A multidisciplinary group of experts from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and the British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group produced the recommendations.

- **Management before the gastroenterology or liver clinic**: Recommendations cover the management of people with, or at risk of, NAFLD.
- **Assessment and investigations in secondary care**: Assessment and investigations are discussed for secondary care settings.
- **Management in secondary care**: Guidance for management within secondary care is provided.

The quality of evidence for each recommendation was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. An anonymous modified Delphi voting process was conducted individually by each member of the group to assess the level of agreement with each statement. Statements were included when agreement was 80% or greater.

From the final list of statements, a smaller number of auditable key performance indicators were selected to allow services to benchmark their practice. It is hoped that services will review their practice against our recommendations and key performance indicators and institute service development where needed to improve the care of patients with NAFLD.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^117Pi5QN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These stages correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and indicate potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with a NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4 and ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising noninvasive tool (NIT) is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by transient elastography (TE) with AST. In the derivative and validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of approximately 0.80 and two author-determined cutoffs. The first (≤ 0.35) was to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4 and ≥ F2, and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4 and ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

### Update on the role of elastography in liver disease [^11619LYs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the assessment of its severity are important for providing appropriate management, determining the prognosis, or identifying the need for surveillance. Currently, for fibrosis staging, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with shear wave elastography (SWE) techniques is considered a reliable substitute for liver biopsy in several clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that stiffness value is a biomarker of diffuse liver disease that must be interpreted taking into consideration anamnesis, clinical, and laboratory data.

In patients with diffuse liver disease, it is more clinically relevant to determine the likelihood of advanced disease rather than to obtain an exact stage of liver fibrosis using a histologic classification. In this regard, a "rule of five" for LSMs with vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and a "rule of four" for LSMs with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)-based techniques have been proposed. In patients with advanced chronic liver disease (CLD), the risk of liver decompensation increases with increasing liver stiffness value.

SWE has been proposed as a tool to predict the risk of death or complications in patients with CLD. LSM by VCTE combined with platelet count is a validated non-invasive method for varices screening, with very good results in terms of invasive procedures being spared. ARFI-based techniques also show some promising results in this setting. LSM, alone or combined in scores or algorithms with other parameters, is used to evaluate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically in relation to indications for screening adult patients, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend considering case-finding screening strategies. These strategies are advised for MASLD with liver fibrosis in patients having cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, to potentially prevent progression to cirrhosis and its complications:

- **Overweight or obesity**:
	- BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² (≥ 23 kg/m² in people of Asian ethnicity)
	- Waist circumference ≥ 94 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females (Europeans)
	- ≥ 90 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females (South Asians and Chinese)
	- ≥ 85 cm in males and ≥ 90 cm in females (Japanese)

- **Dysglycemia or T2DM**:
	- Prediabetes: HbA1c 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%) or fasting plasma glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL) or 2-hour plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance test 7.8–11 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL)
	- T2DM: HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5%) or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (≥ 126 mg/dL) or 2-hour plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (≥ 200 mg/dL)
	- Treatment for T2DM

- **Dyslipidemia**:
	- Plasma triglycerides ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (≥ 150 mg/dL)
	- HDL-C ≤ 1.0 mmol/L (≤ 39 mg/dL) in males and ≤ 1.3 mmol/L (≤ 50 mg/dL) in females
	- Lipid-lowering treatment

- **BP**:
	- ≥ 130/85 mmHg
	- Treatment for hypertension

### Noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: Present and future [^111TukCw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from simple fatty liver, which generally follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. At present, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to diagnose NASH and establish the presence of fibrosis. Noninvasive clinically available tests lack accuracy and reliability.

In light of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD, along with significant research efforts in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, noninvasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable biomarkers are greatly needed. They will not only help in the diagnosis of NASH but also be useful for the assessment of treatment response and prognosis, remaining a research priority in the NAFLD field.

The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

For those discharged to primary care, recommendations should be made on triggers for re-referral back to secondary care liver services (Recommendation 33, Table 1). A baseline assessment cannot adequately exclude the future possibility of fibrosis progression and liver-related outcomes, particularly as patients might accumulate further risk factors and metabolic comorbidities over time. There is also the possibility of a false negative baseline fibrosis assessment that could lead to an inappropriate patient discharge to primary care. Therefore, systems should be in place for the re-evaluation of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD discharged to primary care. The method of fibrosis assessment should be based on local availability and expertise. Some patients may require specific follow-up recommendations; for example, it would be inappropriate to use the FIB-4 score to follow up a patient with non-liver-related thrombocytopenia because this could lead to a false positive result. Moreover, it may be appropriate to suggest no further fibrosis assessments in patients who have significant comorbidities or frailty where management of liver disease would not alter their long-term outcomes.

Other potential triggers for re-referral might include a significant increase in serum liver enzyme values and/or laboratory indicators of advanced chronic liver disease, such as decreasing albumin, increased prothrombin time, and increased bilirubin. Furthermore, the development of T2DM should prompt a fibrosis reassessment because this has been linked with liver disease progression.

### Fibroscan versus simple noninvasive screening tools in predicting fibrosis in high-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients from Western India [^1137AjGS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The term nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterizes a condition of excess fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of significant amounts of alcohol consumption, usually defined as less than 20 g of ethanol per day. NAFLD is a common disorder worldwide, with prevalence ranging from 10–30% in various countries. The disease spectrum includes benign steatosis, which has a low probability of progression, and steatohepatitis (15%), which is characterized by rapid progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Detection of this small fraction is of utmost importance for aggressive management.

Ultrasound detects fatty liver with good sensitivity but does not differentiate simple steatosis from steatohepatitis. Serum transaminases have low value in predicting steatohepatitis. The only gold standard test for detecting this fraction with increased risk of progression is liver biopsy. However, applying liver biopsy to all patients with NAFLD is impractical and should be advised only in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or raised liver enzymes. Even when there is a high risk of fibrosis, such as in diabetic patients, the population is large enough to merit carrying out an invasive procedure to rule out fibrosis.

Therefore, an easy, rapid, accurate, and noninvasive screening test is needed to select the small fraction of NAFLD patients for liver biopsy. Fibroscan (transient elastography) measures liver stiffness by estimating the velocity of propagation of a shear wave through liver tissue.

### Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic significance of blood fibrosis tests and liver stiffness measurement by FibroScan in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1165DBXe]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

NAFLD is highly prevalent, but only a small subset of patients develop advanced liver fibrosis with impaired liver-related prognosis. This study aimed to compare blood fibrosis tests and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the evaluation of prognosis in NAFLD.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in a cross-sectional study including 452 NAFLD patients with liver biopsy (NASH-CRN fibrosis stage), LSM, and eight blood fibrosis tests (BARD, NAFLD fibrosis score, FibroMeter(NAFLD), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), FIB4, FibroTest, Hepascore, FibroMeter(V2G)). Prognostic accuracy was evaluated in a longitudinal study including 360 NAFLD patients.

- **Results**: LSM and FibroMeter(V2G) were the two best-performing tests in the cross-sectional study; AUROCs for advanced fibrosis (F3/4) were, respectively, 0.831 ± 0.019 and 0.817 ± 0.020 (p ≤ 0.041 vs. other tests). The rates of patients with ⩾90% negative/positive predictive values for F3/4 were 56.4% and 46.7% (p < 0.001 vs. other tests). Obuchowski indexes were 0.834 ± 0.014 and 0.798 ± 0.016 (p ≤ 0.036 vs. other tests). Two fibrosis classifications were developed to precisely estimate the histological fibrosis stage from LSM or FibroMeter(V2G) results without liver biopsy, with diagnostic accuracy of 80.8% vs. 77.4% (p = 0.190), respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves in the longitudinal study showed that both classifications categorized NAFLD patients into subgroups with significantly different prognoses (p < 0.001).

Identification of people with NAFLD

Use of defined pathways for investigating suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests (Recommendation 1, Table 1). Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or T2DM; hypertriglyceridemia; low HDL; increased waist circumference, or high blood pressure. NAFLD is highly prevalent in those with T2DM or metabolic syndrome, and the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or metabolic syndrome (Recommendation 2, Table 1).

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3,688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease.
