## Question

management of prolonged qt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of prolonged QT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and measuring QTc accurately. Then, I should classify whether the QT prolongation is congenital or acquired. Next, I will assess immediate risk and decide on monitoring and disposition. After that, I need to remove reversible causes, especially drugs and electrolytes. Then, I will initiate acute therapy if torsades occurs, followed by chronic risk stratification and long-term management, including beta-blockers, genotype-specific therapies, and device decisions. Finally, I should address special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with thresholds and actions, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and ensure QTc is measured correctly, because automated ECG readouts can mislead and manual measurement is essential. I should measure in leads II and V5 from the earliest QRS onset to the latest T-wave return to baseline, and I need to correct for heart rate using Bazett or Fridericia, recognizing Bazett's overcorrection at high rates and undercorrection at low rates, with Fridericia often more robust at faster heart rates, and I should double-check for U waves that can obscure the T-wave endpoint [^114mPDSR] [^1163reB9] [^113EMYDX].

> Wait, let me verify the thresholds that trigger action. A QTc greater than 500 ms or a rise of more than 60 ms from baseline is high risk for torsades, whereas normal QTc is generally less than 450 ms in men and less than 460 ms in women, and I should remember that risk rises continuously with each 10 ms increase in QTc, roughly by 5–7% for cardiac events, so I should not be reassured by values just below 500 ms if other risk factors are present [^114mPDSR] [^1163reB9] [^114jAiSn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to classify whether the QT prolongation is congenital or acquired, because that changes management, so I should review family history, prior ECGs, and look for secondary causes such as drugs, electrolyte derangements, structural heart disease, or bradycardia, and if the phenotype is strong but the genetic test is negative, I should remember that up to 25% of clinically definite LQTS can be genotype-negative, so a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis [^117KMExR] [^111Bs9LM] [^116Zbk3G].

> I will now examine immediate risk to decide on monitoring and disposition. Patients with QTc greater than 500 ms, symptomatic palpitations, syncope or presyncope, or bradycardia with heart rate less than 60 bpm warrant continuous telemetry and a monitored setting, and I should repeat ECGs every 24 hours until QTc normalizes, escalating to ICU care if instability or recurrent torsades occurs [^114mPDSR] [^114k3p73].

> Next, I should review and remove reversible causes, and I need to ensure a meticulous medication reconciliation to stop all QT-prolonging agents when feasible, including antiarrhythmics, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, antipsychotics, antidepressants, ondansetron, methadone, and many oncology agents, while correcting electrolytes promptly to potassium around 4.5–5.0 mEq/L and magnesium at least 2.0 mg/dL, and I should treat bradycardia or pauses because the "short–long–short" sequence precipitates torsades [^1122HasY] [^1114qAWd] [^117JGeZM].

> But wait, what if torsades de pointes occurs? I should confirm hemodynamics and defibrillate if unstable, and if stable, I should give intravenous magnesium sulfate 2 g IV push with repeat dosing as needed, consider potassium repletion to high-normal even if baseline potassium is normal, accelerate the heart rate with isoproterenol or temporary pacing to suppress pause-dependent ectopy, and avoid giving antiarrhythmic drugs that further prolong repolarization, especially class IA and III agents [^117JGeZM] [^1114qAWd] [^113PDn3E].

> Let me think about chronic risk stratification now. I should confirm QTc thresholds that guide therapy, where beta-blockers are generally indicated when QTc is at least 470 ms in congenital LQTS, and intensification is reasonable when QTc exceeds 500 ms or when there are high-risk features such as LQT2 or LQT3 genotype, prior syncope or cardiac arrest, female sex with LQT2, or age under 40 years, and I should use validated tools and genotype-informed risk calculators when available [^114rjRyL] [^116tUN6N] [^114pSRRY].

> I should confirm first-line chronic therapy. Nonselective beta-blockers such as nadolol or propranolol reduce arrhythmic events substantially across LQTS subtypes, with greater benefit in LQT1 and meaningful reductions in LQT2 and females with LQT3, and I need to monitor adequacy with exercise testing because beta-blocker effect can be unmasked or validated during exertion and recovery, adjusting dose to blunt catecholamine surges [^1133V421] [^116tUN6N] [^117F7Bni].

> Hold on, I should verify genotype-specific add-on therapy. For LQT3, mexiletine can shorten QTc and reduce events, and an acute oral or IV drug test can help predict response, whereas for recurrent syncope despite beta-blockers, left cardiac sympathetic denervation is a reasonable adjunct, and I should reserve ICDs for secondary prevention after cardiac arrest, for high-risk patients with recurrent syncope or QTc greater than 500 ms despite therapy, or when risk calculators indicate very high arrhythmic risk and life expectancy exceeds one year [^113BEhdc] [^111gLP7A] [^111tRzLf] [^117NQYjJ] [^113H2SC4] [^116SVS7M].

> I need to ensure lifestyle and trigger avoidance are addressed. Patients should avoid QT-prolonging drugs whenever possible, LQT1 patients should avoid unsupervised swimming, LQT2 patients should minimize sudden auditory stimuli, and competitive sports decisions should be individualized based on genotype, symptoms, and QTc, with low-risk, genotype-positive patients sometimes allowed to participate under supervision after careful evaluation [^111RsD5z] [^113WvtZr] [^117HXKJZ].

> Let me reconsider special populations. In cancer therapy, I should obtain a baseline ECG, repeat ECGs after dose changes and at steady state, interrupt QT-prolonging therapy if QTc reaches or exceeds 500 ms, and use weekly ECGs when QTc is 480–500 ms, coordinating multidisciplinary decisions about risks and benefits of continuing oncologic therapy, and in pediatrics, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for LQTS in syncope, seizures, or drowning events and involve pediatric cardiology early [^112yCJuK] [^114WGJz2] [^114k3p73] [^111XrhRL] [^113YpyEj].

> I should double-check perioperative considerations. Many anesthetics and perioperative factors can prolong QT, so I need to plan for continuous monitoring, avoid QT-prolonging agents when alternatives exist, correct electrolytes preemptively, and be prepared to treat torsades with magnesium and rate acceleration if it occurs intraoperatively or postoperatively [^111sKyZR] [^112utRaR].

> To synthesize, let me verify the practical thresholds and actions. If QTc is 450–499 ms, I should remove offending drugs, correct electrolytes, and monitor closely. If QTc is 500 ms or greater, I should add continuous monitoring, repeat ECGs daily until normalization, and strongly consider stopping the culprit therapy. If torsades occurs, I should give magnesium, pace or use isoproterenol for bradycardia, and avoid QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics. For chronic congenital LQTS, I should start a nonselective beta-blocker, escalate to mexiletine for LQT3 or LCSD and ICD for high-risk features, and embed trigger avoidance and family screening into long-term care [^114mPDSR] [^1114qAWd] [^1133V421].

Management of prolonged QT centers on **identify and stop QT-prolonging drugs** [^1122HasY], **correct electrolytes (K+ ≥ 4.5 mEq/L, Mg2+ ≥ 2.0 mg/dL)** [^1114qAWd], and **monitor with serial ECGs** until QTc normalizes [^113FewC3]. For torsades de pointes, give **IV magnesium 2 g** [^117JGeZM] promptly, pace or use isoproterenol if bradycardic [^117JGeZM], and avoid antiarrhythmics that prolong QT. In congenital LQTS, use **nonselective beta-blockers** (nadolol/propranolol) [^1133V421] and consider ICD for high-risk patients [^117NQYjJ]. For acquired cases, remove the cause, correct electrolytes, and monitor; most resolve with these steps [^111ghsuJ].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and risk stratification

- **Normal QTc**: 350–450 ms (men), 360–460 ms (women) [^1163reB9].
- **Borderline QTc**: 450–459 ms (men), 460–469 ms (women).
- **Prolonged QTc**: ≥ 460 ms (men), ≥ 470 ms (women).
- **High risk**: QTc ≥ 500 ms or increase > 60 ms from baseline [^114mPDSR].

---

## Immediate management of torsades de pointes (TdP)

### Acute management

- **Defibrillation**: for hemodynamic instability [^114DuDGd].
- **IV magnesium sulfate**: 2 g IV over 1–2 min; repeat once if needed [^1114qAWd].
- **Overdrive pacing or isoproterenol**: for bradycardia or pause-dependent TdP [^117JGeZM].
- **Avoid QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics**: e.g. amiodarone, sotalol [^1122HasY].

---

## General management principles

### Identify and remove causative factors

Identify and stop **QT-prolonging drugs** [^1122HasY] and correct **electrolytes** — potassium to ≥ 4.5 mEq/L [^1114qAWd] and magnesium to ≥ 2.0 mg/dL [^notfound]. Monitor with **serial ECGs** until QTc normalizes [^114k3p73].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Beta-blockers**: first-line for congenital LQTS; use nonselective agents (nadolol, propranolol) [^1133V421].
- **Mexiletine**: for LQT3 with prolonged QTc [^113BEhdc].
- **Isoproterenol or pacing**: for bradycardia-induced TdP [^113PDn3E].

---

### Device therapy

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (**ICD**) is indicated for high-risk patients — those with prior cardiac arrest, recurrent syncope despite therapy, or QTc > 500 ms with high-risk genotype [^111LL78M]. Temporary **pacing** is used for bradycardia-induced TdP [^113PDn3E].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

- **Avoid QT-prolonging drugs**: ongoing vigilance [^111RsD5z].
- **Regular ECG monitoring**: track QTc and therapy response [^113zmiKK].
- **Genetic counseling**: for congenital LQTS and family screening [^115YLDr1].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: avoid triggers, strenuous exercise (especially swimming for LQT1), and loud noises (LQT2) [^113WvtZr].

---

## Special considerations

### Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS)

In congenital LQTS, **beta-blockers** are first-line therapy [^1133V421]; consider **ICD** for high-risk patients [^117NQYjJ] and **left cardiac sympathetic denervation** when beta-blockers are ineffective or not tolerated [^111tRzLf].

---

### Acquired long QT syndrome

In acquired long QT syndrome, **remove the cause** by stopping offending drugs and correcting electrolytes [^1114qAWd]; **monitor** with serial ECGs until QTc normalizes [^114k3p73].

---

## Management of prolonged QT interval

| **Clinical scenario** | **Immediate management** | **Long-term management** |
|-|-|-|
| Torsades de pointes | - Defibrillation <br/> - IV magnesium <br/> - Overdrive pacing or isoproterenol | - Avoid QT-prolonging drugs <br/> - Correct electrolytes <br/> - Regular ECG monitoring |
| Congenital LQTS | - Beta-blockers <br/> - ICD if high risk <br/> - Mexiletine for LQT3 | - Avoid triggers <br/> - Genetic counseling <br/> - Regular follow-up |
| Acquired QT prolongation | - Stop offending drugs <br/> - Correct electrolytes <br/> - Serial ECGs | - Avoid QT-prolonging drugs <br/> - Regular ECG monitoring |

---

Effective management of prolonged QT requires **rapid identification of causes**, correction of electrolytes, and targeted therapy; **prompt treatment of TdP** with magnesium and rate support is critical, and long-term care focuses on trigger avoidance and risk stratification.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) — genetic testing provides diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information, with substantial diagnostic yield and selective use in unexplained QTc prolongation. Genetic testing for disease-causing mutations in long QT syndrome offers important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information in addition to the clinical evaluation, and a positive test can facilitate establishing risk for family members; the yield in phenotype-positive patients is 50% to 86.0%. A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of long QT syndrome, and in asymptomatic patients with otherwise unexplained prolonged QTc ≥ 480 ms on serial ECGs, genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis and supplement prognostic information.

Long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes — electrolyte optimization and medication precautions include that intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes of torsades de pointes without necessarily shortening QT, repeated doses may be needed, and the risk of magnesium toxicity is very small with the doses usually used to treat torsades de pointes, 1 to 2 g intravenously; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 mEq/L and 5 mEq/L shortens QT and may reduce the chance of recurrent torsades de pointes. QT-prolonging medications are not used in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative or the benefit greatly exceeds the risk, episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by exposure to a QT-prolonging medication with increased risk when the QT is already prolonged from genetic and clinical risk factors, and implicated medication classes include antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, antibiotics, antifungals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, and anticancer agents.

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^117KMExR]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterised by heart rate corrected QT interval prolongation and life-threatening arrhythmias, leading to syncope and sudden death. Variations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels, accessory ion channel subunits or proteins modulating the function of the ion channel have been identified as disease-causing mutations in up to 75% of all LQTS cases. Based on the underlying genetic defect, LQTS has been subdivided into different subtypes. Growing insights into the genetic background and pathophysiology of LQTS has led to the identification of genotype–phenotype relationships for the most common genetic subtypes, the recognition of genetic and non-genetic modifiers of phenotype, optimisation of risk stratification algorithms and the discovery of gene-specific therapies in LQTS. Nevertheless, despite these great advancements in the LQTS field, large gaps in knowledge still exist. For example, up to 25% of LQTS cases still remain genotype elusive, which hampers proper identification of family members at risk, and it is still largely unknown what determines the large variability in disease severity, where even within one family an identical mutation causes malignant arrhythmias in some carriers, while in other carriers, the disease is clinically silent. In this review, we summarise the current evidence available on the diagnosis, clinical management and therapeutic strategies in LQTS. We also discuss new scientific developments and areas of research, which are expected to increase our understanding of the complex genetic architecture in genotype-negative patients, lead to improved risk stratification in asymptomatic mutation carriers and more targeted (gene-specific and even mutation-specific) therapies.

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^112HXEEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). QTc prolongation is influenced by many factors including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval. In addition, ED patients may present with conditions that may predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects, but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation. This review discusses commonly encountered medications that are associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

AHA/ACC/HRS 2017 — Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) supportive guidance, risk, and monitoring — Beta blockers reduce adverse cardiac events for long QT syndrome type 1 (> 95%), long QT syndrome type 2 (> 75%), and females with long QT syndrome type 3 by > 60%; in selected patients, beta blockers can be protective against sudden cardiac arrest. Patients receiving a beta blocker should undergo ongoing monitoring to assess changes in QTc over time and adequacy of beta blockade with exertion. High‑risk LQTS features include QTc > 500 ms, genotypes long QT syndrome type 2 and long QT syndrome type 3, females with genotype long QT syndrome type 2, < 40 years of age, and prior cardiac arrest or recurrent syncope. Women with long QT syndrome type 2 are at a higher risk of postpartum cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death and should receive pre‑pregnancy counseling. In LQTS with recurrent syncope while on a beta blocker, escalation of therapy is warranted to prevent sudden cardiac death.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) diagnosis is mainly based on QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Bazett's formula, while excluding secondary causes of QTc prolongation from drugs, acquired cardiac conditions, electrolyte imbalance, and unbalanced diets; a scoring system that considers age, medical and family history, symptoms, and QTc provides diagnostic probability. Approximately 20%–25% of genetically confirmed LQTS may have a normal range QTc. Provocative QT tests during change from supine to standing, in recovery after exercise, or during epinephrine infusion have been proposed to unmask patients with normal resting QTc; these tests may be considered in uncertain cases, though the clinical use of this test requires more extensive validation.

the QTc should be no more than 440 milliseconds to start dofetilide in the setting of a narrow QRS complex, the QTc should be no more than 500 ms in the setting of ventricular conduction abnormality. 20 This guidance may be used with other QT-prolonging medications until a standard. using a large international registry of LQTS, it was noted that although the risk of cardiac events was significantly higher among patients with LQT1 and LQT2 than with LQT3, the frequency of lethal cardiac events was significantly higher in the LQT3 group. 6 When exposed to QT-prolonging medications, individuals without lifelong. and hypomagnesemia are particularly significant and remediable. Physicians should monitor potassium and magnesium levels in patients who start antiarrhythmic QT-prolonging medications and supplement them as needed, especially in patients taking other medications that can cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

Measurement of the baseline QT interval may also be of critical importance. interval in patients receiving QT-prolonging medications. First, an ECG should be routinely checked before and after starting an antiarrhythmic agent that can prolong the QT interval. If the patient has a prolonged QTc at baseline, it is important. probable, or possible potential for causing QT prolongation. If the drug was deemed by the LQTS experts to have improbable or very improbable potential for causing QT prolongation, checking an ECG before and after starting the drug, especially in low-risk patients, may not be necessary. is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. 9, 49 Thus, physicians are left with great uncertainty regarding when to stop a QT-prolonging medication.

Respondents to the survey on LQTS were more likely to stop a QT-prolonging medication for a QT of 520 ms than for a QT of 500 ms. However, it should. the need for antipsychotic therapy cannot be ignored, and the patients with the most severe psychoses may need the highest doses of drugs. These same patients are also at higher risk of nonadherence to prescribed therapies and to the development of other conditions, such as electrolyte depletion or sympathetic overactivity.

Finally, despite all progress in genetic screening methods, the yield of finding a potential pathogenic variant in a LQTS patient with a clear phenotype is at most 75%–80%. However, in dedicated cardiogenetic clinics the yield was lower, around 50%, with these higher values only in earlier years and lower values in more recent years because of a more lenient case selection in recent years. Important additional scientific inquiries in this field are the unravelling of the genotype in the 25%–30% genotype elusive cases and the role of additional genetic and other factors in determining the arrhythmia risk. For example, comorbidities like hypertension may aggravate the LQTS phenotype by deleterious effects of the interaction between hypertrophy and the mutation. Furthermore, recent data show evidence for a more complex polygenic architecture in genotype-negative patients, and preliminary evidence in single families has revealed evidence for the existence of both protective as well as deleterious alleles, which may modify the phenotype by, respectively, aggravating (figure 6B) or alleviating (figure 6C) the QT-prolonging effects of a LQTS-causing mutation. New genes, yet to be identified, may also form a partial explanation for the genetic underpinning in gene-elusive patients.

In summary, congenital LQTS is an inheritable entity characterised by a prolonged heart-rate corrected QT interval, and it associates with malignant arrhythmias at young age. It is caused by a decrease in repolarising cardiac ion currents in a complex polygenic composition and interacting with multiple other factors such as sex, age, comorbidities and triggers such as drugs. Therapy relies importantly on ß-blockers and lifestyle measures. More patient specific pharmacological and invasive therapies are available and under continuous development. A better understanding of its complex architecture paves the path to improving care for these patients and their families.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^115oSZtc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The cardiovascular complications of cancer therapeutics are the focus of the burgeoning field of cardio‐oncology. A common challenge in this field is the impact of cancer drugs on cardiac repolarization (ie, prolongation) and the potential risk for the life‐threatening arrhythmia torsades de pointes. Althoughprolongation is not a perfect marker of arrhythmia risk, this has become a primary safety metric among oncologists. Cardiologists caring for patients receiving cancer treatment should become familiar with the drugs associated withprolongation, its incidence, and appropriate management strategies to provide meaningful consultation in this complex clinical scenario.

Methods and Results

In this article, we performed a systematic review (using Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines) of commonly used cancer drugs to determine the incidence ofprolongation and clinically relevant arrhythmias. We calculated summary estimates of the incidence of all and clinically relevantprolongation as well as arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We then describe strategies to prevent, identify, and manageprolongation in patients receiving cancer therapy. We identified a total of 173 relevant publications. The weighted incidence of any corrected(c) prolongation in our systematic review in patients treated with conventional therapies (eg, anthracyclines) ranged from 0% to 22%, althoughc > 500 ms, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death was extremely rare. The risk ofc prolongation with targeted therapies (eg, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors) ranged between 0% and 22.7% with severe prolongation (c > 500 ms) reported in 0% to 5.2% of the patients. Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death were rare.

Conclusions

Our systematic review demonstrates that there is variability in the incidence ofc prolongation of various cancer drugs; however, the clinical consequence, as defined by arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, remains rare.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^113hAY9c]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cancer patients have an increased risk of QTc prolongation due to multiple etiologies and a higher risk of mortality. Because the majority of QT monitoring for cancer patient is performed in the outpatient setting, clinicians must be aware of the common risk factors that can lead to QTc prolongation to prevent the development of TdP. Early recognition and definitive treatment of QTc prolongation may allow cancer patients to continue with their treatment in most cases. For higher-risk individuals, multispecialty discussions should be held to assess the risk and benefits tailored to the best interests of the patient.

AHA/ACC/HRS 2017 — Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) additional evaluation and risk-based therapy — For suspected LQTS, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, recording the ECG lying and immediately on standing, and/or exercise treadmill testing can be useful for diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc less than 470 ms, chronic beta-blocker therapy is reasonable. In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc greater than 500 ms while receiving a beta blocker, intensification with medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, or an ICD may be considered.

### A review of long QT syndrome: everything a hospitalist should know… [^113YpyEj]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

In this article, we will review various aspects of long QT syndrome necessary for hospitalists who care for children, adolescents, and young adults who have known LQTS and also review presenting features that should make one consider LQTS as a cause of hospitalization. Pediatric hospitalists care for patients who have suffered near-drowning, unexplained motor vehicular accidents, brief resolved unexpected events, sudden infant death syndrome, recurrent miscarriages, syncope, or seizures. These common conditions can be clinical clues in patients harboring 1 of 16 LQTS genetic mutations. LQTS is commonly caused by a channelopathy that can cause sudden cardiac death. Over the years, guidelines on management and recommendations for sports participation have evolved with our understanding of the disease and the burden of arrhythmias manifested in the pediatric age group.

This review will include the genetic causes of LQTS, clinical features, and important historical information to obtain when these presentations are encountered. We will review medical and surgical treatments available to patients with LQTS and long-term care recommendations and prognosis for those diagnosed with LQTS.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^111G1CTj]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Case

A 66-year-old female with a past medical history significant for acute myeloid leukemia, prior transient ischemic attack, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presented to the hospital with dizziness and falls. At the time of presentation, she was noted to have slurred speech and gait instability. She denied any loss of consciousness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions and a QT interval, corrected for heart rate (QTc) of 487 ms. An ECG 2 months earlier showed a QTc of 455 ms.

How do we diagnose QT prolongation?

The QTc represents the time between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. On a standard 12-lead ECG, this measurement is usually taken from limb lead II and precordial lead V 5 measuring from the beginning of the Q wave to the termination of the T-wave. The QT interval adjusts to heart rate and different formulas have been used to correct the QT interval. The Bazett (QTcB = QT/√RR) formula assumes an exponential relationship between the QT interval and the R to R interval. Bazett's correction is most useful for heart rates between 60 and 100 beats/min with inaccuracies at slower (with overcorrection) and faster (with undercorrection) heart rates. The Fridericia formula (QTcF = QT/∛RR) is similar, but has greater accuracy at faster heart rates. Linear formulas such as the Framingham (QTcFra = QT + 0.154 [1 − RR]) and Hodges (QTcH = QT + 0.00175 [(60 / RR) − 60]) have more uniform correction for heart rates above 90 beats/min, but are less commonly used.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^114mPDSR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Management of QTc Prolongation

When a prolonged QTc interval is detected (> 500 ms or an increase of > 60 ms longer than baseline), the patient should be evaluated carefully, with discontinuation of all offending drugs immediately (if appropriate). Strategies previously discussed to identify causes of QTc prolongation should be considered. Patients who experience associated syncope or presyncope, palpitations, or QTc > 500 ms and/or bradycardia (HR, < 60 bpm) should be evaluated immediately in a monitored setting. An ECG should be repeated every 24 hours until resolution of QTc prolongation is confirmed. A prolonged QTc increases the risk of a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia called TdP (Figure 4 A). Most of the data on the risk of TdP in relation to QTc prolongation are from large registries of patients with congenital long QT syndromes. 193, 194 These data show that each 10‐ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% increase in risk for cardiac events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and/or death. Other risk factors for TdP beyond QTc have been described in settings outside of cancer therapy (Table 5) and, thus, the extrapolation to the cancer population is less clear. 195 Although some medications are associated with QTc prolongation, not all drugs that prolong the QTc cause TdP. Therefore, the risk assessment of TdP attributable to drugs should not only be based on QTc alone but considered in the context of other predisposing TdP risk factors. 196 Recurrence of TdP is frequent and, hence, the occurrence of a single event mandates urgent clinical evaluation and monitoring.

### Long QT syndrome and anaesthesia [^112utRaR]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

The long QT syndrome is a disorder of myocardial electrical conduction that leaves the heart vulnerable to the ventricular tachydysrhythmia torsade de pointes. Clinically, this results in syncope or sudden death. The long QT syndrome may be congenital, if caused by abnormal myocardial potassium or sodium ion channels, or acquired, if due to drugs, electrolyte abnormalities or metabolic conditions. Triggers for the development of torsade de pointes include both anaesthesia and surgery. Some anaesthetic agents prolong the QT interval. The condition is reviewed and suggestions are made for the anaesthetic management of affected patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced QT prolongation and electrolyte abnormalities — evaluation and management: Antiarrhythmic drugs or electrolyte abnormalities should not be assumed to be the sole cause of sustained monomorphic VT (Level of Evidence: B). Patients with polymorphic VT with prolonged QT interval due to antiarrhythmic medications or other drugs should be advised to avoid exposure to all agents associated with QT prolongation (Level of Evidence: B). In patients with polymorphic VT associated with drug-induced QT prolongation, withdrawal of the offending agent is usually sufficient to prevent arrhythmia recurrence; if ventricular function is normal, no therapy beyond drug withdrawal, avoidance of future drug exposure, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is necessary. If ventricular function is abnormal, cardiac arrest or syncope should not be attributed solely to antiarrhythmic drugs and evaluation and treatment should be similar to patients with such events without antiarrhythmic drugs. Occasionally, monomorphic sustained VT occurs only with antiarrhythmic drugs without QT prolongation, and in most such patients the monomorphic VT is inducible by EP testing in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Discussion: Management of Patients at Risk or With Cancer Therapy–Related QT Prolongation

On the basis of our systematic review and our clinical experience, a suggested management approach for patients scheduled to start potential QT‐prolonging cancer therapy or for patients with QT prolongation during cancer treatment is described later and summarized in Figure 2.

Figure 2
Algorithm of assessment of patients at risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation or withc prolongation before or during cancer treatment. EP (Electrophysiology)

Precancer Treatment Assessment and Prevention

In patients scheduled to receive potential QT‐prolonging cancer drugs, a complete medical and medication history (including nonprescription, recreational, and complementary/alternative medicines) should be obtained. In cancer patients being evaluated for clinical trials (before the start of cancer therapy), the prevalence of prolonged QTc has been reported to be ≈6%. 180, 181, 182 Therefore, a pretreatment ECG should be performed to document QTc values. A risk score to identify individual patient‐specific risk of QTc prolongation during cancer therapy does not exist.

### The long QT syndrome: a transatlantic clinical approach to diagnosis and therapy [^111vmJSy]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The mind-boggling progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the long QT syndrome (LQTS) has been the subject of many articles and reviews. Still, when it comes to the management of the patients affected by this life-threatening disorder, too many errors still take place, both in the diagnostic process and in the therapeutic choices. The price of these errors is paid by the patients and their families. This review is not directed to the relatively small number of LQTS experts who know what to do. It does not deal with genetics, with epidemiology, or with the well-known clinical manifestations. We have focused solely on the approach to diagnosis and therapy and we have directed this review to the average clinical cardiologist who, in his/her practice, sees occasionally patients affected or suspected to be affected by LQTS; the cardiologist who may know enough to manage them but not enough to be completely confident on his/her most critical choices. We have provided our personal views without making any attempt to blend differences whenever present. On most issues we agree fully but where we do not, we make it clear to the reader by indicating who is thinking what. The result may be unconventional, but it mirrors the challenges, often severe, that we all face in managing and protecting these patients from sudden death while also helping them live and thrive despite their diagnosis. We trust that this unabashed presentation of our clinical approach will be useful for both cardiologists and patients.

### Update on long QT syndrome [^115D9nga]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder characterized by a prolonged QT interval in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and increased risk of malignant arrhythmias in patients with a structurally normal heart. Since its first description in the 1950s, advances in molecular genetics have greatly improved our understanding of the cause and mechanisms of this disease. Sixteen genes linked to LQTS have been described and genetic testing had become an integral part of the diagnosis and risk stratification. This article provides an updated review of the genetic basis, diagnosis, and clinical management of LQTS.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^113jfL1F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with cancer receiving treatment are prone to QTc prolongation because of many risk factors and comorbidities. The true incidence of QTc prolongation and TdP from the multitude of cancer drugs is challenging to determine. In patients treated with conventional cancer drugs, the weighted incidence of any QTc prolongation in our systematic review varied between 0% and 22%, although QTc > 500 ms, arrhythmias, or SCD was extremely rare. The risk of QTc prolongation with targeted therapies was also variable (0%–22.7%), with severe prolongation (QTc > 500 ms) reported in 0% to 5.2% of the patients. However, arrhythmias and SCD were rare. Strategies to prevent QTc prolongation and the risk of subsequent TdP involve identification of potential drug interactions, correction of underlying electrolyte abnormalities, careful ECG monitoring, and patient education.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2026 Prostate Cancer — QT interval, monitoring, and cardiometabolic screening during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): ADT may also prolong the QT/QTc interval, and providers should consider whether the benefits of ADT outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval; electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered. Based on adverse metabolic effects and associations with higher incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, screening for and intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease are recommended for patients receiving ADT, while whether strategies for these activities should differ from those of the general population remains uncertain.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^113PDn3E]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

How do we manage QT prolongation in TdP?

Once QTc prolongation is identified, serum electrolyte levels should be obtained and abnormalities should be corrected. If a patient develops TdP, intravenous magnesium sulfate should be administered immediately. In patients without congenital long-QT syndrome, mexiletine, a Class Ib antiarrhythmic, has been shown to shorten the QT interval, halt episodes of TdP, and prevent recurrence of refractory TdP. If signs of electrical instability persist, transfer to the intensive care unit is recommended with initiation of beta-adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol or temporary pacing to increase the heart rate.

The European Society of Cardiology has offered an expert consensus on cancer treatments and cardiotoxicity. However, there are no generally accepted consistent criteria regarding discontinuation of cancer therapeutics for patients who develop QT prolongation. Oncologists and cardiologists must make case-by-case decisions of continuing potentially life-prolonging cancer therapy balanced by the risk for lethal arrhythmias.

LEARNING POINTS
- When QTc is elevated, check and correct electrolyte imbalances and perform a medication reconciliation to discontinue QT-prolonging agents.
- Patients who develop TdP should be treated as per advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol with intravenous magnesium sulfate and transfer to an intensive care unit for closer monitoring.

Case Continued

Before discharge, the patient had resolution of ventricular ectopy on telemetry. She was started on guideline-directed anti-remodeling medications. A repeat echocardiogram showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. A follow up 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm with a QTc of 442 ms.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome — therapeutic management and thresholds: In patients with long QT syndrome with a resting QTc greater than 470 ms, a beta blocker is recommended. In high-risk patients with symptomatic long QT syndrome in whom a beta blocker is ineffective or not tolerated, intensification of therapy with additional medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type), left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or an ICD is recommended. In patients with long QT syndrome and recurrent appropriate ICD shocks despite maximum tolerated doses of a beta blocker, intensification of medical therapy with additional medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type) or left cardiac sympathetic denervation), is recommended. In asymptomatic patients with long QT syndrome and a resting QTc less than 470 ms, chronic therapy with a beta blocker is reasonable. In asymptomatic patients with long QT syndrome and a resting QTc greater than 500 ms while receiving a beta blocker, intensification of therapy with medications (guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type), left cardiac sympathetic denervation or an ICD may be considered. In patients with long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

### Evaluation and management of cardiac safety using the electrocardiogram in oncology clinical trials: focus on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval) [^113NPQTL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Non-antiarrhythmic drugs have been reported to prolong the QTc interval and induce potentially fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. An increasing number of drugs that are used for treating malignancies are no exception. Therefore, both oncologists and regulators expect sponsors of oncology drugs to evaluate, during the development of the drugs, their effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG), particularly on the QTc interval. In the case of agents that cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the primary approach is to carry out an intense ECG evaluation, employing robust ECG recordings, during early-phase clinical trials, together with characterization of the concentration-QTc interval relationship, and follow this up with an appropriate intensity of ECG monitoring in the later phases of development. This article describes the broad principles of these approaches, including recommendations for exclusion criteria (relative to baseline QTc interval and to cardiac comorbidity); it also describes methods for conducting ECG monitoring and a proposed scheme for the management of any QTc-related effects that may emerge.

### Evaluation of the effect of dapagliflozin on cardiac repolarization: a thorough QT / QTc study [^1129Ht27]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide epidemic, with approximately 285 million patients at present and a projected rise to 439 million by 2030. This progressive disease typically requires chronic lifestyle and pharmacologic management to maintain effective glycemic control. Given the potential for extensive exposure and continued therapy, investigational drugs for T2DM demand rigorous evaluation for potential long-term safety concerns, including potential effects on cardiac repolarization. Delayed ventricular repolarization, as measured by a prolonged QT interval, has been associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes.

Dapagliflozin is a first-in-class oral, oncedaily, potent, and highly selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor being developed for the treatment of T2DM. Treatment with dapagliflozin promotes urinary glucose excretion by preventing up to 50% of the filtered glucose from being reabsorbed. Thus, by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibition provides a mechanism for improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM that is independent of insulin secretion or insulin action.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^111H5dFS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The cardiovascular complications of cancer therapeutics are the focus of the burgeoning field of cardio-oncology. A common challenge in this field is the impact of cancer drugs on cardiac repolarization (ie, QT prolongation) and the potential risk for the life-threatening arrhythmia torsades de pointes. Although QT prolongation is not a perfect marker of arrhythmia risk, this has become a primary safety metric among oncologists. Cardiologists caring for patients receiving cancer treatment should become familiar with the drugs associated with QT prolongation, its incidence, and appropriate management strategies to provide meaningful consultation in this complex clinical scenario.

Methods and Results

In this article, we performed a systematic review (using Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines) of commonly used cancer drugs to determine the incidence of QT prolongation and clinically relevant arrhythmias. We calculated summary estimates of the incidence of all and clinically relevant QT prolongation as well as arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We then describe strategies to prevent, identify, and manage QT prolongation in patients receiving cancer therapy. We identified a total of 173 relevant publications. The weighted incidence of any corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in our systematic review in patients treated with conventional therapies (eg, anthracyclines) ranged from 0% to 22%, although QTc > 500 ms, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death was extremely rare. The risk of QTc prolongation with targeted therapies (eg, small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors) ranged between 0% and 22.7% with severe prolongation (QTc > 500 ms) reported in 0% to 5.2% of the patients. Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death were rare.

Conclusions

Our systematic review demonstrates that there is variability in the incidence of QTc prolongation of various cancer drugs; however, the clinical consequence, as defined by arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, remains rare.

### QT interval prolongation and hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19… [^112GwpSa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more. Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. The Tisdale score, used to prognosticate QT prolongation in hospitalized patients, was applied retrospectively to evaluate QTc prolongation risk. 10 End points of interest were changes in QTc in the cohort and between groups receiving hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, development of prolonged QTc interval to 500 milliseconds or more, and documented ADEs.

The median baseline QTc was 455 milliseconds. With treatment, 10 of 90 patients had ΔQTc of 60 milliseconds or more; 18 had posttreatment QTc intervals of 500 milliseconds or more. Of 37 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, 7 developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 had ΔQTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater with concomitant loop diuretic administration, or a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more. This underscores the American College of Cardiology's recommendation for baseline risk assessment, frequent QTc monitoring, and strict cutoffs for therapy cessation; the Infectious Diseases Society of America voices similar concerns, recommending targeted antiviral therapeutics be limited to clinical trials.

14, 15 Ultimately, curtailing hydroxychloroquine-associated ADEs would require a multidisciplinary effort across medicine, infectious diseases, pharmacy, cardiology, critical care, and health care quality.

### QT-prolonging medications and autopsy-defined causes of sudden death… [^1155F2Ts]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Multivariate regression was used to evaluate the association of QTPM with the risk of presumed SCD, autopsy-defined SAD, and non-SAD compared with trauma controls. Medication exposure, determined by prescription lists and postmortem toxicologic findings, was used to calculate a summative QTPM exposure score. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2018, to June 15, 2019., conveying a 2- to 3-fold increased risk in certain populations. 3, 4 As such, use of QT interval–prolonging medication has represented a traditional target for prevention of SCD. 5 Cautious use of QTPMs has been bolstered by a number of. Because our results do not exclude increased risk of SAD with QTPMs, regulatory policy and patient safety measures surrounding QTPM continue to be important. However, our study indicates that most of the association with sudden death was nonarrhythmic and mechanistically unrelated to QT prolongation.

Clinicians routinely use screening electrocardiography during treatment, with discontinuation of QTPM if the QT interval is prolonged, in many cases limiting the use of first-line therapies. Outside specific highly-monitored settings, 33 it remains unclear whether routine screening and QT interval–guided tailoring of therapy is beneficial or sufficient to alter the risk of sudden death. Current drug information label recommendations from the US Food and Drug Administration are drug specific and equivocal but generally recommend assessment of baseline risk factors for torsades de pointes and close monitoring of electrolyte levels, with variable recommendations for measurement of baseline QT intervals. Our findings suggest the current best estimate of the risk of SAD associated with QTPM is confounded and may be significantly overestimated.

Given that our study lacks QT interval data, clinicians should continue to exercise caution in monitoring patients with QTPM exposure, because the greatest exposure was highly associated with sudden death, albeit predominantly due to nonarrhythmic causes. However, clinicians should be aware that interventions focused solely on prevention of arrhythmic death are unlikely to entirely address the risk of sudden death in this population. Our results suggest that efforts focused on reducing risks of comorbid conditions, including close monitoring for illicit drug use and sequelae of diabetes, psychiatric diseases, and renal failure, are important to reduce overall risk of sudden mortality in patients prescribed QTPMs.

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

Objective

To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

Study Selection

We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which 6 were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

Data Synthesis

Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed in patients who are about to begin taking a QT-prolonging medication. Although inadequate clinical studies preclude prediction of absolute risk for individual patients, particularly high-risk situations can be defined based on clinical variables. We propose recommendations on proper monitoring of the QT interval in patients receiving QT-prolonging medications.

Conclusion

Although the use of QT-prolonging medications can predispose to torsades de pointes, there is a relative paucity of information that can help clinicians and patients make optimal informed decisions about how best to minimize the risk of this serious complication.

### Current concepts in the mechanisms and management of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes [^114DuDGd]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is characterized by a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) and increased risk of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). We review mechanisms, predispositions, culprit agents, and management of this potentially fatal phenomenon. Virtually all drugs that prolong QTc block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(kr)). Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose-dependent manner, others do so at any dose. Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common. Implicated drugs include class 1A and III antiarrhythmics, macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials, antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone. Treatment for TdP includes immediate defibrillation for hemodynamic instability and intravenous magnesium sulfate. Potassium levels should be maintained in the high normal range, and all QT prolonging agents must be promptly discontinued.

### Management of long QT syndrome [^116GKagm]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and by life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, occurring especially during conditions of increased sympathetic activity. Existing therapies are very effective, but mortality is high among untreated, symptomatic individuals. The identification of several of the genes responsible for LQTS and the realization that they all encode cardiac ion-channels has represented a landmark finding. This advance has fostered novel genotype-phenotype studies that are providing unique insight into how close the relationship can be between molecular biology and clinical cardiology. LQTS represents a paradigm for sudden cardiac death. Indeed, the growing knowledge developed for LQTS is likely to provide the key to understanding the genetic propensity to sudden death in patients with more-common cardiovascular diseases. The data presented here illustrate how the treatment of LQTS is rapidly evolving toward a highly individually tailored approach on the basis of patient-specific genetic information.

QT interval — sex and age differences: Typically, women have longer QT intervals than do men, and this difference is more pronounced at slower heart rates. In males, the corrected QT interval decreases at puberty and then gradually increases as androgen levels fall, and by age 50, gender differences in QT intervals have largely equalized; a similar shortening of the QT interval at puberty has been noted in males genotypically characterized with LQTS.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^111KdJ11]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A significant proportion of the study population was found to be exposed to QT-prolonging medications, and the issue of polypharmacy was observed to exacerbate this risk. The association of QT prolongation with various comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction, further emphasizes the complex interplay of multiple risk factors within this vulnerable population. Consequently, it is imperative to implement targeted strategies for the management and monitoring of QT intervals in elderly patients to reduce the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias and enhance overall patient safety. This study underscores the urgent need for heightened awareness and proactive management of QT prolongation risks to enhance the standard of care and safety for geriatric patients.

Patient counseling and monitoring

Patients should be counseled about worrisome cardiac signs after starting the treatment (syncope, presyncope, fainting, rapid palpitations, or dizzy spells) that should prompt them to seek medical evaluation. With respect to early detection, ECGs should be repeated during treatment, as per drug labels. ECG monitoring after a change in dose of a QTc‐prolonging drug is recommended. 191 However, because experience with some of the newer cancer drugs is limited, if concern for QTc prolongation exists, an ECG should be performed after every treatment cycle and when the plasma concentration of the drug reaches a steady state (eg, 5 half‐lives). The duration of monitoring will depend on the half‐life of all implicated drugs and the impairment in the elimination pathways. In hospitalized patients, if available, a QT‐alert system could be used to identify those who prolong their QTc during cancer treatment. This has been shown to be effective in the detection of patients (cancer and noncancer) at risk of TdP. 192 Strategies to minimize the risk of cancer therapy–related QTc prolongation are summarized in Table 4.

### Guidelines for reporting case studies and series on drug-induced QT interval prolongation and its complications following acute overdose [^1116j5UP]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: The assessment and management of patients with QT interval prolongation in poisoning requires an appropriate method of measuring and adjusting the QT interval for the heart rate (HR) in order to decide if the patient is at risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias, notably torsade de pointes (TdP). As the Clinical Toxicology Collaborative (CTC) workgroup reviewed the published literature on drug-induced QT interval prolongation in poisoning, it became obvious that many publications were missing essential data that were necessary to thoroughly assess and compare the evidence. The aim of this guidance document is to identify essential and ideal criteria required when reporting a case of drug-induced QT interval prolongation and/or TdP in poisoning. Methods: We employed a mixed methods approach as follows. Initially, we reviewed 188 cases of available published case reports and series in the literature regarding drug-induced QT interval prolongation and/or TdP in poisoning as the first step to another project. Common features and deficiencies were identified. Given the large gaps in reporting quality, we conducted an iterative consultative process involving all 23 members of the CTC to identify essential and ideal criteria to analyse publications of QT interval prolongation in poisoning. A priori standards were developed for acceptance or rejection of individual criteria. Results: Survey response was 100%. A minimum set of essential criteria for reporting cases of QT interval prolongation and drug-induced TdP in overdose setting are provided and a 35-item checklist is presented. Conclusions: We report a QT reporting checklist to ensure published case reports and series describing drug-induced QT interval prolongation in poisoning can contribute to the fund of knowledge of QT interval prolongation, TdP and other malignant dysrhythmias.

### Perioperative management of patients with congenital or acquired disorders of the QT interval [^111sKyZR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

QT prolongation can be attributable to various causes that can be categorised as acquired or congenital. Arrhythmias related to QT prolongation can result in clinical presentations, such as syncope and sudden cardiac death. The perioperative period presents a number of issues that may affect a patient's risk of developing polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Although most patients may have an unremarkable perioperative course, some may have complications; this review article aims to help clinicians avoid potential complications, and to help them address treatment for perioperative issues that may occur.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) management — lifestyle and sports: Life‑style modifications such as avoidance of strenuous exercise, especially swimming, without supervision in LQT1 patients, reduction in exposure to abrupt noises in LQT2 patients, and avoidance of drugs that prolong QT interval in all LQTS patients, should be routine. Participation of LQTS patients in competitive sports is still a matter of debate among the experts, but low‑risk patients with genetically confirmed LQTS, borderline QTc prolongation, no history of cardiac symptoms, and no family history of multiple sudden cardiac deaths may be allowed to participate in competitive sports in special cases after full clinical evaluation, and this applies especially to patients genotyped as non‑LQT1; in contrast, in all patients with a high perceived risk and in patients with exercise‑induced symptoms, competitive sport should be avoided.

### Congenital long QT syndrome [^117HXKJZ]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) encompasses a group of heritable conditions that are associated with cardiac repolarization dysfunction. Since its initial description in 1957, our understanding of LQTS has increased dramatically. The prevalence of LQTS is estimated to be ∼1:2,000, with a slight female predominance. The diagnosis of LQTS is based on clinical, electrocardiogram, and genetic factors. Risk stratification of patients with LQTS aims to identify those who are at increased risk of cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death. Factors including age, sex, QTc interval, and genetic background all contribute to current risk stratification paradigms. The management of LQTS involves conservative measures such as the avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs, pharmacologic measures with nonselective β-blockers, and interventional approaches such as device therapy or left cardiac sympathetic denervation. In general, most forms of exercise are considered safe in adequately treated patients, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is reserved for those at the highest risk. This review summarizes our current understanding of LQTS and provides clinicians with a practical approach to diagnosis and management.

Limitations

The translation of findings of QTc prolongation or associated arrhythmias from clinical trials from which our data are obtained to clinical practice is challenging. Most of the clinical trials of new cancer therapies in this review excluded patients with a baseline pre‐treatment QTc > 450 ms, carefully followed up patients with repeated ECGs, or avoided the use of concomitant QTc‐prolonging drugs. Therefore, findings from such trials may not be generalizable to clinical practice, where such meticulous follow‐up may not be offered. Therefore, care must be taken in patients receiving potentially QTc‐prolonging drugs in routine clinical practice. Because our search was exhaustive, cancer therapies that are not listed in Table 1 are unlikely to cause clinically relevant QTc prolongation. However, because of the rapid pace of new drug discovery in the field of oncology, it is possible that new therapies causing QTc prolongation have been introduced into the market during the preparation of this article. Regardless, the concepts of diagnosis and management of QTc prolongation remain the same.

### Measurement and management of QT interval prolongation for general physicians [^113FewC3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the more challenging aspects of ECG interpretation is measurement and interpretation of the QT interval. This interval represents the time taken for the ventricles to completely repolarise after activation. Abnormal prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a form of potentially life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Detection of a prolonged QT interval is essential as this can be a reversible problem, particularly in the context of the use of a variety of commonly prescribed medications in the hospital setting. Automated ECG printouts cannot be relied upon to diagnose QT interval prolongation; thus, the onus is on the clinician to identify it. This is a difficult task, as the normal QT interval is typically measured relative to the heart rate. Therefore, the QT interval often requires "correction" for the current heart rate, in order to correctly stratify the risk of torsades de pointes. A wealth of correctional formulae have been derived, but none has proven superior. We present an approach to the ECG in this context, and a step-by-step guide to manually measuring and correcting the QT interval, and an approach to management in common hospital-based clinical scenarios.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) — genetic testing utility and yield: Genetic testing for disease-causing mutations in LQTS offers important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic information, and a positive test can facilitate establishing risk for family members. The yield of genetic testing in phenotype-positive patients is 50% to 86%. A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis, which relies on clinical evaluation. In asymptomatic patients with otherwise unexplained prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) ≥ 480 ms on serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis and supplement prognostic information.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome — risk with normal QTc and beta-blocker considerations: Approximately 10% to 36% of genotype-positive patients have QTc intervals ≤ 440 ms and, although patients with normal QTc have a lower risk of VA and SCD than those with prolonged QTc, they still have increased risk versus genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched patients. Beta blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events substantially; during the periods of highest risk in the first 3 decades of life, treatment with a beta blocker may reduce risk of SCA. Because QTc changes over time, assessment of QTc on ECG annually or with medication changes and assessment of medication efficacy with exercise testing are indicated, and asymptomatic adult (male) patients with normal QTc intervals may choose to decline beta-blocker therapy.

While published guidelines are useful in the care of patients with long-QT syndrome, it can be difficult to decide how to apply the guidelines to individual patients, particularly those with intermediate risk. We explored the diversity of opinion among 24 clinicians with expertise in long-QT syndrome. Experts from various regions and institutions were presented with 4 challenging clinical scenarios and asked to provide commentary emphasizing why they would make their treatment recommendations. All 24 authors were asked to vote on case-specific questions so as to demonstrate the degree of consensus or divergence of opinion. Of 24 authors, 23 voted and 1 abstained. Details of voting results with commentary are presented. There was consensus on several key points, particularly on the importance of the diagnostic evaluation and of β-blocker use. There was diversity of opinion about the appropriate use of other therapeutic measures in intermediate-risk individuals. Significant gaps in knowledge were identified.

Drug‑induced QT prolongation and management — many marketed cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolong ventricular repolarization and can precipitate life‑threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias; susceptibility may relate to genetic propensity or female gender and more commonly to elevated drug blood levels from excessive dosage, renal disease, or drug interactions. If ventricular arrhythmia may be due to QT prolongation from prescribed medications, the possible offending therapies should be discontinued and follow‑up monitoring of ventricular repolarization and cardiac rhythm should be carried out.

Introduction

Congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), as the name implies, is characterised by a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, in the absence of structural heart disease and external factors such as a variety of drugs.LQTS was first described in the 1950s of the previous century, initially in a family with deafness (ie, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome). A few years later, in the early 1960s, patients with a similar ECG abnormality but without deafness were described (ie, Romano-Ward syndrome). Although initially this disease was subdivided into these two entities, later in time the more general terminology LQTS was used, and more recently (1995–1996), it became clear that, based on the underlying genetic defect, a further subdivision into distinct subtypes is pertinent. The various milestones in the over 60 years history of this disease are nicely summarised in a recent personal review by Dr Schwartz.

### Electrocardiographic implications of the prolonged QT interval [^111hKNxn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The QT interval measures the time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval may lead to malignant ventricular tachydysrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. Causes of QT prolongation include congenital abnormalities of the sodium or potassium channel, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications; idiopathic causes have also been identified. Patients can be asymptomatic or present with syncope, palpitations, seizure-like activity, or sudden cardiac death. Management involves looking for and treating reversible causes. For patients with congenital or idiopathic QT interval prolongation, the use of beta-blockers can be considered. Certain subsets of patients benefit from implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. Clinicians must remain vigilant for QT interval prolongation when interpreting electrocardiograms, especially in patients presenting with syncope or ventricular arrhythmias.

Identifying causes and risk for QT prolongation

If patients have QTc prolongation, correctable causes should be identified. First, electrolytes should be measured and any abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) should be corrected before treatment. Patients with cancer specifically are at risk for electrolyte imbalance, especially during cancer treatment, because of the following: (1) poor oral intake and conditions that promote loss of potassium and/or magnesium, like salt‐losing nephropathy secondary to platinum salts; (2) diarrhea or emesis from mucositis; (3) fever with sweating; (4) treatment with laxatives; (5) alcohol abuse; and (6) treatment with corticosteroids. Drugs with potentially synergistic effects with cancer therapy to prolong QTc should be identified and modified or stopped. Table 3 provides a selective list of commonly used noncancer treatment drugs that prolong QTc and some safer alternatives, and an exhaustive list can be obtained fromand is updated frequently. 188 Other causes of baseline QTc prolongation include structural heart disease 189 and genetic inherited arrhythmias, including Brugada syndrome, congenital long QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These patients should be evaluated by a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist before cancer therapy with potential QT‐prolonging drugs. A comprehensive review of all medications that need to be avoided or the strategy for monitoring during the treatment should be defined carefully in these patients before cancer therapy. 190

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS — congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) recommendations: In patients with LQTS and a resting QTc greater than 470 ms, a beta blocker is recommended. In high-risk symptomatic LQTS when a beta blocker is ineffective or not tolerated, intensification of therapy with additional medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or an ICD is recommended. In LQTS with recurrent appropriate ICD shocks despite maximum tolerated beta blocker doses, intensification of medical therapy with additional medications or left cardiac sympathetic denervation is recommended. In clinically diagnosed LQTS, genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended. In suspected LQTS, ambulatory ECG monitoring, recording the ECG lying and immediately on standing, and/or exercise treadmill testing can be useful to establish diagnosis and monitor response. In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc less than 470 ms, chronic beta blocker therapy is reasonable. In asymptomatic LQTS with a resting QTc greater than 500 ms while on a beta blocker, intensification of therapy with medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation or an ICD may be considered. In LQTS, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

Specialist Consultation

Cardiology and/or cardiac electrophysiology (EP) consultation is specifically advised in the following: (1) patients seen with a markedly prolonged QTc interval (> 500 ms); (2) those receiving treatment with a known QTc‐prolonging drug, who experience symptoms suggestive of being of cardiac origin; and (3) those with known inherited arrhythmia disorders. Patients who experience associated syncope or presyncope suspected to be of cardiac origin, rapid palpitations, or QTc prolongation with new‐onset bradycardia (HR < 60 bpm) and a high degree of heart block (second and third degree) are at high risk for repeated episodes and should be in a monitored setting with specialist consultation. 199

Long‐Term Treatment

No recommendations on the role of cardiac implantable device insertion exist to date. Patients with severe bradycardia secondary to cancer therapy who are candidates for a QTc‐prolonging drug may benefit from a dual‐chamber pacemaker insertion to avoid symptomatic sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses that are risk factors for TdP. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator should be considered as follows: (1) if the life expectancy of the patient is > 1 year, (2) if the patient has experienced resuscitated SCD, or (3) if the patient has experienced severe arrhythmia from a known QTc‐prolonging agent without any correctable cause and no alternative cancer treatment is available. These patients require careful individual evaluation and discussion in a multidisciplinary team to ensure that the risks and benefits of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy are considered. Also, the potential to turn off active implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy if and when a patient reaches the palliative stage should be discussed.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome — clinical features and risks include that marked QT prolongation with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs and most cases display a "short-long-short" sequence before tachycardia. QT intervals, uncorrected for rate, are generally greater than 500 ms, prominent U waves are common, and marked QTU prolongation may be evident only on postpause beats. Genetic susceptibility may contribute, with commoner DNA variants having frequencies ranging up to 15% of some populations. Presentations include incidental detection, palpitations, syncope due to prolonged episodes of torsades de pointes, or sudden cardiac death. The QT-prolonging agent d-sotalol increased mortality in a large randomized clinical trial, and in the DIAMOND trial, 3.3% of patients with severe heart failure (HF) had torsades de pointes during the first 72 h of dofetilide therapy.

Appropriate measurement of QTc

Measurement of the QT should be based on leads that normally show the earliest QRS onset and the latest end of the T wave (T‐wave offset), which are II and V5. The end of the QT interval is the point at which the T wave reaches the isoelectric line. A normal QTc interval is > 350 and < 450 ms in adult men and > 360 and < 460 ms in adult women. Because the QT interval is inversely proportional to heart rate (HR), different formulas have been described to correct the QT interval for the HR. The objective of calculating the QTc is to obtain a patient's QT corrected to an HR of 60 beats per minute (bpm) which equals to an R interval to R interval (RR) time of 1000ms. The Bazett formulaand the Fridericia formula are based on the assumption of an exponential relationship between QT and the beat to beat interval (RR interval). This relationship is less precise for fast HRs and, hence, other formulas were suggested as alternatives, especially for faster HR (> 90 bpm): the Framingham formula 183, assuming a linear relationship, and the Hodges formula. 184 The Bazett and Fridericia formulas are used most commonly, but evidence supports correcting QT with the Hodges formula to be more accurate, especially at an HR > 90 bpm. 185 When an intraventricular conduction delay, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, or paced rhythm (usually adopting left bundle branch block–like morphological features) is present, a modified QT interval can be calculated by subtracting 48.5% of the duration of the QRS from the measured QT and then correcting it for HR with conventional formulas or by taking a QTc of > 550 ms as abnormal without any substraction. 186 Subtracting the QRS duration from the QT measurement (ie, calculating the so‐called JT interval) and using a cutoff of > 360 ms is an alternative to the modified QT interval calculation. 187 Most ECG machines automatically report a QT interval by calculating the time between the earliest QRS onset of all leads and the latest offset of the T wave. As a result, the automatic QT interval is often longer than the QT interval from any individual lead. Also, automated measurements have not been validated in conduction abnormalities (eg, left bundle branch block) and, hence, manual measurement is the only option. Figure 3 provides useful examples of QT measurement and corrections in several ECG scenarios. It is our suggestion that the QTc calculation can be performed accurately with HR between 60 and 90 bpm with both Bazett and Fridericia formulas and that for HR > 90 bpm, the Hodges correction is the most widely accepted. When a broad QRS of > 120 ms (bundle branch block or conduction delay) is present using a QTc of > 550 ms as a cutoff for abnormality is acceptable, but if baseline QTc is at the upper end of normal or for QRS that is wide but < 120 ms, it is our advice to use the modified QT interval (see above) for a more precise and reproducible measurement.

### QT interval and drug therapy [^111dBbWc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is an important component of the electrocardiogram, which when prolonged can predict the risk of developing the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. There is growing understanding of the genetics associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increasing number of drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Consequently, assessment of the effect of drugs on the QT interval has become a significant aspect of drug development, regulatory assessment and clinical care. Here, we review the QT interval and the risks associated with drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

Monitoring adequacy of beta-blocker therapy using exercise testing can be beneficial, particularly in school-aged patients, and beta-blocker therapy may be associated with a decrease in supine and peak exercise QTc, with the exception of long QT syndrome type 1 patients with C-loop mutations.

### QTc: how long is too long? [^116pvpXX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) affects an estimated 1 in 2500 people and typically presents with syncope, seizures or sudden death. Whereas someone exhibiting marked prolongation of the QT interval with QTc exceeding 500 ms who was just externally defibrillated from torsades de pointes while swimming poses negligible diagnostic challenge as to the unequivocal probability of LQTS, the certainty is considerably less for the otherwise asymptomatic person who happens to host a QTc value coined "borderline" (QTc ≥ 440 ms). Although a normal QT interval imparts a much lower risk of life-threatening events, it does not preclude a patient from nevertheless harbouring a potentially lethal LQTS-causing genetic mutation. Indeed, genetic testing exerts significant diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, the 12-lead ECG remains the universal initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of LQTS and is subject to miscalculation, misinterpretation and mishandling. This review discusses the components of accurate QTc measurement and diagnosis, re-examines what is known about factors affecting QT interval measurement, and clarifies current recommendations regarding diagnosis of so-called "borderline" QT interval prolongation. The current guideline recommendations for the athlete with LQTS are also summarised.

### Management of ventricular fibrillation or unstable ventricular tachycardia in patients with congenital long-QT syndrome: a suggested modification to ACLS guidelines [^115z7VD2]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the QT interval is a known risk factor for syncope, seizures and sudden cardiac death. Most patients with QT prolongation have an acquired cause, but congenital forms of QT prolongation are being increasingly recognized. However, existing advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) treatment algorithms for prolonged QT mediated ventricular fibrillation pertains to acquired long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Here, a young patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest secondary to congenital LQTS illustrates critical exceptions to the current ACLS treatment algorithms for ventricular fibrillation and unstable ventricular tachycardia when QT prolongation is congenital in origin. A clarified ACLS algorithm is proposed.

### Long QT syndrome: diagnosis and management [^114T1CWh]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Long QT syndrome (LQT) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, causing torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. The LQT is a disorder of cardiac repolarization caused by alterations in the transmembrane potassium and sodium currents. Congenital LQT is a disease of transmembrane ion-channel proteins. Six genetic loci of the disease have been identified. Sporadic cases of the disease occur as a result of spontaneous mutations. The acquired causes of LQT include drugs, electrolyte imbalance, marked bradycardia, cocaine, organophosphorus compounds, subarachnoid hemorrhage, myocardial ischemia, protein sparing fasting, autonomic neuropathy, and human immunodeficiency virus disease.

Methods

Data on the diagnosis and management of LQT were thoroughly reviewed.

Results and Conclusions

The diagnosis of LQT primarily rests on clinical and electrocardiographic features and family history. The clinical presentations range from dizziness to syncope and sudden death. Genetic screening is available primarily as a research tool. Short-term treatment of LQT is aimed at preventing the recurrences of torsades and includes intravenous magnesium and potassium administration, temporary cardiac pacing, withdrawal of the offending agent, correction of electrolyte imbalance, and, rarely, intravenous isoproterenol administration. The long-term treatment is aimed at reducing the QT-interval duration and preventing the torsades and sudden death and includes use of oral beta-adrenergic blockers, implantation of permanent pacemaker/cardioverter-defibrillator, and left thoracic sympathectomy. Sodium channel blockers are promising agents under investigation. Electrocardiograms are recorded for screening of family members. The data favor treating asymptomatic patients, if < 40 years old at the time of diagnosis, with beta-adrenergic blockers.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^1113Go9z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Systematic Search of Cancer Therapy‐Induced QT Prolongation

Search strategy

Our search adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews. 3 We performed a literature search with 3 databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases (1974–December, 2015) using 3 concepts: (1) clinical trials, (2) individual anticancer drugs, and (3) cardiotoxicity. Only English‐language articles were reviewed. Reference lists of individual publications and review articles were searched manually for additional studies, and drug labels of individual drugs were reviewed.

Study selection

Phase 1 trials evaluating the effects on QT interval of individual cancer drugs at different doses, phase 2 trials, phase 3 randomized controlled trials, and phase 4 postmarketing studies with systematic monitoring and reporting of ECG data and cardiovascular safety were considered. Prospective cohort studies were included if systematic ECG monitoring was performed. Episodes of arrhythmia or SCD were not taken into account if there was an alternative explanation for their occurrence or if there was no ECG monitoring during the study. Older clinical trials without relevant information on the QT or nonsystematic collection of ECG data were excluded (Figure 1).

Data Management and Analysis: Data extraction

All data were extracted by 2 cardiologists (A.P.‐S. and C.G.) using predefined electronic data extraction forms, including number of subjects treated, number of subjects experiencing QT prolongation (any Common Terminology Cancer Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale version 3 grading), number of subjects experiencing grade III or more QT prolongation (ie, QT corrected prolongation of > 60 ms from baseline or > 500 ms), arrhythmia episodes, and SCD. No data on other cardiotoxic effects of the drugs were collected.

Data synthesis

The proportion of patients with QT prolongation or arrhythmia events or cases of SCD was calculated for every study. For each drug, a weighted average of the proportion of patients experiencing QT prolongation was calculated from all the studies using the number of patients treated in each study as the weighting factor.

European Heart Journal: Cardiovascular Imaging (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to management of QTc prolongation, EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend to interrupt QTc-prolonging cancer therapy temporarily in patients developing asymptomatic QTc interval ≥ 500 ms (using Fridericia correction) and repeat ECG every 24 hours until resolution of the QTc prolongation.

### How to diagnose and manage QT Prolongation in cancer patients [^114kVBhG]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past 30 years, the development of efficacious treatment regimens has increased overall survival among cancer patients. However, many of these treatments can cause QT prolongation which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. Prolonged QT can lead to a polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes (TdP). The clinical presentation can be insidious varying between minimal symptoms to severe manifestations, including sudden cardiac death.

Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to QT prolongation. In this "How To", we use a clinical case to show our approach to the diagnosis and management of QT prolongation in cancer patients.

Patients with long QT syndrome are most commonly of three types. It is important to understand several points about this potentially lethal syndrome: 1. What precipitates the syndrome? 2. What channelopathies are involved? 3. What are the characteristic T-wave abnormalities seen in patients with long QT syndrome? 4. What therapy should be initiated? 5. Who needs an ICD? Table I summarizes several key features of the different long QT syndromes.

### Amisulpride overdose: suggested management of prolonged QTc [^114GZyWF]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A case of amisulpride overdose is presented and its effect on prolonging the QT (corrected) interval is discussed. Amisulpride is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and part of its safety profile is that is has no effect on the QT interval in therapeutic doses. The efficacy of intravenous calcium in restoring the QT to normal is proposed.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^111WhdTa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The advances in treatment of cancer have led to significant improvement in cancer‐related mortality. 1 Although many of the conventional drugs, such as the anthracyclines, continue to be used widely, there are many efficacious targeted therapies that are introduced into the market. An important off‐target effect of some of these drugs includes abnormalities in cardiac repolarization resulting in QT prolongation. QT prolongation has been linked to an increased risk of life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmia and reports of sudden cardiac death (SCD). 2 Therefore, the management of the effects of cancer therapeutics on cardiac repolarization necessitates collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists. This systematic review of the literature of conventional and targeted anticancer therapies is intended to help the clinicians do the following: (1) appreciate the QT prolongation and arrhythmia potential of the many commonly used cancer drugs; (2) recognize the need for careful evaluation of the QT changes, especially in the context of other underlying ECG or cardiac abnormalities; and (3) understand strategies to investigate and manage patients with cancer therapy–induced QT prolongation, such that the risk of SCD is not increased and potentially lifesaving cancer therapy is not withheld inappropriately.

### Prolonged QT syndrome and sedation: a case report and a review of the literature [^11744j9k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Prolonged QT syndrome is the most common genetic arrhythmia syndrome, and the majority of patients are undiagnosed. The syndrome is characterized by abnormally long ventricular repolarization (QT interval) on electrocardiogram, which may manifest as syncopal episodes, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by stress or medications. There are few randomized controlled trials examining the safety of typical sedation medications in the patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome. This case describes the management of sedation in a patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome and then reviews the current literature regarding commonly utilized sedation medications.
