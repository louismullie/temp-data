## Question

Patient with Aki on ckd, when are you able to discharge

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a patient with acute kidney injury (AKI) on chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be safely discharged from the hospital. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical stability of the patient and whether the precipitating cause of AKI has been addressed. Then, I should verify the trajectory of kidney function recovery and whether the patient is dialysis dependent or independent at discharge. Next, I will review electrolyte, acid-base, and volume status, followed by medication reconciliation and nephrotoxin management. After that, I need to ensure discharge documentation and follow-up plans are aligned with guidelines, including timing of reassessment. Finally, I will consider special populations and risk stratification to individualize the plan, and then synthesize a practical decision framework for discharge readiness [^b6904b47] [^3710d6cf] [^badd8d04].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: discharge readiness hinges on clinical stability and a downward risk trajectory, not on complete normalization of kidney function, because recovery can continue after discharge and CKD patients are at higher risk of non-recovery and adverse outcomes, so I should not delay discharge solely for incomplete biochemical recovery if the patient is otherwise stable [^6f64200c] [^b4afe1ba].

> I will now examine the precipitating cause and its resolution, because discharge should not occur until the AKI trigger has been identified and is adequately treated or controlled; common drivers include sepsis, hypovolemia, nephrotoxins, obstruction, or cardiorenal syndrome, and I need to ensure these are addressed and that the clinical course is improving before discharge [^b6904b47] [^03899f8c].

> Next, I should review the kidney function trajectory; for dialysis-independent patients, I need to check that creatinine is on a downward trend or has plateaued near baseline, acknowledging that eGFR equations are less reliable in AKI and that muscle mass loss can confound creatinine, so I should interpret trends cautiously and avoid overpromising recovery timelines [^c087dca6] [^00cac3f5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dialysis dependence; I should confirm whether the patient still needs renal replacement therapy (RRT) at discharge, because up to 30% of AKI survivors may require outpatient dialysis, and in those cases I must arrange transitional dialysis, preserve residual renal function, and set expectations about recovery, which can occur in 20–60% over months, with baseline kidney function as the strongest predictor [^ccf7146f] [^fc8c6bd0] [^f2b06982].

> I need to ensure electrolyte, acid-base, and volume status are stable off IV therapies; specifically, potassium should be less than about 5.5 mmol/L, bicarbonate should be at least 18–20 mmol/L if feasible, and the patient should be euvolemic or at a safe dry weight with a plan for outpatient diuretic titration if needed, because instability in these domains increases readmission risk and delays recovery [^notfound].

> Let me consider medication reconciliation carefully; I should stop or dose-adjust nephrotoxic drugs, provide clear instructions on which medications to hold during acute illness ("sick day rules"), and reconcile chronic CKD medications such as RAAS inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors, recognizing that early post-discharge RAAS use has been associated with better outcomes in some cohorts, while still individualizing based on potassium and kidney function [^badd8d04] [^cdc97b13] [^4d6753d2].

> I should double-check the discharge documentation requirements; the discharge summary must record the AKI episode, maximum KDIGO stage, etiology, whether RRT was needed and if it is ongoing, and the discharge creatinine/eGFR, and it should explicitly request post-discharge kidney function monitoring and specify timing of follow-up, because this materially improves transitions of care and long-term outcomes [^3710d6cf] [^dbd06f90] [^badd8d04].

> Now, regarding follow-up timing, I need to ensure the plan matches risk; for high-risk patients such as those with stage 3 AKI, pre-existing CKD, or dialysis at discharge, nephrology follow-up within 1–2 weeks is reasonable, whereas for lower-risk stage 1 AKI without CKD, primary care follow-up in about 3 months may suffice, with earlier checks if labs are abnormal or symptoms arise; importantly, KDIGO advises reassessing all AKI survivors at 3 months to distinguish resolved AKI from new or worsening CKD, and ERBP suggests not later than 2 months for high-risk inpatients [^b6904b47] [^0dffc80d] [^c55dd287].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population; for cirrhosis, I should coordinate hepatology–nephrology follow-up within about 1 month given high readmission and metabolic complications, and consider cystatin C to better estimate kidney function; for postoperative patients, I should arrange kidney function checks within 1 month and escalate to nephrology if dysfunction persists at 90 days; for pediatrics, earlier follow-up is advisable given developmental considerations and growth-related changes in kidney function [^a12f675f] [^8dfe45d2] [^37cb36f5].

> I should confirm that the patient and caregivers receive education on warning signs, fluid and blood pressure targets, and medication safety; patient information leaflets and structured education improve awareness and may reduce recurrent AKI, and I need to ensure there is a clear plan for obtaining labs and who will act on results, because under-monitoring after discharge is common and associated with worse outcomes [^a6ba6542] [^7d981751].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework: discharge is appropriate when the precipitating cause is controlled, the patient is clinically stable, and either kidney function is recovering with a safe downward trajectory and no immediate dialysis need, or dialysis needs are stable with outpatient arrangements in place; I should add that even if creatinine has not returned to baseline, discharge can proceed if the trend is favorable and reliable follow-up is secured, given the high risk of non-recovery and long-term complications in CKD patients with AKI [^b4afe1ba] [^6f64200c].

> Finally, I should verify that my plan aligns with evidence on long-term risk; AKI survivors, especially those with CKD, have higher risks of mortality, CKD progression, and ESRD, so I must not falsely reassure when post-discharge eGFR looks "normal", and I should build in surveillance for proteinuria and blood pressure control, with RAAS blockade when indicated, to mitigate future kidney decline and cardiovascular events [^1a170f49] [^43404a0e] [^8fad0a00].

Patients with AKI on CKD can be discharged when they are **clinically stable** — hemodynamically stable, with electrolytes and acid–base balance controlled, and no active complications — and when there is a **downward trend in creatinine** or stabilization near baseline, even if not fully recovered. Discharge is also appropriate if the patient remains dialysis dependent, provided there is a clear outpatient dialysis plan and close follow-up. Discharge should include medication reconciliation, patient education, and a scheduled follow-up within 1–2 weeks for high-risk patients or within 3 months for all AKI survivors to assess renal recovery and screen for new or worsening CKD [^b6904b47] [^0dffc80d].

---

## Clinical stability criteria

Before discharge, patients must meet the following **clinical stability criteria**:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Stable blood pressure and heart rate without ongoing vasopressor support.

- **Electrolyte and acid-base balance**: Potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, and calcium within acceptable ranges; no life-threatening hyperkalemia or severe metabolic acidosis.

- **Volume status**: Euvolemia or a safe dry weight achieved; no pulmonary edema or significant peripheral edema.

- **Absence of active complications**: No active infection, bleeding, or uncontrolled pain.

---

## Renal function recovery criteria

Renal function recovery should be assessed using **serial measurements of serum creatinine and urine output**. Discharge is appropriate when:

- **Downward trend or stabilization**: Serum creatinine is decreasing or has stabilized near the patient's baseline, even if not fully recovered.

- **Dialysis independence**: The patient is no longer requiring dialysis, or there is a clear outpatient dialysis plan if still dependent.

- **Urine output**: Adequate urine output (> 0.5 mL/kg/hr) without significant oliguria or anuria.

---

## Documentation and follow-up planning

Comprehensive documentation and follow-up planning are essential at discharge. The discharge summary should include the **AKI episode, maximum stage, etiology, renal function at discharge, and dialysis status** [^3710d6cf]. Follow-up should be arranged within 1–2 weeks for high-risk patients (e.g. stage 3 AKI, pre-existing CKD, or dialysis dependence) and within 3 months for all AKI survivors to assess renal recovery and screen for new or worsening CKD [^b6904b47] [^0dffc80d].

---

## Patient education and medication reconciliation

Patient education and medication reconciliation are critical to prevent recurrence and ensure adherence. Provide education on **AKI recognition, hydration, and when to seek medical attention**, and reconcile medications by adjusting doses to current renal function, avoiding nephrotoxins, and providing clear instructions on sick-day rules [^badd8d04].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **additional considerations**:

- **Dialysis-dependent patients**: Ensure a clear outpatient dialysis plan, including modality, frequency, and access care [^ccf7146f].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of non-recovery and complications; consider earlier follow-up and enhanced monitoring [^c55dd287].

- **Patients with significant comorbidities**: Tailor follow-up and monitoring to individual risk factors and clinical context [^2dfa2fb0].

---

## Summary of discharge criteria

| **Criterion** | **Requirement** |
|-|-|
| Clinical stability | Hemodynamically stable; electrolytes and acid-base balance controlled; no active complications |
| Renal function | Downward trend or stabilization of creatinine; adequate urine output |
| Dialysis status | Independence from dialysis or clear outpatient dialysis plan |
| Documentation | Comprehensive discharge summary with AKI details and follow-up plan |
| Follow-up | Scheduled within 1–2 weeks for high-risk patients; within 3 months for all |
| Education | Patient educated on AKI recognition, hydration, and medication adherence |
| Medication reconciliation | Doses adjusted; nephrotoxins avoided; sick-day rules provided |

---

Patients with AKI on CKD can be discharged once they are **clinically stable**, show evidence of renal recovery or have a secure dialysis plan, and have appropriate follow-up and education in place. This approach balances the need for continued recovery with the risks of prolonged hospitalization.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^6f64200c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of critical illness and carries a significant risk of short- and long-term mortality, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular events. The degree of renal recovery from AKI may substantially affect these long-term endpoints. Therefore maximising recovery of renal function should be the goal of any AKI prevention and treatment strategy. Defining renal recovery is far from straightforward due in part to the limitations of the tests available to assess renal function. Here, we discuss common pitfalls in the evaluation of renal recovery and provide suggestions for improved assessment in the future. We review the epidemiology of renal recovery and of the association between AKI and the development of CKD. Finally, we stress the importance of post-discharge follow-up of AKI patients and make suggestions for its incorporation into clinical practice. Summary key points are that risk factors for non-recovery of AKI are age, CKD, comorbidity, higher severity of AKI and acute disease scores. Second, AKI and CKD are mutually related and seem to have a common denominator. Third, despite its limitations full recovery of AKI may best be defined as the absence of AKI criteria, and partial recovery as a fall in AKI stage. Fourth, after an episode of AKI, serial follow-up measurements of serum creatinine and proteinuria are warranted to diagnose renal impairment and prevent further progression. Measures to promote recovery are similar to those preventing renal harm. Specific interventions promoting repair are still experimental.

Background

AKI has become a well-recognised medical condition since the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, and the introduction of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance in 2013 (subsequently updated in 2019) which highlight the impact of AKI on patients and their long-term health. AKI is an acute change (within 7 days) in the patients' baseline renal function; specifically, creatinine and/or urine output. AKI covers a wide range of clinical conditions, ranging from mild injury (stage 1) to severe injury (stage 3), which can result in permanent and complete loss of renal function. These three stages of AKI are classified using internationally agreed staging(table 1).

Table 1
Kidney Disease| Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) staging

AKI is a common complication of many other acute illnesses, such as sepsis or dehydration. It is present in 22% of hospital patients, and is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, with patients being at increased risk of death during their hospital stay, alongside increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), despite the severity of their AKI. While it was previously thought that AKI was completely reversible with no long-term health implications for patients, there is growing evidence that even a single episode of AKI can lead to permanent organ damage. The impact of a single episode of AKI can lead to future AKIs, the development of CKD, and increase the risk of other complications such as cardiovascular diseaseand stroke. Despite its high prevalence and associated morbidity, many AKIs are preventable, or treatable with rapid recognition and treatment. To date, much of the literature has focused on the role of professionals in managing and reducing such risks. Less work has been done to consider the role patients have in altering disease progression through modifying or changing their behaviour.

1.3. Further follow-up of AKI

1.3.1 Assess patients 2 months after AKI to evaluate the completeness of resolution, the detection of new onset CKD or worsening of pre-existing CKD. (1C)

Rationale

Observations in recently published epidemiological studies show that in a considerable number of patients who survive the acute clinical condition, CKD develops or worsens. Thus, management of patients should extend even beyond the condition of AKI, and should include monitoring for new-onset CKD. Although the follow-up interval after which an assessment should occur is a matter of clinical judgement, we feel that in high-risk in-patients kidney function should be re-assessed not later than 2 months after hospital discharge. Patients should be managed according to appropriate guidelines if CKD is detected.

### Acute-on-chronic kidney injury at hospital discharge is associated with long-term dialysis and mortality [^b4afe1ba]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) is among the most potent predictors of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we quantified this risk in a multicenter, observational study of 9425 patients who survived to hospital discharge after major surgery. CKD was defined as a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). AKI was stratified according to the maximum simplified RIFLE classification at hospitalization and unresolved AKI defined as a persistent increase in serum creatinine of more than half above the baseline or the need for dialysis at discharge. A Cox proportional hazard model showed that patients with AKI-on-CKD during hospitalization had significantly worse long-term survival over a median follow-up of 4.8 years (hazard ratio, 1.7) than patients with AKI but without CKD. The incidence of long-term dialysis was 22.4 and 0.17 per 100 person-years among patients with and without existing CKD, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for long-term dialysis in patients with AKI-on-CKD was 19.8 compared to patients who developed AKI without existing CKD. Furthermore, AKI-on-CKD but without kidney recovery at discharge had a worse outcome (hazard ratios of 4.6 and 213, respectively) for mortality and long-term dialysis as compared to patients without CKD or AKI. Thus, in a large cohort of postoperative patients who developed AKI, those with existing CKD were at higher risk for long-term mortality and dialysis after hospital discharge than those without. These outcomes were significantly worse in those with unresolved AKI at discharge.

Follow-up of AKI patients

Which patients require follow-up?

Follow-up for development of CKD should be considered in all patients who developed AKI, irrespective of the apparent degree of renal recovery. Importantly, while only a small proportion of AKI survivors may develop ESKD over time, many instead die, especially from cardiovascular causes. CKD is indeed strongly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In younger survivors, development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease may accelerate CKD progression, so that ESKD may develop after many years even if there is an apparently good initial recovery. Thus, in all groups of AKI survivors there is great potential for interventions to improve longer-term outcomes.

How to organize follow-up?

In practice the main hurdle is identifying patients for follow-up. This can be problematic as hospital discharge may be many weeks or months following the episode of AKI with the discharging team often not involved in the active management of the patient during their critical illness. Currently only a minority of patients who require RRT in the ICU and recover renal function receive nephrology follow-up, illustrating the need to establish robust mechanisms to ensure targeted AKI follow-up. Such services have been developed and piloted, but generally remain dependent on referral of patients following inpatient nephrology consultation, emphasising the need for appropriate involvement of renal services as inpatients to allow appropriately targeted follow-up. Care pathways for follow-up should vary according to need. Patients with significant overt renal impairment at hospital discharge (e.g. eGFR less than 30 mL/min/m 2) require reassessment of renal function, probably within 2 weeks of discharge. In others, reassessment of renal function at 90 days after insult is more appropriate, to allow time for both recovery of muscle mass and any further recovery of renal function, permitting a clearer assessment of the new baseline renal function (Fig. 4). Timing and location of follow-up will be dependent on local resources; however, it is likely to be impracticable for all stage 1 AKI to receive follow-up in secondary care. Effective long-term management of CKD can be achieved in primary care, but this is only possible if patients are identified at discharge and appropriate clinical guidelines are provided by specialists.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) long-term risk — some patients remain at elevated risk after apparent recovery: Lastly, the fact that some 30% of patients who recover from AKI remain at increased risk of CKD, cardiovascular disease, and death calls for the identification of the risk factors that can identify such patients in the hopes of providing them with timely preventive measures.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^ccf7146f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

ASN Kidney Health Guidance — AKI-D recovery prognosis and individualized management notes that outpatient recovery of kidney function ranges from 20% to 60% of patients and that at 6 months after discharge, 31% of patients with AKI-D achieved dialysis independence. Baseline kidney function is identified as the strongest predictive factor, and even among stage 4 CKD (chronic kidney disease), up to 20%–30% of patients will experience recovery. Because of poor predictive accuracy, it is appropriate to err on the side of assuming that most patients will recover, and therefore, all patients should initially receive AKI-D–specific individualized care; for patients with a high likelihood of recovery of kidney function, it is appropriate to maintain this approach for at least 90 days after discharge. Conversely, for patients with low likelihood for recovery, earlier designation of ESRD (end-stage renal disease) diagnosis may be appropriate, and for those with significant comorbidities, nephrologists should facilitate shared goals-of-care discussions, including advanced care planning and palliative care options.

### The aftermath of acute kidney injury: a narrative review of long-term mortality and renal function [^731ccdc8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication of hospitalization and is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality. While AKI is a known risk factor for short-term adverse outcomes, more recent data suggest that the risk of mortality and renal dysfunction extends far beyond hospital discharge. However, determining whether this risk applies to all patients who experience an episode of AKI is difficult. The magnitude of this risk seems highly dependent on the presence of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, preexisting CKD, and renal recovery. Furthermore, these comorbidities themselves lead to structural renal damage due to multiple pathophysiological changes, including glomeruloscleroses and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which can lead to the loss of residual capacity, glomerular hyperfiltration, and continued deterioration of renal function. AKI seems to accelerate this deterioration and increase the risk of death, CDK, and ESRD in most vulnerable patients. Therefore, we strongly advocate adequate hemodynamic monitoring and follow-up in patients susceptible to renal dysfunction. Additionally, other potential renal stressors, including nephrotoxic medications and iodine-containing contrast fluids, should be avoided. Unfortunately, therapeutic interventions are not yet available. Additional research is warranted and should focus on the prevention of AKI, identification of therapeutic targets, and provision of adequate follow-up to those who survive an episode of AKI.

### AKI transition of care: a potential opportunity to detect and prevent CKD [^443868a9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence rate of AKI is increasing across the spectrum of hospitalized children and adults. Given the increased morbidity and mortality associated with AKI, significant research effort has been appropriately focused on standardizing AKI definitions, identifying risk factors, and discovering and validating novel, earlier structural biomarkers of kidney injury. In addition, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that AKI is a risk factor for the future development or accelerated progression of CKD. Unfortunately, prospective observational studies have not consistently followed survivors of episodes of AKI for longitudinal outcomes after hospital discharge, which could lead to ascertainment bias in terms of over- or underestimation of CKD development. Furthermore, data show that clinical follow-up of AKI survivors is low. This lack of systematic study and clinical follow-up represents a potential missed opportunity to prevent chronic disease after an acute illness and improve outcomes. Therefore, prospective study of transitions of care after episodes of AKI is needed to identify which patients are at risk for CKD development and to optimally target therapeutic interventions.

### Preexisting chronic kidney disease: a potential for improved outcomes from acute kidney injury [^5e8434c3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The influence of preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) on AKI outcomes is unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We analyzed data from a prospective observational cohort study of AKI in critically ill patients who received nephrology consultation: the Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease. In-hospital mortality rate, length of stay, and dialysis dependence were compared in patients with and without a prior history of CKD, defined by an elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria, and/or abnormal renal ultrasound within a year before hospitalization. We hypothesized that patients with AKI and prior history of CKD would have lower mortality rates, shorter lengths of stay, and higher rates of dialysis dependence than patients without prior history of CKD.

Results

Patients with AKI and a prior history of CKD were older and underwent nephrology consultation earlier in the course of AKI. In-hospital mortality rate was lower (31 versus 40%, P = 0.04), and median intensive care unit length of stay was 4.6 d shorter (14.7 versus 19.3 d, P = 0.001) in patients with a prior history of CKD. Among dialyzed survivors, patients with prior CKD were also more likely to be dialysis dependent at hospital discharge. Differences in outcome were most evident in patients with lower severity of illness.

Conclusions

Among critically ill patients with AKI, those with prior CKD experience a lower mortality rate but are more likely to be dialysis dependent at hospital discharge. Future studies should determine optimal strategies for managing AKI with and without a prior history of CKD.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1c9841a4]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Rationale for a guideline on AKI — AKI is a global problem with immediate and long-term adverse outcomes, more prevalent in and a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), with individuals with CKD especially susceptible; the burden may be greatest in developing countries, and early detection to prevent progression to kidney failure requiring dialysis is of paramount importance, yet preventable risk factors are not widely known and variably practiced.

### Validation of risk prediction models to inform clinical decisions after acute kidney injury [^2c383f7b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Plain-Language Summary

Despite frequent poor outcomes, there is limited evidence to guide the way in which we prioritize care after acute kidney injury (AKI). This study validates 2 clinical risk models for outcomes in hospital survivors and AKI survivors. We used decision curve analysis to compare which decision strategies provide more benefit than harm. We found that risk models predicting death or readmission and chronic kidney disease have the potential to assist follow-up decisions after AKI and could be superior to alternative strategies such as prioritizing AKI severity or kidney recovery alone. We also found that many patients currently receive little or no postdischarge monitoring after AKI. This indicates possible opportunities for the implementation of decision support to guide postdischarge care for people hospitalized with AKI.

Editorial, p. 16

Among the 1 in 7 people in hospital who develop acute kidney injury (AKI), many continue to experience poor health outcomes even after discharge, including a 1 in 3 risk of unplanned readmissions within 90 days (especially with heart failure), and incomplete recovery of kidney function leading to new or progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) over the first year. From this large and heterogeneous group of people with AKI, it remains unclear which individuals should receive follow up after AKI and for what reasons.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^8591bdbf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology and outcomes — clinical burden — span multiple settings, and severe disease in critical illness is frequent and lethal; "severe AKI occurs in > 5% of critically ill patients and is associated with mortality rates of 40%-70%". Although "recovery of kidney function occurs in the majority of patients surviving an episode of AKI, many patients remain dialysis dependent or are left with severe renal impairment", and "even patients who have complete or near-complete recovery of kidney function are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD)" with superimposed AKI on CKD "associated with acceleration in the rate of progression to end-stage disease".

### Post-discharge kidney function is associated with subsequent ten-year renal progression risk among survivors of acute kidney injury [^cc2d6e98]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes AKI guidelines provide advice for post-AKI management based on expert opinion but without graded evidence. They state that people with AKI should be re-evaluated for resolution of kidney function and receive care based on CKD guidelines if they have developed CKD. However, this guidance does not apply to those who have had an episode of AKI and recovered to normal levels of kidney function after the episode. The relevance of post-episode recovery to baseline as a stratifying risk factor for AKI outcomes has been previously recognized in some studies but not in others. This is because previous studies have dichotomized recovery as being present or absent, with each using different cutoff values, but in reality, a spectrum of renal recovery exists. Moreover, even if patients could be adequately grouped by recovery status, the use of a pre-episode baseline for determining outcomes would not separate the initial progression caused by incomplete recovery (however slight) from the subsequent progression caused by ongoing decline. The solution in clinical practice is that a clinician will wait to see where a post-episode eGFR finally settles (which becomes the "new baseline") before evaluating risk and planning care from that point on. Therefore this is the approach we adopted in our analysis.

In this large population study, we evaluated whether a completed AKI episode was still associated with subsequent renal decline, after allowing for a variable extent of initial renal recovery to baseline once the episode has ended. We isolated subsequent renal decline by using post-episode eGFR as the reference for subsequent renal outcomes. We hypothesized that more patients with AKI (vs. no AKI) would experience ongoing renal decline (a 30% eGFR drop), resulting in more patients with AKI having CKD stage 4.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to discharge from hospital, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to include notes in the discharge on the need for documentation of the AKI in the primary care record and the need for registration on the primary care CKD register if residual CKD exists at the time of discharge.

RRT long-term outcomes and follow-up

Choice of RRT modality and impact on recovery.

The selection of RRT modality does not appear to have a major impact on recovery of kidney function. – Selection of modality of RRT should therefore be based on shared decision-making, local expertise, logistic factors, and patient characteristics. Estimated GFR in conjunction with major adverse kidney events has been used for medium- and long-term assessment but has several limitations. There is uncertainty about the best way to measure renal recovery after RRT in both the short- and medium-term. However, proteinuria is associated with worse long-term outcomes and is easy to measure.

Assessment of kidney function for renal recovery.

In addition to the development of CKD, patient-centered outcomes (quality of life, functional recovery), along with patient experience after AKI, should be a priority and need to be assessed. Post-AKI proteinuria is associated with future loss of kidney function and is regarded as a valuable risk-stratification tool in the post-AKI period. –

Optimal follow-up for AKI patients following RRT

Shared decision-making and communication among caregivers, the patient, and family members is crucial to patient recovery. Patients recovering from critical illness and AKI are often discharged to rehabilitation/skilled nursing facilities and need close monitoring to ensure adequate overall recovery to a baseline state of health and well-being. Such patients should receive multidisciplinary, recovery-focused care. Patients with AKI who continue to require RRT at hospital discharge often receive hemodialysis in outpatient dialysis facilities. Patients with congestive heart failure are less likely to recover kidney function. Higher ultrafiltration rates and more intradialytic hypotensive episodes are associated with higher risk of non-recovery of kidney function. To assess for renal recovery, hemodynamic status, intravascular volume, and urine output during dialysis should be carefully monitored.

Quality indicators for acute RRT

The importance of measuring and monitoring the quality of acute RRT provided to critically ill patients with AKI, including the optimal "benchmarking" for acute RRT programs, is receiving great attention. Quality of acute RRT should be monitored to ensure the effective and safe delivery of care. At a minimum, institutions and programs providing RRT should integrate, monitor, and report quality and outcome indicators across all forms of acute RRT therapies. These outcome measures should comprise a variety of metrics that incorporate patient survival, patient-centered acute RRT outcomes, safety, AKI survivor–related outcomes, and patient experience. Quality indicators should include shared goals that are patient- and clinically centered.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^b6904b47]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) risk assessment, testing, and follow-up — The cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible. We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities and exposures (1B), and manage patients according to their susceptibilities and exposures to reduce the risk of AKI. Test patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to detect AKI. Evaluate patients with AKI promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes. Monitor patients with AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to stage the severity, according to Recommendation 2.1.2. Manage patients with AKI according to the stage (see Figure 4) and cause.

### Long-term outcomes after acute kidney injury during hospitalization: a systematic review and meta-analysis of matched controls studies [^1a170f49]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on long-term outcomes of hospital survivors is controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting such outcomes in patients with AKI and including a control population.

Data Sources

We included original studies published in peer-reviewed journals that compared long-term outcomes (survival, need for dialysis, chronic kidney disease [CKD]) among hospitalized patients with vs. without AKI.

Study Selection

Pertinent articles enrolled patients who experienced and survived a defined episode of AKI, included a control group without AKI, and reported at least one long-term outcome (mortality, dialysis, or CKD), with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators extracted data on study characteristics, patient populations, follow-up duration, and long-term outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

We identified 14 studies for a total of 1,058,109 overall matched patients with a median duration of follow-up of 3 years. Patients who experienced an episode of AKI and survived hospital discharge had a significant increase in long-term mortality at the longest follow-up available for each study (137,506/519,672 [26.4%] vs. 93,702/530,663 [17.6%]; relative risk [RR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.13–1.78; p = 0.002), compared with controls. They also had a greater risk of receiving dialysis (1,928/42,529 [4.5%] vs. 854/42,529 [2.0%]; RR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.79–3.43; p < 0.001), and of developing CKD (2,956/5,739 [51.5%] vs. 2,902/7,781 [37.3%]; RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.33–2.19; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with controls, patients who experienced an episode of AKI and survived to hospital discharge have an increased risk of death, dialysis, and CKD.

### The aftermath of acute kidney injury: a narrative review of long-term mortality and renal function [^5da3fbc8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

However, the AKI survivor population is very heterogeneous, and AKI etiology varies widely. Therefore, identifying individuals with the highest risk of renal deterioration is greatly important. In addition to AKI, other factors associated with an increased risk of CKD or ESRD include higher age, lower baseline renal function, diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart failure, low serum albumin, proteinuria, liver failure, higher Charlson comorbidity index score, and recurrent episodes of AKI. In summary, those with the highest risk of progression towards CKD or ESRD after an episode of AKI are those who already have an increased risk for CKD progression independent of an episode of AKI. Additionally, the complexity of this association is increased even more because the vast majority of the aforementioned risk factors are associated with an increased risk of AKI itself.

In 2009, Ishani et al. demonstrated in 200,000 hospitalized elderly that patients with AKI but without preexisting CKD as well as patients with preexisting CKD but without AKI have an increased risk of developing ESRD. In addition, those authors demonstrated that an episode of AKI in patients with CKD exponentially potentiates the development of ESRD (adjusted HR = 41.2, 95% CI = 34.6–49.1). These results are in accordance with those published by Wu et al. in 2010, which demonstrated in a population of over 9000 surgical ICU patients with a median follow-up of 4.6 years that patients with both AKI and CKD had an adjusted HR of 91.6 (95% CI = 49.3–170.1) for ESRD. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was performed in a cohort stratified by renal recovery at hospital discharge, which was defined as a serum creatinine concentration at discharge of < 50% above the baseline serum creatine concentration. Patients who experienced an episode of acute-on-chronic kidney disease without renal function recovery at hospital discharge had the greatest risk for ESRD compared to patients without AKI and CKD (adjusted HR = 212.7), followed by those with acute-on-chronic kidney disease with recovery (HR = 74.1), those with AKI without recovery (HR = 61.0), those with CKD without AKI (HR = 42.6), and those with AKI with recovery (HR = 4.5) (all P values < 0.001). Although no consensus criteria for renal recovery have been developed, these results are in accordance with the results of most other recently published studies that evaluated the impact of renal recovery or post-AKI renal function on CKD or ESRD (Table 3). In contrast, one postoperative study by van Kuijk et al. did not demonstrate a gradual relationship between AKI with or without renal recovery and CKD, and the relative risk was equally high in both groups. This difference could result from the short timeframe in which renal recovery was determined (day 3 after diagnosis). Furthermore, the highest incidence rate of complications after AKI is observed during the first consecutive year but appears to decline in subsequent years. Fortrie et al. showed a strong association between AKI and impaired renal function 1 year following transplantation in a cohort of patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. However, with longer follow-up, only AKI requiring RRT was associated with further deterioration of renal function. In contrast to AKI, renal function at 1 year following transplantation was strongly associated with further renal deterioration.

KDIGO acute kidney injury research recommendations — Priorities emphasize early management trials and fluid assessment: Clinical research aimed at testing early management strategies is urgently needed, including trials that address the risks and benefits of commonly used fluid-management strategies, including intravenous (i.v.) fluids and diuretics; methods to better assess fluid status in critically ill and other hospitalized patients at risk for AKI are needed; and research is needed, with follow-up beyond hospital stay, to better understand the clinical consequences of AKI in patients with and without underlying CKD.

### Kidney function decline after a non-dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury is associated with higher long-term mortality in critically ill survivors [^cc52f0b6]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Long-term trajectories of kidney function after AKI in critically ill survivors are not well-defined, especially in those who have not received dialysis. This issue is possibly overlooked in post-discharge medical care.

- A considerable portion of critically ill patients, who survived AKI that did not require dialysis, had CKD during long-term follow-up.

- We revealed that there was a steady long-term decline in kidney function after hospital discharge. Therefore, we should not view AKI only as a self-limiting acute disease, but also as a long-lasting progressive disorder.

- The mortality risk increased significantly in a graded manner with the decline in kidney function from baseline eGFR to advanced stages of CKD during the follow-up period.

- We need to organize multidisciplinary medical care for critically ill AKI survivors to continually monitor kidney function after discharge. One potential modifiable factor to improve long-term survival of patients with AKI after discharge from hospital is to prevent the deterioration of their kidney function.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^e80d8ee2]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO guideline recommended urine sediment analysis for differential diagnosis in patients with AKI, especially when glomerular disease is expected. Meeting participants noted that urine sediment analysis is not routinely performed in many centers despite its potential role in the workup of AKI. Additionally, the value of urine biochemistry analysis has been challenged, especially in sepsis.

The FST may be useful for identifying patients with AKI who are likely to have progressive disease and need dialysis. There is also evidence that the FST is useful in predicting delayed graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. This test was not included in the 2012 guideline but should now be considered. Importantly, unregulated diagnostics tests such as FST or urine sediment analysis require careful standardization and quality control. Their introduction into clinical practice should include local evaluation for correct performance and interpretation.

The traditional approach to classifying AKI as pre-renal, renal, and post-renal is still found in many medical text-books. A different framework is needed, because these terms are considered unhelpful, especially the term pre-renal, which is often misinterpreted as "hypovolemic" and may encourage indiscriminate fluid administration. For classifying AKI, it may be more beneficial to distinguish between conditions that reduce glomerular function, conditions that result in injury of tubules and/or glomeruli, and conditions that do both.

Endpoints for clinical trials and quality improvement initiatives for AKI include mortality, new onset or progression of CKD, and dialysis dependency. Additional endpoints are needed for both clinical management and research, and these might include recovery of function, maximum changes in creatinine concentration, stage of AKI/AKD, impact on renal reserve, and patient experience. Additionally, there is a need to better define renal recovery and its functional (filtration, tubular, endocrine) and anatomic/structural dimensions.

Follow-up

Increased risks for mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression of kidney disease are well-documented outcomes of AKI.– However, not everyone with AKI has a poor outcome, and predictors of poor outcomes have been identified. Follow-up recommendations (Figure 1)have been proposed that could be integrated into a KDIGO guideline revision. Although it has been suggested that patients be screened at hospital discharge or seen within 1 month of AKI diagnosis, there is no consensus on the optimal strategy and duration of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes.

### Long-term risk of mortality and other adverse outcomes after acute kidney injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2585d0ab]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized patients. The impact of AKI on long-term outcomes is controversial.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Participants

Persons with AKI.

Selection Criteria For Studies

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from 1985 through October 2007. Original studies describing outcomes of AKI for patients who survived hospital discharge were included. Studies were excluded from review when participants were followed up for less than 6 months.

Predictor

AKI, defined as acute changes in serum creatinine level or acute need for renal replacement therapy.

Outcomes

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, and mortality.

Results

48 studies that contained a total of 47,017 participants were reviewed; 15 studies reported long-term data for patients without AKI. The incidence rate of mortality was 8.9 deaths/100 person-years in survivors of AKI and 4.3 deaths/100 patient-years in survivors without AKI (rate ratio [RR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.97 to 3.42). AKI was associated independently with mortality risk in 6 of 6 studies that performed multivariate adjustment (adjusted RR, 1.6 to 3.9) and with myocardial infarction in 2 of 2 studies (RR, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.61 to 2.61). The incidence rate of CKD after an episode of AKI was 7.8 events/100 patient-years, and the rate of end-stage renal disease was 4.9 events/100 patient-years.

Limitations

The relative risk for CKD and end-stage renal disease after AKI was unattainable because of lack of follow-up of appropriate controls without AKI.

Conclusions

The development of AKI, defined as acute changes in serum creatinine level, characterizes hospitalized patients at increased risk of long-term adverse outcomes.

### Exercise as a therapeutic option for acute kidney injury: mechanisms and considerations for the design of future clinical studies [^4d2a3268]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Considerations for the implementation of future clinical studies

Timing of exercise

There are many different recovery trajectories following AKI, with individuals either having early recovery prior to discharge, late recovery or non-recovery. Observational studies investigating recovery following AKI indicate that recovery continues post discharge with late recovery still clearly associated with better outcomes than non-recovery. Therefore, an exercise intervention would be most effective in the three months following the AKI insult, since renal recovery appears to continue up until this point. Exercise may have the potential to accelerate recovery which could be beneficial, as those with prolonged recovery have worse long term outcomes than individuals for whom recovery is more immediate. An exercise intervention immediately in the post discharge period may be most feasible as this will allow adequate time for patients to at least recover some of their functional status following their acute hospital admission, hence encouraging their participation in the programme.

Outcomes

Outcomes that are meaningful and relevent to patients (patient-centered) should be used to assess the effectiveness of future exercise interventions. Standardised outcomes for clinical trials have been set out in numerous medical specialities, including nephrology. Currently, however, there are no specific standardised core outcomes for AKI patients. Many outcomes such as health related quality of life and mortality are important to all kidney diseased patient populations and therefore can be translated to the AKI setting. CKD specific outcomes are also still relevant since AKI and CKD are considered on a spectrum as opposed to two separate conditions hence there is a large overlap between patient outcomes. The current standardised outcomes for patients with varying levels of CKD have therefore influenced the outcomes highlighted in Fig. 2 which we believe are important for future trials in the AKI population.

Outcomes for future clinical trials. Figure adapted from the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG) core outcomes sets. This figure highlights outcomes of critical importance to people with CKD, which may be used as endpoints in a trial designed to test the effectiveness of exercise interventions following an episode of AKI

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to definitions, ADQI 2017 guidelines recommend to define acute kidney disease as a condition (acute or subacute damage and/or loss of kidney function) where criteria for AKI stage ≥ 1 persist ≥ 7 days after exposure (7–90 days after exposure to an AKI initiating event). Classify acute kidney disease persisting > 90 days as CKD.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury and long-term outcomes: is time of the essence? [^2fef5a8e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

After any illness, restoration to good health results from organ functional recovery that is dependent on the prior state of health, severity of illness, and the process of care. Although the severity stage can be delineated by the magnitude of structural and functional derangement at any point in time, quantifying recovery is often difficult, as it requires knowledge of the prior condition of the organ and ongoing interventions. The course of disease, with progression or improvement, consequently represents both the nature and extent of injury and repair, the associated comorbidities, and the management. Furthermore, the association of the extent of recovery with short-term and long-term outcomes requires accurate definitions and recognition of the events during and after the illness. In acute kidney injury (AKI), it is well recognized that the stage of AKI; associated comorbidities of diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD); and dialysis requirements are associated with adverse outcomes. More recently, attention has focused on the duration and number of episodes of AKI as factors associated with nonrecovery from AKI and short-term and long-term mortality. Most of these data have emerged from retrospective studies from postcardiac surgery and intensive care unit settings and have not been studied prospectively in other settings. Bhatraju et alstudied long-term major adverse kidney events (MAKE), including incidence or progression of CKD, death, or dialysis, in the prospective, multicenter Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae (ASSESS-AKI) cohort study. Patients with and without AKI who survived hospitalization for 3 months were enrolled and followed up for a median of 4.7 years. Patients with AKI were classified as having resolving AKI if their serum creatinine values decreased by 0.3 mg/dL or more (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4) or 25% or more from maximum within the first 72 hours after AKI diagnosis and as having nonresolving AKI if they failed to meet these criteria. Most patients (74%) had Stage 1 AKI, 9% had sepsis, 4% required mechanical ventilation, and less than 7% needed dialysis. Of the patients with AKI, 62% had a resolving pattern; 54% of these patients had returned to baseline creatinine concentration at hospital discharge and 51% returned to baseline creatinine concentration at 3 months, whereas only 16% of patients with nonresolving AKI had returned to baseline creatinine concentration at hospital discharge and 38% returned to baseline creatinine concentration at 3 months. Compared with patients with no AKI, those with resolving AKI had an almost 2-fold higher risk of MAKE and those with nonresolving AKI had an almost 3-fold higher risk of MAKE; these risks persisted when adjusted for underlying comorbidities and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage of AKI. Patients with nonresolving AKI had a higher rate of incident and progressive CKD. Patients with AKI had a higher mortality rate than those without AKI (22% vs 12%), but there were no differences between patients with resolving AKI and those with nonresolving AKI. Interestingly, the AKI severity stage did not differentiate the development of MAKE during the 4 years of follow-up.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^a6af8f3a]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

### The severity of acute kidney injury predicts progression to chronic kidney disease [^fb10cc57]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

To make these data accessible to clinicians, we developed three multivariable models to identify those AKI survivors who were at highest risk for progression to CKD. Model 1 was developed by stepwise regression and had a rank correlation between predicted and observed CKD4 of 0.64 (area under ROC curve = 0.82). To try and simplify model 1, we developed model 2, which was based on the most heavily weighted factors from model 1. This model had a rank correlation of 0.61 between predicted and observed CKD4 (area under ROC curve = 0.81). Model 2 performs well, but because it includes mean SC-Hosp, its use would be limited to electronic medical records that can calculate that variable automatically. Therefore, we developed model 3 for use as a 'bedside' model, which is based on sentinel clinical events (RIFLE stage, need for dialysis, and so on). This model performs well with a rank correlation of 0.54 between predicted and observed CKD4 (area under ROC curve = 0.77). We then tested these equations in a separate large cohort of hospitalized veterans. All three equations were significant when tested in the CON populations (P < 0.001) and had c -statistics ⩾0.81, signifying good reproducibility for all three models. We believe that these equations should undergo further validation and recalibration in other large population cohorts. In addition, because these endpoints are accessible, clinicians can use these equations to risk stratify AKI survivors who are at highest risk for progression to CKD. Once fully validated, hospitals with computerized medical record systems might use software based on prediction formulas like these, to generate a warning linked to the patient's discharge that a particular patient is at risk for progression to CKD after experiencing an episode of AKI. This is particularly important when one considers that only a very small fraction of AKI patients are currently followed by a nephrologist after discharge.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with acute kidney injury [^5ebb9c27]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The long-term sequelae of AKI have received increasing attention so that its associations with a number of adverse outcomes, including higher mortality and development of CKD, are now widely appreciated. These associations take on particular importance when considering the high incidence of AKI, with a lack of proven interventions and uncertainties around optimal care provision meaning that the long-term sequelae of AKI present a major unmet clinical need. In this review, we examine the published data that inform our current understanding of long-term outcomes following AKI and discuss potential knowledge gaps, covering long-term mortality, CKD, progression to ESKD, proteinuria, cardiovascular events, recurrent AKI, and hospital readmission.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^201c246a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

### Post-discharge kidney function is associated with subsequent ten-year renal progression risk among survivors of acute kidney injury [^2d59094f]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Crude proportions and cumulative rates of subsequent renal progression

Figure 3 shows the crude proportions of people alive 1 year after hospital discharge who subsequently experienced renal decline (top plot), de novo CKD stage 4 (bottom plot), and death before progression during the study follow-up period until 10 years after discharge. After AKI (vs. no AKI), there was an excess of renal decline, or decline and death outcomes combined, among those with post-episode eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. This excess was not present among those with a lower post-episode eGFR. The outcome of de novo CKD stage 4 was also more common among those with AKI, but uncommon among those with post-episode eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (1.5% AKI, 0.7% no AKI) and eGFR 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (6.1% AKI, 4.8% no AKI), compared with eGFR 30–44 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (22.5% AKI, 22.7% no AKI). Supplementary Figure S1 shows crude outcomes at 5 years after hospital discharge, with similar relationships, but with fewer deaths.

### Management of patients with acute kidney injury undergoing dialysis after hospital Discharge [^723ce142]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a common diagnosis in hospitalized patients and can range in severity from a minor, reversible rise in creatinine to a more severe kidney injury with resultant complications. In a small but significant percentage of patients with acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy is required for supportive care. Patients who require renal replacement therapy and survive to hospital discharge face major challenges in recovering from acute illness while adapting to an outpatient dialysis system that was not designed for patients with acute kidney injury. In addition, treating clinicians must navigate complex transitions of care and remain cognizant of signs of renal recovery. This review describes the current evidence in postdischarge acute kidney injury requiring dialysis management. We discuss risk factors for dialysis dependency, markers of kidney recovery, transitions of care, dialysis customization, and quality of life.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^c3051194]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients who progress to stage 2 AKI, adjusting drug dosages to account for glomerular filtration and careful attention to volume input or output become important. Stage 3 AKI is associated with acid–base imbalance, altered electrolyte levels, and accumulation of uremic toxins. Decisions on the need for intensive care and initiation of kidney replacement therapy require expertise in nephrology or critical care medicine and should be considered early in disease progression.

Phase of care, monitoring, and follow-up can vary greatly depending on the severity of disease. The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients diagnosed with AKI are evaluated at 3 months to screen for new or progressive chronic kidney disease, while the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and PeriOperative Quality Initiative recommend all postoperative patients with AKI or acute kidney disease have a kidney health assessment within 30 days of hospital discharge. As morbidity and mortality increase with severity of AKI (and in patients without renal recovery), these factors should inform the frequency and nature of follow-up. Management of AKI during the period of inpatient hospitalization provides an opportunity to prevent or delay progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease. Patients requiring acute renal replacement therapy (or necessitate continuous renal replacement therapy due to hemodynamic instability) should be managed in the ICU. Furthermore, a variety of critical conditions associated with AKI including shock, sepsis, acid–base imbalance, and respiratory failure secondary to fluid overload require intensive care. The KDIGO management guidelines recommend considering ICU admission beginning at stage 2 AKI.

### Predictors of progression to chronic dialysis in survivors of severe acute kidney injury: a competing risk study [^34b8797e]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using a competing risk model, we have demonstrated important predictors of progression to chronic dialysis in survivors of a hospitalization complicated by AKI requiring dialysis. Greater appreciation of the link between AKI and CKD is appropriately accompanied by calls for greater nephrology follow-up for AKI survivors. Our results identify patients with characteristics that associate with a high risk of kidney disease progression and death who should be targeted for closer post-discharge follow-up. Further studies to develop and validate a more robust predictive model, will help optimize outcomes of AKI survivors.

Framework for approach to management of dialysis-requiring AKI in the outpatient setting by likelihood of kidney recovery — High (> 30%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include all patients with baseline eGFR > 60, younger patients (< 55 yr) with baseline CKD but minimal comorbidity burden (e.g., no liver or heart failure), and patients with short duration of dialysis dependence < 30 d; the approach includes care focused on promoting kidney function recovery and close monitoring for recovery for at least 90 d after discharge. Moderate (10%–30%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include patients with baseline CKD and limited comorbidity burden and patients with baseline CKD and intermediate duration of dialysis dependence (30–90 d); the approach includes care focused on promoting kidney function recovery and close monitoring for recovery for at least 30–60 d after discharge. Low (< 10%) recovery phenotype: Example scenarios include patients with 3 or more of the following — advanced baseline CKD (eGFR < 15 or eGFR < 30 with A3 albuminuria), older age (> 75 yr), significant comorbidities (decompensated liver or heart failure), or prolonged duration of dialysis dependence (> 90 d); the approach includes initial care focused on promoting kidney function recovery with consideration for early (< 30 d) transition to ESRD diagnosis with appropriate shift in management.

### New insights into acute-on-chronic kidney disease in nephrology patients: the CKD-REIN study [^dcc32b8a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute-on-chronic kidney disease (ACKD) is poorly understood and often overlooked. We studied its incidence, circumstances, determinants and outcomes in patients with CKD.

Methods

We used the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria to identify all-stage acute kidney injury (AKI) events in 3033 nephrology outpatients with CKD Stages 3–5 participating in the CKD-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network cohort study (2013–20), and cause-specific Cox models to estimate hazard ratios [HRs; 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of AKI-associated risk factors.

Results

At baseline, 22% of the patients [mean age 67 years, 65% men, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 32 mL/min/1.73 m2] had a history of AKI. Over a 3-year follow-up, 443 had at least one AKI event: 27% were Stage 2 or 3 and 11% required dialysis; 74% involved hospitalization including 47% acquired as hospital inpatients; and a third were not reported in hospital discharge reports. Incidence rates were 10.1 and 4.8/100 person-years in patients with and without an AKI history, respectively. In 2375 patients without this history, male sex, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, several drugs, low eGFR and serum albumin levels were significantly associated with a higher risk of AKI, as were low birth weight (< 2500 g) (adjusted HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.35–2.91) and haemoglobin level (HR 1.21; 1.12–1.32 per 1 g/dL decrease). Within 1 year, only 63% of the patients had recovered their previous kidney function, 13.7% had started kidney replacement therapy and 12.7% had died.

Conclusions

The study highlights the high rate of hospital-acquired AKI events in patients with CKD, and their underreporting at hospital discharge. It also reveals low birth weight and anaemia as possible new risk factors in CKD patients.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^3710d6cf]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to discharge from hospital, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to include a record in the discharge summary regarding AKI detected whilst in hospital, its maximum stage, etiology, the need for renal support (temporary/ongoing), and discharge renal function, if dialysis-independent.

Discussion

This large analysis of hospital survivors after AKI isolates the risk of long-term subsequent progression of kidney disease from progression that has already arisen because of an initial step drop in kidney function (incomplete recovery). When this novel approach was used, AKI during a hospital admission was associated with increased subsequent renal progression irrespective of how progression was defined, irrespective of proteinuria or AKI severity, and even if post-episode kidney function was normal. In one of the longest observation periods of any renal progression study, the excess risk after AKI diminished over time but persisted throughout the 10 years of the study.

Previous studies have also shown an association between AKI and long-term CKD, but our analysis extends the current understanding by providing greater detail and precision. First, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies of AKI prognosis have presented renal progression endpoints both defined in terms of an intermediate outcome (30% renal decline) and a hard outcome (de novo CKD stage 4 or long-term RRT). This analysis shows that no matter how renal progression is defined, AKI is associated with poorer long-term outcomes, although we recognize that de novo CKD stage 4 was most common among those with AKI who already had a low eGFR. Second, previous analyses have used an all-or-nothing "renal recovery" dichotomy as a risk factor for prognostic study in AKI. However, grouping patients in this way does not separate the initial renal decline (i.e. nonrecovery to baseline that is already observable after the episode) from subsequent renal decline (the uncertainty of what happens next), nor does it account for intra-episode changes in eGFR that can occur irrespective of AKI. Our analysis provides the following important detail: whereas 25.7% of people with AKI experienced a 30% decline between their pre-episode and post-discharge eGFR values from the post-discharge eGFR value, 14.8% of people with AKI experienced subsequent renal decline. This represented a relative risk of up to 2.5-fold from AKI (vs. no AKI), which varied depending on the level of post-episode eGFR.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) follow-up — risk stratification and timing are emphasized: clinicians may be overwhelmed by 3-month follow-up of many patients with stage 1 AKI; the risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) after AKI is related to AKI severity, and those with stage 3 AKI will likely require far earlier post-discharge follow-up; patients with AKI with pre-existing CKD or with worsening CKD after AKI could represent a particularly high-risk group; in pediatrics, the 3-month time to follow-up may be reasonable, and we would suggest that early follow-up among pediatric patients with AKI is advisable.

### Recovery after critical illness and acute kidney injury [^4e751c5e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

AKI is a common complication in hospitalized and critically ill patients. Its incidence has steadily increased over the past decade. Whether transient or prolonged, AKI is an independent risk factor associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes, even if patients do not require KRT. Most patients with early AKI improve with conservative management; however, some will require dialysis for a few days, a few weeks, or even months. Approximately 10%-30% of AKI survivors may still need dialysis after hospital discharge. These patients have a higher associated risk of death, rehospitalization, recurrent AKI, and CKD, and a lower quality of life. Survivors of critical illness may also suffer from cognitive dysfunction, muscle weakness, prolonged ventilator dependence, malnutrition, infections, chronic pain, and poor wound healing. Collaboration and communication among nephrologists, primary care physicians, rehabilitation providers, physical therapists, nutritionists, nurses, pharmacists, and other members of the health care team are essential to create a holistic and patient-centric care plan for overall recovery. Integration of the patient and family members in health care decisions, and ongoing education throughout the process, are vital to improve patient well-being. From the nephrologist standpoint, assessing and promoting recovery of kidney function, and providing appropriate short- and long-term follow-up, are crucial to prevent rehospitalizations and to reduce complications. Return to baseline functional status is the ultimate goal for most patients, and dialysis independence is an important part of that goal. In this review, we seek to highlight the varying aspects and stages of recovery from AKI complicating critical illness, and propose viable strategies to promote recovery of kidney function and dialysis independence. We also emphasize the need for ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^c4f500a4]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

Acute kidney disease: a recent entity

Acute kidney disease (AKD) defined as an AKI episode that lasts longer than 7 days but less than 90 days has recently been proposed as a concept (Fig. 1). It aims at closing the gap between AKI and CKD (which requires 3 months to be diagnosed). AKD uses the creatinine criteria of the KDIGO definition. It is important to note that the diagnosis of AKD (severity) or apparent recovery may be affected by the decrease of Scr related to muscle mass loss associated with chronic critical illness. The relationship between persistent AKI, AKD and CKD as well as interventions that may interfere with this evolution require further study (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Following the development of AKI, several scenarios are possible that may lead to recovery of renal function or to more prolonged dysfunction. Acute kidney disease (AKD) is assessed between 7 and 90 days after AKI. In patients that do not improve, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is established after day 90. Biomarkers of renal injury and function may be able to refine the prediction of rapid recovery (i.e. transient AKI) or transition to more persistent impairment of renal function and several therapeutic interventions may be able to modulate the progression of the disease course

### Intermediate and long-term outcomes of survivors of acute kidney injury episodes: a large population-based cohort study [^84c42808]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Editorial, p. 3

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 1 in 7 hospital admissions. Even those with small increases in creatinine levels have 4-fold greater hospital mortality than those with no creatinine level increase. Overall, for those who survive to hospital discharge, the prognosis remains poor. However, although 2 previous systematic reviews reported long-term increased mortality and long-term renal replacement therapy (RRT) after AKI (vs no AKI), there was substantial heterogeneity in both outcomes (I 2 > 85%). To discuss risk and plan care for individual patients requires a better understanding of what drives variation, which patients are at elevated risk, and how long risk remains elevated.

Clinical guidelines recognize that the long-term prognostic factors for AKI are poorly understood. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline advocates follow-up of all patients with AKI, and UK guidelines recommend surveillance for at least 2 to 3 years. Monitoring of all patients may be prudent, but in clinical practice, some patients are prioritized over others, only a minority see a nephrologist, and follow-up may be brief. Without more detailed prognostic studies, it is difficult for clinicians to communicate individual risks and prioritize high-risk patients for an appropriate duration.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^cd8b68aa]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-D) — epidemiology and scope — AKI is a common and serious complication among hospitalized adult and pediatric patients, with severe cases requiring KRT. Although recent studies have shown improving hospital mortality rates for patients with AKI-D, up to 30% of AKI-D survivors will require dialysis beyond discharge. United States Renal Data System data demonstrate a marked increase in patients with AKI receiving outpatient hemodialysis in ESRD facilities from 6400 individuals in 2017 to a peak of 11,964 in 2020. After hospitalization, patients with AKI-D who are dialysis dependent at discharge remain at significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes, including CKD, permanent dialysis dependence, cardiovascular disease, rehospitalization, and death. Recognizing significant gaps and variability in outpatient AKI-D care, the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Health Guidance oversight committee convened a multidisciplinary expert workgroup to address clinical guidance for patients with AKI-D who continue to require dialysis after hospital discharge. This guidance does not address management of patients with AKI-D who achieve dialysis independence before discharge and notes that some regulatory challenges and suggestions are primarily meant for patients dialyzing in outpatient facilities in the United States.

### Preventing acute kidney injury and its longer-term impact in the critically ill [^5f8fbaa4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous syndrome that not only affects short-term morbidity and mortality but also influences long-term outcomes. AKI is part of acute kidney disease (AKD) that encompasses a range of different conditions and is characterized by a kidney dysfunction lasting 90 days or less after which time the term chronic kidney disease (CKD) applies. AKD may result in irreversible loss of nephrons and may lead to CKD. In this narrative review, an update on different aspects of AKI in critically ill patients will be provided. We discuss biomarkers for early diagnosis of AKI, sub-clinical AKI, as well as AKI-AKD-CKD transition. In addition, various strategies to prevent the development of AKI, including the application of amino acids, remote-ischemic preconditioning, hemoadsorption, and a kidney prevention strategy, will be discussed. Finally, the choice of adequate endpoints for AKI prevention trials will be addressed". Take home message". AKI and even subclinical AKI impact short- and long-term outcome and therefore, prevention of kidney injury is of utmost importance. As several strategies have been proven to be effective in preventing the development of AKI, these therapies should be implemented in daily practice to improve patient outcomes.

The number of patients with AKI receiving outpatient hemodialysis (AKI-D) is increasing. At present, on the basis of limited data, approximately one third of patients with AKI-D who receive outpatient dialysis after hospital discharge survive and regain sufficient kidney function to discontinue dialysis. Data to inform dialysis management strategies that promote kidney function recovery and processes of care among patients with AKI-D receiving outpatient dialysis are lacking. In this article, we detail current trends in the incidence, risk factors, clinical outcomes, proposed management, and health policy landscape for patients with AKI-D receiving outpatient dialysis and identify areas for further research.

### Post-discharge kidney function is associated with subsequent ten-year renal progression risk among survivors of acute kidney injury [^e0004658]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure

AKI during the index hospital admission was identified and staged from 1 to 3 by using AKI criteria based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group guidelines. Baseline creatinine values for identifying AKI were determined by a modified "e-alert" algorithm with a hierarchy of criteria for creatinine changes from the previous 48 hours and 7, 90, and 365 days as stated elsewhere. Briefly, this definition for AKI involves 1 of 3 criteria: serum creatinine level ≥ 1.5 times higher than the median of all creatinine values 8 to 90 days earlier, or 91 to 365 days earlier if no tests were done between 8 and 90 days; serum creatinine level ≥ 1.5 times higher than the lowest creatinine value within 7 days; or serum creatinine level > 26 μmol/l higher than the lowest creatinine value within 48 hours. We have previously described this definition in more detail for studying the prognosis of AKI in hospitals.

Outcomes

Two subsequent renal progression outcomes are defined for this analysis: sustained 30% eGFR decline (in all 14,651 patients) and de novo CKD stage 4 (in 14,106 patients with post-episode eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). For either outcome, progression was sustained if it lasted at least 90 days or if the patient started long-term RRT. Notably, as illustrated in Supplementary Table S1, if a pre-episode eGFR (instead of the post-episode eGFR) had been used as reference value for subsequent renal outcomes, 25.7% of patients with AKI would already have had a 30% eGFR decline on the first day of the study (i.e. nonrecovery from AKI misclassified as post-episode renal decline).

Follow-up

Follow-up began at study entry, 1 year after discharge from the index hospital episode. It lasted until the date of renal progression (respectively sustained 30% renal decline or new CKD stage 4 for each progression subanalysis), death, or the end of study follow-up in July 2013.

### Processes of care after hospital discharge for survivors of acute kidney injury: a population-based cohort study [^7d981751]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Survivors of acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of adverse outcomes. Monitoring of kidney function, screening for proteinuria, use of statins and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and nephrology follow-up among survivors have not been fully characterized. We examined these processes of care after discharge in survivors of hospitalized AKI.

Study Design

Population-based retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Adults in Alberta, Canada, admitted to the hospital between 2009 and 2017, then followed from their discharge date until 2019 for a median follow-up of 2.7 years.

Exposure

Hospital-acquired AKI diagnostically conforming to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) serum creatinine criteria for stage 2 or stage 3 disease, or the need for acute dialysis.

Outcome

Outcomes after hospital discharge included the proportion of participants who had evaluation of kidney function, were seen by a specialist or general practitioner, and received postdischarge prescriptions for recommended medications for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Analytical Approach

Cumulative incidence curves to characterize the proportion of participants who received each process of care outcome within the first 90 days and subsequent 1-year follow-up period after hospital discharge. To avoid risks associated with multiple hypothesis testing, differences were not statistically compared across groups.

Results

The cohort (n = 23,921) included 50.2% men (n = 12,015) with a median age of 68.1 [IQR, 56.9–78.8] years. Within 90 days after discharge, 21.2% and 8.6% of patients with and without pre-existing CKD, respectively, were seen by a nephrologist; 60.1% of AKI survivors had at least 1 serum creatinine measured, but only 25.5% had an assessment for albuminuria within 90 days after discharge; 52.7% of AKI survivors with pre-existing CKD, and 51.6% with de novo CKD were prescribed a RAAS inhibitor within 4–15 months after discharge.

Limitations

Retrospective data were collected as part of routine clinical care.

Conclusions

The proportion of patients receiving optimal care after an episode of AKI in Alberta was low and may represent a target for improving long-term outcomes for this population.

Plain-Language Summary

A study in Alberta, Canada, examined the care received by patients with acute kidney disease (AKI) during hospitalization and after discharge between 2007 and 2019. The results showed that a low proportion of patients with moderate to severe AKI were seen by a kidney specialist during hospitalization or within 90 days after discharge. Fewer than 25% of AKI patients had their kidney function monitored with both blood and urine tests within 90 days of discharge. Additionally, about half of AKI survivors with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were prescribed guideline recommended medications for CKD within 15 months after discharge. There is potential to improve health care delivery to these patients both in hospital and after hospital discharge.

### Modification of outcomes after acute kidney injury by the presence of CKD [^026a1fad]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients is associated with poor outcomes; however, it is unclear how relationships between AKI and clinical outcomes vary with baseline kidney function.

Study Design

Population-based cohort.

Setting & Participants

Adults in Alberta, Canada, who were hospitalized between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2006, with at least 1 serum creatinine measurement during hospitalization and 1 outpatient creatinine measurement within 6 months preceding admission.

Predictor

Baseline kidney function, defined as mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of all outpatient creatinine measurements within 6 months before the index hospitalization, and AKI, defined using consensus criteria.

Outcomes

Death during the index hospitalization and death or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after hospitalization.

Results

AKI occurred in 18.3% of the 43,008 hospitalized patients in the cohort. Risk of AKI increased with decreasing eGFR (8.9% with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) vs 68.9% with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). In multivariable Cox models, AKI of any severity was associated with death during the index hospitalization across all levels of eGFR, with an HR of 2.99 (95% CI, 2.59–3.44) in patients who had the least severe AKI across all eGFR strata up to an HR of 10.62 (95% CI, 8.78–12.82) in patients with baseline eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and the most severe AKI. The risk of death or ESRD decreased after discharge, with the highest risk of ESRD after AKI noted in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (17.0% in the AKI group vs 5.6% in the non-AKI group; P < 0.01).

Limitations

The study cohort is restricted to patients who had outpatient serum creatinine values available.

Conclusions

AKI of any severity increases the risk of death both during hospitalization and after discharge. Although the risk of developing ESRD after AKI is greatest in patients with baseline eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), this is exceeded by the risk of death.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^c62d9923]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

### Post-discharge kidney function is associated with subsequent ten-year renal progression risk among survivors of acute kidney injury [^43404a0e]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The extent to which renal progression after acute kidney injury (AKI) arises from an initial step drop in kidney function (incomplete recovery), or from a long-term trajectory of subsequent decline, is unclear. This makes it challenging to plan or time post-discharge follow-up. This study of 14651 hospital survivors in 2003 (1966 with AKI, 12685 no AKI) separates incomplete recovery from subsequent renal decline by using the post-discharge estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than the pre-admission as a new reference point for determining subsequent renal outcomes. Outcomes were sustained 30% renal decline and de novo CKD stage 4, followed from 2003–2013. Death was a competing risk. Overall, death was more common than subsequent renal decline (37.5% vs 11.3%) and CKD stage 4 (4.5%). Overall, 25.7% of AKI patients had non-recovery. Subsequent renal decline was greater after AKI (vs no AKI) (14.8% vs 10.8%). Renal decline after AKI (vs no AKI) was greatest among those with higher post-discharge eGFRs with multivariable hazard ratios of 2.29 (1.88–2.78); 1.50 (1.13–2.00); 0.94 (0.68–1.32) and 0.95 (0.64–1.41) at eGFRs of 60 or more; 45–59; 30–44 and under 30, respectively. The excess risk after AKI persisted over ten years of study, irrespective of AKI severity, or post-episode proteinuria. Thus, even if post-discharge kidney function returns to normal, hospital admission with AKI is associated with increased renal progression that persists for up to ten years. Follow-up plans should avoid false reassurance when eGFR after AKI returns to normal.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: an updated review on pathophysiology and management [^3fc3799d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The need for better follow-up and long-term care of patients recovering from AKI or AKD is increasingly being recognized. Several institutions and health care systems have developed AKI follow-up clinics. However, there is also a need for specific quality indicators and quality measures and better quantification of the impact of these organization on patient-centered outcomes. Strategies to prevent long-term complications of AKI have emerged recently. First, prevention of new episodes of AKI (e.g. with avoidance of nephrotoxins) is important. Recognition and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, or obesity are potential key factors to improve long-term outcomes. In this line, an observational study showed that follow-up by a nephrologist was associated with lower long-term all-cause mortality following AKI, but implementation in clinical practice would impose a substantial burden on the nephrology community. This calls for risk-stratified follow-up, driven by proteinuria and estimated GFR at discharge, potentially aided by biomarker levels.

Several cardio- and renoprotective pharmacological strategies hold promise to improve post-AKI outcomes. Reducing the consequences of RAAS activation after AKI appears to improve long-term mortality in patients recovering from AKI. Treatments with selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors have recently been shown to improve clinical outcomes (mortality or progression of CKD and cardiovascular events) in CKD patients. Whether these results translate into better post-AKI outcomes needs to be explored.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^4d6753d2]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Appendix K — nephrotoxic agents and medication dose adjustments in chronic kidney disease (CKD) highlights the burden and organization of drug-induced kidney injury: In hospitalized acute kidney injury (AKI), approximately 1 in 5 episodes are medication-related, and during critical care approximately a third of patients receive multiple potentially nephrotoxic medications; in outpatients with stage G3-G5 CKD, approximately half use a potentially inappropriate medication. The kidney receives 20% of cardiac output and has a greater exposure to the risk of toxic drug effects than other organ systems. For risk framing, the KDIGO 2019 Controversies in Acute Kidney Injury model organizes drugs into two major categories by which they can cause harm: kidney dysfunction or kidney injury. Pharmacovigilance signals include that, per the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2019–2023, there were 77,000 reports of serious AKI suspected to be caused by a drug; seven of the top 10 suspect generic drugs were in the PPI class representing 86% of all reported cases of serious, drug-induced AKI, and global surveillance reports where the PPI class occupies 4 of 5 drugs suspected of causing nephrotoxicity. Clinically, the primary care provider must have a high degree of clinical suspicion of drugs may be causative when an acute decline in kidney function is detected, with cessation of the offending agent as the first step in reversing drug-induced AKI; patient knowledge of having CKD was associated with a protective effect, reducing exposure.

### Validation of risk prediction models to inform clinical decisions after acute kidney injury [^2952bf3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Poor outcomes after hospitalization with AKI are increasingly recognized, but how to perform optimal follow-up care is uncertain. In this validation study of 2 risk prediction models, both performed well in predicting individualized risks of death or readmission (for all hospital survivors) and risks of progression to CKD G4-G5 (for AKI survivors) and were superior to alternative strategies for targeting people follow-up, including indiscriminate follow-up of all people with AKI, or those with severe AKI. We also showed that while poor outcomes are particularly common after AKI, many people receive little or no postdischarge monitoring, which suggests opportunities exist to develop follow-up interventions to improve postdischarge care.

While the current KDIGO AKI guideline suggests a post-AKI clinical reassessment for all patients, emerging AKI return clinics are often limited to those with severe AKI episodes. Our findings do not support this approach. Among all people leaving hospital, either a model-guided approach or follow-up of all people were the most beneficial approaches. By contrast, a strategy of targeted follow-up based on AKI severity was not only inferior, but also had potential for net harm at clinically relevant risk thresholds for death or readmission. Targeting care based on recovery of kidney function at discharge was also inferior to a model-based approach for death or readmission avoidance and at most risk thresholds for progression to CKD G4-G5. Thus, our analyses suggest that incorporating risk prediction models into postdischarge and post-AKI care planning could improve follow-up planning over alternative "one size fits all" approaches that are currently being promoted in guidelines and existing clinical practices.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) classification and outcomes — small changes in kidney function in hospitalized patients are important and associated with significant changes in short- and long-term outcomes; the shift of terminology from ATN and ARF to AKI has been well received; RIFLE/AKIN criteria provide a uniform definition of AKI and have become the standard for diagnostic criteria; AKI severity grades represent groups with increasing severity as illustrated by increasing use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and increasing mortality; RIFLE/AKIN classification is analogous to KDOQI CKD staging, and the guideline developed recommendations for evaluation and management using this stage-based approach.

Definitions and calculation of kidney dysfunction

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

For AKI staging, two serum creatinine (SCr) values are required. The renal database algorithm uses pre-admission baseline SCr (defined as the average Scr from all values measured 7–365 days pre hospitalisation), and compares this with first in-hospital measured Scr (AKI stage at admission). If a pre admission baseline is not available then an estimated Scr (eSCr) is calculated assuming a theoretical estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and using backward calculation of the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, as recommended by KDIGO. Staging of AKI is revised throughout the admission after each new SCr result and the overall worst AKI stage is recorded as the final AKI stage for the hospital episode. Ideally urine output criteria for AKI definition would be used in addition to SCr criteria but these data are not routinely recorded electronically and urine output measurement is not reliable in non-catheterised or incontinent patients (Table 1).

KDIGO Kidney Disease | Improving Global Outcomes

SCr Serum creatinine

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD stage was calculated in patients with an actual baseline and a post discharge SCr. Pre-admission CKD stage was calculated using mean pre admission SCr, age, gender and ethnicity. Post-discharge CKD was calculated using mean post-discharge SCr (measured between 90 and 365 days following discharge), age, gender and ethnicity.

Post-operative outcomes

Data were retrieved for: length of acute hospital stay; time to death (in hospital and post-discharge); postoperative admission to critical care; renal recovery (percentage change comparing 90–365 day post discharge SCr and pre-admission known baseline) and dialysis dependence (defined as attending dialysis clinic 90–365 days post discharge).

A minimum 90 day time frame for renal recovery is used to assess renal outcome post discharge, in accordance with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines which defines CKD as a persistent decline in kidney function lasting > 90 days, otherwise patients are defined as recovered renal function.

This paper provides an endorsement of the KDIGO guideline on acute kidney injury; more specifically, on the part that concerns renal replacement therapy. New evidence that has emerged since the publication of the KDIGO guideline was taken into account, and the guideline is commented on from a European perspective. Advice is given on when to start and stop renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury; which modalities should be preferentially be applied, and in which conditions; how to gain access to circulation; how to measure adequacy; and which dose can be recommended.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and international club of ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^567030be]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to 60% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. – In 2012, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) VIII and the International Club of Ascites (ICA) proposed diagnostic criteria for AKIwhich were further revised in 2015 by the ICA. Over the last decade, there have been significant advances in the field. In 2023, a joint meeting of ADQI (ADQI XXIX) and the ICA was reconvened to refine the diagnostic criteria for AKI and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), review their epidemiology and pathophysiology, explore the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognostication of AKI, examine current and novel therapies for the prevention and treatment of AKI, and create a potential paradigm for the post-discharge care of patients who experience AKI or acute kidney disease (AKD), especially as they progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The goals of the meeting were to provide recommendations for clinical practice and identify knowledge gaps to inform a research framework for this clinically important area.

### Validation of risk prediction models to inform clinical decisions after acute kidney injury [^2dfa2fb0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

There is limited evidence to guide follow-up after acute kidney injury (AKI). Knowledge gaps include which patients to prioritize, at what time point, and for mitigation of which outcomes. In this study, we sought to compare the net benefit of risk model-based clinical decisions following AKI.

Study Design

External validation of 2 risk models of AKI outcomes: the Grampian -Aberdeen (United Kingdom) AKI readmissions model and the Alberta (Canada) kidney disease risk model of chronic kidney disease (CKD) glomerular (G) filtration rate categories 4 and 5 (CKD G4 and G5). Process mining to delineate existing care pathways.

Setting & Participants

Validation was based on data from adult hospital survivors of AKI from Grampian, 2011–2013.

Predictors

KDIGO-based measures of AKI severity and comorbidities specified in the original models.

Outcomes

Death or readmission within 90 days for all hospital survivors. Progression to new CKD G4-G5 for patients surviving at least 90 days after AKI.

Analytical Approach

Decision curve analysis to assess the "net benefit" of use of risk models to guide clinical care compared to alternative approaches (eg, prioritizing all AKI, severe AKI, or only those without kidney recovery).

Results

26,575 of 105,461 hospital survivors in Grampian (mean age, 60.9 ± 19.8 [SD] years) were included for validation of the death or readmission model, and 9,382 patients (mean age, 60.9 ± 19.8 years) for the CKD G4-G5 model. Both models discriminated well (area under the curve [AUC], 0.77 and 0.86, respectively). Decision curve analysis showed greater net benefit for follow up of all AKI than only severe AKI in most cases. Both original and refitted models provided net benefit superior to any other decision strategy. In process mining of all hospital discharges, 41% of readmissions and deaths occurred among people recovering after AKI. 1,464 of 3,776 people (39%) readmitted after AKI had received no intervening monitoring.

Limitations

Both original models overstated risks, indicating a need for regular updating.

Conclusions

Follow up after AKI has potential net benefit for preempting readmissions, death, and subsequent CKD progression. Decisions could be improved by using risk models and by focusing on AKI across a full spectrum of severity. The current lack of monitoring among many with poor outcomes indicates possible opportunities for implementation of decision support.

### Long-term prognosis after acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy [^68af48bb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the long-term survival and renal function of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) treated with continuous renal replacement therapy are scarce.

Methods

We investigated the 3-year survival and need for chronic dialysis in critically ill patients, who had survived an episode of AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy.

Results

A total of 206 ICU patients with AKI were randomized in a trial comparing haemofiltration versus haemodiafiltration. Of these, 95 (46%) survived at 90 days. Post-discharge information relating to 3-year survival and renal function was successfully obtained in 89 (94%) of the patients. Of the 89 patients studied, chronic kidney disease (CKD) was present in 32 subjects from the onset, and CKD developed de novo in 25 patients following AKI. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) developed in 9 patients (of whom 8 had pre-existing CKD) and 29 patients died. Three-year survival was 67% overall; the mortality at 3 years was 50% for those with pre-existing kidney disease, and 71 and 82% for those with de novo and without CKD, respectively.

Conclusion

After an episode of AKI necessitating a continuous renal replacement therapy, rapid progression to ESKD is commonly observed in patients with pre-existing chronic renal impairment. Medical care with an emphasis on nephroprotection is necessary in these patients.

### New criterion to evaluate acute-on-chronic kidney injury based on the creatinine reference change [^c1706bfb]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The lack of consensus criteria of acute on chronic kidney injury (ACKI) affects the judgment for its clinical prognosis.

Methods

In this study, we analyzed the data from 711,615 hospitalized adults who had at least 2 serum creatinine (SCr) tests within 30 days. We estimated the reference change value (RCV) of SCr given initial SCr level in adults without known risks of acute kidney injury other than chronic kidney disease (CKD). We proposed a criterion for ACKI based on the RCV of SCr (cROCK), which defined ACKI as a ≥ 25% increase in SCr in 7 days. We validated cROCK by its association with the risks of in-hospital mortality, death after discharge, and CKD progression in a large cohort of patients with CKD stage 3.

Results

In 21,661 patients with CKD stage 3, a total of 3,145 (14.5%), 1,512 (7.0%), and 221 (1.0%) ACKI events were detected by both cROCK and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), cROCK only, and KDIGO only, respectively. cROCK detected 40% more ACKI events than KDIGO. Compared with patients without ACKI by both definitions, those with cROCK- but not KDIGO-defined ACKI had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 5.53; 95% CI 3.75–8.16), death after discharge (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21–1.83), and CKD progression (OR 5.65; 95% CI 3.05–10.48).

Conclusions

RCV-based criterion (cROCK) for ACKI is clinically valid in that it has a substantially improved sensitivity in identifying patients with high risk of adverse outcomes.

Post-AKI/AKD outpatient follow-up in patients with cirrhosis

What are the key elements of an appropriate post-AKI/AKD care bundle following hospital discharge in patients with cirrhosis?

Consensus statements

We recommend tailoring the care bundle for post-AKI/AKD outpatient follow-up according to the severity of both kidney and liver disease, with the delivery of care requiring close collaboration between hepatologists and nephrologists (best practice statement).
We recommend personalised palliative care evaluation with goals including reduction in symptom burden, patient/caregiver wellbeing and goals of care discussions (best practice statement).

Rationale:

Patients discharged following an episode of AKI are at an increased risk of recurrent episodes of AKI, progression to CKD, dialysis dependency and mortality. – The post-hospital discharge period is a critical time in which dynamic liver and kidney function changes impact outcomes including mortality, transplant candidacy, and quality of life. Almost half of patients with cirrhosis discharged after an episode of AKI are re-admitted within 3 months, with 22% of readmissions due to renal and metabolic issues such as AKI, anasarca, or hyponatremia. Patients with cirrhosis who are discharged after an episode of AKI should have, at a minimum, a KLH assessment within 1 month of discharge, the timing of which can be individualised according to the risk-phenotype of the patient at the time of discharge (Fig. 6). From the clinical point of view, the stage of cirrhosis should be assessed during the first outpatient visit, with a focus on evaluating the presence and severity of specific complications. In assessing renal recovery, it is important to emphasise that using SCr may result in overestimation of kidney function and measurement of serum CysC levels should be considered when available. – Screening for albuminuria should be routine following an episode of AKI as it has been shown to identify those patients who are at a higher risk of CKD progression.

### Individualized recommendations for acute kidney injury… [^eb65f453]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Patients who met the AKI criteria for inclusion were identified using an electronic alert algorithm that compared each creatinine value measured during hospitalization to the lowest creatinine value in the preceding 7 days and to creatinine values in the past 48 hours using KDIGO criteria. Electronic alerts were instantaneously delivered to the KAT, when a creatinine value met an inclusion criterion. The KAT reviewed the patient's EHR and confirmed that the participant met inclusion criteria for AKI. After EHR review, the KAT provided a set of recommendations focused on evaluation and management of AKI that was individualized for each patient. Recommendations were given only if they were not already ordered or performed by the patient care team. After adding the KAT note to the chart, KAT had no further contact with the clinical care team.

Each KAT member received an orientation on the trial procedure as well as information regarding AKI evaluation and management. KAT members were encouraged to use their clinical judgment for each patient. KAT members were discouraged from recommending discontinuing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors solely for AKI. The primary outcome was a composite of AKI progression, dialysis receipt, or death within 14 days of randomization while hospitalized. AKI progression was defined as meeting a higher KDIGO AKI stage than the AKI stage at enrollment. Patients discharged from the hospital before 14 days without a study outcome were censored at discharge. There was no significant difference between the intervention and usual care groups in rates of discharge to hospice or in nephrology consults within 14 days from AKI detection. In this multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating early, real-time AKI recommendations for hospitalized patients, the intervention was delivered shortly after AKI detection and resulted in increased implementation of AKI diagnostic and therapeutic interventions compared with usual care. However, the intervention had no significant effect on patient outcomes, including AKI progression, dialysis, or mortality, compared with usual care.

### A prospective cohort study of acute kidney injury and kidney outcomes, cardiovascular events, and death [^8fad0a00]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported to be associated with excess risks of death, kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events although previous studies have important limitations. To further examine this, we prospectively studied adults from four clinical centers surviving three months and more after hospitalization with or without AKI who were matched on center, pre-admission CKD status, and an integrated priority score based on age, prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, preadmission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and treatment in the intensive care unit during the index hospitalization between December 2009-February 2015, with follow-up through November 2018. All participants had assessments of kidney function before (eGFR) and at three months and annually (eGFR and proteinuria) after the index hospitalization. Associations of AKI with outcomes were examined after accounting for pre-admission and three-month post-discharge factors. Among 769 AKI (73% Stage 1, 14% Stage 2, 13% Stage 3) and 769 matched non-AKI adults, AKI was associated with higher adjusted rates of incident CKD (adjusted hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.51–6.31), CKD progression (2.37,1.28–4.39), heart failure events (1.68, 1.22–2.31) and all-cause death (1.78, 1.24–2.56). AKI was not associated with major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in multivariable analysis (0.95, 0.70–1.28). After accounting for degree of kidney function recovery and proteinuria at three months after discharge, the associations of AKI with heart failure (1.13, 0.80–1.61) and death (1.29, 0.84–1.98) were attenuated and no longer significant. Thus, assessing kidney function recovery and proteinuria status three months after AKI provides important prognostic information for long-term clinical outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury: an increasing global concern [^3b833138]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Despite an increasing incidence of acute kidney injury in both high-income and low-income countries and growing insight into the causes and mechanisms of disease, few preventive and therapeutic options exist. Even small acute changes in kidney function can result in short-term and long-term complications, including chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Presence of more than one comorbidity results in high severity of illness scores in all medical settings. Development or progression of chronic kidney disease after one or more episode of acute kidney injury could have striking socioeconomic and public health outcomes for all countries. Concerted international action encompassing many medical disciplines is needed to aid early recognition and management of acute kidney injury.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^03899f8c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

The study STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) was published by Sean M Bagshaw and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease and Acute kidney injury. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of RRT initiation strategy in patients with and without CKD? In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the population was: 1121 patients (353 female, 768 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with documented pre-existing eGFR data prior to hospitalization. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m². In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the interventions were: n = 689 RRT for patients with CKD (eGFR ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m²) n = 432 RRT for patients without CKD (eGFR > 59 mL/min/1.73 m²). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes at day 90 (47.2% vs. 39.5%; aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in RRT dependence at day 90 (13.7% vs. 7.7%; aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.43) No significant difference in RRT-free days at day 90 (39.7 days vs. 47.9 days; MD -3.24, 95% CI -8.3 to 1.82) No significant difference in death in the hospital (40.6% vs. 35.6%; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37). In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the STARRT-AKI (secondary analysis, CKD) study, the conclusion was: in patients with documented pre-existing eGFR data prior to hospitalization, RRT for patients with CKD was not superior to RRT for patients without CKD with respect to death from all causes at day 90.

KDIGO AKI — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) recommendations state to initiate RRT emergently when life‑threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance exist, and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). The rationale notes that while no RCTs exist for dialysis for life‑threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently.

### Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) and international club of ascites (ICA) joint multidisciplinary consensus meeting [^081687f1]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

KLH management focuses on five key domains that include education, medication management, disease-modifying interventions, and dynamic transplant and palliative care evaluations. Communication of future risk of CKD and recurrent AKI episodes helps the patient adhere to preventative measures and avoid further kidney insults. Medication reconciliation is crucial during the first outpatient visit since dose modifications and initiation of medications such as diuretics are frequently necessary. The routine post-discharge evaluation of the global domains of frailty in addition to assessment of symptom burden and health-related quality of life, can allow for potentially modifiable gaps to be identified and addressed. More than one-third of caregivers of patients with cirrhosis have been shown to be affected by one or more major adverse impacts on their own lives and a substantial portion of family members are forced to stop working to provide care.

Palliative care is not synonymous with end-of-life care and is associated with improvements in advance care planning, patient and caregiver satisfaction, and lower healthcare utilisation without detriment to patient survival, yet it remains underutilised in patients with cirrhosis (< 5%), especially in patients never placed on the waiting list. – Recognising AKI as a marker of worse prognosis in cirrhosis, persistent kidney dysfunction following discharge can be a trigger for reassessing goals of care by a multidisciplinary team, especially for those patients who are not candidates for LT and with a life expectancy of less than a few months. In such instances, a palliative approach to care is important to ensure that patient's goals are elicited and translated into care that best meets their needs before an acute medical crisis occurs.

### Recovery from AKI in the critically ill: potential confounders in the evaluation [^ff90ce3f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Studies on recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients yield variable results. We assessed the impact of different recovery definitions, of different exclusion criteria, and of imputing missing baseline creatinine on AKI recovery in a heterogeneous ICU population.

Methods

Secondary analysis of the EPaNIC database. Recovery of kidney function in patients who developed AKI in ICU was assessed at hospital discharge. We studied recovery rates of different AKI stages with different definitions of recovery after inclusion or exclusion of non-survivors and in patients with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, the impact of imputing missing baseline creatinine was investigated.

Results

A total of 1310 AKI patients were studied of which 977 were discharged alive from hospital. Rate of complete recovery (absence of KDIGO criteria) was markedly higher in survivors than in all AKI patients (79.5 vs 67.0%), especially for more severe forms of AKI. For patients with CKD, only the need for renal replacement therapy worsened kidney outcome as compared with no-CKD patients. Using stricter definitions of complete recovery significantly reduced its occurrence. New or worsening CKD occurred in 30% of AKI survivors. In no-CKD patients with available baseline creatinine, using an imputed baseline did not affect recovery. Patients with unavailable baseline creatinine were different from those with known baseline and revealed different recovery patterns.

Conclusion

These results indicate the need for rigorous description of AKI severity, the included population, definitions, and baseline creatinine handling in reports on AKI recovery.

### Outpatient dialysis for acute kidney injury: progress and pitfalls [^6644cc7a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI) has increased markedly in the United States. At the same time, mortality rates have recently improved. As such, increasing numbers of patients with AKI are surviving to hospital discharge, including up to 30% who will continue to require outpatient dialysis. In recent years, policy changes have significantly affected the care of this high-risk population. Beginning in 2017, new legislation reversed a previous Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services policy that prohibited dialysis for AKI at end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities. This has improved dialysis options for patients, but the impact on patient outcomes remains uncertain. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of evidence basis to guide management of this vulnerable patient population. Moving forward, additional data reporting and analyses will be required, analogous to how the US Renal Data System has helped inform ESRD care. As the dialysis setting for patients with AKI shifts to the ESRD setting, it is incumbent on the nephrology community to identify best practices to promote kidney recovery, recognizing that these practices will differ from standard ESRD protocols.

### Renal recovery after acute kidney injury [^00cac3f5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Timing of recovery assessment

In the current literature, the timing for the evaluation of renal recovery varies considerably. Some studies determine "recovery" after 3–7 days to make the distinction between transient and persistent AKI. Recent evidence suggests that the time pattern of changes in kidney function and relapses after initial "reversal" may also be associated with mortality. Most studies report recovery at hospital discharge. However, its evaluation at a fixed time point, e.g. at 3 months, allowing one to mark the transition from AKI to CKD, would be more appropriate. Delaying the assessment might also reduce the problem of the impact of sarcopenia on SCr levels. The recent Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) conference suggests differentiating AKI (first 7 days) from acute kidney disease (AKD) (AKI persisting for 7–90 days) and CKD (after 90 days), which may provide a framework for defining recovery in terms of time after the sentinel event (Fig. 3). While AKD was initially proposed to encompass any acute condition that impacts on longer-term kidney function, this more recent ADQI proposal further refines the criteria with the addition of a staging system.

Fig. 3
AKI, AKD, CKD and time course of recovery. Recovery may occur early during acute kidney injury (AKI) up to 7 days after the insult, or later during acute kidney disease (AKD), between 7 days and 3 months after the insult to the kidney

Defining recovery

In the past, renal recovery was often defined as independence from RRT following dialysis-requiring AKI. More recently, non-recovery from less severe AKI has received more attention due to its association with adverse long-term outcomes. Despite many limitations the most obvious definition of full recovery from AKI is the absence of AKI criteria. Partial recovery can then be defined as a fall in AKI stage. Recovery may occur early after the insult leading to AKI or later during the phase of AKD (Fig. 3). However, it is important to appreciate that the use of the creatinine criteria may result in important underestimation of recovery in patients with unknown premorbid creatinine or overestimation of recovery by ignoring the loss of muscle mass that occurs during critical illness. Tubular secretion of creatinine, the contribution of which increases with decreasing GFR, also results in overestimation of GFR by creatinine clearance. An alternative definition of non-recovery might be the presence of eGFR criteria for new or worsening CKD, which, however, still relies on SCr with its associated shortcomings.

© 2025 Question Following an episode of acute kidney injury, what is the ideal blood pressure range, and how soon after hospital discharge do potential benefits of lower blood pressure outweigh risks of mortality and readmission. Findings. In this cohort study of 80 960 patients from the Veterans Healthcare Association who had AKI during a hospital admission, systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg had the most favorable postdischarge risk level for mortality and readmission over time. There was a clear, time-dependent mediation of the associations of blood pressure with mortality and readmission, with patients with higher blood pressures generally being at lower risk for mortality and readmission initially, but at higher risk later in the postdischarge course. Patients typically had stage 1 AKI during their admission. ACEI or ARB medications were prescribed within 60 days of discharge to 35 098 patients.

Patient characteristics based on the first blood pressure following discharge are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. In this cohort study of patients post-AKI, we found that associations of SBP with both mortality and hospital readmission rates were substantially affected by timing relative to hospital discharge. Risks of mortality and hospital readmission in all SBP groups relative to the 160 mm Hg or greater group were highest immediately following discharge and decreased over time. Finally, similar risks for mortality and readmission were observed in those with and without use of an ACEI or ARB medication, with lower relative risks in those with ACEI or ARB use within 60 days. These findings may have substantial implications for patient care following an in-hospital AKI event. Our findings also provide additional nuance to questions regarding ACEI and ARB use in the postdischarge period.

We did observe some lower relative risks of mortality in those with ACEI or ARB use at 60 days, as shown in Table 3. In this retrospective cohort study of patients post-AKI, there were substantial variations in the associations of SBP with mortality based on time from discharge. Risks of mortality and readmission relative to elevated blood pressure were highest in the immediate postdischarge period, with a shift toward lower mortality and readmission at later time points. Veterans with SBP between 130 and 139 mm Hg had the most favorable risk level over time of any group. These findings may have important implications for the timing and targets for blood pressure control used in post-AKI care.

### Short-and long-term outcomes of intensive care patients with acute kidney disease [^f4365de2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant problem in healthcare worldwide, with associated increased risk in both short- and long-term mortality and development of subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whilst AKI has been recognised as a common occurrence within the context of critical illness, the reported incidence in the intensive care unit (ICU) literature has varied from 30–57%. This can be attributed to differences in study populations, increasing recognition of the importance of AKI over time, and variation in the classification system used for diagnosing AKI.

Following publication of the RIFLE classification for AKI, further classifications were produced by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN)and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group. Current KDIGO classification has incorporated and adapted elements of both RIFLE and AKIN criteria to form the most current and internationally accepted criteria for diagnosing and staging AKI. Recent consensus concludes AKI should not be a treated as an isolated event, but as the beginning of a continuum of kidney disease where an initial insult can lead to both persistent kidney injury and CKD. Within this spectrum of disease, it has been postulated that persistent kidney injury should be treated as a separate entity from rapid-reversal AKI. In recognition of these different disease pathways, the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in 2017 proposed the definition of acute kidney disease (AKD) as AKI (KDIGO stage 1 or greater) that persists for 7 days or longer.

This new definition was identified as an important area for research, however, little data exist regarding patients who suffer from AKD and how they differ from patients with AKI that do not develop AKD. A subsequent definition expanded on the concept of AKD being inclusive of patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 for 7–90 days. This definition offers broader diagnostic criteria but is more difficult to apply in the context of an injury acquired on ICU. Furthermore, it would require the removal of all patients with pre-existing CKD stage 3 or worse, as these patients already have eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2.

The aim of this study sought to ascertain the epidemiology and short- and long-term outcomes of patients admitted to ICU suffering from AKD and compare them to patients with a more transient AKI. The specific outcomes were to ascertain potential risk factors associated with progression to AKD, determine short- and long-term mortality in AKI and AKD groups and assess the proportion of MAKEs during the follow up period.

Background

AKI is characterised by a rapid reduction in kidney function with impaired electrolyte, acid-base and water homeostasis. AKI is associated with increased mortality, risk of chronic kidney disease and susceptibility to further episodes of AKI. The Renal Association UK guidelines divide the severity of AKI into three stages based on the absolute or relative elevation in serum creatinine or the need for dialysis treatment. The incidence of AKI has increased substantially over the last two decades, with an incidence of 3995 per million population in the UK in 2013. This increase is most notable in the elderly and in patients with multiple comorbidities. In England, the estimated economic burden of inpatient care for AKI is over £1 billion. There is also a substantial cost for ongoing care, for patients discharged with AKI, estimated to be 179 million in 2010–2011. A review by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Mortality group in 2009 found substantial deficiencies in the inpatient care of patients with AKI. The recognition and management of AKI have become a major healthcare priority in England.

1.2: Risk assessment

1.2.1 We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. (1C)

1.2.2 We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. (Ungraded statement). Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. (Ungraded statement).

1.2.3 We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets. (Ungraded statement).

Rationale

Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI [e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)]. The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be of importance to follow-up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function is an important risk factor in this patient group.

As prevention is still the best 'treatment' of AKI, and as many cases of avoidable AKI do not occur in patients in the ICU or on the nephrology ward, but in general wards, ERBP stresses the importance of developing and implementing pathways of care to detect and monitor patients at risk of AKI outside nephrology units and ICUs. These pathways should be developed in collaboration with the different involved specialities, to address the specific needs and risks per particular patient group. Even if patients are only seen after having been exposed to a risk factor, they still should be assessed in order to identify those who are more likely to develop AKI, as well as those who will require closer monitoring and general supportive measures in order to avoid further injury.

### Prognosis and mortality within 90 days in community-acquired acute kidney injury in the southwest of Sweden [^68c66459]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common consequence of acute illness that carries a substantially increased risk of mortality for many hospitalized patients. Most survive to discharge and some even recover but there is growing evidence suggesting significantly increased long-term risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease, and death after an episode of AKI.

Hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) has been the focus of research over the last two decades. Less data has been published referring to the group of patients with previously normal kidney function, presenting at hospital with an existing acute kidney injury and defined as a community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI). CA-AKI represents the majority of AKI cases. According to several studies, CA-AKI incidence is 2 to 3 times higher than HA-AKI incidence and has the same prognostic significance as HA-AKI on mortality and higher healthcare costs.

The presence and severity of AKI predict mortality, bring with it the need of hospitalization, increased healthcare costs and a high prevalence of disease for both the individual and society. Mild AKI stage 1 is associated with a reduction in survival, which remains detectable for 10 years or more. Even patients attaining an apparent complete recovery remain at risk for long-term kidney complications.

CA-AKI is a serious condition that can occur acutely in previously kidney healthy individuals, but follow-up of kidney function is often limited. Management of concomitant diseases appears to be prioritized over CA-AKI in hospitalized patients. AKI still is often dismissed as a benign event and patients have no acknowledgement of their AKI at hospital discharge. Few patients have follow-up in primary healthcare (PHC) centers or nephrology clinic after discharge from hospital.

While studies have demonstrated an association between CA-AKI and subsequent kidney complications, less is known about the prognostic implications of a hospital-associated CA-AKI episode in the subgroup of patients with normal pre-hospitalization kidney function, according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria.

The objective of the present study was to investigate prognosis and mortality in previously kidney-healthy individuals who visited the ED and simultaneously hospitalized with AKI. The aim was also to investigate the follow-up of this category of patient with an emphasis on their kidney function.

### Association between early recovery of kidney function after acute kidney injury and long-term clinical outcomes [^22ec6d6a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The implications of this work are 2-fold. First, our findings appear to be generalizable to most hospitalized patients who develop AKI. In epidemiologic studies, most patients who develop AKI will have KDIGO stage 1 AKI, and in-hospital mortality is uncommon (the mortality rate is ≤ 10%). Thus, 74% of patients in ASSESS-AKI had KDIGO stage 1 AKI, and patients were included if they survived 90 days after AKI diagnosis. We have shown that even patients with presumed mild AKI are at high risk for poor long-term kidney outcomes. However, current practice is for only a minority of patients with AKI to receive specialized nephrology follow-up at hospital discharge. One reason for the lack of follow-up may be the high rates of AKI in the hospital setting and the difficulty in identifying patients at highest risk for poor renal-specific outcomes. Previous studies have shown that SCr concentration at hospital discharge is associated with the development of CKD. We have now shown that prior to hospital discharge, the trajectory of SCr concentration within 72 hours after AKI diagnosis is associated with the development and progression of CKD independent of the SCr concentration at hospital discharge. Thus, AKI recovery subgroups could inform inpatient and outpatient nephrology consultation. Second, to our knowledge, no safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies exist for treating AKI. One reason for the lack of therapies may be that grouping together patients with AKI with different risks for poor long-term outcomes may obscure a treatment signal specific to certain populations of patients with AKI. Identifying patients with nonresolving AKI may allow for prognostic enrichment of future AKI clinical trials (ie, selecting patients with a greater likelihood of the clinical event that the trial therapy is seeking to prevent).

Fig. 5
Potential monitoring approach for patients who experience PO-AKI or PO-AKD.

Limited data are available to inform the timing and nature of monitoring for patients who experience postoperative acute kidney injury (PO-AKI) or postoperative acute kidney disease (PO-AKD). We suggest that these patients should have their kidney function checked within 1 month of hospital discharge to confirm the extent of recovery or progression of kidney disease. Those with persistent kidney dysfunction at 90 days should be formally assessed for the development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The degree of nephrology involvement in follow-up monitoring should increase with the duration and severity of AKI or AKD commensurate with the risk of developing CKD. Patients with less severe AKI or AKD can be monitored in primary care or by the base specialist and referred for nephrology care if needed according to CKD guidelines. Future research is needed to clarify the optimal timings and methods to provide post-AKI or AKD care. Adapted from Acute Disease Quality Initiative 24, CC BY 2.0.

In survivors of PO-AKI or AKD, the key priorities of long-term management are to facilitate kidney recovery, prevent progressive CKD and mitigate long-term comorbidities, including cardiovascular risk. However, whether any effective strategies beyond supportive CKD care exist is unknown. ADQI recommends that a post-AKI or AKD care bundle should include assessment of kidney function, advocacy and education, review and adjustment of medications, blood pressure management and a sick day protocol. A multi-disciplinary follow-up approach (involving nephrology, primary care, pharmacy, a dietician, a social worker and non-nephrology subspecialists) combined with patient education is recommended but has not been formally studied. Undoubtedly, drug selection, dosing and monitoring are important and should be guided by personalized clinical decision making and regular assessment of kidney function. Both the use of nephrotoxic drugs and the inappropriate exclusion of potentially beneficial medications (for example, ACE inhibitors or antidiabetic medications) need to be avoided. In patients with AKD, in particular, a substantial risk exists of potential therapeutic failure caused by underdosing or avoidance of effective cardiovascular drugs. Close collaboration between the relevant clinical teams is paramount and future research efforts should clarify the ideal timing and method for providing post-AKI and AKD care (Box 7).

Overall outcome in patients with AKI admitted to the ICU

During their hospitalization, 655 out of 1,303 patients died. Overall observed mortality was 50.3% ranging from 43 to 64% per center (Table 1). Within the three classes of the SHARF score, mortality increased from 22% in the lowest class to 64% in the highest class (Table 3).

Outcome in total group and according to SHARF severity classes

AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease; SHARF score, Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure score

Mean ICU LOS was 14 days, mean hospital LOS was 34 days. Within the three classes of the SHARF score, mean ICU length of stay increased from 7.9 days to 16.0 days. At hospital discharge, patients had a mean eGFR of 66.6 ml/minute (SD 37.7) and eGFR was above 60 ml/minute (Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 to 2) in 39% of patients. On the other hand, 16% of patients were discharged while still being treated with RRT. They were considered as having developed end-stage kidney disease and started a chronic RRT program. CKD stage 5 at discharge was most frequently observed in the lowest SHARF class (Table 3).

CONCLUSIONS

Although much of the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline remains state of the art, advances over the past decade have improved our understanding of best practices. Many of these advances are widely accepted (e.g. nephrotoxic medication stewardship, shared decision making for RRT), but others are more controversial (Table 5). Although some centers and specific programs have embraced new technologies and ways of thinking, others have taken a more conservative, or "wait-and-see" approach. Even among conference participants, there was lack of unanimity for various perspectives, and obvious practice variation continues to exist, even among experts. Perhaps more than any new trial or discovery, this fact provides ample rationale for revisiting the AKI guideline in the near future.

GFR/SCr algorithm — classification steps for no known kidney disease (NKD), acute kidney disorder/disease (AKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) proceed through three questions: first, "Is GFR decreased or is serum creatinine increased ?" with timing qualifiers "No Yes < 3 mo or unknown Yes > 3 mo" to sort into NKD, AKD, or CKD; second, "Is Scr increasing or GFR decreasing ?" including the branch "Yes-D, change in SCr meets AKD criteria but not AKI criteria"; and third, "Does the decrease in GFR or increase in Scr resolve within 3 months?" The text specifies that "The answer to Question 1 requires ascertainment of an index GFR/SCr as well during the prior 3 months" and that "Question 2 requires repeat ascertainment of kidney function after the index measure", with abbreviations defined on the figure legend.

### Post-discharge kidney function is associated with subsequent ten-year renal progression risk among survivors of acute kidney injury [^88231438]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

A strength of this analysis is the use of routinely collected data within a large regional population with long follow-up. This "real-life" situation maximizes the generalizability of our findings. Another strength is the distinction of 2 perspectives on progression by using both intermediate (30% renal decline) and hard (CKD stage 4) endpoints. Moreover, by defining the study entry eGFR at a post-discharge time point, our analysis provides a precise separation of incomplete initial recovery and subsequent renal decline that has not previously been studied. A limitation is that data collection was not protocolized. This means there may be ascertainment biases in our determination of renal progression, but these will have been partially offset by our requirement for the outcomes to be sustained for at least 90 days. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with only a discharge creatinine value available in the first post-episode year, with unchanged results. Similarly, quantified proteinuria was frequently not tested in the cohort. In most cases this will have been because of a low level of suspicion for proteinuria or a negative urinalysis, but some cases of proteinuria may have been missed. We also recognize that post-AKI proteinuria will frequently reflect underlying renal disease rather than a new derangement consequent to AKI. Finally, as with all observational studies, there will be residual confounding, which means that the long-term role of AKI may have been overestimated. Our analyses included adjustment for confounders including social, demographic, and renal measurements; comorbid factors; and acute diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis. However, we recognize that hospital episode International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes for comorbidities may lack granularity. We note that prospective recruitment and protocolized follow-up could overcome some of these issues but would be at the expense of "real-life" generalizability.

Overall, this study shows that no matter how severe an AKI episode is, irrespective of proteinuria and even if post-episode function is apparently preserved, an episode of AKI is associated with increased subsequent renal decline that persists for up to 10 years. Recommendations for follow-up should therefore be formulated carefully to avoid false reassurance when eGFR after AKI appears to have returned to the normal range.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

Consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). Discontinue RRT when it is no longer required, either because intrinsic kidney function has recovered to the point that it is adequate to meet patient needs, or because RRT is no longer consistent with the goals of care (Not Graded). We suggest not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery, or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT (2B).

### Acute kidney injury care following hospitalization: care provision and public policy for acute kidney injury survivors [^4152df6c]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The global incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasing. AKI is associated with both short- and long-term risks, including increased risk of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and all-cause death. This review summarizes existing posthospitalization AKI care guidelines, interprets the current state of evidence for AKI survivor care models including nephrology-specific and multidisciplinary team interventions, and details the health policy landscape for AKI survivors receiving outpatient dialysis in the United States. The main finding of this review is that evidence supporting specific posthospitalization AKI care interventions is very limited, resulting in imprecise consensus-based practice recommendations by national and international kidney societies for AKI survivors. The main implication of this work is to highlight the urgent need for additional research evaluating the efficacy of different care models among AKI survivors at high risk of maintenance dialysis, progression of kidney disease, rehospitalization, and death to devise value-based care models and clinical interventions that improve patient outcomes.
