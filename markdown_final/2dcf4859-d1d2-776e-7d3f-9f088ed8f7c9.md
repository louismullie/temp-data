## Question

Encephalopathy work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the encephalopathy workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway, breathing, and circulation. Then, I should verify the focused history and examination to frame the differential. Next, I will consider first-line labs and when to add toxicology or metabolic panels. After that, I need to check the neuroimaging strategy, including when CT versus MRI is indicated. Then, I will review when to pursue lumbar puncture and what to send. I should also examine when EEG is necessary. Finally, I will tailor the workup to special populations and outline escalation pathways if the initial evaluation is unrevealing, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation, treat hypoglycemia immediately, and secure IV access for fluids and medications, because encephalopathy often reflects life-threatening systemic illness and delays in stabilization worsen outcomes [^40cc08ba] [^815efdbd].

> Next, I should review the history and examination with a structured approach, and I need to ensure I capture tempo, exposures, comorbidities, and focal deficits. I should ask about onset and evolution (hyperacute, acute, subacute, chronic), trauma, seizures, fever, substance use, medications, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression, travel, and animal exposures, while on exam I will assess mental status using a standardized scale, look for asterixis, tremor, myoclonus, focal signs, and meningeal irritation, because this frames the differential and guides testing [^85a254f9] [^38c75d54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should organize the differential by mechanism to avoid anchoring: structural causes (stroke, hemorrhage, mass effect), diffuse neuronal dysfunction (metabolic, toxic, infectious, autoimmune, seizures), and psychiatric mimics, and I should remember that encephalopathy is a syndrome, not a disease, so I must keep a broad differential and avoid premature closure [^85a254f9] [^40cc08ba].

> I will now examine first-line laboratory testing that I should obtain in essentially all patients: CBC, electrolytes including sodium and calcium, renal function, liver panel with ammonia, glucose, ABG for acid-base status, and coagulation profile, because these detect common reversible metabolic derangements and liver disease that can drive encephalopathy. I should double-check that ammonia is interpreted in context, as a normal ammonia does not exclude hepatic encephalopathy and a very high ammonia supports it but is not diagnostic by itself [^a9197f3f] [^31317a98].

> Wait, let me verify when to add toxicology and targeted metabolic testing. If the history suggests exposure or the presentation is atypical for hepatic encephalopathy, I should obtain a comprehensive toxicology screen and consider acetaminophen, salicylates, and specific antiepileptic levels, and if there are recurrent or unexplained episodes, I should consider inborn errors of metabolism with serum amino acids, lactate, and ammonia, recognizing that non-cirrhotic hyperammonemia can mimic hepatic encephalopathy and requires prompt recognition and treatment [^7386242a] [^a0ec3e93].

> Now, I need to check the neuroimaging strategy. Non-contrast head CT is appropriate emergently when there are focal deficits, trauma, seizures, or when the cause is unknown, to exclude hemorrhage or mass effect, but MRI is far more sensitive for encephalitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and many toxic-metabolic etiologies, so if CT is non-diagnostic and the patient is stable, I should obtain MRI with contrast when feasible [^39d0ce3a] [^89cc855f].

> But wait, what if the patient has cirrhosis and suspected hepatic encephalopathy? I should confirm that routine brain imaging is not required for recurrent, typical HE episodes, yet imaging is indicated for first episodes, new focal signs, seizures, or nonresponse to therapy, and I should remember that while cirrhotic patients have a higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage, the yield of routine CT in the absence of focal findings is low, so I should individualize imaging rather than default to CT in every case [^a9197f3f] [^f4fa7e06].

> Next, I should review when to perform lumbar puncture and what to send. If infection is suspected or the diagnosis remains unclear after initial noninvasive testing, I should obtain CSF for cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, culture, and HSV PCR, and I should add VZV, enterovirus, or arbovirus testing based on season and exposure history, while also sending CSF for autoimmune encephalitis panels when clinically suspected, because early identification changes management and prognosis [^fcbe920c] [^cad72904].

> I need to ensure I do not miss nonconvulsive seizures. EEG is indicated when there is fluctuating mental status, subtle motor phenomena, or when the patient fails to improve as expected, because nonconvulsive status epilepticus is common in encephalopathy and alters management, and EEG patterns such as generalized slowing or triphasic waves can also support metabolic encephalopathy when structural disease is excluded [^71f6a78e] [^187ae510].

> Let me consider special populations and tailored pathways. In cirrhosis, I should prioritize identifying precipitants such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances, and I should treat empirically for hepatic encephalopathy while concurrently evaluating alternatives, using lactulose and considering rifaximin for secondary prophylaxis after recovery, whereas in suspected autoimmune encephalitis I should not wait for antibody results before starting immunotherapy if clinical suspicion is high, and in sepsis-associated encephalopathy I should aggressively treat the underlying infection and systemic contributors while monitoring for delayed neurocognitive recovery [^a9197f3f] [^cad72904] [^b8306e87].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation steps if the initial workup is unrevealing. If no diagnosis emerges after appropriate first-line testing, I should reconsider the differential, repeat neuroimaging with MRI if not already done, consider brain biopsy or metagenomic sequencing in refractory cases, and involve subspecialists such as infectious diseases, neurology, or hepatology early, because delays in targeted therapy worsen outcomes in encephalitis and other treatable encephalopathies [^fcbe920c] [^d783e57f].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and follow-up plans. I need to record the level of consciousness using standardized scales, track the evolution of deficits, and communicate clearly with consultants and caregivers, and for hepatic encephalopathy in particular, I should document precipitant evaluation and plan for secondary prophylaxis and transplant referral when indicated, as this affects recurrence and long-term outcomes [^38c75d54] [^a9197f3f].

The encephalopathy workup should be **structured and time-sensitive**, prioritizing stabilization and reversible causes. Start with ABCs, vitals, and a focused neurologic exam, then obtain **CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver panels, glucose, ammonia, and ABG**. Order **non-contrast head CT** urgently if focal deficits, trauma, or unknown etiology are present; follow with **MRI** if CT is non-diagnostic or suspicion remains high. Perform **lumbar puncture** for infection or inflammation when safe, and use **EEG** to detect nonconvulsive seizures or metabolic patterns. Tailor additional tests to clinical clues (toxicology, endocrine, autoimmune, malignancy), and escalate to specialist input or advanced imaging if the diagnosis remains unclear [^40cc08ba] [^39d0ce3a] [^fcbe920c] [^71f6a78e].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Immediate priorities are **airway, breathing, and circulation** with continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation. Perform a focused neurologic examination to assess mental status, pupils, motor strength, coordination, and signs of seizures or focal deficits [^40cc08ba].

---

## Essential laboratory investigations

Obtain the following tests in parallel with stabilization:

| **Test category** | **Specific tests** |
|-|-|
| Basic metabolic panel | - Sodium <br/> - Potassium <br/> - Chloride <br/> - Bicarbonate <br/> - Glucose <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Magnesium <br/> - Renal function (BUN, creatinine) [^notfound] |
| Liver function tests | - AST <br/> - ALT <br/> - ALP <br/> - GGT <br/> - Bilirubin <br/> - Albumin <br/> - INR [^notfound] |
| Hematologic tests | - CBC <br/> - Platelets <br/> - Coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, INR) [^notfound] |
| Metabolic tests | - Ammonia <br/> - Lactate <br/> - Arterial blood gas (ABG) <br/> - Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) [^notfound] |
| Infectious screening | - Blood cultures <br/> - Urinalysis and urine culture <br/> - Chest X-ray <br/> - Consider HIV, hepatitis serologies based on risk [^notfound] |

---

## Neuroimaging

Neuroimaging is critical to exclude structural causes and guide further workup:

- **Non-contrast head CT**: Obtain urgently if focal deficits, trauma, or unknown etiology are present to exclude hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute ischemia [^40cc08ba] [^39d0ce3a].
- **MRI brain**: Use if CT is non-diagnostic or suspicion remains high for encephalitis, PRES, or other non-CT-visible pathology; MRI offers superior sensitivity for these entities [^39d0ce3a] [^89cc855f].
- **Advanced imaging**: Consider MR spectroscopy, PET, or SPECT in selected cases for metabolic or functional insights [^89cc855f].

---

## Lumbar puncture (LP)

Perform LP when infection or inflammation is suspected and there is **no contraindication** (e.g. mass effect, coagulopathy). Analyze CSF for cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, culture, and PCR for HSV, VZV, enteroviruses, and other pathogens based on clinical context [^fcbe920c]. Also assess oligoclonal bands, IgG index, and neuronal autoantibodies if autoimmune encephalitis is suspected [^cad72904].

---

## Electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG is indicated to detect **nonconvulsive seizures** or status epilepticus, and to identify encephalopathic patterns (e.g. triphasic waves) suggestive of metabolic or hepatic encephalopathy [^71f6a78e] [^187ae510].

---

## Additional specialized tests

Tailor further testing to clinical suspicion:

- **Toxicology screen**: Urine and serum for drugs, alcohol, and medications [^7386242a].
- **Endocrine evaluation**: Cortisol, ACTH, prolactin if endocrine encephalopathy suspected.
- **Autoimmune panel**: ANA, ANCA, anti-thyroid antibodies, paraneoplastic antibodies [^cad72904].
- **Malignancy screening**: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, mammogram, or PET-CT if paraneoplastic encephalitis is suspected [^cad72904].
- **Genetic testing**: Consider in young patients or suspected hereditary metabolic disorders [^a4badf6d].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Encephalopathy has a broad differential; organize by **etiology**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Metabolic | - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Uremic encephalopathy <br/> - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction [^c78373f8] [^b7ced93c] |
| Toxic | - Drug overdose <br/> - Alcohol withdrawal <br/> - Heavy metals <br/> - Carbon monoxide [^7386242a] |
| Infectious | - Meningitis <br/> - Encephalitis (HSV, VZV, enteroviruses) <br/> - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy [^fcbe920c] [^b8306e87] |
| Structural | - Stroke <br/> - Intracranial hemorrhage <br/> - Mass lesions <br/> - Traumatic brain injury [^40cc08ba] |
| Autoimmune | - Autoimmune encephalitis <br/> - Paraneoplastic syndromes <br/> - Multiple sclerosis [^a9eef8b1] [^cad72904] |
| Seizure-related | - Nonconvulsive status epilepticus <br/> - Postictal state [^71f6a78e] |

---

## Indications for specialist consultation

Involve specialists early for complex or refractory cases: **neurology** for seizures, encephalitis, or unclear etiologies; **infectious diseases** for suspected CNS infections; **hepatology** for hepatic encephalopathy; **endocrinology** for suspected endocrine causes; and **oncology** for paraneoplastic syndromes.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Continuously reassess neurologic status, repeat labs to track metabolic corrections, and monitor for complications such as seizures, infections, or respiratory failure. Document baseline deficits and track recovery to guide rehabilitation planning [^10a949a9].

---

A structured, stepwise approach — stabilize, obtain core labs and imaging, and escalate to LP, EEG, and targeted tests — ensures **rapid identification of reversible causes** and improves outcomes in encephalopathy.

Childhood encephalopathy is an uncommon but significant paediatric presentation and is associated with significant mortality and long-term morbidity in survivors. By definition it is a somewhat non-specific presentation with a wide differential diagnosis and long list of possible investigations. Choice of investigation, including neuroimaging modality, can be a daunting prospect for the clinician faced with the encephalopathic child and it is important to select appropriately for a high diagnostic yield. Initial management centres on good emergency care irrespective of cause. More specific therapies however vary enormously, and appropriate treatment is important and influences outcome. Evidence exists for management of many of the individual conditions causing encephalopathy. This review aims to outline a clinical approach to selecting investigations to identify a specific cause and provides an overview of the treatment for the commoner causes of encephalopathy that a general paediatrician may reasonably expect to be faced with.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^77a1b032]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Specific therapy for overt HE episodes includes supportive care, treatment of underlying precipitants, and initiation of specific therapy; first-line choices are nonabsorbable disaccharides or short-course antibiotics. All patients recovering from an acute episode of overt HE should also receive secondary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of recurrence; the evidence-based choices include nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or rifaximin. Appropriate therapy can reduce the duration of admission and reduce the risk of subsequent readmission. However, to maximize the benefits from therapy, early diagnosis is essential to allow prompt initiation of recommended treatment.

We recommend that our conclusions and recommendations be considered further by our colleagues in gastroenterology and hepatology and those in other disciplines and hope that these recommendations assist in the development of regional/national cross-speciality guidelines to improve the identification and triage of patients who may have HE and facilitate appropriate management. We also hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with HE from initial 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment, which may be by a clinician or healthcare provider not routinely responsible for management of an individual's liver disease.

We present a case of a patient presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome to the emergency department. We discuss the various symptoms that lead to the identification of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and the important clinical clues. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a very uncommon diagnosis/clinical presentation that requires the understanding of the condition and awareness in distinct/specific patient populations. Without this understanding, the diagnosis may be missed and appropriate management delayed.

CONCLUSIONS

In summary, hospitalists are commonly charged with taking care of patients with HE in the community or academic settings. Hence, they should be well‐equipped with the knowledge and develop a systematic approach to the overall management of these patients in the hospital setting. This is important as patients with decompensated liver disease and HE is very ill at initial presentation to the hospital and merit an expedited workup and management with or without the help of a subspecialist. Otherwise, these patients have the potential to deteriorate quickly leading to adverse outcomes. Systematic and guideline congruent management will largely optimize the clinical outcomes in these patients.

### A clinical approach to diagnosing encephalopathy [^85a254f9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy refers to dysfunction of the level or contents of consciousness due to brain dysfunction and can result from global brain insults or focal lesions. The underlying causes of encephalopathy include both primary neurologic and systemic conditions. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy, with a focus on primary neurologic causes. A practical schema for organizing the differential diagnosis is to group etiologies by their pace of onset and evolution (eg, sudden, acute, subacute, chronic).

Panel recommendations

General practitioners, acute care physicians and others, who may encounter patients with cirrhosis, should be aware of the signs and symptoms of HE. If these healthcare providers identify cognitive impairment, or symptoms of HE, in patients with cirrhosis, additional clinical assessment/workup may be required. This may include specialist consultation if helpful. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their family physician: 38% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 3.63/5). Most patients with cirrhosis will be under appropriate specialist care. The primary care physician plays a vital role in the identification of patients with liver disease and should be aware of at-risk groups in addition to clinical signs and symptoms. Guidelines for the primary care provider on this are lacking. HE as a first presentation of cirrhosis would be unusual. However, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings – for example, the patient with risk factors for liver disease, the patient with physical signs suggesting liver disease, or the patient with abnormal serum liver function tests. Unlike other decompensation events (e.g. variceal bleeding, ascites), patients with HE may not present to their usual specialist as a result of their symptoms, and patients with prior HE are more likely to present to their primary care provider or as an emergency admission. Therefore, it is necessary that patients with HE not presenting to their usual healthcare provider are identified and appropriate treatment initiated. Although assessment of cognition and psychiatric symptoms is relatively simple, making a definitive diagnosis of HE is more difficult and HE remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms of HE are relatively nonspecific (Table 1), which can lead to challenges in making a formal diagnosis of HE. Therefore, providers should be ready to consider HE as a cause of cognitive dysfunction and symptoms in patients with cirrhosis, and either work up the patient to make a formal diagnosis or, if necessary, be prepared to refer such patients to specialist care for further assessment. This prompt workup and/or referral should allow for early initiation of appropriate management, which might reduce the risk of hospitalization and thus reduce healthcare costs.
The lead clinician caring for patients with cirrhosis (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) should formally assess all patients for signs and symptoms of HE. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their gastroenterologist: 63% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.5/5). All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their liver specialist: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). Although the general practitioner or acute care physician or other healthcare provider encountering patients with cirrhosis and cognitive impairment should have a low 'threshold' for suspecting HE as a possible cause, we believe that it is the responsibility of the lead clinician (gastroenterologist or liver specialist) to routinely assess patients with cirrhosis for symptoms of HE. According to current guidelines this may involve clinical assessment and/or psychometric testing. As stated below (point 3), the selection of additional psychometric testing remains a matter of personal experience and availability. Routine formal assessment will facilitate early identification of symptoms of HE, and therefore initiation of appropriate management.
Assessment for overt HE should principally be by clinical evaluation, with use of additional testing as required on an individual basis (and according to availability). The assessment of overt HE outside a liver unit should be by clinical evaluation only: 25% strongly agree; 50% agree (mean score: 3.75/5). Only near consensus was reached for this statement as one author strongly felt that even outside the liver unit additional testing beyond clinical assessment was necessary. However, on further discussion it was agreed that for many healthcare providers the facilities are not available to undertake additional tests. Therefore, the final statement above, which allows for additional testing 'if available', was agreed upon. The EASL/AASLD guidelines state that overt HE is primarily a clinical diagnosis (Table 1). Psychometric and neurophysiological tests do not differentiate HE from other causes of cognitive dysfunction, and differential diagnoses include renal dysfunction, hyponatraemia, diabetes, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, psychometric, psychophysical and neurophysiological tests can have some value in supporting the clinical diagnosis of lower grades of overt HE, in addition to their use to detect minimal HE. These include simple paper and pencil tests (including the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test) as well as more sophisticated psychometric tests including the Inhibitory Control Test and Repeated Battery for Assessment of Neurological State, neurophysiological testing by electroencephalogram, or psychophysical testing – for example, the Critical Flicker Frequency. Full consensus on the use of a specific test or tests could not be reached, reflecting differences in availability and clinical opinion. It should be noted that not all of the available tests are fully validated and many require administration by a trained examiner. The results of several of these including the Inhibitory Control Test and Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score test, can be affected by age, educational status and training effects, and for many tests validated 'normals' are not available for all countries/languages and populations. The availability of equipment for these tests varies, and in many centres pencil and paper tests are used and remain valuable. However, if available, the Critical Flicker Frequency test was felt by some authors to have several advantages, including lack of training effect, educational status, and age, and avoidance of interexaminer variability.
For all patients with HE, consideration should usually be given for referral to a liver unit or physician who specializes in liver disease. All patients with overt HE should be referred to a liver unit: 50% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.38/5). HE is a decompensation event and all healthcare providers managing patients with a diagnosis of HE should consider whether the patient should be referred to a liver specialist. Although policies vary with respect to wait-listing patients with HE and a number of allocation scoring systems have been proposed, further assessment of patients with HE is warranted as they may be eligible for assessment for liver transplantation.
All patients with overt HE should be treated (including checking for precipitants). All patients with HE should be treated: 75% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 4.75/5). The most important step in the management of HE is evaluation for precipitants (Table 2), and appropriate intervention. In addition, all patients with a diagnosis of overt HE should be treated. The most commonly used treatments are nonabsorbable disaccharides. A meta-analysis indicated that lactulose or lactitol therapy resulted in clinical improvement, although there was no effect on mortality. Although the same meta-analysis reported that nonabsorbable disaccharides were inferior to short-course antibiotic therapy, lactulose is the usual 'first choice' treatment for overt HE. Antibiotics are, however, commonly used, whereas other therapies available in some countries include oral branched chain amino acidsand intravenous-ornithine-aspartate (LOLA). Other treatment options specialists may consider include albumin dialysisand embolization of large spontaneous portal–systemic shunts, although these are not part of the EASL/AASLD recommendations. If helpful, advice on treatment should be sought from a specialist in liver diseases, particularly for more severe cases, and/or those for whom a nonstandard therapy is being considered.
After recovery/improvement of HE symptoms, secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all patients. After recovery/improvement of overt HE, patients should receive secondary prophylaxis: 83% strongly agree; 16% agree (mean score: 4.83/5). Prior HE is associated with an increased risk for subsequent episodes. In one study ∼50% of patients with at least one prior HE event (median 1) suffered recurrence within 1 year, and in another, 46% of those with at least two prior events suffered recurrence within 6 months. Therefore, it is appropriate to offer secondary prophylaxis to reduce recurrence in most, if not all, patients recovering from an episode of HE. Secondary prophylaxis should be initiated by the clinician managing an episode of HE, with advice from a gastroenterologist or specialist in liver disease if helpful. In patients with a median of one prior episode, lactulose was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrence over a median 14 months' follow-up. Patients receiving lactulose should have the dose adjusted so that there are two or three bowel movements daily but without diarrhoea. In patients with at least two prior episodes of HE in the previous 6 months (the majority of whom were receiving lactulose), rifaximin-α (rifaximin) 550 mg twice daily was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for recurrent HE over 6 months and a reduction in the risk for HE-related hospitalization. The EASL/AASLD guidelines suggest rifaximin 550 mg twice daily add-on to lactulose after the second episode of HE. It may also be appropriate to consider rifaximin monotherapy in patients intolerant to lactulose despite patient education, and dose adjustment to achieve two or three bowel movements each day. A number of other therapies used for secondary prophylaxis are not included in the EASL/AASLD guidelinesbut were felt by some authors to have a role. Full consensus could not be reached on these treatments, partly because of differences in availability and clinical experience. These included laxatives, branched chain amino acids, and LOLA. For patients with hyperammonaemia and HE, LOLA was felt to be particularly helpful by one author, although only intravenous LOLA was reported by the EASL/AASLD guidelines as being effective for the treatment of HE episodes but not for secondary prophylaxis. There was also experience of using oral branched chain amino acids in patients with chronic HE who were protein intolerant, as recommended by the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) guidelines on nutrition. Patients receiving secondary prophylaxis should be encouraged to remain on therapy to maximize the benefits of treatment. It is the responsibility of all healthcare professionals who encounter patients with cirrhosis and HE to encourage compliance with therapy.
Liver specialists may assess patients with cirrhosis for minimal HE; other healthcare professionals caring for patients with cirrhosis should not be expected to routinely assess patients for minimal HE. Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their gastroenterologist: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). Patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for minimal HE by their liver specialist: 88% strongly agree; 13% agree (mean score: 4.88/5). Substantial expertise is required to make a diagnosis of minimal HE and the diagnosis is defined by the test used. In addition, there are no therapies with a specific approval for its treatment. Therefore, it may be reasonable to expect that diagnosis and management of minimal HE should remain the responsibility of liver specialists. Although treatment for minimal HE has been shown to improve cognitive test score and quality of life–, it is not yet possible to confirm benefits in terms of reduced episodes of overt HE or other clinical outcomes. As a result, there is no agreement over potential treatment strategies, including the optimal duration of therapy. It is appropriate for those healthcare providers caring for patients with cirrhosis, who have the expertise and experience, to utilize psychometric or neurophysiological tests on a case-by-case basis if this will help clinical decision making. This reflects the EASL/AASLD guidelines, which suggest that consideration be given to testing patients for minimal HE and providing counselling in some circumstances – for example, potential consequences on driving, flying, train drivers, or operating machinery.
If diagnosed, consideration should be given to treatment of patients with minimal HE. All patients with a diagnosis of minimal HE should be treated: 38% strongly agree; 38% agree (mean score: 4.13/5). If a diagnosis of minimal HE has been made it is reasonable to consider treatment, accepting the caveats above regarding uncertainties surrounding the endpoints of treatment and lack of licensed therapies. Such a decision should be taken in consultation with a specialist in liver diseases.

Recommendations and case description framework — Every case and bout of HE should be described and classified according to four factors (type of underlying disease, severity of manifestations, time course, precipitating factors). Recommendations specify evaluation according to the type of underlying disease, severity of manifestations, time course, and precipitating factors (GRADE III, A, 1), and state that a diagnostic workup is required, considering other disorders that can alter brain function and mimic HE (GRADE II-2, A, 1).

Purpose Of Review

The present article gives an update and outlines the fundamental principles of clinical reasoning and a diagnostic approach to a patient suspected to have acute encephalitis.

Recent Findings

Encephalitis remains to be associated with significant mortality and neurological morbidity. Unfortunately, the etiologic diagnosis remains elusive for the majority of the patients with encephalitis preventing targeted therapies. Clinicians could utilize clues such as duration of symptoms, exposure history, cerebrospinal fluid profile, neuroimaging findings and locations, and entertain certain opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed individuals. A comprehensive diagnostic for the most common viral and autoimmune etiologies should be systematically done and prompt empiric antiviral therapy should be started. Evaluation and therapy for autoimmune etiologies should be done for patients with a negative viral work up. Brain biopsy and metagenomic sequencing should be considered for patients with unknown etiologies that are clinically worsening.

Summary

Encephalitis remains with unacceptable mortality and morbidity with the most common etiologies being idiopathic. A comprehensive diagnostic work up and prompt antiviral and autoimmune therapies are of paramount importance to improve the outcomes of this devastating disease.

Brain scans — computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) do not contribute diagnostic or grading information for HE; however, because the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage is at least 5-fold increased and symptoms may be indistinguishable, a brain scan is usually part of the diagnostic workup of first-time HE and when there is clinical suspicion of other pathology.

### Diagnosis of coma [^31317a98]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for the comatose patient is includes structural abnormality, seizure, encephalitis, metabolic derangements, and toxicologic etiologies. Identifying and treating the underlying pathology in a timely manner is critical for the patient's outcome. We provide a structured approach to taking a history and performing a physical examination for this patient population. We discuss diagnostic testing and treatment methodologies for each of the common causes of coma. Our current understanding of the mechanisms of coma is insufficient to accurately predict the patient's clinical trajectory and more work needs to be done to investigate potential treatments for this often fatal disorder.

### Hepatic encephalopathy: a neurologist's perspective [^0b45a49f]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Liver disease is increasingly common, estimated to affect over 25% of the world's population. Failure of the liver to maintain a normal metabolic milieu leads to impaired brain function (hepatic encephalopathy), and conditions that cause liver disease can themselves predispose to neurological disease. As neurologists' involvement with the acute take increases, it is important that we are familiar with the neurological complications of liver disease, their investigation and management, and to know which other neurological diseases occur in this patient population. In this article, we review the causes, presentation and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, and discuss important differential diagnoses in patients with liver disease who present with neurological disturbance.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^975787e6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### Low yield of head CT in cirrhotic patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy [^f4fa7e06]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a significant complication that occurs in 30%–45% of patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. It manifests as a wide spectrum of changes in consciousness, personality, motor function and/or cognition. Pathophysiology of HE is complex and involves dysregulation between portosystemic shunting, excess ammonia, inflammatory mediators, oxidative stress and cerebral edema. There are no pathognomonic clinical or imaging findings that specifically arise in patients with HE, and thus detailed evaluation of alternative aetiologies of brain dysfunction is needed prior to diagnosis.

Initial workup in a patient with suspected HE includes a thorough physical examination and laboratory testing to evaluate for any evidence of bleeding, electrolyte abnormalities or infection. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is a feared cause for altered mentation in cirrhotic patients. However, ICH is typically accompanied by focal neurological deficit(s) (FND) on physical examination. Despite low diagnostic yield in the absence of FND demonstrated by several studies, non-contrast head CT (HCT) is still frequently used in evaluation of cirrhotic patients presenting with altered consciousness, contributing to higher healthcare costs. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines do not offer concrete recommendations on the role of imaging in HE, with the only data available on the topic in the AASLD guidelines is citing a fivefold increased relative risk of ICH in cirrhotic patientsand common practice patterns where neuroimaging is routinely obtained in patients presenting with HE.

This study aims to investigate the yield of obtaining routine HCTs in cirrhotic patients presenting with HE and investigating correlates of acute intracranial abnormalities on imaging in this population.

### Identifying encephalopathies from acute metabolic derangements [^b7ced93c]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic derangements, when acute and severe, affect brain function. This presents mostly with a marked decline in the level of consciousness, resulting in impaired responsiveness, abnormal receptivity, impaired content, and loss of memory retention. The term metabolic encephalopathy has been used but is conjecture that can be challenged in the age of modern neuroimaging. We now recognize that many metabolic encephalopathies may involve structural lesions and at an early stage. Common clinical conundrums are the evaluation of the degree of brain injury and its recoverability. This review discusses the appropriate terminology for these conditions, the diagnostic approach, therapy recommendations, and prediction of recovery potential. In evaluating a presumed metabolic cause for encephalopathy, we must (1) search for and rule out structural injury to the brain despite an obvious explanatory metabolic derangement, (2) recognize that several confounding conditions often co-exist, and (3) acknowledge that resolution of brain dysfunction may be protracted despite normalization of laboratory values.

### Diagnostic criteria for susac syndrome [^be139d35]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome is characterised by the triad of encephalopathy with or without focal neurological signs, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss. Establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed because the triad is complete only in a minority of patients at disease onset. This leads to a critical delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment. Our objective was to establish criteria for diagnosis of either definite or probable Susac syndrome.

Method

The establishment of diagnostic criteria was based on the following three steps: (1) Definition of a reference group of 32 patients with an unambiguous diagnosis of Susac syndrome as assessed by all interdisciplinary experts of the European Susac Consortium (EuSaC) team (EuSaC cohort); (2) selection of diagnostic criteria, based on common clinical and paraclinical findings in the EuSaC cohort and on a review of the literature; and (3) validation of the proposed criteria in the previously published cohort of all Susac cases reported until 2012.

Results

Integrating the clinical presentation and paraclinical findings, we propose formal criteria and recommend a diagnostic workup to facilitate the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. More than 90% of the cases in the literature fulfilled the proposed criteria for probable or definite Susac syndrome. We surmise that more patients could have been diagnosed with the recommended diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

We propose diagnostic criteria for Susac syndrome that may help both experts and physicians not familiar with Susac syndrome to make a correct diagnosis and to prevent delayed treatment initiation.

### Investigation of the child with an acute metabolic disorder [^a7eea685]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited biochemical defects may present with acute life-threatening illness with a high mortality and morbidity. Some are treatable and have a good outcome with early appropriate intervention. However, because of their rarity, diagnosis is often delayed; they are not considered or investigated appropriately. This is especially likely in those presenting in previously healthy adults. The collection of acute samples is crucial. There are numerous disorders, and front-line tests must cast a wide net. A small core of emergency tests generally indicates which metabolic pathway is defective and provides a working diagnosis and basis for treatment. Later confirmation and identification of the precise defect are essential for long-term management and for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis of future pregnancies. An escalating number of specialist tests and mutation analyses are undertaken by metabolic laboratories worldwide, but they are not widely available, are expensive, and must be requested selectively. Guidelines are presented here for the front-line investigation of acutely ill children with hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, encephalopathy and intractable seizures, and for a dying child with a suspected, undiagnosed, inherited metabolic defect. With modification, these are also applicable to adults with a metabolic defect. In order to guide further investigation, selected disorders are described briefly along with their diagnostic work-up. Information about sample collection and processing is provided.

### Clinical reasoning: a 59-year-old man with acute-onset encephalopathy and aphasia [^6906ff13]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessing patients with acute encephalopathy presents significant challenges because of the wide range of underlying causes. This complexity is further intensified when seizures are involved, making the selection of effective management even more critical. In this case, a 59-year-old man was evaluated at the emergency department for acute-onset confusion and aphasia, which later on was complicated by seizures. Stroke was initially ruled out, and valproate therapy was instituted. EEG showed slow background activity, CSF was normal, and brain MRI showed bilateral cortical T2 hyperintensities with diffusion restriction involving the insula and cingulate gyrus. The neuroimaging findings narrowed the differential and pointed to the final diagnosis. In this case, we walk through the differential diagnosis of acute encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of a systematic diagnostic approach and considering the wide variety of etiologies, with an emphasis on those with specific treatments. The presence of key clinical and radiologic data guides the clinician to reach the final diagnosis.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^b90ecc58]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
In a specialty care setting (usually general neurology, geriatric psychiatry, or geriatrics), this diagram briefly illustrates how each primary care clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow (see Figure 2 for details). Additional detail is provided on how higher tier assessments and diagnostic tests fit into the specialty care workflow. In some specialty care settings, the assessments and tests illustrated in Figure 4 are performed to arrive at the 3‐step diagnostic formulation. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or may exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.,

Specialized neurobehavioral assessments and neurologic examinations are also used to monitor status, as well as to disentangle the adverse effects of prior or current treatments (e.g. parkinsonism, dyskinesias, cognitive side effects of medications, sleep and mood changes) from the symptoms of disease(s) and comorbid conditions. Recommendation 12 provides additional detail on patient characteristics that warrant specialist referral.

### A young woman presenting with encephalopathy: a case report [^1cc89366]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When cerebral white matter lesions are detected in young patients presenting with neurologic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). Still, it is crucial to screen for important differential diagnoses which require sophisticated workup and sometimes immediate treatment, such as autoimmune encephalopathies, juvenile stroke, central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, and, as in this case, Susac syndrome. Knowledge about key clinical and neuro-imaging features is therefore of utmost importance. Here, we report a case of a young woman presenting with encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and cerebral white matter lesions and discuss our diagnostic approach.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: proposed best practice recommendations for diagnosis and acute management [^cad72904]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this first part of the best practice recommendations, we covered the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup and acute management of AE guided by published studies and the results of the AEACN survey providing updated recommendations for management of patients with suspected AE. The second part will follow with a focus on bridging therapy, symptomatic treatment and maintenance immunotherapy. A discussion of the limitations will be presented at the end of the second part. A summary of the best practice recommendations for AE diagnosis and acute management is presented in box 1.

Box 1
Best practice recommendations summary for acute management of autoimmune encephalitis (AE)

Evaluate the likelihood of AE relative to the patient's clinical picture.
Perform brain MRI and/or EEG to look for focal or multifocal brain abnormality.
Perform lumbar puncture to support inflammatory aetiology and rule out infective/neoplastic causes. Test oligoclonal bands, IgG index, IgG synthesis rate and neuronal autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Send blood tests to rule out other potential causes guided by neuroanatomical and clinical data. Test neuronal autoantibodies in the serum.
Consider brain FDG-PET when there is a high clinical suspicion of AE and other paraclinical studies are uninformative.
Perform cancer screening with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast in relevant cases (or MRI when CT is contraindicated or not preferred). If negative, consider further testing with mammogram/breast MRI, pelvic ultrasound, and/or whole body FDG-PET guided by the clinical presentation and each patient's specific cancer risk factors.
Once infection is ruled out based on basic CSF results (eg, number of cells) and if biopsy for primary CNS lymphoma or neurosarcoidosis is not a consideration, start acute immunotherapy with high dose corticosteroids (or IVIG or PLEX if steroids are not preferred or contraindicated).
If there is no clinical, radiological or electrophysiological improvement by the end of the initial treatment cycle, add IVIG or PLEX. Consider IVIG first in agitated patients and in those with bleeding disorders. Consider PLEX first in patients with severe hyponatraemia, high thromboembolic (or cancer) risk, and if there is associated brain or spinal demyelination.
Consider starting with a combination therapy of steroids/IVIG or steroids/PLEX from the beginning (as opposed to sequentially) in patients with severe initial presentation (eg, severe NMDAR-antibody presentation, new onset refractory status epilepticus, severe dysautonomia, etc).
If there is no clinical or radiological improvement 2–4 weeks after completion of combined acute therapy, consider starting a second-line agent when the clinical suspicion is high and/or a clinically relevant antibody is present.
Consider rituximab in known or highly suspected antibody-mediated autoimmunity (eg, NMDAR-antibody encephalitis) and consider cyclophosphamide in known or highly suspected cell-mediated autoimmunity (eg, classical paraneoplastic syndrome).
If no clear objective or subjective evidence of improvement with conventional second-line therapies, consider novel approaches such as tocilizumab or bortezomib although there is only minimal evidence to support their use.
Start bridging therapy with gradual oral prednisone taper or monthly intravenous Ig or intravenous methylprednisolone. Avoid steroid taper or implement a shorter taper in vague cases with poor response to initial immunosuppressive therapy or when immunosuppression may impose higher risks than benefits (eg, patients with cancer or active infection).

Hepatobiliary emergencies typically present with a constellation of different symptoms including abdominal pain, fevers, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, coagulopathy, and in some instances, encephalopathy. The differential can be broad and may include infectious, inflammatory, and even iatrogenic etiologies. Workup with appropriate lab and imaging studies can help discern between different pathologies and thus guide their management. Interventions can range broadly from conservative management with medical therapy to endoscopic options or surgery. This article explores the diagnostic workup and evaluation as well as the current therapeutic interventions for a variety of these nontraumatic hepatobiliary emergencies based on the most current literature.

### Minimal hepatic encephalopathy… [^fb578406]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Setting University medical center. Results Six months after LT, patients had improved their performance in visuospatial and selective attention, visuospatial short-term and long-term memory, and language tasks. After 18 months, a further improvement was found for selective attention and verbal short-term memory, while no other cognitive functions varied over time. A wide range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, such as personality disorders, inappropriate affective, behavioral, and sleep disturbances, and cognitive and psychomotor impairment, can occur in patients with liver cirrhosis, 1 usually classified as hepatic encephalopathy. Conventionally, HE is graded according to 4 stages of severity on the basis of clinical examination, 1 but the absence of clinical signs does not exclude the diagnosis of HE. 2, 3 In patients without overt neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive deficits can be detected by neuropsychological tests4 disclosing subclinical or minimal HE.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is often associated with patient complaints about reduced work efficiency5 and probably predisposes to overt HE. 6 The profile of cognitive dysfunctions associated with MHE is still under study. Selective deficits in attention and fine motor skills have been observed, with spared general intellectual abilities. 4, 7 This pattern of cognitive deficits suggests subcortical cerebral impairment. Recent neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography, 8, 9 magnetic resonance imaging, 10 or magnetic resonance spectroscopy11, 12 confirm the prominent involvement of frontosubcortical structures. The measures of the Stroop color test, TMT, Cross Out a Test, auditory reaction time, visual reaction time, and visual accuracy test are computed on a reversed scale, in which low values indicate the best function; in the other tests, a high value is a sign of good functioning.

This is supported by our finding of a progressive ongoing recovery of some functions such as memory span and selective attention. In conclusion, LT has a favorable effect on MHE, which continues during longitudinal observation. Further prospective and longitudinal studies will target specific structural or biochemical changes in patients who have received a transplant.

Hunt for precipitants or triggers — A preferred approach

There is considerable overlap between precipitants of HE and factors contributing to non‐HEs. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline recommends broad consideration of infection, electrolyte derangements, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage as potential sources for decompensation. In patients with ascites, diagnostic paracentesis remains a critical part of diagnostic workup and should be performed promptly after the presentation. Given the high rate of morbidity and mortality from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, previous studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of death associated with early paracentesis in patients admitted with ascites. However, paracentesis can be especially challenging to obtain in the first 24 h of admission for many reasons. Encephalopathy itself may limit patients' ability to consent to a procedure or maintain positioning/sterility while paracentesis is being performed. Staffing limitations and level of training may also limit the ability to perform paracentesis in the first hours after admission. One retrospective analysis of patients admitted for HE noted that 77% did not have diagnostic paracentesis during their admission. Blood cultures should generally be performed on admission as part of a broad infectious workup. Chest radiographs and urinalysis may also be considered, although are not always warranted in those patients who are able to provide negative infectious history for these systems and have no concerning physical exam findings. Gastrointestinal bleeding, typically apparent in the history, may be more challenging to elucidate in encephalopathic patients. Although many metabolic derangements potentially driving HE can be readily seen on a basic metabolic panel, hypovolemia (a potential HE precipitant) may be challenging to identify as many patients with cirrhosis have third spacing on physical exam. Hence, astute clinical assessment is most important for making these judgment calls. If the clinical situation demands, it may be prudent to consult the Hepatology or Gastrointestinal services, if available. Table 1 shows some of the representative precipitants for HE.

### Clinical reasoning: a 24-year-old pregnant woman with headache and behavioral change progressing to coma [^13d18a5e]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The broad differential diagnosis associated with progressive subacute encephalopathy can be intimidating, especially in a young, pregnant woman. In this case, a 24-year-old woman at 21 weeks of gestation presented with persistent, drug-resistant fronto-parietal headache, with subsequent progressive development of psychomotor lentification and inappropriate behavior. Physical examination was normal, as were routine laboratory parameters and CT findings, and these symptoms were initially interpreted in the context of chronic depression. Later, the patient developed generalized dystonia and fever, with rapid clinical deterioration, depression of consciousness and, eventually, progression to coma. This case emphasizes the complexity and challenges involved in the diagnostic approach to a patient with progressive subacute encephalopathy framed by worsening CNS symptoms. It highlights the clinical considerations and complementary investigation of various etiologies, in a step-by-step approach, ultimately leading to the final diagnosis. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of these conditions can lead to more favorable outcomes, particularly in gestating patients, where prompt intervention is crucial, and where critical decisions may have to be made regarding pregnancy and the safety of treatment options.

Executive summary of recommendations

Presentation and severity assessment

1. We recommend that the presence of encephalopathy in a patient with acute severe (AS) autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) should codify the disease as AIH-related acute liver failure (AIH ALF). This should trigger consideration of urgent liver transplant. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Pediatric first unprovoked seizure — diagnostic testing guidance includes: LP: Option: In the child with a first nonfebrile seizure, LP is of limited value and should be used primarily when there is concern about possible meningitis or encephalitis. EEG: Standard: The EEG is recommended as part of the neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with an apparent first unprovoked seizure. Neuroimaging studies: Guideline: If a neuroimaging study is obtained, MRI is the preferred modality; Option: Emergent neuroimaging should be performed on a child of any age who exhibits a postictal focal deficit that does not quickly resolve or who has not returned to baseline within several hours after the seizure. Option: Nonurgent imaging studies with MRI should be seriously considered in any child with a significant cognitive or motor impairment of unknown etiology, unexplained abnormalities on neurologic examination, a seizure of partial onset with or without secondary generalization, an EEG that does not represent a benign partial epilepsy of childhood or primary generalized epilepsy.

### What to see when you are looking at confusion: a review of the neuroimaging of acute encephalopathy [^89cc855f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acute encephalopathy is a clinical conundrum in neurocritical care facing physicians with diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Encephalopathy arises from several concurrent causes, and delayed diagnosis adds to its grim prognosis. Diagnosis is reached by melding clinical, neurophysiological and biochemical features with various neuroimaging studies. We aimed to compile the pathophysiology of acute encephalopathies in adults, and the contribution of cerebral CT, MRI, MR spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) to early diagnosis, treatment and prognostication. Reports from 1990 to 2013 were identified. Therefore, reference lists were searched to identify additional publications. Encephalopathy syndromes best studied by neuroimaging emerge from hypoxic-ischaemic injury, sepsis, metabolic derangements, autoimmune diseases, infections and rapidly evolving dementias. Typical and pathognomonic neuroimaging patterns are presented. Cerebral imaging constitutes an important component of diagnosis, management and prognosis of acute encephalopathy. Its respective contribution is dominated by rapid exclusion of acute cerebral lesions and further varies greatly depending on the underlying aetiology and the range of possible differential diagnoses. CT has been well studied, but is largely insensitive, while MRI appears to be the most helpful in the evaluation of encephalopathies. MRS may provide supplementary biochemical information and determines spectral changes in the affected brain tissue. The less frequently used PET and SPECT may delineate areas of high or low metabolic activity or cerebral blood flow. However, publications of MRS, PET and SPECT are limited only providing anecdotal evidence of their usefulness and sensitivity.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^abd53d51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### A clinical approach to diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis [^a9eef8b1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Encephalitis is a severe inflammatory disorder of the brain with many possible causes and a complex differential diagnosis. Advances in autoimmune encephalitis research in the past 10 years have led to the identification of new syndromes and biomarkers that have transformed the diagnostic approach to these disorders. However, existing criteria for autoimmune encephalitis are too reliant on antibody testing and response to immunotherapy, which might delay the diagnosis. We reviewed the literature and gathered the experience of a team of experts with the aims of developing a practical, syndrome-based diagnostic approach to autoimmune encephalitis and providing guidelines to navigate through the differential diagnosis. Because autoantibody test results and response to therapy are not available at disease onset, we based the initial diagnostic approach on neurological assessment and conventional tests that are accessible to most clinicians. Through logical differential diagnosis, levels of evidence for autoimmune encephalitis (possible, probable, or definite) are achieved, which can lead to prompt immunotherapy.

### Adherence to recommended inpatient hepatic encephalopathy workup [^f244ced0]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is characterized by altered sensorium and is the most common indication for hospitalization among patients with cirrhosis. Liver societal guidelines for inpatient HE revolve around identification of potential precipitants. In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine adherence to societal guidelines for evaluation of HE in 78 inpatients. The adherence rate to societal recommended guidelines for workup of HE was low, with only 17 (22%) patients having complete diagnostic workup within 24 hours of admission. Notably, 23 (30%) patients were not subjected to blood culture analysis, 16 (21%) were missing urinalysis, and 15 (20%) were missing chest radiograph. In patients with ascites (N = 34), 26 (77%) did not have a diagnostic paracentes is to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In contrast, serum ammonia determination, a laboratory test not endorsed by societal guidelines for workup of HE, was ordered in 74 (95%) patients. These findings underscore the limited adherence to societal guidelines in hospitalized patients with HE.

### Wernicke's encephalopathy: new clinical settings and recent advances in diagnosis and management [^18f18fff]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from thiamine deficiency, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. According to autopsy-based studies, the disorder is still greatly underdiagnosed in both adults and children. In this review, we provide an update on the factors and clinical settings that predispose to Wernicke's encephalopathy, and discuss the most recent insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis, and treatment. To facilitate the diagnosis, we classify the common and rare symptoms at presentation and the late-stage symptoms. We emphasise the optimum dose of parenteral thiamine required for prophylaxis and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy and prevention of Korsakoff's syndrome associated with alcohol misuse. A systematic approach helps to ensure that patients receive a prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment.

### The spectrum of sepsis-associated encephalopathy: a clinical perspective [^b8306e87]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a severe neurologic syndrome characterized by a diffuse dysfunction of the brain caused by sepsis. This review provides a concise overview of diagnostic tools and management strategies for SAE at the acute phase and in the long term. Early recognition and diagnosis of SAE are crucial for effective management. Because neurologic evaluation can be confounded by several factors in the intensive care unit setting, a multimodal approach is warranted for diagnosis and management. Diagnostic tools commonly employed include clinical evaluation, metabolic tests, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging in selected cases. The usefulness of blood biomarkers of brain injury for diagnosis remains limited. Clinical evaluation involves assessing the patient's mental status, motor responses, brainstem reflexes, and presence of abnormal movements. Electroencephalography can rule out non-convulsive seizures and help detect several patterns of various severity such as generalized slowing, epileptiform discharges, and triphasic waves. In patients with acute encephalopathy, the diagnostic value of non-contrast computed tomography is limited. In septic patients with persistent encephalopathy, seizures, and/or focal signs, magnetic resonance imaging detects brain injury in more than 50% of cases, mainly cerebrovascular complications, and white matter changes. Timely identification and treatment of the underlying infection are paramount, along with effective control of systemic factors that may contribute to secondary brain injury. Upon admission to the ICU, maintaining appropriate levels of oxygenation, blood pressure, and metabolic balance is crucial. Throughout the ICU stay, it is important to be mindful of the potential neurotoxic effects associated with specific medications like midazolam and cefepime, and to closely monitor patients for non-convulsive seizures. The potential efficacy of targeted neurocritical care during the acute phase in optimizing patient outcomes deserves to be further investigated. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy may lead to permanent neurologic sequelae. Seizures occurring in the acute phase increase the susceptibility to long-term epilepsy. Extended ICU stays and the presence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy are linked to functional disability and neuropsychological sequelae, underscoring the necessity for long-term surveillance in the comprehensive care of septic patients.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^309f0780]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

When to call consultations — A case‐by‐case approach?

Although most hospitalists are comfortable managing typical OHE patients, certain situations demand getting in touch with a specialist. Hepatology should be consulted in patients with HE who are post‐TIPS, as consideration of a shunt diameter reduction may be an option for treatment. For patients presenting with OHE with relatively well‐preserved liver function, the consideration of large, spontaneous portosystemic shunts may be an underlying precipitant for HE. In these cases, treatment includes potential embolization of the shunt, but the careful patient selection and liver function must be considered with the help of an expert consultation. Hepatic encephalopathy in acute liver failure warrants hepatology consultation as the management differs from that of HE in CLD. These patients are at high risk for morbidity and mortality with risk for progression to fulminant hepatic failure and the potential need for expedited transplant evaluation. And of course, GI and/or Hepatology teams need to be involved up front in cases of HE precipitated by GI bleeding for consideration of endoscopic procedures. In addition, in those cases of persistent OHE not responding to initial management by the hospitalist, the threshold for specialty consultation should be low, particularly if the patient is on the transplantation list or potentially a candidate for the same. The role of more frequent consultation with specialists has been explored as a potential quality improvement (QI) measure using various models. While mandatory gastroenterology involvement was found to be associated with improved guideline‐adherent care, it did not improve readmission rates. However, the overall impact of QI initiatives in the care of OHE patients remains an area of future interest.

### Diagnosis of reversible causes of coma [^40cc08ba]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Because coma has many causes, physicians must develop a structured, algorithmic approach to diagnose and treat reversible causes rapidly. The three main mechanisms of coma are structural brain lesions, diffuse neuronal dysfunction, and, rarely, psychiatric causes. The first priority is to stabilise the patient by treatment of life-threatening conditions, then to use the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings to identify structural causes and diagnose treatable disorders. Some patients have a clear diagnosis. In those who do not, the first decision is whether brain imaging is needed. Imaging should be done in post-traumatic coma or when structural brain lesions are probable or possible causes. Patients who do not undergo imaging should be reassessed regularly. If CT is non-diagnostic, a checklist should be used use to indicate whether advanced imaging is needed or evidence is present of a treatable poisoning or infection, seizures including non-convulsive status epilepticus, endocrinopathy, or thiamine deficiency.

### Medically unexplained neurologic symptoms: a primer for physicians who make the initial encounter [^ed039960]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Medically unexplained symptoms are ubiquitous in clinical practice. Medical use costs of medically unexplained symptoms are projected at approximately $256 billion per year. When initially seen, these symptoms are often baffling, not only to the patients but also to the physicians who encounter them. Because of this, properly diagnosing them is seen generally as difficult at best, leading to massive overuse of unnecessary testing. Subsequently, their management can be cumbersome. All this burdens the patients with unnecessary costs, financially and emotionally. This primer discusses historical perspectives of these and the changing nomenclature, and outlines how to think about these complex symptoms and neurologic findings that will enable a positive diagnosis rather than a diagnosis of exclusion. We also offer useful heuristic principles of their management so that physician-patient relationships can be better maintained and the quality of life of these patients can be improved by way of some simple, economic approaches.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^e5c5520e]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy guideline (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [AASLD] and European Association for the Study of the Liver [EASL]) — recommendation grading and scope are defined as follows: the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines Subcommittee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendation classified as strong (1) or weak (2). Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care, and they are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case; specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

### EASL clinical practical guidelines on the management of acute (fulminant) liver failure [^53d3cf1a]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction. In the context of hepatological practice, however, ALF refers to a highly specific and rare syndrome, characterised by an acute abnormality of liver blood tests in an individual without underlying chronic liver disease. The disease process is associated with development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. These, as well as additional clinical procedures will be the subject of these clinical practice guidelines.

### The spectrum of sepsis-associated encephalopathy: a clinical perspective [^46976e7b]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors and clinical presentation

Most of the available data on acute encephalopathy in the ICU has been generated from studies conducted in the general population. Few specific epidemiological studies have been conducted in patients with sepsis, and risk factors for SAE identified in these studies are described in Table 1. These studies are biased by the lack of consensual definitions for SAE and the use of different sepsis criteria. Therefore, large multicenter epidemiological studies specific to SAE are needed.

Table 1
Risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy

Clinical evaluation of SAE is challenging in the ICU because neurologic assessment can be confounded by several factors, including fever, metabolic derangements, and the use of hypnotic agents in mechanically ventilated patients. SAE manifests as a rapid change from baseline cognitive status or level of consciousness, and presents with a wide range of symptoms, from mild delirium (19%) to coma (40%). Coma or hypoactive delirium is the most common presentation of SAE, whereas agitation (~ 10% of cases) and dysautonomia are less frequent. Convulsive seizures (~ 2% of cases) and focal signs (~ 1% of cases) are uncommon and should trigger investigations to rule out brain injury. Thus, underdiagnosis of SAE is probable in the absence of systematic screening with validated tools. Conversely, SAE may be the first sign of early sepsis, and any new-onset encephalopathy must prompt clinicians to screen their patients for infection.

Methods

On the basis of the results of the Needs Assessment survey and follow on discussions, a PubMed search was undertaken to identify additional management guidelines and recommendations for management of HE. The MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' combined with the subheadings 'therapy', 'rehabilitation', 'diet therapy', or 'drug therapy' was used as an initial search. This was then supplemented by a search combining the MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' and the article types 'consensus development conference', 'consensus development conference, NIH', or 'guideline'. A total of 1146 possible publications were identified and a manual search of this list was then undertaken to identify publications that could inform the development of draft statements. Because of the paucity of suitable papers, a free text search ('hepatic encephalopathy' AND (guideline* OR algorithm)) and a MESH search ('cognition disorders' AND cirrhosis) were also undertaken. These did not retrieve any additional suitable citations.

### Immune-mediated encephalitis [^a7d08514]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A neurological deterioration in a child presents a significant worry to the family and often a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. A dysregulated immune response is implicated in a wide and growing spectrum of neurological conditions. In this review we consider the current paradigms in which immune-mediated encephalopathies are considered; the development of paediatric specific diagnostic criteria that facilitate early consideration and treatment of immune-mediated conditions and the limitations and potential developments in diagnostic testing. We consider the expanding phenotype of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody, the spectrum of virus-associated encephalopathy syndromes, and the strategies that have been employed to build an evidence base for the management of these rare conditions. Looking forward we explore the potential for advanced molecular investigations to improve our understanding of immune-mediated encephalitides and guide future treatment strategies. Recently characterized immune-mediated central nervous system disorders include new antibodies causing previously recognized phenotypes. Aggregation of conditions with similar clinical triggers, and characterization of unique imaging features in virus-associated encephalopathy syndromes. Immune treatment iscurrently guided by meta-analysis of individualized patient data and/or multi-national consensus.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^44105809]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as 'brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting'. Symptoms of overt HE include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness – particularly disturbance of the sleep/wake cycle–. In more severe HE, patients may become disorientated, acutely confused and suffer from agitation or coma. Minimal HE, the mildest form of HE, is clinically undetectable and requires the use of psychometric or neurophysiological testing to make a diagnosis.

Overt HE is a common complication of cirrhosis; at diagnosis approximately 10% of patients have HE, and 20–40% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HE during their disease course. In a multicentre study in Europe, of 2145 successive patients at different stages of liver disease 21% had HE. HE is also associated with a poor prognosis; 1-year mortality in patients with HE was 64% in one population-based series. Mortality may also be correlated with HE severity. In addition, HE affects the patient's quality of life, and caregiver burden. There is also accumulating evidence that after apparent resolution of HE persistent cognitive dysfunction may occur.

### 11-year-old boy with B-ALL-induced hypereosinophilic syndrome presenting as acute encephalopathy [^2ac83dca]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy is a disturbance in neurologic function. It is commonly attributed to infectious and inflammatory etiologies but encompasses a wide differential. Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare cause of encephalopathy that is associated with underlying infection or malignancy. We present a pediatric patient who experienced several days of worsening encephalopathy and neurological deterioration associated with influenza B infection and hypereosinophilia. A thorough workup ultimately revealed a diagnosis of HES secondary to B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This case exemplifies the importance of maintaining a broad approach to the diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and management of encephalopathy.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: the efficient investigation of infantile and childhood epileptic encephalopathies in the era of modern genomics [^a4badf6d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

The investigation of children presenting with infantile and childhood epileptic encephalopathies (ICEE) is challenging due to diverse aetiologies, overlapping phenotypes and the relatively low diagnostic yield of MRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and biochemical investigations. Careful history and thorough examination remain essential as these may identify an acquired cause or indicate more targeted investigation for a genetic disorder. Whole exome sequencing (WES) with analysis of a panel of candidate epilepsy genes has increased the diagnostic yield. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), particularly as a trio with both parents' DNA, is likely to supersede WES. Modern genomic investigation impacts on the timing and necessity of other testing. We propose a structured approach for children presenting with ICEE where there is diagnostic uncertainty, emphasising the importance of WGS or, if unavailable, WES early in the investigative process. We note the importance of expert review of all investigations, including radiology, neurophysiology and biochemistry, to confirm the technique used was appropriate as well as the results. It is essential to counsel families on the risks associated with the procedures, the yield of the procedures, findings that are difficult to interpret and implication of 'negative' results. Where children remain without a diagnosis despite comprehensive investigation, we note the importance of ongoing multidisciplinary care.

### Diagnosis and management of acute liver failure [^2c065cc3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a devastating syndrome afflicting previously healthy individuals. Early recognition of the illness is crucial, as aggressive treatment may improve outcomes. Despite significant advances in care, however, the mortality remains high (30–100%). This brief review will focus on the causes and overall management of the complications of ALF.

Recent Findings

Our knowledge of the causes of ALF has expanded significantly in the last decade. The mechanism of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema in this setting continues to be elucidated and is discussed here.

Summary

Improved outcomes can be achieved with the early recognition and aggressive management of ALF.

### Imaging evaluation of the adult presenting with new-onset seizure [^8dffe71d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to discuss the evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging in adult patients presenting with new-onset seizure.

Conclusion

Unenhanced CT should be the initial imaging examination performed for adults presenting with first unprovoked seizure in the acute setting to exclude conditions requiring urgent or emergent intervention. MRI has added benefits and should be considered for adults presenting acutely for whom the initial CT is negative and for those presenting with new-onset seizure in the nonacute setting.

### Non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia: are we missing the diagnosis? [^a0ec3e93]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy secondary to hyperammonaemia is a known complication of chronic liver disease. In contrast, non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia is a lesser-known entity that should be considered in a patient with acute encephalopathy as part of the diagnostic workup as prompt identification can help to avoid complications such as seizures and cerebral oedema. We present a case of a middle-aged woman who presented electively for a total pancreatectomy-duodenectomy with splenectomy, hepatico-jejunostomy, gastro-jejunostomy and developed encephalopathy on postoperative day 10 due to non-cirrhotic hyperammonaemia.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^97ceca6c]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Delphi process

Strong levels of consensus were reached regarding the role of gastroenterologists and liver specialists in the clinical diagnosis of HE, with lower levels of consensus regarding the role of the family physician. There was also consensus that all patients with cirrhosis should be assessed, not only those with a history of decompensation. As shown, full consensus was not reached regarding the specific diagnostic test or tests that should be used, nor the treatment of an overt HE episode. In contrast, there was general consensus that secondary prophylaxis was appropriate. During the final teleconference, agreement was reached to develop the 'recommendations' below with all members of the Panel providing agreement. The relevant consensus statements and level of consensus are also provided for each recommendation.

### Autoimmune neurology: the need for comprehensive care [^a3ff3606]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Initial Diagnosis

AE can produce a diverse set of symptoms that usually comprises both limbic and extralimbic dysfunction including impaired cognition and short-term memory, psychiatric symptoms, focal neurologic deficits, and altered level of consciousness. Patients may initially present to clinicians outside of neurology, such as psychiatry or internal medicine, which can delay prompt diagnosis and treatment. In 1 multisite study, AE was initially suspected in only 32% of patients despite 80% of patients presenting with symptoms and signs typical of an immune-mediated neurologic disorder. Even in tertiary care centers, there can be significant delays in diagnosis, contributing to delays in treatment and prolongation of hospital stay.

Recognition of characteristic clinical syndromes is critical given the potential reversibility of these disorders. Clinical consensus criteria for AE, published in 2016, can help with this, offering objective measures to anchor the AE diagnosis. These criteria prioritized findings on clinical history and examination, in combination with the results of commonly available tests, with the goal of promoting early recognition and treatment independent of autoantibody test results. Autoantibody testing should still be obtained, recognizing that the identification of specific disease–associated autoantibodies may establish the diagnosis of definite AE, dictate the risk of underlying malignancy, guide treatment decisions, and inform long-term prognosis, including the risk of relapse. When possible, serum and CSF should be tested for autoantibodies because the sensitivity of commercially available antibody tests can be more sensitive in CSF (i.e. NMDA receptor [NMDAR] encephalitis) and serum for others (i.e. leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 [LGI-1] encephalitis). Comprehensive but targeted autoantibody evaluations are usually preferred over single, specific autoantibody tests given the potential overlapping clinical syndromes, and the clinical significance assigned to the identification of more than 1 antibody. Clinicians should also be aware that a low titer result may also accompany other pathologically relevant results. In addition, the specificity and sensitivity can vary for different antibodies (table), so clinicians need to understand the diagnostic limitations of some autoantibody panels.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: a consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^a21a0e93]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting. Symptoms include nonspecific cognitive impairment, personality changes and changes in consciousness. Overt (symptomatic) hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis that is associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present to healthcare providers who do not have primary responsibility for management of patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, we developed a series of 'consensus points' to provide some guidance on management.

Methods

Using a modified 'Delphi' process, consensus statements were developed that summarize our recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Points on which full consensus could not be reached are also discussed.

Results

Our recommendations emphasize the role of all healthcare providers in the identification of cognitive impairment in patients with cirrhosis and provide guidance on steps that might be considered to make a diagnosis of overt hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, treatment recommendations are summarized. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy can have a significant impact on patients; however, in most circumstances identification and management of minimal hepatic encephalopathy remains the responsibility of specialists in liver diseases.

Conclusion

Our opinion statements aim to define the roles and responsibilities of all healthcare providers who at times care for patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. We suggest that these recommendations be considered further by colleagues in other disciplines and hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with cirrhosis and with a 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment through to a formal diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy.

Objective

The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute encephalopathy is broad. Imaging can help in narrowing the differential in many cases. We pictorially review the more classic MRI features of several acute toxic and acquired metabolic encephalopathies.

Conclusion

After completing this article, the reader will have knowledge of the more common imaging appearances of toxic and acquired metabolic encephalopathies, which will help in correctly identifying the cause of encephalopathy in some patients.

### Hepatic encephalopathy 2018: a clinical practice guideline by the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) [^ba0e2bed]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common, worrisome and sometimes difficult to manage complication of end-stage liver disease. HE is often recurrent, requiring multiple hospital admissions. It can have serious implications in terms of a patient's ability to perform complex tasks (for example driving), their earning capacity, their social and family roles. This guideline reviews current knowledge on HE definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment, both by general principles and by way of a summary of available drugs and treatment strategies. The quality of the published, pertinent evidence is graded, and practical recommendations are made. Where possible, these are placed within the Italian health service context, with reference to local diagnosis and management experience.
