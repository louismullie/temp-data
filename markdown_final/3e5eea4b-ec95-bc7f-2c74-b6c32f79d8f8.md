## Question

How many stages within the food supply chain can food availability and consumption be measured?

Answer Choices:
A. 10
B. 5
C. 2
D. 4

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many stages within the food supply chain can food availability and consumption be measured, with options of 10, 5, 2, or 4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which document actually enumerates the stages of the food supply chain. Then, I should verify whether that source is authoritative and whether it explicitly frames the stages as the ones where availability and consumption are measured. Next, I will count the stages and double-check for any ambiguities. Finally, I will match the count to the correct option and briefly justify why the other choices are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the source that lists the stages. The FDA educational material titled "Science our food supply: fillable high school student activity sheets" outlines the Farm-to-Table Continuum with numbered steps: 1. Source/Production of goods, 2. Processing/manufacturing, 3. Transportation, 4. Retail, 5. Table, which totals five distinct stages from production through consumption at the table.

> Wait, let me verify whether this is the right framework for measuring availability and consumption. The document is designed to help students trace the journey of food crops and identify where food safety issues and availability/consumption considerations arise, which aligns with measuring food availability and consumption across the supply chain. It explicitly presents these as the steps in the continuum, supporting the idea that these are the standard stages used for such assessments in educational and regulatory contexts.

> I should double-check the count before concluding. Listing them again: Source/Production, Processing/manufacturing, Transportation, Retail, and Table equals five stages. None of the steps are subdivided in a way that would inflate the count to 10, and there are not just 2 or 4 explicitly named stages in this schema, so the correct number here is 5.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the distractors. Option A (10) is too high for this enumeration; Option C (2) is too few; Option D (4) is close but misses the final "Table" stage, which is where consumption is actually realized. Only Option B matches the five-stage Farm-to-Table Continuum as presented in the FDA material, which is the most direct and authoritative source provided for this question.

> Final answer: B. 5.

---

The correct answer is **B. 5**. Food availability and consumption can be measured at five key stages of the food supply chain: production, processing, distribution, retail, and consumption. These stages align with the **farm-to-table continuum** used in food safety and nutrition surveillance, and are the standard framework for tracking food from origin to consumption [^1123q4g2].

## Stages of the food supply chain

The food supply chain is commonly divided into the following **five stages**:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Production | - Farming <br/> - Raising livestock <br/> - Fishing <br/> - Aquaculture <br/> - Primary production of raw food materials |
| Processing | - Transformation of raw materials into food products <br/> - Includes cleaning <br/> - Cutting <br/> - Cooking <br/> - Packaging <br/> - And preservation |
| Distribution | - Transportation <br/> - Logistics <br/> - And warehousing of food products from processing facilities to retail outlets |
| Retail | - Sale of food products to consumers through grocery stores <br/> - Markets <br/> - Restaurants <br/> - And other food service establishments |
| Consumption | - Final use of food by consumers <br/> - Including household consumption and food service consumption |

---

These stages are consistent with the **farm-to-table continuum**, which is widely used in food safety and nutrition surveillance to track food from its origin to consumption [^1123q4g2].

---

## Measurement of food availability and consumption

Food availability and consumption can be measured at each stage of the food supply chain using various **methods and indicators**:

- **Production stage**: Crop yields, livestock production, fishing quotas, and agricultural output statistics.
- **Processing stage**: Volume of processed foods, inventory levels, and production capacity utilization.
- **Distribution stage**: Transportation logistics, warehouse inventories, and supply chain efficiency metrics.
- **Retail stage**: Sales data, inventory turnover, and consumer purchasing patterns.
- **Consumption stage**: Household consumption surveys, dietary intake assessments, and nutrition surveillance data.

---

## Importance of measuring food availability and consumption

Measuring food availability and consumption at each stage of the food supply chain is **essential** for:

- **Policy development**: Informing agricultural, trade, and nutrition policies to ensure food security and public health.
- **Resource allocation**: Guiding the distribution of resources and investments across the food supply chain.
- **Monitoring and evaluation**: Assessing the effectiveness of interventions and programs aimed at improving food availability and consumption.
- **Risk management**: Identifying and addressing potential disruptions or vulnerabilities in the food supply chain.

---

## Conclusion

Food availability and consumption can be measured at **five key stages** of the food supply chain: production, processing, distribution, retail, and consumption. This framework aligns with the farm-to-table continuum and is essential for effective food policy, resource allocation, and risk management.

Prediabetes — high-risk adults: Meta-analyses reported increased regression to normal glucose regulation with vitamin D versus placebo (RR 1.48 [95% CI, 1.14–1.92] and RR 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16–1.46]). Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults with high risk for diabetes by American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria. Dosing varied across trials, 4 studies used vitamin D2, and due to this variability the panel could not recommend a specific dosage of vitamin D. Over 3 years, absolute diabetes risk reductions were 24 fewer per 1000 (systematic review) or 33 fewer per 1000 (IPD-MA), compared with 70 fewer per 1000 with metformin, noting vitamin D in trials was applied in addition to recommended lifestyle changes.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^112BGL9C]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Major cardiovascular events

There were 1336 major cardiovascular events during follow-up (vitamin D, n = 637 (6.0%); placebo, n = 699 (6.6%)). Compared with the placebo group, the rate of major cardiovascular events was lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.01), although the upper bound of the confidence interval is consistent with there being no effect (fig 2, table 2). The hazard ratio did not change with time (supplementary fig 1, supplementary table 4). The difference in the standardised cause specific cumulative incidence at five years was −5.8 events per 1000 participants (95% confidence interval −12.2 to 0.5 per 1000 participants), resulting in a number needed to treat to avoid one major cardiovascular event of 172.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^1111rS7K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3], 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], and 4β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [4β,25(OH)2D3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D2 (n = 28) or vitamin D3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D3 to D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Participants receiving vitamin D2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D3 to vitamin D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 than those receiving vitamin D3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 and 4β,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 and 1-α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^111Dxkqk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — vitamin D for adults with prediabetes: In adults with prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Technical remarks specify that lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes, and that trials primarily related to adults with high-risk prediabetes identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge). Across trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels reported that the baseline mean 25(OH)D level in the 11 trials was 12 to 28 ng/mL (30–70 nmol/L), and among trials without baseline 25(OH)D as an eligibility criterion the baseline mean level of 25(OH)D was 18 to 28 ng/mL (45–70 nmol/L).

### Vitamin D and child health: part 2 (extraskeletal and other aspects) [^117GVNaM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

Differential effects of vitamin D regimens on 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels

Figure 4a shows mean 25(OH)D2 level from day 0 to day 140 in the eight groups. Analysis of 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 showed significant effect of treatment group (p < 0.001) and baseline 25(OH)D2 level (p < 0.001) but not BMI (p = 0.18) or sex (p = 0.28). Figure 4b depicts adjusted mean (SE) 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 in the three D2 treated groups. Adjusted mean 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was significantly higher (17 and 20%) in D2 daily group compared to D2 2-weekly group (mean difference 881.5 nmol.d/L (CI, 257.0 to 1506.1, p = 0.006)) and D2 4-weekly group (mean difference 1029.2 nmol.d/L (CI, 410.5 to 1648.0, p = 0.001)), with no significant difference between the 2-weekly and 4-weekly groups (p = 0.65). In contrast, adjusted mean 25(OH)D2 AUC 7 and AUC 14 were significantly lower in the D2 daily group compared to D2 2-weekly group (mean difference −42.0 nmol.d/L (CI, −56.5 to −27.6, p < 0.001) and −38.5 nmol.d/L (CI, −70.6 to −6.5, p = 0.02), respectively) and to D2 4-weekly group (mean difference −91.4 nmol.d/L (CI, −105.7 t0 -77.2, p < 0.001) and −136.9 nmol.d/L (CI, −168.0 to −105.8, p < 0.001), respectively). Further, 25(OH)D2 AUC 7, AUC 14, and AUC 28 were significantly higher in D2 4-weekly group compared to 2-weekly group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, 25(OH)D2 AUC 7, AUC 14, and AUC 28 were significantly associated with BMI (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively) and sex (p = 0.003, p = 0.02, p = 0.046, respectively).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112p24G5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — justification for the recommendation and targeting considerations indicate that the panel favored empiric vitamin D based on moderate certainty that it lowers progression to type 2 diabetes, likely without harm. The IPD-MA suggested greatest benefit among those with baseline 25(OH)D level lower than 12 ng/mL (20 nmol/L) (HR 0.58 [95% CI, 0.35–0.97]), but overall evidence did not support the net benefit of 25(OH)D testing in adults with prediabetes followed by supplementation only in those with low levels. Vitamin D supplementation that raises 25(OH)D may further lower diabetes risk but could potentially increase adverse effects (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones), although there was no evidence of this in the IPD-MA.

### Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus / COVID-19 disease [^115tebds]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^114kvSAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes trial.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a 22-site trial that took place from October 2013 through December 2018 in the United States. The study randomly assigned 2423 adults (mean age 60 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m 2) who met at least 2 of 3 glycemic criteria for prediabetes (FG 100–125 mg/dL; 2hG 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7–6.4%) to treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and semiannually with FG and HbA1c. The trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 28 ng/mL (69 nmol/L) and 78% of participants had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL (49 nmol/L) (Table 3). During follow-up, mean serum 25(OH)D level in the vitamin D group rose to 54 ng/mL compared with 29 ng/mL in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 616 diabetes events had occurred: 293 in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.4 events vs 10.7 events per 100 person-years, respectively). In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75–1.04).

In each of these 3 studies, protocol-specified adverse events of interest (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis) were rare, and there were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^115648Jz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Do subgroup findings elicit positive signals?

Response to vitamin D depends on vitamin D status at baseline. Thus, people with higher baseline levels of blood 25(OH)D would benefit less from vitamin D supplementation than people with lower baseline levels. The high proportion of participants with adequate blood 25(OH)D levels at baseline may have prevented the detection of statistically significant differences between the vitamin D and placebo groups in the full trial cohorts. In all 3 trials, among participants with baseline blood 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL, the risk of diabetes with vitamin D supplementation was reported to be lower compared with participants with levels ≥ 20 ng/mL, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the D2d study, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in a small subgroup of participants with a baseline 25(OH)D level < 12 ng/mL (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18–0.80; p for interaction = 0.023). Results from subgroup analyses need to be interpreted cautiously partly because of the potential of a type I error (false positive) due to multiple analyses. However, given strong preexisting biologic plausibility, vitamin D supplementation may be more important in reducing diabetes risk among persons with prediabetes and low vitamin D status.

### A randomized trial of cinacalcet versus vitamin D analogs as monotherapy in secondary hyperparathyroidism (PARADIGM) [^111iUBBD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Direct comparison of cinacalcet and vitamin D analogs as monotherapies to lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels has not been undertaken.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a prospective, multicenter, phase 4, randomized, open-label study that enrolled participants from 2010 to 2012. Adult participants (n = 312) on hemodialysis with PTH > 450 pg/ml were randomized 1:1 to 12 months of treatment with either cinacalcet (n = 155) or vitamin D analogs (n = 157) to evaluate the mean percentage change in plasma PTH level (primary end point) and the proportion of participants achieving plasma PTH < 300 pg/ml or a ≥ 30% decrease in PTH (secondary end points). A preplanned analysis to determine whether there were important region-by-treatment interactions was also undertaken.

Results

Baseline mean PTH was 846 pg/ml (n = 155) for cinacalcet and 816 pg/ml (n = 157) for vitamin D analog therapy. The mean (95% confidence interval) percentage change from baseline in PTH was -12.1% (-20.0% to -4.1%) in the cinacalcet arm and -7.0% (-14.9% to 0.8%) in the vitamin D analog arm, a difference of -5.0% (-15.4% to 5.4%) (P = 0.35). Similarly, there was no difference in achievement of secondary efficacy end points between arms (19.4% and 15.3% of participants with PTH ≤ 300 pg/ml and 42.6% and 33.8% of participants had a PTH reduction > 30% in the cinacalcet and vitamin D analog arms, respectively). A prespecified analysis revealed a large treatment-by-region interaction, with nominally greater response to cinacalcet compared with vitamin D analogs in non-United States participants (US versus non-US participants, P < 0.001). Hypocalcemia was more common in the cinacalcet arm, whereas hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia occurred more often in the vitamin D analog arm.

Conclusions

Participants had similar modest reductions in PTH with either cinacalcet or vitamin D analog monotherapy over 52 weeks of treatment, but effects varied by region. Treatments differed with regard to effect on calcium and phosphorus levels.

### Odevixibat (Bylvay) [^112p7jKf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Preparation and Administration Instructions

For patients taking bile acid binding resins, take BYLVAY at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking a bile acid binding resin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Do not crush or chew capsules.
Mix the contents of the shell containing Oral Pellets into soft food or a liquid (as described below).
Discard the emptied shells. Do not let your child swallow the unopened shells containing the Oral Pellets.
Administer BYLVAY with the first morning meal.
Place a small amount (up to 2 tablespoons [30 mL]) of soft food (apple sauce, oatmeal, banana or carrot puree, chocolate or rice pudding) in a bowl. Keep the soft food at, or cooler than, room temperature.
Open the shell containing Oral Pellets and empty the contents into the bowl of soft food. Gently tap the Oral Pellet shell to ensure that all contents have been dispersed.
If the dose requires more than one shell of Oral Pellets, repeat Step 3.
Gently mix until well dispersed and administer the entire dose immediately.
Follow the dose with breast milk, infant formula, or other age-appropriate liquid.
Do not store the mixture for future use.
For patients unable to swallow soft food, see the instructions below.
Administer BYLVAY with the first morning meal.
Open the shell containing Oral Pellets and empty the contents into a small mixing cup. Gently tap the shell containing Oral Pellets to ensure that all contents have been emptied into the mixing cup.
If the dose requires more than one shell of Oral Pellets, repeat Step 2.
Add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of an age-appropriate liquid (for example, breast milk, infant formula, or water).
Let the pellets sit in the liquid for approximately 5 minutes to allow complete wetting REMINDER: The Oral Pellets will not dissolve in the liquid.
After 5 minutes, place the tip of the oral syringe completely into the mixing cup. Pull the plunger of the syringe up slowly to withdraw the liquid/pellet mixture into the syringe. Gently push the plunger down again to expel the liquid/pellet mixture back into the mixing cup. Do this 2 to 3 times to ensure complete mixing of the pellets into the liquid.
Withdraw the entire contents into the oral syringe by pulling the plunger on the end of the syringe.
Place the tip of the syringe into the front of the patient's mouth between the tongue and the side of the mouth, and then gently push the plunger down to squirt the liquid/pellet mixture between your child's tongue and the side of the mouth. Do not squirt liquid/pellet mixture in the back of the child's throat because this could cause gagging or choking.
Do not administer via a bottle or "sippy cup" because the Oral Pellets will not pass through the opening. The oral pellets will not dissolve in liquid.
Follow the dose with breast milk, infant formula, or other age-appropriate liquid.
If any pellet/liquid mixture remains in the mixing cup, repeat Step 7 and Step 8 until the entire dose has been administered.
Check the child's mouth to make sure all of the liquid/pellet mixture has been swallowed.
Take in the morning with a meal.
Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water.
Alternatively, for patients unable to swallow the capsules whole, BYLVAY capsules may be opened, and sprinkled and mixed with a small amount of soft food, or mixed with an age-appropriate liquid. Follow directions above for oral pellets to prepare and administer such a mixture.

### Printing two-dimensional gallium phosphate out of liquid metal [^11216m5y]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Gallium phosphate (specially α-GaPO 4), is a well-known piezoelectric material that is iso-structural with α-quartz. The crystal structure of gallium phosphate (Fig. 1a, b) exhibits trigonal symmetry with cell parameters of a = 4.87 Å and c = 11.05 Å and γ = 120°. It is considered superior to quartz for several technical applications, due to a significantly higher thermal stability, comparable quality factor (Q) and a higher piezoelectric coefficient. Moreover, the α-phase of bulk GaPO 4 is stable up to 930 °C and thus the material can be very promising for high-temperature sensors, offering a nearly temperature independent piezo effect. Despite these unique properties, GaPO 4 has been essentially overlooked as a 2D piezoelectric material and the structural and electronic properties of ultra-thin GaPO 4 are still unknown.

Ball and stick representation of the synthesised GaPO 4 crystal: a top view and b side view showing an out-of-plane structure exhibiting unit cell parameter c = 11.05 Å. c Schematic illustration of the van der Waals 2D printing technique of Ga 2 O 3 nanosheet from liquid metal gallium. d Schematic setup for the chemical vapour phase reaction system used for synthesising GaPO 4 nanosheets

GaPO 4 does not naturally crystallise in a stratified structure, eliminating the choice of common exfoliation techniques, and hence other processes must be developed to synthesise it –. Moreover, the deposition of high quality, defect free single crystal GaPO 4 is crucial, and so far, no report has addressed the growth of wafer-scale 2D GaPO 4 films. Hence, the synthesis and deposition of large-area, high quality and homogeneous ultra-thin GaPO 4 nanosheets will have a major impact on 2D piezotronics.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^113uxCYa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in the D2/D3 group, 25(OH)D2 level increased to about one third to one half the levels in the three D2 treated groups (Fig. 4a, however, 25(OH)D3 did not increase (Fig. 4c. Further, in the three D2 treated groups, 25(OH)D3 level progressively and consistently decreased over the course of the study (Fig. 4c. It declined from a mean of 39.2 nmol/L at day 0 to 33.0, 31.6, 28.6, and 22.9 at days 7, 14, 28, and 140, respectively. To further explore the effect of D2 treatment on 25(OH)D3 level, we examined the correlation between the changes (day 140 minus day 0) in 25(OH)D3 level and 25(OH)D2 level in the three D2 treated groups. As shown in Fig. 5a, there was significant negative correlation (r = −0.48, p < 0.001). However, the change in 25(OH)D3 level also correlated negatively with day zero 25(OH)D3 level (r = −0.58, p < 0.001) and with day 140 25(OH)D levels (r = −0.32, p = 0.003). Of note, in one participant who started with measurable 25(OH)D2 level and received D3 2-weekly, 25(OH)D2 level decreased by 16.4 nmol/L between days 0 and 140 (Fig. 5b). In comparison, the mean decrease in 25(OH)D3 level in the three D2 treated groups was 16.4 nmol/L (CI, 14.0 to 18.7, p < 0.001), suggesting that D3 treatment may also induce a decline in 25(OH)D2 level of the same magnitude.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111crY8T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

Influence of vitamin D 3 on its own metabolism

Having characterized the effects of vitamin D 2 on metabolism of vitamin D 3, we proceeded to conduct a second set of pairwise before and after statistical analyses to evaluate the effects of vitamin D 3 on the same biochemical parameters in a separate group of 24 individuals who received four monthly doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D 3. Results of these analyses (Table 2) show that administration of vitamin D 3 elevated serum concentrations of vitamin D 3 (80.0% increase, P = 0.03), 25(OH)D 3 (110.0% increase, P < 0.001; Fig. 3), 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 (165.5% increase, P < 0.001), 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 (66.6% increase, P = 0.005), and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 (214.5% increase, P = 0.02). Administration of vitamin D 3 also increased the ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 (32.6% increase, P = 0.006) but had no statistically significant effect on ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to vitamin D 3 (P = 0.09), 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 (P = 0.06), or 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 (P = 0.06).

### Vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115esJi]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are recommended for the prevention of fracture, but previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting results, with uncertainty about optimal doses and regimens for supplementation and their overall effectiveness.

Objective

To assess the risks of fracture associated with differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in observational studies and the risks of fracture associated with supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium in RCTs.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and other RCT databases were searched from database inception until December 31, 2018. Searches were performed between July 2018 and December 2018.

Study Selection

Observational studies involving at least 200 fracture cases and RCTs enrolling at least 500 participants and reporting at least 10 incident fractures were included. Randomized clinical trials compared vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium with control.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two researchers independently extracted data according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and assessed possible bias. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Data extraction and synthesis took place between July 2018 and June 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Any fracture and hip fracture.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (39 141 participants, 6278 fractures, 2367 hip fractures), each increase of 10.0 ng/mL (ie, 25 nmol/L) in 25 (OH)D concentration was associated with an adjusted RR for any fracture of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.96) and an adjusted RR for hip fracture of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.86). A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (34 243 participants, 2843 fractures, 740 hip fractures) of vitamin D supplementation alone (daily or intermittent dose of 400–30 000 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 8.4 ng/mL) did not find a reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98–1.14) or hip fracture (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98–1.32), but these trials were constrained by infrequent intermittent dosing, low daily doses of vitamin D, or an inadequate number of participants. In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (49 282 participants, 5449 fractures, 730 hip fractures) of combined supplementation with vitamin D (daily doses of 400–800 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 9.2 ng/mL) and calcium (daily doses of 1000–1200 mg) found a 6% reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99) and a 16% reduced risk of hip fracture (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone was associated with reduced risk of fracture, but daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium was a more promising strategy.

The study randomly assigned 1256 adults (mean age 61 years, mean BMI 24 kg/m 2) who met the impaired glucose tolerance criterion for prediabetes (2hG 140–199 mg/dL) and had no diabetes (FG < 126 mg/dL and HbA1c < 6.5%) to treatment with 0.75 mg of eldecalcitol (an analog of the active form of vitamin D 3) daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and quarterly with FG and HbA1c. Information on mean baseline blood 25(OH)D level and proportion of participants with a level ≥ 20 ng/mL is not yet available. Based on results published in abstract form, after a median follow-up of 2.8 years, 121 diabetes events had occurred: 57 in the vitamin D group and 64 in the placebo group. In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.87; 95% CI: 0.68–1.09).

### Prognostic and therapeutic role of vitamin D in COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115BkYrS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency may increase the susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to determine the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and susceptibility to COVID-19, its severity, mortality, and role of vitamin D in its treatment.

Methods

We searched CINAHL, Cochrane library, EMBASE, PubMED, Scopus, and Web of Science up to May 30, 2021, for observational studies on association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and susceptibility to COVID-19, severe disease, and death among adults, and, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vitamin D treatment against standard care or placebo, in improving severity or mortality among adults with COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies and AUB-KQ1 Cochrane tool for RCTs. Study-level data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 and R (v4.1.0). Heterogeneity was determined by I2 and sources were explored through prespecified sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regressions.

Results

Of 1877 search results, 76 studies satisfying eligibility criteria were included. Seventy-two observational studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1 976 099). Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increased the odds of developing COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.46; 95% CI, 1.28–1.65; P < 0.0001; I2 = 92%), severe disease (OR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52–2.38; P < 0.0001; I2 = 81%), and death (OR 2.07; 95% CI, 1.28–3.35; P = 0.003; I2 = 73%). The 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were lower in individuals with COVID-19 compared with controls (mean difference [MD] -3.85 ng/mL; 95% CI, -5.44 to -2.26; P ≤ 0.0001), in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls with nonsevere COVID-19 (MD -4.84 ng/mL; 95% CI, -7.32 to -2.35; P = 0.0001) and in nonsurvivors compared with survivors (MD -4.80 ng/mL; 95% CI, -7.89 to -1.71; P = 0.002). The association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and death was insignificant when studies with high risk of bias or studies reporting unadjusted effect estimates were excluded. Risk of bias and heterogeneity were high across all analyses. Discrepancies in timing of vitamin D testing, definitions of severe COVID-19, and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency partly explained the heterogeneity. Four RCTs were widely heterogeneous precluding meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Multiple observational studies involving nearly 2 million adults suggest vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency increases susceptibility to COVID-19 and severe COVID-19, although with a high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Association with mortality was less robust. Heterogeneity in RCTs precluded their meta-analysis.

### Guidelines for family-centered care in the neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU [^114GooW9]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ICU family-centered care — psychologist consultation (PICO 4.3) notes limited access and targeted evidence; psychology consultation service provision ranges from 4% in the United Kingdom and United States to 29% in Australia for ICU patients, and in one European study 37% of relatives had access to psychologists. Only three publications describing two interventions were considered, all assessing mothers of preterm neonates in NICUs. One randomized trial compared 36 mothers supported by a psychologist during hospitalization with 23 mothers receiving psychologist support plus additional reading and video materials, with the additional-materials group showing more favorable anxiety at follow up. Another randomized trial compared 43 mothers receiving general support to 62 mothers receiving targeted trauma-focused CBT; targeted sessions improved all spheres of evaluated outcomes including Davidson Trauma Scale, Beck Anxiety, and Beck Depression Inventory, with outcomes described at 4–5 weeks and maintenance of improved outcomes at 6 months.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^115HV2PP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to evaluate the influence of vitamin D 2 on circulating concentrations of parent vitamin D 3 and its dihydroxylated metabolite 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 in addition to serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2 and 25(OH)D 3. We found that administration of vitamin D 2 exerted a greater inhibitory effect than administration of vitamin D 3 on mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 in the circulation. We also observed that vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 increased the mean 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio to a similar extent, and that neither form of vitamin D had a statistically significant effect on the mean serum 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio. By contrast with findings of a recently published study, we found that administration of vitamin D 3 did not suppress serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2, nor did it influence mean serum 25(OH)D 2 -to-vitamin D 2 ratio. Administration of vitamin D 2 resulted in an increase in the mean 25(OH)D 2 -to-D 2 ratio.

### Safety and tolerability of high-dose daily vitamin dsupplementation in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study-a randomized trial in persons with prediabetes [^113oT7nc]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

A total of 8304 AEs occurred during follow-up. The incidence rate of total AEs was lower in the vitamin D 3 group (4039; 116.1 events per 100 person-years) compared to the placebo group (4265; 123.6 events per 100 person years) (IRR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.90, 0.98) (Table 3). A total of 529 SAEs occurred during follow-up. The incidence rate of SAEs was not different between the vitamin D 3 (260 events; 7.47 per 100 person-years) and placebo groups (269; 7.80 per 100 person-years) (IRR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.81, 1.14). The majority of SAEs were for hospitalization and there was no statistically significant difference among the treatment groups (IRR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.79, 1.12) (Table 3). Supplementary Tables 2, 3, and 4 provide additional data for total AEs and SAEs by treatment group using an end organ classification. The vitamin D 3 group had fewer AEs and SAEs for injury and musculoskeletal events.

Adherence to the intervention was high (84.1% of prescribed pills were taken) and a similar proportion of participants in the vitamin D 3 group (12.1%) and placebo group (10.3%) stopped trial pills (difference, 1.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.7, 4.3). There was no significant difference between the proportions of participants who stopped study pills for any reason, including due to AEs or due to participant choice (17.5% in the vitamin D group vs. 16.0% in the placebo group). There was no significant difference between the proportions of participants who stopped study pills due to an AE: overall, 58 (4.8%) participants in the vitamin D group stopped trial pills due to an AE, including abnormal safety labs, compared to 46 (3.8%) in the placebo group (difference in proportions for vitamin D vs. placebo, 0.9% [95% CI, −0.6, 2.6%]) (Table 4).

### Vitamin D and risk for type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data from 3 randomized clinical trials [^112wWTvn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Purpose

To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022.

Study Selection

Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes.

Data Extraction

The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Data Synthesis

Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol reduced risk for diabetes by 76% (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.16 to 0.36]), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.16 to 1.46]). There was no evidence of difference in the rate ratios for adverse events (kidney stones: 1.17 [CI, 0.69 to 1.99]; hypercalcemia: 2.34 [CI, 0.83 to 6.66]; hypercalciuria: 1.65 [CI, 0.83 to 3.28]; death: 0.85 [CI, 0.31 to 2.36]).

Limitations

Studies of people with prediabetes do not apply to the general population. Trials may not have been powered for safety outcomes.

Conclusion

In adults with prediabetes, vitamin D was effective in decreasing risk for diabetes.

Primary Funding Source

None. (PROSPERO: CRD42020163522).

### Calcitriol [^115Xnc8D]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

Calcitriol is rapidly absorbed from the intestine. Peak serum concentrations (above basal values) were reached within 3 to 6 hours following oral administration of single doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mcg of calcitriol. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mcg, mean serum concentrations of calcitriol rose from a baseline value of 40.0 ± 4.4 (SD) pg/mL to 60.0 ± 4.4 pg/mL at 2 hours, and declined to 53.0 ± 6.9 at 4 hours, 50 ± 7.0 at 8 hours, 44 ± 4.6 at 12 hours, and 41.5 ± 5.1 at 24 hours.

Following multiple-dose administration, serum calcitriol levels reached steady-state within 7 days.

Distribution

Calcitriol is approximately 99.9% bound in blood. Calcitriol and other vitamin D metabolites are transported in blood, by an alpha-globulin vitamin D binding protein. There is evidence that maternal calcitriol may enter the fetal circulation. Calcitriol is transferred into human breast milk at low levels (i.e., 2.2 ± 0.1 pg/mL).

### Associations between change in total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D with 24, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^117JcNCy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

The physiologic role of free 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in humans is unclear.

Objective

To assess whether rise in total vs free 25(OH)D is associated with change in downstream biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target cells in kidney and parathyroid: 24,25-dihyroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)2D] and PTH, respectively.

Design

16-week randomized controlled trial.

Intervention

60 μg (2400 IU)/d of D3 or 20 μg/d of 25(OH)D3.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

35 adults age ≥ 18 years with 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL.

Main Outcome Measures

24,25(OH)2D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and PTH.

Results

At baseline, participants [D3 and 25(OH)D3 groups combined] were 35.1 ± 10.6 years. Mean total 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and PTH were 16.6 ng/mL, 4.6 pg/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 37.2 pg/mL, respectively. From 0 to 4 weeks, rise in only free 25(OH)D was associated with a concurrent 24,25(OH)2D increase [P = 0.03, adjusted for change in 1,25(OH)2D and supplementation regimen] and PTH decrease (P = 0.01, adjusted for change in calcium and supplementation regimen). Between 4 and 8 weeks, and again from 8 to 16 weeks, rises in free and total 25(OH)D were associated with 24,25(OH)2D increase; in contrast, rise in neither total nor free 25(OH)D was associated with PTH decrease during these time periods.

Conclusions

Early rise in free 25(OH)D during treatment of vitamin D deficiency was more strongly associated with changes in biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target kidney and parathyroid cells, suggesting a physiologic role of free 25(OH)D in humans.

### Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) [^114NLHVt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Administration Instructions

Food may affect EPIDIOLEX levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consistent dosing of EPIDIOLEX with respect to meals is recommended to reduce variability in cannabidiol plasma exposure.

Calibrated measuring devices (1 mL and 5 mL oral syringes) will be provided and are recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.

Oral administration is recommended. When necessary, EPIDIOLEX can be enterally administered via silicone feeding tubes, such as nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. The recommended volume for flushing (with room temperature drinking water) after each dose is approximately 5 times the priming volume of the tube. The flushing volume may need to be modified in patients with fluid restrictions. Do not use with tubes made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane and avoid use of silicone nasogastric tubes with short lengths and narrow diameters (e.g., less than 50 cm and less than 5 FR).

Discard any unused EPIDIOLEX remaining 12 weeks after first opening the bottle [see How Supplied/ Storage and Handling (16.2)].

2.5 Discontinuation of EPIDIOLEX

When discontinuing EPIDIOLEX, the dose should be decreased gradually. As with most antiepileptic drugs, abrupt discontinuation should be avoided when possible, to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

2.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Dose adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It may be necessary to have slower dose titration in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment than in patients without hepatic impairment (see Table 1).

EPIDIOLEX does not require dose adjustment in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment.

### Alternative protein sources: science powered startups to fuel food innovation [^113hRC8Z]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

New technologies and discoveries continue to fuel the field of alternative protein sources. Alternative protein sources used to fabricate meat, fish and diary food products can help to address food security challenges and mitigate environmental issues, by significantly reducing emissions and requiring far less land. For example, based on a life cycle assessment, plant-based meat can cut emissions by 90 percent, and use 99 percent less land and water compared to conventional meat.

The current alternative proteins sources include insect-, fungi- and plant-based proteins and cell-based proteins grown from animal cells in the form of cultivated meat and fish. Producing food from alternative proteins has made a big leap forward in the past decade with plant-, fungi- and insect-based food available in grocery shops and food made from meat substitutes being served in restaurants. However, there are still a number of challenges to overcome before these products will become a commodity accessible to everyone. The main challenges (Fig. 5) include consumer acceptance driven by their ability to mimic traditional food in terms of texture, taste and appearance; affordability due to high cost associated with a complex technological process and its scalability as well as raw materials cost and a development of regulatory framework to enable market accessibility that requires more research to demonstrate their long-term safety profile and potential health risks.

Fig. 5
Alternative proteins food: mass market challenges and approaches to tackle them.

The main challenges for alternative proteins food to become a commodity could be divided into three groups: (1) Affordability, (2) Acceptability and (3) Accessibility that form 3As framework. Affordability challenge is driven by high cost associated with a complex technological process and its scalability as well as raw materials cost. Acceptability challenge deals with consumer acceptance of alternative protein proteins products and their ability to mimic traditional food in terms of texture, taste, and appearance. Accessibility challenge is ability to place these products on the market and rely on a regulatory framework that is in a development stage and requires more research to demonstrate their long-term safety profile and potential health risks. Multi-dimensional efforts are being put in place to address these challenges that include interdisciplinary and integrated research, new partnerships and global alliances and continuous investment from both private and public sources. Specific examples of these activities are presented for each of the 3As challenges.

### Calcitriol 0.25 mcg (calcitriol) [^111qod85]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Absorption

Calcitriol is rapidly absorbed from the intestine. Peak serum concentrations (above basal values) were reached within 3 to 6 hours following oral administration of single doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mcg of Calcitriol. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mcg, mean serum concentrations of calcitriol dose from a baseline value of 40.0 ± 4.4 (SD) pg/mL to 60.0 ± 4.4 pg/mL at 2 hours, and declined to 53.0 ± 6.9 at 4 hours, 50 ± 7.0 at 8 hours, 44 ± 4.6 at 12 hours, and 41.5 ± 5.1 at 24 hours.

Following multiple-dose administration, serum calcitriol levels reached steady-state within 7 days.

Distribution

Calcitriol is approximately 99.9% bound in blood. Calcitriol and other vitamin D metabolites are transported in blood, by an alpha-globulin vitamin D binding protein.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^112D3B5M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### Effect of mobile food environments on fast food visits [^111RmmM8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the first strategy (Food Swamp intervention), we select the areas with the largest (average) values of ϕ, i.e. the areas where FFO predominate. For comparison and to resemble prior food desert interventions around home neighborhoods, in our second strategy (Low Food Access intervention), we select the areas that have the largest values of ϕ and are classified by the USDA as food deserts (both low-income and low-supermarket-access). The third strategy (Food Hotspots intervention) is implemented by selecting the areas where most FO visit decisions are made. However, these strategies do not incorporate individual preferences or susceptibility to food environments. Thus, in our fourth strategy (Behavior-Environment intervention), we select areas Ω as the top areas ranked by Δ FFO (Ω) in Eq. (2), which includes not only the context but also the individual preferences of people deciding in those contexts. Figure 4 A shows the relationship between the change in FFO visits Δ FFO (Ω) and the average context ϕ in the different areas (census tracts) in our cities. The figure illustrates the dependence between these two variables, but there is still significant variability. For the same average of ϕ, we have areas where the change in Δ FFO (Ω) spans two orders of magnitude. In this representation, our Food Swamp and Behavior-Environment interventions are very easy to interpret. They consist of choosing the rightmost (greatest change in context) or topmost (greatest change in FFO visits) areas, respectively. In the case of Food Swamps and Low Food Access interventions, we can see those strategies choose areas Ω in which Δ FFO (Ω) is small because not many decisions are made (Low Food Access) or because users are less affected by the FFO environment in those areas (Food Swamps). The Food Hotspots intervention chooses areas where the most FO decisions are made, but without considering whether users are affected by the FFO environment. As a result, the total effect of the four strategies is very different; see Fig. 4 B. Overall, the Behavior-Environment intervention would be 1.93 × to 3.85 × times more efficient in decreasing FFO visits than interventions that used only the FFO context where decisions are made or around the home neighborhood. In relative terms, by changing one hundred FFO (0.22% of the total), our Behavior-Environment intervention could avert around 0.56% of the visits to FFO, while other strategies could only affect 0.29% of those visits at most. If we scale these numbers to the total population, our Behavior-Environment could avert around 719k visits to FFO in 6 months, compared with only 442k at most in the other interventions. Furthermore, the impact of the interventions is predominantly independent of income (see Fig. 4 B), health conditions (see Supplementary Note 9), or particular city (see Supplementary Note 10), and thus its effect does not concentrate on particular groups or geographies. For example, we found that our Behavior-Environment intervention is still 2 × to 2.5 × more effective than the rest of the interventions at targeting decisions made by high obesity or diabetes prevalence groups (see Supplementary Note 9).

Swirl the container gently to keep the particles from settling, and administer the suspension before it settles. The mixture will have a bitter taste.
Rinse the container with 15 mL of drinking water and administer the rinse water.
Repeat Step 3. Visually confirm that no particles are left in the container. If particles remain, repeat Step 3.

Administration of Dispersed Tablets through a Nasogastric (NG) or Orogastric (OG) Tube

Remove the cap (if applicable) and plunger out of a 50 or 60 mL catheter-tip compatible syringe or equivalent. Add two tablets into the syringe body and place the plunger back in the syringe. Only two tablets can be administered via NG or OG tube at a time.
Draw 30 mL of drinking water (other liquids have not been tested) into the syringe and hold the syringe with the tip pointing upward. Pull the plunger further to a higher volume position to have some air space in the syringe. Place the cap back on the syringe (if applicable). Shake the syringe well (careful not to spill the contents) for about 30 to 45 seconds or until the tablets are completely dispersed.
Once the tablets are completely dispersed in the syringe, remove the cap from the syringe again (if applicable) and attach the syringe to the NG or OG tube and administer the dispersion before it settles.
Draw 15 mL of water using the same syringe and flush through the same NG or OG tube.
Repeat Step 4 and make sure no particles are left in the syringe by visual inspection. If particles remain, repeat Step 4.
For doses of 800 mg (four 200 mg tablets) and 1,200 mg (six 200 mg tablets) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)], repeat Steps 1–5 until prescribed dose is reached. The same syringe, NG or OG tube can be used.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney function in adults with prediabetes: a secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^115B84j3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration has been associated with higher levels of proteinuria and lower levels of eGFR in observational studies. In the Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study, we investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on kidney outcomes in a population with prediabetes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Overweight/obese adults with high risk for type 2 diabetes (defined by meeting two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes) were randomized to vitamin D 3 4000 IU per day versus placebo. Median duration of treatment was 2.9 years (interquartile range 2.0–3.5 years). Kidney outcomes included (1) worsening in Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk score (low, moderate, high, very high) on two consecutive follow-up visits after the baseline visit and (2) mean changes in eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).

Results

Among 2166 participants (mean age 60 years, body mass index 32 kg/m 2, serum 25(OH)D 28 ng/ml, eGFR 87 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, UACR 11 mg/g, 79% with hypertension), 10% had moderate, high, or very high KDIGO risk score. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years, there were 28 cases of KDIGO worsening in the vitamin D group and 30 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52 to 1.52]). Mean difference in eGFR from baseline was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.3 to -0.7) in the vitamin D group and -0.1 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -0.4 to 0.2) in the placebo group; between-group difference was -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.6). Mean difference in UACR was 2.7 mg/g (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.3) in the vitamin D group and 2.0 (95% CI, 0.5 to 3.6) in the placebo group; between-group difference was 0.7 mg/g (95% CI, -1.5 to 2.9).

Conclusions

Among persons with prediabetes, who were not preselected on the basis of serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D supplementation did not affect progression of KDIGO risk scores and did not have a meaningful effect on change in UACR or eGFR.

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with abdominal infection: the INSPIRE 4 cluster randomized clinical trial [^111V8vhK]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study INSPIRE 4 was published by Shruti K Gohil and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute appendicitis, Acute cholecystitis, Acute cholangitis, Acute diverticulitis and Intra-abdominal abscess. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the trial question was: what is the role of computerized provider order entry stewardship bundle in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection? In the INSPIRE 4 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the population was: 105004 patients (62101 female, 42903 male). The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics for abdominal infection. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the interventions were: n = 50620 CPOE stewardship bundle (computerized patient order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics coupled with clinician education and feedback) n = 54384 routine stewardship (educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy (169.3 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 19.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.66). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in vancomycin days of therapy (29.7 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 11.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37) Significant increase in reduction in antipseudomonal days of therapy (131.8 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 5.6 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.78). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in length of stay, days to ICU transfers. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection, CPOE stewardship bundle was superior to routine stewardship with respect to reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy.

### Maternal vitamin D ₃ supplementation at 50 μ g / D protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation [^114P9uS9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown.

Objectives

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (> 30, > 40, > 50, and > 75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

Design

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

Results

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-μg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-μg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-μg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-μg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (viread) [^112JfaBh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 	Recommended Oral Powder Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older Weighing at Least 10 kg

The recommended dosage of VIREAD oral powder in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older weighing at least 10 kg who are unable to swallow a tablet is 8 mg of TDF per kg of body weight (up to a maximum of 300 mg) once daily administered as oral powder (see Table 2). Weight should be monitored periodically and the VIREAD dose adjusted accordingly.

VIREAD oral powder should be measured only with the supplied dosing scoop. One level scoop delivers 1 g of powder, which contains 40 mg of TDF. VIREAD oral powder should be mixed in a container with 2 to 4 ounces of soft food not requiring chewing (e.g., applesauce, baby food, yogurt). The entire mixture should be ingested immediately to avoid a bitter taste. Do not administer VIREAD oral powder in a liquid as the powder may float on top of the liquid even after stirring. Further patient instructions on how to administer VIREAD oral powder with the supplied dosing scoop are provided in the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

2.4	Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment

Significant increase in drug exposures occurred when VIREAD was administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min). Table 3 provides dosage interval adjustment for patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment of VIREAD tablets 300 mg is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

No data are available to make dosage recommendations in patients with creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min who are not on hemodialysis.

No data are available to make dosage recommendations in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

### Vitamin-D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25 (OH) D3 level is a reciprocal phenomenon: a randomized controlled trial [^115b31oE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin-D2 (D2) treatment has been associated with a decrease in 25-hydroxy (25(OH)) vitamin-D3 (D3) level, suggesting that D3 treatment would be preferred to raise total 25(OH) vitamin-D (D) level. We postulated that D2 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level is related to the increase in 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific, and thus there would be a similar D3 treatment-associated decrease in 25(OH)D2 level.

Methods

Fifty volunteers were block-randomized to 50,000IU D2 or placebo orally once (study-1) and fifty volunteers received 50,000IU D2 orally once and 4days later block-randomized to 50,000IU D3 or placebo orally once (study-2). Interventions were concealed from volunteers and research coordinators and blindly-administered. Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels were blindly-determined at baseline and days 14, 28, 42, and 56, post-randomization by high performance liquid chromatography assay. Results of 97 participants were analyzed. Primary outcome measure was day-28 D2-associated change in 25(OH)D3 level in study-1 and D3-associated change in 25(OH)D2 level in study-2, adjusted for baseline levels.

Results

Mean (95% confidence interval) difference between the active and placebo arms in the decrease in day-28 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 25(OH)D2 (study-2) levels was 13.2 (9.7 to 16.6) and 9.8 (5.2 to 14.4) nmol/L, respectively. Corresponding differences at day-56 were 10.8 (6.8 to 14.8) and 1.7 (-7.6 to 11.1) nmol/L, respectively. The difference between the placebo and active arms in area-under-the-curve at day-28 (AUC 28) and day-56 (AUC 56) were 262.3 (197.8 to 326.7) and 605.1 (446.3 to 784.0) for 25(OH)D3 (study-1) and 282.2 (111.2 to 453.3) and 431.2 (179.3 to 683.2) nmol.d/L for 25(OH)D2 (study-2), respectively. There were significant correlations between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels in study-1 (rho = -0.79, p < 0.001) and study-2 (rho = -0.36, p = 0.01), and between day-28 changes in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level in study-2 (rho = -0.42, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Compared to placebo, D3 treatment is associated with a decrease in 25(OH)D2 level similar in magnitude to D2-treatment associated decrease in 25(OH)D3 level; however, the D3-placebo difference in 25(OH)D2 level is shorter-lasting. Changes in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels are correlated with each other and with baseline 25 (OH) D levels, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism.

### Reactive halogens increase the global methane lifetime and radiative forcing in the 21st century [^1123Aywt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Spatial patterns of halogen-mediated change in CH 4 loss rate averaged during the 21st century for RCP6.0 scenario.

a Surface CH 4 loss (yr −1) without halogens (noHAL). b Halogen-mediated changes in CH 4 loss (yr −1) at the surface. c Same as (b) but in percentage. d Zonal distribution of CH 4 loss (yr −1) without halogens (noHAL) showing the largest CH 4 loss near-surface level in tropics. e Zonal distribution of halogen-mediated change in CH 4 loss (yr −1). f Same as (e) but in percentage. Results for the RCP8.5 scenario are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.

Figure 3 shows the time series of annual global CH 4 loss and its changes due to reactive halogens during the 21st century for both RCP scenarios. Regardless of including or neglecting RHS in the model, CH 4 loss shows a consistent decreasing trend for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 in the 21st century. This is associated with the decreasing trend of the tropospheric OH abundance (Supplementary Fig. 6), as a result of increasing trend of CH 4 emissions in the 21st century. The consideration of RHS in the CESM model, in active connection with the climate system, leads to a significant reduction in tropospheric O 3 (Supplementary Fig. 2) and therefore OH (Supplementary Fig. 3), mostly due to iodine and bromine (ref.), but a large enhancement in Cl atom levels (Supplementary Fig. 4) averaged over the entire 21st century. Although the tropospheric OH burden is reduced by RHS, the contribution of the dominant OH-driven pathway to the total CH 4 loss in all simulations is one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Cl-driven channel (Fig. 3a). The consideration of halogens leads to significant changes in both CH 4 loss channels (Fig. 3b, c). The enhancement of Cl-driven CH 4 loss is only a fraction of the large reduction in OH-driven CH 4 loss due to the combined halogens, thereby resulting in a net reduction of the total CH 4 loss (Fig. 3b, c).

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^114Di1YQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D 3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.

Results

A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9 ± 23.2 ng per milliliter (117 ± 58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4 ± 5.6 ng per milliliter (28 ± 14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P = 0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality.

Conclusions

Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D 3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

### Validation of the 4AT, a new instrument for rapid delirium screening: a study in 234 hospitalised older people [^116xYHiv]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "4 'A's Test (4AT) for delirium screening" for delirium, postoperative delirium and ICU delirium.

The 4 A's Test, also known as the 4AT, is a clinical calculator used for delirium screening in patients. It is applicable to a wide range of patient populations, particularly those in acute hospital settings, intensive care units, and long-term care facilities. The 4AT is designed to quickly and accurately identify patients who may be suffering from delirium, a common and serious cognitive disorder. The test assesses four areas: alertness, AMT4 (a brief memory test), attention, and acute change or fluctuating course. The 4AT is particularly useful because it does not require any special training to administer and can be completed in under 2 minutes. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, making it a versatile tool for healthcare professionals.

The 4 'A's Test (4AT) is a straightforward and efficient tool used to screen for delirium and assess cognitive impairment. It involves evaluating four key components: alertness, cognitive orientation (AMT 4), attention, and recent changes in cognitive state. Each response is given a specific score that contributes to an overall total, which informs the interpretation of the patient's condition.

- **Alertness**: Evaluate the patient's alertness and categorize it as:

- **Normal**: Score 0
- **Mild sleepiness for less than 10 seconds after waking, then normal**: Score 0
- **Clearly abnormal**: Score 4

- **AMT 4 (Cognitive Orientation)**: Ask the patient to state their age, date of birth, the name of the hospital or place, and the current year. Score based on the number of mistakes:

- **No mistakes**: Score 0
- **1 mistake**: Score 1
- **Two or more mistakes, or if untestable**: Score 2

- **Attention**: Ask the patient to list the months of the year in reverse order, starting from December:

- **Lists 7 or more months correctly**: Score 0
- **Starts but lists fewer than 7 months, or refuses to start**: Score 1
- **Untestable or cannot start because unwell**: Score 2

- **Acute Change or Fluctuating Course**: Determine if the patient has experienced an acute change or fluctuation in mental state over the last two weeks, which persists in the last 24 hours:

- **No**: Score 0
- **Yes**: Score 4

Once all the responses are scored, sum these scores to get a total between 0 and 12. This total is then interpreted:

- A total score of 0 indicates that delirium or severe cognitive impairment is unlikely.
- Scores between 1 and 3 suggest possible cognitive impairment.
- A score of 4 or higher indicates possible delirium and/or cognitive impairment.

- recent fracture (within the past 12 months)

- fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy

- fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (such as long-term corticosteroids)

- multiple fractures

- very low T-score (such as < -3.0)

- high risk for falls or history of injurious falls

- very high fracture probability by FRAX (such as major osteoporosis fracture > 30%, hip fracture > 4.5%) or other validated fracture risk algorithm. (Grade B; BEL 1).

### Insulin lispro (Humalog) [^115VyNPe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including HUMALOG. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMALOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between HUMALOG and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.

Do not transfer HUMALOG U-200 from the HUMALOG prefilled pens to a syringe. The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Global atmospheric methane uptake by upland tree woody surfaces [^1154QDX5]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fig. 3
Empirical model of CH 4 uptake versus MAT.

Mean CH 4 uptake recorded in the uppermost tree sampling position above the forest floor in each of the upland forest locations, plotted against MAT for each site. The regression equation is CH 4 uptake = −2.179 MAT + 6.837. The grey shading represents the 95% confidence interval.

Source Data

We then scaled estimated CH 4 uptake across the globe based on tree canopy cover and mean climatology. Finally, we aggregated the CH 4 uptake across biomes to determine per-biome values (Extended Data Table 3). A first approach that excludes any CH 4 uptake from woody surfaces more than 4 m above the forest floor suggests a highly conservative uptake estimate of 1.7 Tg of CH 4 yr −1. However, considering all woody tree surfaces leads to a mean total global woody surface CH 4 sink estimate of 37.2 Tg of CH 4 yr −1 (24.6–49.9 Tg of CH 4 yr −1), with the range demonstrating uncertainty associated with the land surface products used, which offer very different global woody surface area estimates (Extended Data Table 4) or whether woody shrubs are included ('high' estimate, Extended Data Table 3). Despite this uncertainty, the size of this global CH 4 woody surface uptake is similar to that of the global soils sink (30–40 Tg of CH 4 yr −1), thus far the only other characterized terrestrial CH 4 sink in the Earth system. We estimate the total global aboveground woody surface area to be 143 (± 59) million km 2 (Extended Data Table 4), approximately equal to total global land surface area (149 million km 2), but, unlike the global land (soil) surface, this area of CH 4 exchange will vary with changing forest cover. Hence, woody surface extent and architecture adds a poorly appreciated structural third dimension for exchange between the land biosphere and atmosphere.

### Pathways to "5-a-day": modeling the health impacts and environmental footprints of meeting the target for fruit and vegetable intake in the United Kingdom [^111f277N]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fruit and vegetable consumption in the United Kingdom is currently well below recommended levels, with a significant associated public health burden. The United Kingdom has committed to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, and this transition will require shifts towards plant-based diets.

Objective

The aim was to quantify the health effects, environmental footprints, and cost associated with 4 different pathways to meeting the United Kingdom's "5-a-day" recommendation for fruit and vegetable consumption.

Methods

Dietary data based on 18,006 food diaries from 4528 individuals participating in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2012/13–2016/17) constituted the baseline diet. Linear programming was used to model the hypothetical adoption of the 5-a-day (400 g) recommendation, which was assessed according to 4 pathways differing in their prioritization of fruits versus vegetables and UK-produced versus imported varieties. Increases in fruit and vegetable consumption were substituted for consumption of sweet snacks and meat, respectively. Changes in life expectancy were assessed using the IOMLIFET life table model. Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs), blue water footprint (WF), and total diet cost were quantified for each 5-a-day diet.

Results

Achieving the 5-a-day target in the United Kingdom could increase average life expectancy at birth by 7–8 mo and reduce diet-related GHGEs by 6.1 to 12.2 Mt carbon dioxide equivalents/y; blue WFs would change by -0.14 to +0.07 km3/y. Greater reductions in GHGEs were achieved by prioritizing increased vegetable consumption over fruit, whereas the greatest reduction in WF was obtained by prioritizing vegetable varieties produced in the United Kingdom. All consumption pathways increased diet cost (£0.34-£0.46/d).

Conclusions

Benefits to both population and environmental health could be expected from consumption pathways that meet the United Kingdom's 5-a-day target for fruit and vegetables. Our analysis identifies cross-sectoral trade-offs and opportunities for national policy to promote fruit and vegetable consumption in the United Kingdom.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^112Jqnxh]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 5–1 — estimated calorie needs per day by age, gender, and physical activity level provides Calorie Requirements (kcals) by Activity Level at three different levels of physical activity and states that the estimates are rounded to the nearest 200 calories and that an individual's calorie needs may be higher or lower than these average estimates. At age 2–3 years, daily estimates are 1,000–1,200 (sedentary), 1,000–1,400 (moderately active), and 1,000–1,400 (active). For females 9–13 years the values are 1,400–1,600, 1,600–2,000, and 1,800–2,200; for females 14–18 years they are 1,800, 2,000, and 2,400. For males 14–18 years the values are 2,000–2,400, 2,400–2,800, and 2,800–3,200; for males 19–30 years they are 2,400–2,600, 2,600–2,800, and 3,000. Sedentary means a lifestyle that includes only the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life, moderately active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, and active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life; estimates for females do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Safety and tolerability of high-dose daily vitamin dsupplementation in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study-a randomized trial in persons with prediabetes [^114tuZCL]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Routine use of vitamin D supplements has increased substantially in the United States. However, the safety and tolerability of long-term use of high-dose vitamin D are not known. We assessed the safety and tolerability of high-dose, daily vitamin D 3 in the vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study.

Subjects/Methods

In total, 2423 overweight/obese persons with prediabetes were randomized in a double-blind manner to either 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 (the tolerable upper intake level for adults by the National Academy of Medicine) taken daily or matching placebo. All participants were included in this analysis. Incident adverse events (AE) were ascertained 4 times a year at in-person visits (twice a year) and interim remote encounters (twice a year) and were defined as untoward or unfavorable medical occurrences. Serious adverse events (SAE) included death, life-threatening events, and hospitalizations.

Results

A total of 8304 AEs occurred during 3 years of follow-up and were less frequent in the vitamin D group compared to placebo (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] = 0.94; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.90, 0.98). The overall frequency of protocol-specified AEs of interest, which included nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or low estimated glomerular filtration rate, was low and did not differ by group. There were no significant between-group differences in total SAEs (IRR = 0.96 (0.81, 1.14)).

Conclusion

Vitamin D 3 supplementation at 4000 IU per day was safe and well tolerated among overweight/obese participants at high risk for diabetes who were appropriately monitored for safety. In this population, this dose of vitamin D 3 did not increase risk of AEs or SAEs, including those previously associated with vitamin D such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or nephrolithiasis.

### The gut commensal blautia maintains colonic mucus function under low-fiber consumption through secretion of short-chain fatty acids [^111kKS5e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Mucus growth rate measurements

The thickness and growth rate of the inner colonic mucus layer were measured as previously described. Briefly, the distal part of the colon was gently flushed with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O 2 and 5% CO 2) Kreb's buffer (116 mM NaCl, 1.3 mM CaCl 2, 3.6 mM KCl, 1.4 mM KH 2 PO 4, 23 mM NaHCO 3, and 1.2 mM MgSO 4 (pH 7.4)) to remove luminal content and unattached mucus ("outer layer"). After removal of the muscle layer, colonic tissue was mounted in a horizontal perfusion chamber system supplemented with a continuous basolateral supply of Kreb's-glucose buffer (10 mM D-glucose, 5.7 mM sodium pyruvate and 5.1 mM sodium glutamate). Black 10 μm polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, USA) were added on top of the mucus to visualize the surface, and Kreb's-mannitol (10 mM mannitol, 5.7 mM sodium pyruvate and 5.1 mM sodium glutamate) was added apically for hydration. The thickness of the mucus was measured using a fine glass micropipette connected to a micrometer through a stereomicroscope (Olympus) at five different locations per sample and presented as an average value (mucus thickness). To acquire the mucus growth rate, mucus thickness was measured at 0 min and after 45 min to calculate the change in thickness per minute (µm/min).
