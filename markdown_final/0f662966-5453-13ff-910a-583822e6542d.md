d) It's a spore forming organism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best describes a trophozoite among four choices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of a trophozoite across medically important protozoa. Then, I should verify how trophozoites differ from cysts or spores in terms of motility, reproduction, and environmental resistance. Next, I will examine specific examples from Giardia, Entamoeba, Acanthamoeba, and Plasmodium to ensure consistency. Finally, I will compare each answer choice against the evidence and select the best fit, correcting any misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the general definition. Across protozoan parasites, the trophozoite is the active, vegetative stage that is typically motile and capable of reproduction, whereas the cyst is the dormant, environmentally resistant stage used for transmission. This biphasic life cycle is well established for Giardia, Entamoeba, and Acanthamoeba, and the trophozoite is the disease-causing form in these organisms.

> Wait, let me verify the motility and reproduction points specifically. Giardia trophozoites are motile flagellates that multiply by binary fission in the small intestine and attach to the mucosa, while cysts are nonmotile and survive outside the host. Similarly, Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites are motile amoebae that reproduce and invade tissues, whereas cysts are the nonmotile, transmissible form. Acanthamoeba trophozoites feed and divide, while cysts are stress-resistant and nonmotile. In Plasmodium, the intraerythrocytic trophozoite is the growing, metabolically active stage that precedes schizont formation and merozoite release, again reflecting vegetative growth rather than dormancy.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about environmental resistance. I initially thought "resistant form" might apply broadly, but that would be a mistake. The resistant, transmission-ready stage is the cyst, not the trophozoite. Trophozoites are generally fragile outside the host and are not the spore-like, highly resilient forms. For example, Giardia cysts survive months in cold water, whereas trophozoites rapidly degenerate; Acanthamoeba cysts withstand desiccation and disinfectants, while trophozoites do not; and Entamoeba cysts transmit infection, whereas trophozoites die in the environment. So option a, which claims trophozoites are the resistant form, is incorrect.

> I need to check the claim that trophozoites are nonmotile. That is directly contradicted by the biology of these organisms. Giardia trophozoites swim with flagella, Entamoeba trophozoites exhibit amoeboid motility, and Acanthamoeba trophozoites crawl and phagocytose prey. Even in Plasmodium, although the merozoite is the invasive motile form, the intraerythrocytic trophozoite is metabolically active and undergoes dynamic remodeling, which is not consistent with a nonmotile descriptor. Thus, option c is incorrect [^1168dxvu].

> Let me consider whether trophozoites are spore-forming. Spores are a bacterial or fungal concept, not a protozoan one. Protozoa that form environmentally resistant stages produce cysts, not spores. For instance, Giardia and Entamoeba make cysts, and Acanthamoeba makes a double-walled cyst; none form spores. Therefore, option d is fundamentally misaligned with protozoan biology and should be rejected [^112PAdGo].

> Now, I should confirm why option b fits best. "The vegetative stage of the protozoa that's motile & capable of reproducing" matches the canonical definition across these pathogens: trophozoites are the active, feeding, dividing forms that cause disease, whereas cysts are the dormant, nonreproductive transmission stages. This pattern holds for Giardia, Entamoeba, Acanthamoeba, and the asexual blood-stage trophozoites of Plasmodium, reinforcing that option b is the most accurate and generalizable choice [^114ewKUB].

> Final answer: b) The vegetative stage of the protozoa that's motile & capable of reproducing [^114ewKUB] [^111AgrRQ].

---

The correct answer is **b) The vegetative stage of the protozoa that's motile & capable of reproducing**. Trophozoites are the **active, feeding, and reproducing stage** of protozoa, typically motile and responsible for pathogenesis in the host [^113KUaT8] [^114ewKUB]. They are **not the resistant form** (that is the cyst) [^114ewKUB] [^111AgrRQ], are not non-motile, and do not form spores [^112PAdGo].

---

## Characteristics of trophozoites

Trophozoites exhibit several **distinct characteristics** that differentiate them from other life cycle stages:

- **Motility**: Trophozoites are typically motile, utilizing pseudopodia, flagella, or cilia for movement. For example, Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites move using pseudopodia, while Giardia lamblia trophozoites use flagella [^113KUaT8] [^114ewKUB].

- **Reproduction**: Trophozoites reproduce asexually, most commonly through binary fission, allowing rapid multiplication within the host [^114ewKUB] [^116DdCPr].

- **Feeding**: Trophozoites are actively engaged in feeding, often phagocytosing host cells, bacteria, or other organic material. Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites, for instance, ingest red blood cells and host tissue, contributing to tissue destruction and disease pathogenesis [^113KUaT8].

- **Pathogenicity**: Trophozoites are typically the pathogenic stage of protozoan parasites, causing damage to host tissues and organs. For example, Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites infect and destroy red blood cells, leading to malaria symptoms [^1178r6DP].

---

## Comparison with other protozoan life cycle stages

To fully understand trophozoites, it is essential to compare them with other stages in the protozoan life cycle, particularly **cysts**:

| **Characteristic** | **Trophozoite** | **Cyst** |
|-|-|-|
| Motility | Motile | Non-motile |
| Reproduction | Active reproduction (binary fission) | Dormant, no reproduction |
| Environmental resistance | Sensitive to environmental stress | Highly resistant to harsh conditions |
| Transmission | Not directly transmitted | Responsible for transmission |
| Examples | Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites, Giardia lamblia trophozoites, Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites | Entamoeba histolytica cysts, Giardia lamblia cysts, Acanthamoeba cysts |

---

## Clinical significance of trophozoites

Trophozoites are clinically significant because they are the **active disease-causing stage** of protozoan parasites. Their presence in host tissues or bodily fluids often indicates active infection and guides diagnosis and treatment. For example:

- **Entamoeba histolytica**: Trophozoites cause amoebic colitis and liver abscesses, leading to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide [^113KUaT8].

- **Giardia lamblia**: Trophozoites colonize the small intestine, causing malabsorption, diarrhea, and nutritional deficiencies [^114ewKUB].

- **Plasmodium falciparum**: Trophozoites infect and destroy red blood cells, causing severe malaria with potentially fatal outcomes [^1178r6DP].

---

## Diagnostic implications

Detection of trophozoites in clinical specimens is critical for diagnosing active protozoan infections. Diagnostic methods include microscopic examination of stool, blood smears, or tissue samples, as well as molecular techniques such as PCR [^117KYMkt] [^1168dxvu]. For example, **Giardia lamblia trophozoites** can be identified in stool samples using trichrome staining or direct fluorescent antibody assays, while **Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites** are detected in blood smears using Giemsa staining [^117KYMkt] [^1168VhdA].

---

## Conclusion

Trophozoites are the **active, motile, and reproducing stage** of protozoan parasites, responsible for pathogenesis and disease manifestation in the host [^113KUaT8]. They are distinct from cysts, which are dormant and environmentally resistant, and play a crucial role in the transmission and persistence of protozoan infections [^111AgrRQ]. Understanding the biology and clinical significance of trophozoites is essential for effective diagnosis, treatment, and control of protozoan diseases.

At 48 h, we observed sexual stages (we use the terms male and female gametes according to the convention of the extensive literature on sex in the malaria parasite Plasmodium). Female or macrogametes had a single nucleus that was significantly larger (0.89 μm²) than the nuclei of asexual stages (0.43 μm²; P < 0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test) and male or microgametes, which had dense, bullet-shaped nuclei (0.15 μm²; P < 0.0001, unpaired Student's t -test). We found up to 16 of these nuclei in male or microgamonts (the precursor stage of the male gamete). We next conducted time-course experiments and assigned a stage to all of the parasites observed using the morphometric characteristics that are defined above. Initially, all parasites in culture were asexual meronts and trophozoites. After 36 h, the culture rapidly sexualizes, with gamonts and gametes representing > 80% of all stages after 72 h (Fig. 1e).

Microscopic examination (Figure 1; Appendix Figure) showed characteristics typically described for Babesia trophozoites, including extracellular parasites, abundant binary fission, and absence of schizonts. The observed forms were highly pleomorphic. We observed piriform parasites, resembling B. divergens, as well as more round forms, as shown in the original description of B. crassa, but the round forms were not as abundant as usually described. We also observed voluminous forms resembling bandform trophozoites of Plasmodium malariae. Although 4 parasites in 1 erythrocyte were frequently observed, the tetrad (Maltese Cross) form, typical for B. divergens, was never seen.

We performed our routine PCR tests for B. divergens and B microti, using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master HybProbe (Roche,) (Appendix). Unexpectedly, both PCRs came back negative. We then applied a universal Babesia spp. PCR, targeting a consensus sequence of the internal transcribed spacer 1 gene of the 18S RNA, as previously reported (Appendix). Visual inspection of the agarose gel showed a PCR fragment of ≈480 bp. The PCR product was purified and sequenced on both strands by Eurofins Genomics. We identified the consensus sequence (GenBank accession no. MW504968) as Babesia spp. by using BLAST. We conducted phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses by using MEGA X 10.1.8. We constructed a phylogenetic tree with corresponding sequences of the Babesia genus obtained from GenBank by using the neighbor-joining method with Kimura 2-parameter distances and using Theileria spp. as the outgroup (Figure 2). Our sequence aligned with the B. crassa complex and specifically with a B. crassa –like sequence from Slovenia (GenBank accession no. MK240324) with 99.11% identity.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117KYMkt]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia diagnosis in children with HIV is described as follows: Although diagnostic tests for Giardia infection have not been evaluated in children with HIV, the tests are expected to perform similarly as in other populations. A definitive diagnosis of Giardia infection is established by detection of Giardia trophozoites or cysts in stool specimens, duodenal fluid, or small-bowel tissue by microscopic examination using staining methods such as trichrome, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assays, detection of soluble stool antigens using enzyme immunoassays (EIA), or use of molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and EIA or multiplex PCR testing is the currently recommended methodology based on assay performance. Appropriately conducted direct examination of stool establishes the diagnosis of Giardia in up to 70% of patients with a single examination and in 85% with a second examination. Because of intermittent excretion of cysts, stool specimens should be examined within 1 hour after being passed; trophozoites are more likely in unformed stools, and cysts, but not trophozoites, are stable outside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. When giardiasis is suspected and stool specimens are negative, aspiration, biopsy, or both, of the duodenum or upper part of the jejunum should be performed; in a fresh specimen, trophozoites usually can be visualized on direct wet mount, and although histologic evaluation of duodenal biopsy samples has low sensitivity for detecting infection, this approach may be necessary in patients with clinical characteristics of Giardia infection but negative stool and duodenal fluid specimens.

Giardia lamblia is one of the most common causes of intestinal disease in humans. To adapt to environments both inside and outside of the host's small intestine, this protozoan parasite undergoes significant developmental changes during its life cycle. In this review, we analyze and discuss the most recent findings regarding the process of Giardia trophozoites differentiation into infective cysts as well as the mechanism of antigenic variation, which allows the parasite to cause chronic and recurrent infections in susceptible individuals.

### Understanding the liver-stage biology of malaria parasites: insights to enable and accelerate the development of a highly efficacious vaccine [^113onsJu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

LIVER-STAGE BIOLOGY AND "OMICS"

Plasmodium parasites have evolved a complex life cycle with the sporozoite constituting the most versatile and enigmatic form of the parasite, being the stage formed in the mosquito vector and then undergoing further differentiation in human liver cells. Following the bite of an infected mosquito, highly motile sporozoites leave the bite site, travel through the circulation until they find and invade hepatocytes. Once hepatocyte invasion is complete and infection is established, the complex process of parasite liver-stage development is initiated, transforming the parasite from an invasive extracellular form to an intracellular trophozoite within a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), culminating in the production of invasive exoerythrocytic merozoites. Along the liver-stage journey, the parasite encounters many different cell types and conditions, coupled with commensurate changes in parasite gene expression and morphology. For Pf, this process takes 6–7 days. Plasmodium vivax sporozoites can also differentiate into a dormant form, the hypnozoite, which can remain latent for months to years before reactivating, developing further in the liver, and causing blood-stage infection, thus, accounting for the periodic relapses seen in vivax malaria.

Understanding the molecular and cellular events during Pf and Pv liver-stage development becomes extremely important in designing an attenuated sporozoite vaccine that arrests precisely at a desirable time point of liver-stage development. Since the discovery many years ago of the exoerythrocytic development of mammalian malaria parasites in the liver, however, much of our knowledge of this stage has been gained from studies performed with rodent malaria in animal models. The panel discussed the surprisingly limited knowledge of Pf and Pv liver-stage biology and noted that studies on molecular mechanisms surrounding merozoite invasion, development, and egress in red blood cells (erythrocytic phase) have been far ahead of those investigating sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes, intrahepatic development, and subsequent egress. This is in part because liver infections are asymptomatic and cannot be readily observed during natural human infections. In addition, Pf and Pv have a narrow host preference (i.e. are restricted to hepatocytes of humans and great apes), and a natural sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes usually results in the invasion of only a small number of hepatocytes. It is anticipated that the recent development of in vitro human hepatocyte platforms and liver-humanized mice would greatly aid in liver-stage Pf and Pv basic research.

### Amoebiasis [^113KUaT8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Amoebiasis is the second leading cause of death from parasitic disease worldwide. The causative protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, is a potent pathogen. Secreting proteinases that dissolve host tissues, killing host cells on contact, and engulfing red blood cells, E histolytica trophozoites invade the intestinal mucosa, causing amoebic colitis. In some cases amoebas breach the mucosal barrier and travel through the portal circulation to the liver, where they cause abscesses consisting of a few E histolytica trophozoites surrounding dead and dying hepatocytes and liquefied cellular debris. Amoebic liver abscesses grow inexorably and, at one time, were almost always fatal, but now even large abscesses can be cured by one dose of antibiotic. Evidence that what we thought was a single species based on morphology is, in fact, two genetically distinct species — now termed Entamoeba histolytica (the pathogen) and Entamoeba dispar (a commensal) — has turned conventional wisdom about the epidemiology and diagnosis of amoebiasis upside down. New models of disease have linked E histolytica induction of intestinal inflammation and hepatocyte programmed cell death to the pathogenesis of amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess.

Acanthamoeba Keratitis

Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare, often misdiagnosed condition linked to contact lens use. Early diagnosis is crucial as delays worsen visual outcomes and increase surgical intervention rates. IVCM can detect Acanthamoeba cysts and trophozoites: cysts appear as highly refractile, round or oval bodies with double walls (10–15 µm), while trophozoites are larger (25–40 µm) and oval.(Figure 14) Differentiating trophozoites from keratocyte nuclei can be challenging in inflamed corneas.

Figure 14
Confocal microscopy image showing Acanthamoeba cysts in the anterior stroma (340 × 255 μm). The arrow points to a characteristic Acanthamoeba cyst, identifiable by its double-walled, highly reflective round structure, aiding in the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis.

IVCM has also visualized inflamed stromal nerves and small, irregular, hyperreflective elements (5–15 µm) in the basal epithelium, possibly representing cellular debris or altered cysts. IVCM shows potential in monitoring treatment response, as trophozoites may not be visible four to six weeks after therapy begins. Despite its utility, corneal scraping or biopsy remains the definitive diagnostic method.

Fungal Keratitis

IVCM is less established for fungal keratitis, but case reports describe infections caused by Aspergillus, Fusarium, Beauveria, and Candida. Fungal hyphae appear as linear, hyperreflective, well-defined structures (width ~6 µm) with extensive branching. Fungal elements can resemble double-walled structures and are seen as hyperreflective, branching lines (3–8 µm). Sensitivity and specificity have been reported as 94% and 74%, respectively.

### Naturally acquired human plasmodium cynomolgi and P. knowlesi infections, Malaysian borneo [^117DLFBp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Morphological Characterization of P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi Co-infections

Parasitemia in the 6 patients with P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi co-infections ranged from 213 to 84,299 parasites/μL blood (Table 2). Only patients K07 and K199 had blood films of high enough quality for morphologic characterization of Plasmodium species. On examination, we noted P. cynomolgi –infected erythrocytes constituted a small proportion of the malaria-infected erythrocytes, consisting of ≈1.5% of infected erythrocytes for patients K07 and 4.7% for patient K199. We estimated the percentage of P. cynomolgi –infected erythrocytes by using the number of early trophozoite stages with Schüffner's stippling because we only observed the trophozoite stage for P. cynomolgi in these 2 patients. We distinguished P. cynomolgi from P. knowlesi parasites based on morphologic characteristics of infected erythrocytes, as previously described. We observed Schüffner's stippling in early trophozoite-infected erythrocytes, which were enlarged and distorted at times (Figures 3, 4). The trophozoites of P. cynomolgi also had either single, double, or triple chromatin dots. The growing trophozoites of P. knowlesi did not cause erythrocyte enlargement and we did not observe Schüffner's stippling (Figure 4, panels K, L). Furthermore, we observed band-form trophozoites of P. knowlesi in certain erythrocytes (Figure 3, panel I; Figure 4, panel M), and we noted 16 merozoites in 1 schizont (Figure 3, panel J). For patient K07, we examined 4,154 erythrocytes; 12 (0.3%) had prominent Schüffner's stippling, but we did not observe malaria parasites within these erythrocytes (Figure 5).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between giardia lamblia and endemic pediatric diarrhea in developing countries [^116DdCPr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A PRIMER ON G. LAMBLIA INFECTION

Because the biology of G. lamblia infection has been previously reviewed, only a few salient features are mentioned in this systematic review of the epidemiology.

The Life Cycle of G. lamblia

Giardia lamblia, a unicellular eukaryotic flagellated enteric protozoa first described by van Leeuwenhoek in 1681, occurs as a nonmotile cyst (responsible for transmission) or a motile trophozoite (associated with clinical symptoms). Low gastric acidity followed by exposure to pancreatic secretions prompts excystation in the proximal small intestine, with 2 trophozoites deriving from each cyst. The trophozoites replicate in the lumen by binary fission and adhere to enterocytes of the proximal small intestine by suction (using their ventral adhesive disk) and by specific receptor-ligand interactions, but do not invade the epithelium. Encystation begins in the small intestine upon exposure to bile salts and is promoted by alkaline pH and decreasing cholesterol levels. Both cysts and trophozoites may be excreted, depending on the nature of the stool. Giardia cysts survive in the environment for weeks and months, especially in cool and moist conditions.

Transmission

Giardia lamblia is transmitted via the ingestion of as few as 10 cysts. Much information on the modes of transmission of Giardia comes from studies of infection and illness in industrialized-country settings. Waterborne transmission of G. lamblia is well documented, including through recreational water activities and swimming. The low inoculum facilitates person-to-person transmission among family members and subjects in crowded conditions where hygiene practices may be suboptimal (eg, daycare centers). Foodborne transmission of G. lamblia occurs but is uncommon. Sexual transmission has been reported among men who have sex with men.

Epidemiological studies and genotyping studies of G. lamblia support the possibility of zoonotic transmission of G. lamblia assemblages A and B, genotypes known to infect both humans and other host species; genotypes C to G infect only animals.

### G protein signaling in the parasite entamoeba histolytica [^114BFXBc]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The life cycle of E. histolytica consists of an interchange between an encysted form and a motile, pathogenic, trophozoite form. E. histolytica cysts, shed in the feces of infected human hosts, are transmitted primarily by ingestion of contaminated water or food. Excystation occurs in the small intestine, and the resultant E. histolytica trophozoites may then colonize the large intestine while evading the host immune response. Although the majority of E. histolytica infections are asymptomatic, trophozoites can penetrate the intestinal mucous barrier, resulting in colitis. Amebic colitis is characterized by trophozoite-mediated killing of intestinal epithelial cells and responding immune cells, as well as local tissue destruction. In rare cases, E. histolytica trophozoites can enter the blood stream and spread systemically, giving rise to abscesses, primarily in the liver and less frequently in the lungs and brain. Although systemic amebiasis requires previous intestinal infection, amebic liver abscesses can develop in the absence of symptomatic colitis, and are known to appear months or years following exposure. Thus, treatment is recommended for patients with E. histolytica infection, even in the absence of symptomatic disease.

### Plasmodium vivax transcriptomes reveal stage-specific chloroquine response and differential regulation of male and female gametocytes [^1177C11D]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

RNA-sequencing has provided invaluable insights on some of the fundamental characteristics of Plasmodium gene expression and, for example, highlighted the complexity of these parasites' transcriptomes, with extensive noncoding transcripts, long 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, and, often, multiple isoforms per gene. Additionally, gene expression studies have been extremely useful to identify transcriptional differences between parasite stages, in response to antimalarial drugs – or to culture conditions. However, most of these studies have been conducted using rodent malaria parasites or in vitro cultures of P. falciparum, and our understanding of gene regulation in other human malaria parasites remain very incomplete (but see also ref.). This is notably true for P. vivax for which the lack of in vitro culture system restricts studies to patient samples, with all the associated problems due to overwhelming host RNA and asynchronous parasites.

In this study, we showed that parasite gene expression profiles could be consistently generated from patients presenting with clinical vivax malaria. In contrast with the variable stage composition observed by microscopy among patient infections, gene expression deconvolution analyses revealed that the vast majority of RNA molecules in a P. vivax blood infection derived from a single developmental stage, the trophozoites. This observation is consistent with our previous analyses of three P. vivax -infected patients, and with nuclear run-on experiments, RNA polymerase II profilingand single-cell RNA-seqthat showed that Plasmodium trophozoites are much more transcriptionally active than the other asexual parasite stages. In addition, the relatively low sensitivity of microscopy likely contributes to the discrepancy between the microscopy and gene expression deconvolution data: given the low parasitemia typical of P. vivax infections, only a small number of parasites are typically observed by microscopy, which might miss lowly abundant stages (e.g. the schizonts in Fig. 1) and limit the accuracy. For example, in an infection with a parasitemia of 0.1%, analysis of 200 fields by microscopy only provides stage information based on ~50 observed parasites, while RNA-seq data generated from 50 µL of blood would summarize information from ~250,000 parasites.

### 20S proteasomes secreted by the malaria parasite promote its growth [^1178r6DP]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cells (RBCs) are endowed with exceptional features. During their ~120-day lifespan, they travel in circulation a total distance of 500 km, but they have already lost their internal organelles. Throughout their maturation process, RBCs undergo drastic remodeling as they extrude their nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and 20–30% of their cell-surface and protein-synthesis machinery. This means that the survival of these fundamental cells relies exclusively on their internal pool of proteins.

The primary function of RBCs is to provide oxygen to all the body's tissues. This is enabled by their enhanced ability to alter their shape (deformability), allowing them to pass through the smallest capillaries of the human body. The shear elastic properties of the RBCs are predominantly determined by the cytoskeleton's network of integral membrane proteins. The dynamic remodeling ability of the cytoskeleton network allows the repeated large deformation of RBCs, which facilitates movement. Thus, their unconventional cell composition (predominantly proteins) and remarkable mechanical properties make them unique host cells for pathogens.

A case in point is the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), one of the most virulent malaria species, which only infects humans and is responsible for the greatest number of fatalities worldwide, mainly among children and pregnant women. The Pf parasites in the merozoite stage of their blood cycle (asexual replication) must invade naïve RBCs every 48 h to sustain a blood-stage infection: Once an extracellular merozoite invades the RBC, it progresses to the ring stage, grows into a metabolically active trophozoite, and, following nuclear divisions, matures into a multi-nucleated schizont. Subsequently, new merozoites egress from each schizont and invade naïve RBCs to repeat the blood cycle. Thus, malaria pathogenesis highly depends on the extensive remodeling of host RBCs. In particular, these parasites modulate RBC's membrane stiffness, and activate a phosphorylation cascade that includes RBC cytoskeletal proteins.

Statistical Analysis

Algorithm Evaluation

Algorithm performance was evaluated at the cell and image levels. At the cell level, whether bounding boxes identified by the algorithm matched ground truth bounding boxes was determined by a matching process (eMethods 3 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Our evaluation focused on 2 primary end points: malaria detection, defined as the detections of any malaria parasites regardless of life cycle stages, and ring form detection, the most common and characteristic stage in peripheral blood smears of P falciparum.

Metrics conventionally used for object detection in computer vision were applied at the cell level, including precision-recall curves with average precision and free-response receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. At the image level, ROC curves were plotted and areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were computed using the Python package Scikit-learn, version 0.18.1 (Python Software Foundation). The 95% CIs for ROC curves were estimated through 1000 iterations of bootstrap analysis on sensitivity and specificity with α = .05. Error rates of microscopic diagnosis were calculated by counting every mistake equally.

Two operating points were selected at the image level to further characterize the algorithm performance. The first operating point, corresponding to the point with the highest Youden index, reflects the optimal point of algorithm performance with high sensitivity. It was chosen because high sensitivity is a prerequisite for a potential screening tool. The second operating point, the high specificity operating point, which approximates the mean specificity of practicing microscopists in the clinical validation set, could further characterize our algorithm performance against the 4 practicing microscopists. The 95% CIs for the sensitivity and specificity at the 2 operating points were calculated to be exact Clopper-Pearson intervals. Two-sided 95% CIs were computed using the Python package StatsModels, version 0.8.0.

Sensitivity Analysis

Experiments were designed to evaluate the association of different labeling strategies with malaria detection. For the development set, 2 sets of meta-labels were processed and inferred from the raw annotations. For the first set, we pooled the labels of young trophozoite (ring form) and trophozoite into the category trophozoite, together with the remaining labels of schizont and gametocyte; for the second set, all labels regardless of their life-cycle stages were merged into the category malaria infection. These 2 sets of meta-labels were then used to train another 2 malaria detection models with similar configurations delineated above. Their performances were measured with the same metrics.

### Encystation of giardia lamblia: a model for other parasites [^1144V3t3]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

To colonize the human small intestine, Giardia lamblia monitors a dynamic environment. Trophozoites attach to enterocytes that mature and die. The parasites must 'decide' whether to re-attach or differentiate into cysts that survive in the environment and re-activate when ingested. Other intestinal parasites face similar challenges. Study of these parasites is limited because they do not encyst in vitro. Giardia trophozoites were persuaded to encyst in vitro by mimicking physiological stimuli. Cysts are dormant, yet 'spring-loaded for action' to excyst upon ingestion. Giardial encystation has been studied from morphological, cell biological, biochemical, and molecular viewpoints. Yet important gaps remain and the mechanisms that co-ordinate responses to external signals remain enigmatic.

### A 76-year-old male with multiple enhancing brain lesions [^114vDXde]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Histologically, two stages within the life cycle of B. mandrillaris can be identified: the trophozoite and the cyst form. The trophozoites are typically uninucleate and have a nucleus with a centrally placed, dense karyosome, and abundant bubbly cytoplasm. Although not identified in this case, double‐walled cysts are also often seen and can be a histologic feature that distinguishes it from N. fowleri. Trophozoites and cysts may be seen within and surrounding blood vessel walls with an associated mixed acute and chronic inflammation, in addition to hemorrhage and necrosis. Given that patients with GAE may be immunocompromised, the presence of granulomatous inflammation is variable.

GAE caused by B. mandrillaris may be preceded by painless, plaque‐like skin lesions up to 2 years prior to the encephalitic presentation. However, once GAE has developed, the clinical course is often fatal. Common presenting neurologic symptoms include headache, nausea and vomiting, seizures, meningismus, and myalgia. Imaging findings are variable in patients with GAE, ranging from an isolated to multiple low‐density, "space‐occupying" lesions, which may mimic other disease processes such as abscess, metastatic tumor, or hemorrhage.

B. mandrillaris is not readily morphologically identifiable from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens and will not grow on bacteria‐coated agar plates; however, it can be grown on mammalian cell cultures in research settings. CSF studies demonstrate normal to low glucose, increased protein levels, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Therefore, brain or skin biopsy can be critical to the diagnosis. Moreover, it can be challenging to differentiate between B. mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba spp. by histology alone. However, they can be differentiated by multiple techniques including immunohistochemistry, indirect immunofluorescence, or multiplex PCR, the latter of which was performed in this case.

Although GAE often results in death, rare cases have been reported in which patients have recovered following treatment with a combination of antimicrobials including pentamidine isethionate, sulfadiazine, clarithromycin, fluconazole, and flucytosine.

### Cryo-EM structure of ribosome from pathogenic protozoa entamoeba histolytica reveals unique features of its architecture [^113YJDe2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Entamoeba histolytica, as its name suggests (histo-lytic = tissue destroyer), is an anaerobic parasite responsible for intestinal infection that results in bloody diarrhea, known as invasive amoebiasis or invasive colitis. Occasionally, the parasite reaches into the bloodstream and spreads through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver, where it causes liver abscesses. Rarely, it reaches the lung, brain, and spleen and causes abscesses, which can be fatal if untreated –. E. histolytica infects ~35–50 million people worldwide and roughly kills 55,000 people each year. The life cycle of E. histolytica spans the active disease-causing "trophozoite stage", which exists only in the host, and the infective "cyst stage", which survives outside the host. Infection occurs mainly via ingesting mature cyst from fecally contaminated food, water, or hands.

Earlier studies showed that ribosomes from Entamoeba invadens, a non-pathogenic model organism for E. histolytica, assemble in a rod-shaped helical structure known as chromatoid bodies during the cyst stage –. In contrast, its trophozoite stage contains typical ribosomes having monosomes, ribosomal large subunit (LSU), and ribosomal small subunit (SSU). E. histolytica possesses a reduced ribosome as its monosome, LSU, and SSU, which sediments at 75S, 53S, and 36S, respectively (S — Svedberg unit)and their respective rRNA sediments at 25S, 17S, 5.8S, 5S, and 4S. Conversely, human ribosomes monosome, LSU, and SSU sediments, at the 80S, 60S, and 40S, respectively, and possess four rRNA species 28S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S. Whereas the bacterial ribosome, monosome, LSU, and SSU sediments at the 70S, 50S, and 30S, respectively, and their rRNAs are 23S, 16S, and 5S.

### Phosphoantigen burst upon plasmodium falciparum schizont rupture can distantly activate V γ 9V δ 2 T cells [^111UeMoc]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

As BTN3A is not expressed onto iRBCs, phosphoantigens cannot be presented to Vγ9Vδ2 T cells by this molecule by the iRBCs, unlike cancer cells. The potent activation noted by soluble molecules released in the culture supernatant by iRBCs indicates that presentation by the iRBC itself is fully dispensable. Ultracentrifugation ruled out the possibility of presentation by microvesicles, and efficacy of BTN3A blocking on Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell activation suggested an autopresentation of the captured parasite-derived activator molecules by the Vγ9Vδ2 T cells that express BTN3A. Thus, our overall results showed that the activating molecules have all the characteristics of phosphoantigens.

The timing of expression of the DOXP pathway in the apicoplast is consistent with the observed stage-dependent bioactivity, as young intracellular stages (ring stages and young trophozoites), in which the apicoplast is poorly active, do not stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. The exact chemical composition of parasite stimulants still is uncertain; this is why the quantification of bioactivity was estimated against an HMBPP reference, which is the most active phosphoantigen reported to date. Accordingly, our quantification of soluble bioactivity, expressed as HMBPP equivalents, may underestimate the actual amount of activators if some, such as IPP, have a lower specific activity. Nevertheless, our estimates are in accordance with the range of bioactivity (0.1 to 10 nM) measured in supernatants of patient's neutrophils that phagocytosed HMBPP-producing bacteria, with these amounts being sufficient to stimulate Vγ9Vδ2 T cells.

### Plasmodium falciparum transcription in different clinical presentations of malaria associates with circulation time of infected erythrocytes [^113us3gE]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In two studies included in this reanalysis, data supporting further developed parasites circulating in lower parasitaemias and less severe malaria cases were already reported at that time, albeit possibly not clearly or knowingly. Tonkin-Hill et al. described a bias toward early trophozoite transcription in the uncomplicated compared to the ring-stage transcriptional profile of the severe malaria cases analyzed ex vivo, and Lemieux et al. reported that a shorter period of hours in culture was needed to achieve schizont stages in parasites collected from uncomplicated cases (24 h 95% CI 23, 44) than the period needed to have parasites reach the same stage from severe malaria cases (38 h 95% CI 24, 48) (p = 0.05 t test). These are two clues in two different publications, of what we now put in evidence across multiple studies, and is possibly a major driver of P. falciparum ability to grow within a host. Early stage adhesion of infected erythrocytes results in effective evasion of splenic clearance and a subsequent rapid increase in parasitaemia and severity of disease. With two studies, we could relate the parasite transcriptional signatures with size measurements of circulating parasites within the lower and higher parasitaemia groups, which confirmed the presence of more mature parasites in individuals with lower parasitaemias (Fig. 5d), validating longer circulation within the ~48 h IDC detectable through transcriptomic analyses leads to less rapid increase in parasite burden. Adding a third study (Coulibaly et al. in preparation) we were able to cover a wide range of parasite densities across an array of clinical presentations and quantify parasite sizes of freshly isolated parasites from multiple studies evidencing more developed parasites in samples from lower parasitaemias and milder malaria forms, and showing a negative association between parasitaemia and developmental stage of circulating parasites (Fig. 5g). It remains to be explained how P. falciparum alters its adhesive properties driving increased splenic clearance and maintaining lower parasitaemias. We propose that circulating antibodies control parasites with stronger binding abilities and thus potential fast-growth, leading to the biased presence in the circulation of immune or semi-immune individuals of parasites binding less efficiently. These parasites would not be able to increase to high levels because their longer presence in circulation promotes splenic clearance. Although very difficult due to the variable nature of the parasite gene families promoting cytoadhesion, the study of sequential expression and humoral responses to variant surface antigens in P. falciparum may inform how less-adhesive parasites appear gradually in individuals, and how virulence is regulated favoring persistence. Within the ten studies reanalyzed here, only Andrade et al. and Tonkin-Hill et al. discussed possible associations between disease severity and variant gene family transcripts, but none of the studies included longitudinal sampling. In the small number of samples analyzed in Andrade et al. there was no significant enrichment of particular vars, and only a trend of higher expressed var genes in individuals with clinical malaria vs asymptomatic in the dry season. Tonkin-Hill et al. detected no differences between severe and uncomplicated malaria cases in total number of var gene reads, but identified segregation at the multidomain and individual domain level between severe and uncomplicated disease. However, Tonkin-Hill et al. also found genes involved in PfEMP1 transport and regulation to be downregulated in severe malaria leading the authors to suggest that var gene expression was reduced in severe cases, which in light of our current data could also simply indicate less-developed parasites.

### Acanthamoeba and mimivirus interactions: the role of amoebal encystment and the expansion of the 'cheshire cat' theory [^113yw1M4]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Acanthamoeba are natural hosts for giant viruses and their life cycle comprises two stages: a trophozoite and a cryptobiotic cyst. Encystment involves a massive turnover of cellular components under molecular regulation. Giant viruses are able to infect only the trophozoite, while cysts are resistant to infection. Otherwise, upon infection, mimiviruses are able to prevent encystment. This review highlights the important points of Acanthamoeba and giant virus interactions regarding the encystment process. The existence of an acanthamoebal non-permissive cell for Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus, the prototype member of the Mimivirus genus, is analyzed at the molecular and ecological levels, and compared to a similar phenomenon previously described for Emiliana huxleyi and its associated phycodnaviruses: the 'Cheshire Cat' escape strategy.

### Fate of entamoeba histolytica during establishment of amoebic liver abscess analyzed by quantitative radioimaging and histology [^1142o47r]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a human disease characterized by dysentery and liver abscess. The physiopathology of hepatic lesions can be satisfactorily reproduced in the hamster animal model by the administration of trophozoites through the portal vein route. Hamsters were infected with radioactively labeled amoebas for analysis of liver abscess establishment and progression. The radioimaging of material from parasite origin and quantification of the number inflammation foci, with or without amoebas, described here provides the first detailed assessment of trophozoite survival and death during liver infection by E. histolytica. The massive death of trophozoites observed in the first hours postinfection correlates with the presence of a majority of inflammatory foci without parasites. A critical point for success of infection is reached after 12 h when the lowest number of trophozoites is observed. The process then enters a commitment phase during which parasites multiply and the size of the infection foci increases fast. The liver shows extensive areas of dead hepatocytes that are surrounded by a peripheral layer of parasites facing inflammatory cells leading to acute inflammation. Our results show that the host response promotes massive parasite death but also suggest also that this is a major contributor to the establishment of inflammation during development of liver abscess.

### Entamoeba stage conversion: progress and new insights [^112PAdGo]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica, an anaerobic protozoan, is an important global health problem. This parasite has a biphasic life cycle consisting of a dormant cyst stage which is environmentally resistant and transmits the infection, and the proliferative trophozoite stage which is motile and causes invasive disease. The stage conversion process remains poorly understood despite being central to amoebic biology. In this review, we will highlight recent progress in our understanding of Entamoeba stage conversion including dissecting transcriptome analysis in development, characterization of transcriptional networks, demonstration of epigenetic regulation, and role of small molecules that regulate Entamoeba development.

### Human genetics and malaria resistance [^112iqQ3j]. Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malaria has been the biggest cause of childhood mortality globally for much of the last 5000 years. Although now coming under some degree of control, mortality remains high in many countries and worldwide there were an estimated 405,000 deaths from malaria in 2018 alone, with more than 90% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO). Historically, this pressure has resulted in the selection of a wide range of genetic variants that confer protection against malaria-specific death. This review aims to outline some of the more important protective genetic variants that have been identified so far, as summarized in the Table 1. Understanding how these variants confer their protective effects has the potential to inform novel preventative and treatment approaches.

Table 1
A summary of the malaria protective gene variants that are reviewed, with key references

Malaria can be caused by five different species of protozoan Plasmodium parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most prevalent and result in the majority of deaths (Escalante et al; Singh et al; Martinsen et al; WHO). The propagation of all malaria parasites involves both a sexual cycle in mosquitoes and an asexual cycle in humans, in which parasites first infect the liver before becoming established in red blood cells (RBCs). The clinically symptomatic blood-stage involves sequential rounds of parasite multiplication that incorporate invasion of merozoites into RBCs followed by their maturation into trophozoites then schizonts, which ultimately rupture from the RBC to release fresh merozoites which rapidly infect new RBCs (Fig. 1). The asexual cycle gives rise to an exponential multiplication of parasites in the blood and to the pathogenic features of malaria that are observed in the human host (Schellenberg et al; Rogier et al; Snow et al.). The parasite is able to evade the host immune response by sequestering in the deep capillaries (Rowe et al; Williams et al; Butthep et al.). There are multiple points in the parasite lifecycle that have impacted host genetic variation, but the majority of the malaria-protective variants described so far have various important impacts on the structure and function of the RBC (Fig. 1).

### Neuropathological and ultrastructural features of amebic encephalitis caused by sappinia diploidea [^1117tR2B]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Here we present the neuropathological, ultrastructural, and radiological features of Sappinia diploidea, a newly recognized human pathogen. The patient was a 38-year-old man with visual disturbances, headache, and a seizure. Brain images showed a solitary mass in the posterior left temporal lobe. The mass was composed of necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation that contained free-living amebae. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the organism was not a species of ameba previously known to cause encephalitis. Trophozoites had a highly distinctive double nucleus, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that they contained 2 nuclei closely apposed along a flattened surface. The 2 nuclei were attached to each other by distinctive connecting perpendicular filaments. This and several other unique structural features led to the diagnosis of S. diploidea encephalitis. The patient was treated postoperatively with a sequential regimen of anti-amebic drugs (azithromycin, pentamidine, itraconazole, and flucytosine) and is alive after 5 years. Guidelines to recognize future cases of S. diploidea encephalitis are as follows. 1) It presented as a tumor-like cerebral mass without an abscess wall. 2) It had central necrotic and hemorrhagic inflammation that contained acute and chronic inflammatory cells without granulomas or eosinophils. 3) It contained trophozoites (40–70 microm diameter) that contained a distinctive double nucleus. 4) Cyst forms in the host were not excluded or definitely evident. 5) Trophozoites engulfed host blood cells and were stained brightly with Giemsa and periodic acid-Schiff. 6) Trophozoites often were present in viable brain parenchyma on the periphery of the mass without inflammatory response. 7) The prognosis after surgical excision and medical treatment was favorable in this instance.

### An international external quality assessment scheme to assess the diagnostic performance of polymerase chain reaction detection of acanthamoeba keratitis [^1168dxvu]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Acanthamoeba is a free-living amoeba that is ubiquitously present around the world in soil and water. It can exist in a trophozoite stage, which is actively moving and feeding, and a cyst stage, which is dormant and stress-resistant. Acanthamoeba can cause an infectious keratitis, which leads to blindness if left untreated or is treated with the wrong medication. Acanthamoeba keratitis is often seen in contact lens wearers, among which 1 in 21,000 in the Netherlands is affected. In recent years, this incidence has been reported as rising. –

The most important factor that determines the prognosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis is an early diagnosis. However, diagnosing Acanthamoeba keratitis requires clinical expertise, as symptoms overlap with infectious keratitis caused by other micro-organisms. Many different diagnostic tools are available, all with different characteristics. Direct culture is a laborious and time-consuming diagnostic method, in which the clinical sample is added to a non-nutrient agar plate seeded with Gram-negative bacteria (eg Escherichia coli), after which Acanthamoeba growth must be detected microscopically. Direct visualization of Acanthamoeba on the infected eye is also possible using in vivo confocal microscopy, but this method requires specialized equipment and personnel. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have also been developed to detect Acanthamoeba DNA. These NAAT methods have a high sensitivity and can provide rapid results in contrast to the time-consuming culture procedures. However, a large diversity of NAATs are in use, and so far, external quality assessment scheme (EQAS) for these tests is lacking. An EQAS involves the comparison of test results of a laboratory to a source outside of that laboratory, allowing an objective assessment of the diagnostic performance of a laboratory.EQAS has already been used to optimize the detection and evaluation of other infectious diseases using NAATs.

Here, we describe the evaluation of the introduction of an EQAS for the detection of Acanthamoeba cysts and trophozoites by NAAT. We aimed to assess the variation in methods and to determine whether an EQAS for the detection of Acanthamoeba can be of value for the diagnostic process.

### A rare hepatic mass in an Italian resident [^1155Xuu9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) is a protozoan parasite with a simple lifecycle that can exists either in the cyst form that is ingested or in the amoeboid trophozoite stage that is responsible for the disease. Infection is usually taken with ingestion of the cysts in food or water previously contaminated by human faeces. Eh is distributed throughout the world and it represents a health risk in those places where barriers between human faeces and water or food are not adequate. Amoebiasis is the third most common cause of death from parasitic diseases, after schistosomiasis and malaria. Eh infection is endemic in several developing countries like India, Africa, Mexico, Central America, South America and Indonesia. Clinical manifestations may range from asymptomatic disease, that is the most common presentation, to invasive intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. Extra-intestinal manifestations are less frequent and characterized by a negative stool antigen detection. Amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is the most common extra-intestinal site of infection, but it occurs in less than 1% of Eh infections. Among symptoms, diarrhea, fever and right-upper quadrant pain and tenderness are the most common ones but also cough, chest pain and weight loss can be seen. In developed countries amoebiasis is a rare condition but epidemiologically growing, especially in high-risk groups such as travelers to and immigrants from endemic areas, men who have sex with men and patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies, e.g. HIV infection. Here we report a peculiar clinical case of ALA characterized by the absence of an evident source of infections, a silent clinical presentation and the presence of an extremely rare complication.

Results

Development and Characteristics of Data Sets

We established Taiwan Images for Malaria Eradication (TIME) data sets, which included 2 data sets: the development set for training and the clinical validation set for evaluating performance. Images in the development set were scanned from 26 blood smear slides (22 P falciparum –positive and 4 P falciparum –negative smears). Images in the clinical validation set were scanned from 10 blood smears (8 P falciparum –positive and 2 P falciparum –negative smears) (Figure 2). The development set included 6845 images from positive slides and 800 from negative slides that were randomly sampled from more than 812 000 raw scanned images. The clinical validation set included 400 images from positive slides and 100 from negative slides.

Figure 2.
Workflow of Data Set Establishment

Of the 7645 images in the development set, 4402 images (57.6%) were identified with 21 220 P falciparum –infected cells annotated, among which the 2 most common life-cycle stages were young trophozoite (ring form; 80.1%) and trophozoite (10.9%), followed by gametocyte (1.3%) and schizont (0.2%). Of the 500 images in the clinical validation set, 400 (80.0%) were identified with 3061 P falciparum –infected cells. The most common life-cycle stages were ring form (2909 [95.0%]) and trophozoite (117 [3.8%]) (Table). Both data sets had considerable variation in parasite density and the level of touching cells (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). For P falciparum –positive smears, the median number of parasite-infected cells per image was 2 (range, 1–68) in the development set and 4 (range, 1–60) in the clinical validation set.

### Antibodies to variable surface antigens induce antigenic variation in the intestinal parasite giardia lamblia [^113i1BPk]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Antigenic variation (AV) is a mechanism developed by parasitic microorganisms to change the expression of their highly immunogenic surface molecules. AV was discovered over a century agoand is considered an intrinsic process responsible for persistent and recurrent infections caused by unicellular microorganisms –.

Giardia lamblia colonises the lumen of the upper small intestine of vertebrates. Its life cycle includes environmentally resistant cysts and proliferating trophozoites, which attach to the gut surface and cause the clinical manifestations of giardiasis. Unlike other protozoan parasites, AV in Giardia was discovered as a phenomenon occurring in vitro(i.e. in the absence of any immune pressure) before being found to occur during animal infections, suggesting that spontaneous antigenic switching is an inherent characteristic of this parasite.

AV in Giardia involves VSPs, which cover the entire trophozoite surface and are the major antigens recognised by their hosts. VSPs are integral membrane proteins with antigenically variable ectodomains containing multiple CXXC motifs and a highly conserved C-terminal region comprising a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a short cytoplasmic tail (CT). The parasite genome encodes a repertoire of 136 VSPs, but only one is expressed on the surface of individual trophozoites at any time. Expression of a unique VSP is regulated post-transcriptionally by an RNAi-like mechanism and maintained epigenetically. However, why and how trophozoites change one VSP for another remains unknown.

As a major host response, the effect of antibodies against surface antigens has basically been studied in terms of their fate after binding to the cell surface. Many protozoa cope with surface-adhered antibodies by segregating them into "caps" or transferring the antigen/antibody complex to a "flagellar pocket" for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, thereby avoiding protozoan agglutination and opsonization –. If antibody concentrations exceed the capability to remove them, parasites might die by either complement-dependent or independent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity –. Similarly, antibodies against Giardia VSPs have extensively been reported to be cytotoxic.

AV occurs at very low rates in Giardia culturesand does not seem to occur in antibody-deficient hosts. During infections in immunocompetent individuals, however, if antibody-mediated killing is as efficient as it was found in vitro, the number of switchers should be too low to sustain chronic infections. Therefore, we hypothesised that the relationship between protozoan parasites and the host immune response is more complex than previously speculated and that antibodies play a significant role during AV.

Staining methods for Pneumocystis — techniques and recommendations: three types of stains can be used to identify Pneumocystis organisms, with the Gomori methenamine-silver method staining the cyst wall brown or black and Toluidine blue staining the cyst wall blue or lavender, while Giemsa, Diff-Quick, and Wright stains depict trophozoites and intracystic sporozoites pale blue with a punctate red nucleus but do not stain the cyst wall. Monoclonal immunofluorescent antibodies (MERIFLUOR, Meridian Bioscience, Inc.; Cincinnati, OH) that identify the cyst wall can be used for diagnosis and have enhanced specificity and sensitivity compared with the other staining methods, and a cyst wall, trophozoite, and immunofluorescent antibody stain is recommended for each specimen studied.

Transgenic parasites were cultured in T75 flasks, induced for in vitro sexual development by reduction of hematocrit as described elsewhere, and analyzed live by fluorescence microscopy. Morphological differentiation of individual gametocyte stages (stage I–V) was based on the classification by Hawking et al. GFP was expressed throughout sexual development starting at sexually committed schizont stages. In 744/GFP (A) and 748/GFP (B), fluorescence peaks during early development. In 164/GFP (C), fluorescence intensity increases during development, either through elevated expression levels and/or accumulation of GFP over time. Stage I gametocytes are indistinguishable from asexual trophozoites except for the presence of dispersed hemozoin crystals in the former.

### Invasive colonic entamoebiasis in wild cane toads, Australia [^1143Q2zY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The circumstances underlying the unprecedented mortality event and its implications require further investigation. Of paramount importance is determining the current distribution of OTU_12, its original host, and whether native frog populations are at risk from the disease. Isolating and culturing OTU_12 for reference material and morphologic characterization of cysts and trophozoites would facilitate further study. Determining whether changes in the environment, microbiome, or both cause Entamoeba to switch from commensal to pathogenic and the role the disease may play in controlling populations of cane toads also warrant further study.

### The DEAD-box RNA helicase PfDOZI imposes opposing actions on RNA metabolism in plasmodium falciparum [^1119E1DZ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In stark contrast to the more restricted functions of DOZI and its associated components (e.g. CITH and Alba4) in sexual development in the rodent parasites, our study uncovered a significant role of PfDOZI in mRNA metabolism during the IDC with the most noticeable effect observed in the ring and schizont stages. In the early IDC, the PfDOZI complex plays a major role in stabilizing transcripts involved in host cell modification, while its major function switches to RNA degradation in schizonts. The invasion-related genes, transcribed much earlier in trophozoites, may have to be translationally repressed and degraded before being translated "just-in-time" in the late schizont stage when they are needed. In P. yoelii, deletion of pyalba4, a stable component of the DOZI complex, led to a similar alteration in gene expression in schizonts with 251 upregulated and only four downregulated transcripts. These converging findings from the two parasites indicate a more prominent role of the DOZI complexes in RNA decay during the late IDC, which also explains the peak-level gene knockdown achieved in the schizont stage with the TetR-DOZI gene regulation system. Collectively, we have demonstrated that PfDOZI, like its metazoan orthologs, is a versatile regulator of mRNA metabolism, and these functions are dynamically regulated during development with stage-specific characteristics.

### Where have all the diagnostic morphological parasitologists gone? [^111bBGRD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Advances in laboratory techniques have revolutionized parasitology diagnostics over the past several decades. Widespread implementation of rapid antigen detection tests has greatly expanded access to tests for global parasitic threats such as malaria, while next-generation amplification and sequencing methods allow for sensitive and specific detection of human and animal parasites in complex specimen matrices. Recently, the introduction of multiplex panels for human gastrointestinal infections has enhanced the identification of common intestinal protozoa in feces along with bacterial and viral pathogens. Despite the benefits provided by novel diagnostics, increased reliance on nonmicroscopy-based methods has contributed to the progressive, widespread loss of morphology expertise for parasite identification. Loss of microscopy and morphology skills has the potential to negatively impact patient care, public health, and epidemiology. Molecular- and antigen-based diagnostics are not available for all parasites and may not be suitable for all specimen types and clinical settings. Furthermore, inadequate morphology experience may lead to missed and inaccurate diagnoses and erroneous descriptions of new human parasitic diseases. This commentary highlights the need to maintain expert microscopy and morphological parasitology diagnostic skills within the medical and scientific community. We proposed that light microscopy remains an important part of training and practice in the diagnosis of parasitic diseases and that efforts should be made to train the next generation of morphological parasitologists before the requisite knowledge, skills, and capacity for this complex and important mode of diagnosis are lost. In summary, the widespread, progressive loss of morphology expertise for parasite identification negatively impacts patient care, public health, and epidemiology.

### Cryo-EM structure of ribosome from pathogenic protozoa entamoeba histolytica reveals unique features of its architecture [^111YZ6bF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica, an anaerobic protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, bloody diarrhea, and liver abscesses in humans. Amoebiasis is more predominant in tropical areas with poor sanitation conditions, and it remains the fourth leading cause of death due to a protozoan infection. E. histolytica life cycle spans between an infective 'cyst stage' and an active disease-causing 'trophozoite stage'. We have isolated ribosomes from the trophozoite stage of E. histolytica. Here, we report single particle cryo-EM structures of the 53S ribosome large subunit (LSU), and 75S associated ribosomes, with P-tRNA, A/P and P/E tRNAs, and with paromomycin antibiotic, at 2.8 Å to 3.4 Å resolution. The E. histolytica possesses a reduced ribosome with a conserved core, and the periphery evolved with species-specific unique features. The most notable features are the presence of the rRNA triple helix near the peptide exit tunnel, the expansion segment H88ES102 near the exit site on LSU, and unique insertions in r-proteins. Furthermore, the 75S ribosome paromomycin complex structure provides the atomic details of its interactions. These structures provide insights into the evolutionary adaptation of the E. histolytica translational machinery and may be explored further for amoebicidal therapeutic intervention.

### A proteomic view of the plasmodium falciparum life cycle [^116ytE4T]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

The completion of the Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 genome provides a basis on which to conduct comparative proteomics studies of this human pathogen. Here, we applied a high-throughput proteomics approach to identify new potential drug and vaccine targets and to better understand the biology of this complex protozoan parasite. We characterized four stages of the parasite life cycle (sporozoites, merozoites, trophozoites and gametocytes) by multidimensional protein identification technology. Functional profiling of over 2,400 proteins agreed with the physiology of each stage. Unexpectedly, the antigenically variant proteins of var and rif genes, defined as molecules on the surface of infected erythrocytes, were also largely expressed in sporozoites. The detection of chromosomal clusters encoding co-expressed proteins suggested a potential mechanism for controlling gene expression.

### A lactate and formate transporter in the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum [^113d1VNy]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite relies primarily on glycolysis to fuel its rapid growth and reproduction. The major byproduct of this metabolism, lactic acid, is extruded into the external medium. In this study, we show that the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum expresses at its surface a member of the microbial formate-nitrite transporter family (PfFNT), which, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, transports both formate and lactate. The transport characteristics of PfFNT in oocytes (pH-dependence, inhibitor-sensitivity and kinetics) are similar to those of the transport of lactate and formate across the plasma membrane of mature asexual-stage P. falciparum trophozoites, consistent with PfFNT playing a major role in the efflux of lactate and hence in the energy metabolism of the intraerythrocytic parasite.

### Developmental stage-and cell cycle number-dependent changes in characteristics of plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte adherence to placental chondroitin-4-sulfate proteoglycan [^117WJq7B]. Infection and Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

The adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (IRBCs) in the human placenta is mediated by chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S). Although IRBC binding to C4S has been unequivocally established, the adherence characteristics of IRBCs at different stages of parasite development and through successive parasite generations after selection for C4S adherence are not known. Here we show that IRBCs acquire a significant capacity to bind to C4S at as early as 14 h and exhibit maximum binding at 22 to 26 h postinvasion. Surprisingly, the IRBC binding ability decreases by approximately 50% at the late trophozoite and schizont stages. The binding strength of the IRBCs also gradually decreases during successive generations after selection for C4S binding, and at the 32nd generation, the binding capacity was only approximately 31% of that of IRBCs at the 2nd generation, suggesting that IRBCs eventually lose their C4S-adherent capacity. We also tested the susceptibility of the adhesive protein(s) on the IRBC surface to trypsin treatment at different stages of parasite development. The data show that IRBCs with late trophozoites are more resistant to trypsin treatment than those containing early trophozoites, indicating that parasite proteins expressed on the IRBC surface during trophozoite maturation partially mask accessibility of adhesive protein for binding to C4S. These data provide important insights into the expression pattern of the C4S-adhesive protein(s) on the IRBC surface, emphasizing the need for understanding the regulation of genes involved in IRBC binding to C4S. Our data also define the parasite stage at which IRBCs are suitable for studying structural interactions with C4S.

### A time-resolved multi-omics atlas of acanthamoeba castellanii encystment [^111AgrRQ]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Encystment is one of the most prevalent differentiation processes in the living world. This response to environmental stress allows many unicellular organisms to transform into a dormant and protected form resistant to damage called a cyst. Among protists, most free-living and parasitic amoebae, such as Acanthamoeba castellanii and Entamoeba histolytica, can undergo encystment. This ensures species sustainability by allowing them to survive in the environment due to the high resilience of the cysts.

FLA are protists commonly found in water and soil. They are unicellular, chemoheterotrophic, and phagotrophic organisms. Some are amphizoic as they can live and thrive in the environment but can also invade humans. Some FLA cause opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections. For example, the genus Acanthamoeba was reported to cause fatal amoebic meningoencephalitis. Several Acanthamoeba species were also reported to cause a painful corneal disease named Acanthamoeba keratitis. This disease typically occurs in contact lens wearers, linked to poor contact lens hygiene, but also after trauma and contact with contaminated water.

Beyond the pathogenesis they directly induce, FLA are considered reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria. Indeed, FLA feed on bacteria by phagocytosis. These bacteria are mainly digested, but some of them, collectively named amoeba-resisting bacteria, can survive grazing by FLA. Bacteria that are retained within FLA cysts become de facto protected from biocides. In addition, some bacteria have been shown to become more virulent and more resistant to biocides and antibiotics after their passage through amoebae.

Although FLA are considered a public health concern, our knowledge regarding their encystment is currently limited. FLA life cycle can exhibit two forms: trophozoite and cyst. The trophozoite is the vegetative and biochemically active form that feeds and divides. Under adverse environmental conditions or stress, FLA differentiate from trophozoite to cyst, the resting form. This process named encystment is reversible, and FLA may excyst under favorable environmental conditions. The cyst of some FLA, such as Acanthamoeba, is highly resistant to various antimicrobial agents, disinfection agents, desiccation, and radiation.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113R5AcZ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia duodenalis — epidemiology and transmission notes that Giardia duodenalis (also known as Giardia lamblia or Giardia intestinalis) has a worldwide distribution and is the most common nationally reportable intestinal parasitic disease identified by public health laboratories in the United States, that surveillance data show a bimodal age distribution with the greatest number of reported cases occurring in children aged 1 to 9 years and adults aged 35 to 44 years, and that in the United States most cases are reported between early summer and early fall and are associated with recreational water activities (e.g., swimming) and camping; additionally, humans are the principal reservoir, G. duodenalis is a flagellated protozoan with two forms (trophozoites and cysts), after ingestion each Giardia cyst produces two trophozoites in the proximal portion of the small intestine and detached trophozoites form infectious cysts that are passed in feces, duration of cyst excretion is usually self-limited but can vary and excretion may last for months, and studies in adults have shown that ingestion of as few as 10 to 100 fecally derived cysts is sufficient to initiate infection.

### A 76-year-old male with multiple enhancing brain lesions [^1145ZDQT]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our case is unusual in that the patient was, to the best of our knowledge, immunocompetent. Given the multifocality of lesions seen on imaging, the clinical suspicion was for a metastatic tumor. Despite the unusual history, the clinical presentation and time course were classic. The time course was likely subacute, as both pleural and adrenal biopsies demonstrated granulomatous inflammation, without definite trophozoites. Upon histologic examination of the brain biopsies and identification of amoeba forms, tissue was sent for multiplex PCR, where the organism identification was confirmed. Ultimately, this case is a classic presentation of an uncommonly encountered form of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis.

### An overview of the laboratory diagnosis ofpneumonia [^116BgezZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pneumocystis jirovecii, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii, is an opportunistic fungal pathogen, first identified by Carlos Chagas in Brazil in 1909. Chagas studied the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi and mistakenly identified Pneumocystis cysts as a schizogonic form of T. cruzi in lung sections of guinea pigs. In 1912, a couple at the Pasteur Institute in France, Delanoe and Delanoe observed similar structures in Trypanosoma -free rats and proposed the name Pneumocystis carinii, deducing that they represented a new organism. The organism was named Pneumocystis carinii in honor of Antonio Carini, director of the Pasteur Institute.

P. carinii was initially classified as a protozoan, amidst intense debate, as the two unique forms of this organism, the ascus (cyst) and the trophic (trophozoite) life forms, resembled stages observed in a typical protozoa life cycle. The name of the human species, Pneumocystis jirovecii, was coined in 1976 in honor of Otto Jirovec, a Czechoslovak parasitologist and protozoologist, who linked this organism to epidemics of interstitial plasma cell pneumonia in neonates in Europe. P. jirovecii was ultimately reclassified as a member of the ascomycetous fungi Kingdom in 1988, after sequencing data showed homology with other fungal organisms.

P. jirovecii causes severe pneumonia, primarily in immunocompromised patients. The disease caused by P. jirovecii was originally referred to as PCP (P neumocystis c arinii p neumonia) in relation to its prior name. Although PJP (P neumocystis j irovecii p neumonia) is often used, the abbreviation PCP has persisted, standing for P neumo c ystis jirovecii p neumonia.

In this minireview, we briefly review the epidemiology and clinical presentation of PCP and describe current and emerging laboratory diagnostics for Pneumocystis jirovecii.

### Functional characterization of an interferon gamma receptor-like protein on entamoeba histolytica [^111hUk9C]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

In vivo effect of stimulatingtrophozoites with IFN-γ.

We next tested whether treatingwith IFN-γ affected the morphological development of amebic liver abscesses (ALA) in hamsters. Hamsters were inoculated with 5 × 10⁵ trophozoites pretreated or not with IFN-γ for 20 min. Livers of animals inoculated with untreated trophozoites showed the characteristic ALA lesions produced after 4 days, which were small and white and localized to the site of inoculation in the left liver lobe (Fig. 10B, arrows). In marked contrast, ALA produced by trophozoites pretreated with IFN-γ, but not by trophozoites treated with IFN-γ and anti-IFN-γ antibody, produced several granulomas that were distributed throughout the left liver lobe, with a few metastatic foci in other liver lobes (Fig. 10C and D). By histopathology, the lesions produced by untreated trophozoites and trophozoites treated with IFN-γ and anti-IFN-γ antibody showed characteristic ALA granulomas that had a central necrotic region with edges of intense inflammatory infiltrates bordering healthy liver tissues (Fig. 11A and B). The lesions produced bytrophozoites pretreated with IFN-γ (Fig. 11C) show significantly larger areas of necrosis (Fig. 11D), with several peripheral small granulomas (Fig. 11C, yellow arrows). By immunohistochemistry, trophozoites are readily seen at the periphery of the lesions (Fig. 12A and B, yellow arrows), and in lesions caused by trophozoites pretreated with IFN-γ, trophozoites were found in the lesion walls and in close proximity to healthy liver tissues (Fig. 12C, inset, yellow arrow).

### Sequential roles for red blood cell binding proteins enable phased commitment to invasion for malaria parasites [^111AW8Lf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Malaria threatens almost half the globe, with six species of Plasmodium parasites causing significant disease in humans. Symptoms result from the blood stage of the parasite's life cycle when motile merozoites invade red blood cells (RBCs), multiply within them, and then burst out (egress) to release new invasive merozoites. Since blocking invasion prevents parasite replication, a detailed understanding of how merozoites invade RBCs is essential to develop clinical interventions, such as vaccines and antibody therapies.

Video microscopy studies of P. knowlesi (Pk), and later P. falciparum (Pf), revealed merozoite invasion is a rapid process (~60 s) with several morphologically-defined steps. First, the merozoite and RBC form a weak and reversible binding interaction, which quickly progresses into a stronger interaction causing the RBC to deform and 'wrap' around the merozoite. This may facilitate 're-orientation' with realigning its apical end that houses specialised secretory organelles, micronemes and rhoptries, in perpendicular apposition to the RBC surface. Work in Pf identified a further step: fusion between the merozoite's apex and the RBC before internalisation, visualised as a fluorescent signal at the parasite-host cell interface when RBCs are pre-loaded with a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye. Then, the merozoite actomyosin motor actively drives the parasite into the parasitophorous vacuole formed by invagination of the RBC membrane. Invasion usually results in RBC echinocytosis, triggered by secretion of rhoptry contents or by perturbation of RBC homeostasis. Within minutes the RBC returns to its biconcave shape, marking the end of a successful invasion

### Malaria parasites regulate intra-erythrocytic development duration via serpentine receptor 10 to coordinate with host rhythms [^112VP4V3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Time points and biological replicates (n = 2) were clustered using hierarchical clustering in R software environment with Pearson correlations from normalized count values as input and agglomerative hierarchical clustering function "hclust" (option ward.D2) was used for cluster generation. The linear histogram plots representing phase distribution of cycling transcripts were generated using Oriana. PCA was performed on voom-TMM normalized data using princomp in R software environment.

To determine the overall FDR of transcripts with daily rhythms in the host-circadian rhythm mismatching experiment, the time points of collection were randomly permuted 1000 times and the number of transcripts with daily rhythms was assessed for each of the permutations by both the programs used. We observed that in every permutation, the number of rhythmic transcripts detected was less than the observed number of rhythmic transcripts detected when the samples were in correct order of sampling. A similar approach to determine the FDR was used by Rijo-Ferreira et al. This was done for both matched and mismatched parasite datasets, where p < 0.05 was used as a cut-off to identify genes with daily rhythms.

Analysis of parasite developmental rhythmicity

The early trophozoite stage was used as the marker stage because it is both easily identifiable and has developmental duration similar to other stages. Rhythmicities in the proportion of parasites at early trophozoite stages was determined by Fourier transformed harmonic regression in Circwave. A cosine wave was fitted to data from each individual infection and compared to a straight line at the mean via an F -test. The period was allowed to change between 18 and 30 h (i.e. 24 h ± two sampling periods for the host rhythm mismatch experiment and one sampling period for the analysis of sr10 KO strains) and the fit was considered significant if the adjusted (to account for multiple tests for different periods) p value was greater than the alpha of 0.017. General linear models were used to determine if the characteristics of rhythms varied according to treatment and parasite strain (using the package lme4 in R version 3.4.0).

### Molecular markers for sensitive detection ofAsexual stage parasites and their application in a malaria clinical trial [^117EeCBz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Validation of specificity and sensitivity of ring-stage trophozoite and gametocyte markers using in vitro material.

The selected markers were validated on synchronous asexual parasite and gametocyte cultures providing early ring-stage trophozoites (10-hour postsynchronization), late ring-stage trophozoites (20 hours), and mature gametocyte (9 days) samples. Parasite concentrations between 10⁶ and 10¹ parasites/mL were tested.

As expected, 18S DNA was detected in early ring-stage trophozoites, late ring-stage trophozoites, and stage V gametocytes with a limit of detection of 10 parasites/mL (Figure 1A). 18S RNA was detected with similar transcript levels in early and late ring-stage trophozoites and gametocytes (Figure 1B). Pfs25 transcripts were detected in stage V gametocytesat concentrations as low as 100 gametocytes/mL, whereas the highest ring-stage trophozoite concentration (10⁶ parasites/mL) also showed Pfs25 transcript detection. RESA transcripts were more abundantly present in ring-stage trophozoites but were also detected in stage V gametocytes with a limit of detection of ∼10,000 gametocytes/mL (Figure 1D), making it a less suitable trophozoite-specific candidate. SBP1 was detected in all parasite stages. Although transcript levels were higher in ring-stage trophozoites, gametocyte concentrations ≥ 10,000 gametocytes/mL had detectable SBP1 transcripts in our in vitro assays (Figure 1E). REX1 was specific for ring-stage trophozoites; only the highest concentration of gametocytes (10⁶ parasites/mL) showed a detectable signal for REX1 (Figure 1F). However, REX1 was generally less sensitive for ring-stage trophozoite detection compared with other markers with a limit of detection of 10,000 parasites/mL (Figure 1F). PHISTb shared a similar specificity with REX1, detecting exclusively asexual parasites (Figure 1G) and only parasite densities ≥ 10,000 parasites/mL had detectable amplification.

### Molecular insights into Vibrio cholerae's intra-amoebal host-pathogen interactions [^111yw4qk]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

It was proposed that hlyA might be located on a pathogenicity island due to the close proximity of additional genes that likewise encode extracellular enzymes. This region encodes apart from hemolysin (hlyA) a lipase (lipA), a metalloprotease (prtV), and a lecithinase/phospholipase (lec; also known as thermolabile hemolysin). The lecithinase activity of the latter enzyme was characterized, but molecular details and its concrete function are still unknown.

To date, a limited number of studies have shown that minor virulence factors, such as those mentioned above, are also advantageous in an environmental context. Indeed, despite V. cholerae being an aquatic bacterium that is well adapted for survival in this environment, the molecular details about V. cholerae 's environmental lifestyle are still lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that V. cholerae would use as part of its environmental lifestyle, such as its interactions with grazing amoebal predators. In this context, we recently demonstrated that V. cholerae survives predation by Acanthamoeba castellanii, a free-living amoebal species. This amoeba is frequently encountered in aquatic reservoirs and follows a bi-phasic lifecycle: the motile trophozoite form, which grazes on bacterial prey, and the double-walled resistant cyst stage, which forms under harsh conditions. We previously showed that V. cholerae interacts with A. castellanii through the evolution of two distinct phenotypes. Firstly, upon phagocytosis by the feeding amoebal trophozoite, a fraction of the ingested V. cholerae population can resist amoebal digestion, then exit the phagosomal pathway by exocytosis. Notably and in contrast to a previous study, we never observed free V. cholerae cells in the cytosol of such trophozoites, indicating that the bacteria are not released from food vacuoles intracellularly. Secondly, the pathogen colonizes the amoeba's contractile vacuole (CV), which is its osmoregulatory organelle. This organelle expands and contracts in a rhythmic manner based on the accumulation and expulsion of excess water from the cytosol of the cell. While there is still a significant knowledge gap with respect to the detailed mechanisms underlying its osmoregulatory function, it is currently thought that water enters the CV due to a ~1.5 times higher osmolarity of the CV fluid compared to that of the cytosol. The water discharge process, on the other hand, is based on the fusion of the CV and the plasma membrane, a process that is actively driven by myosin-I. This discharge process is essential, as interference with the water expulsion leads to an overfilling of the CV and, ultimately, amoebal cell lysis. With respect to V. cholerae, we recently showed that the bacterium enters this organelle through vacuolar fusion of V. cholerae -containing food vacuoles with the CV. This creates a replication niche for the pathogen in which V. cholerae is maintained even upon amoebal encystement, before it ultimately lyses the host. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this host–pathogen interaction remained elusive and were therefore addressed in the current study. We show that V. cholerae fine-tunes extracellular enzymes to avoid premature intoxication of its host, allowing the bacterium to take full advantage of the intra-amoebal replication niche for undisturbed and non-competitive proliferation before finally lysing its amoebal host. We also demonstrate that flagellum-based motility is of importance for V. cholerae to ultimately escape the ruptured host niche to return to the aquatic environment.

### Migration through host cells by apicomplexan parasites [^115V82Hr]. Microbes and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

In what appears to be an essential prelude to establish a successful infection in the mammalian host, Plasmodium sporozoites move rapidly through several host cells breaching the cell plasma membranes in the process. This mode of invasion precedes the 'traditional' mode in which the sporozoite enters by invagination of the host cell membrane and develops within a parasitophorous vacuole. Here we revisit the existing literature that supports the presence of similar invasive behaviors in other apicomplexan parasites.

### Plasmodium myosin A drives parasite invasion by an atypical force generating mechanism [^111Qj3Lg]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by obligate protozoan parasites from the genus Plasmodium. Despite global efforts to control the disease, malaria is still responsible for half a million deaths each year, with the vast majority of mortality caused by P. falciparum. During its complex life-cycle, the parasite transforms through motile and non-motile stages in its two hosts: human and mosquito (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The sporozoite stage that establishes infection, is injected into the dermis following the bite of an infected female mosquito from the genus Anopheles. This elongated and highly motile parasite form reaches dermal capillaries and is rapidly transported to the liver, where it targets and infects hepatocytes. Within hepatocytes the parasite grows and divides, eventually releasing tens of thousands of merozoite forms en masse into the blood stream. Merozoites, in contrast to sporozoites, are relatively non-motile stages that specifically target erythrocytes, where they develop and lead to all symptoms associated with malaria disease. Beyond this asexual replicative stage of development, some parasites switch commitment to develop into sexual forms (following an as yet unknown signal) producing male and female gametocytes that re-establish mosquito infection on the next bite(Supplementary Fig. 1a). Whilst anti-malarials are available, resistance to all frontline drugs, including combination therapies based on artemisinin, continues to emerge(Supplementary Fig. 1a), reinforcing the need to find drugs with new modes of action.

### Cyst-wall-protein-1 is fundamental for golgi-like organelle neogenesis and cyst-wall biosynthesis in giardia lamblia [^116Akvet]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

G. lamblia is an intestinal protozoan parasite with a strict requirement for differentiation to a cyst stage and back to a trophozoite for transmission to a new host. Genetic manipulation of Giardia has been established for over two decades with first attempts by electroporation and selection of circular plasmid episomes, followed by strategies using Giardia virus RNA as a vector, and finally integration of linear vector DNA for modification of chromosomal DNA. Recently, genome engineering using the Cre/ loxP system has allowed elimination of a single allele followed by the removal of the selection marker from the chromosomal DNA. In the attempt to perform functional characterizations of target genes, tools for depletion of target mRNA stability and/or inhibition of translation were developed and adapted to Giardia. It is important to note that these approaches cannot ensure absence of any given protein since mRNA depletion was reported at anywhere between 22 and 70% (refs,), with the strong likelihood of ambiguous results in phenotypic analyses. In addition to expression control, ectopic expression of dominant-negative variants of GTPases was used in some instances to disrupt protein function and elicit quantifiable phenotypes. The availability of only two highly effective antibiotic resistance markers for selection of transgenesand the organization of the genomic DNA of trophozoites in two diploid nuclei has made engineering of G. lamblia knock-out lines by ablation of all four target gene alleles very challenging. Here, we report on how we addressed this limitation using a method for serial locus disruption based on the Cre/ loxP system. By targeting CWP1, we took advantage of the strict stage-specific regulation of CWP1 expression, in addition to established markers and morphological landmarks associated with the entire process of cyst formationfor the analysis of a Δcwp1 phenotype. Together with Trypanosoma brucei, G. lamblia is the only other species within the Excavata supergroup in which genome editing was performed to address questions on pathogen transmission.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111KqN3n]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### Case report: cervicovaginal Co-colonization withandin association with an intrauterine device [^116bdKti]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Amoebic trophozoites were identified in the cervicovaginal smear of a U.S. patient without travel history at the time of intrauterine device (IUD) removal. Subsequent morphologic analysis and DNA sequencing identified a mixed cervicovaginal colonization of the female genital tract with both Entamoeba gingivalis and Entamoeba polecki in association with Actinomyces species bacteria. This highlights to the potential for colonization of the genital tract with E. gingivalis, particularly in association with IUD placement, and represents the first report of E. polecki in this context.

### The motility of entamoeba histolytica: finding ways to understand intestinal amoebiasis [^111vUUWk]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The pathogenic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica is able to migrate within various compartments of the human body. The present article reviews progress in understanding the mechanisms of cell motility in E. histolytica during human intestinal invasion and, in particular, how the three-dimensional characteristics of the environment regulate the parasite's behaviour. The amoeboid mode of migration that applies to E. histolytica's displacements on two-dimensional surfaces is also expected to apply to the three-dimensional environment in the human intestine although several unknown, distinct modalities may be involved. Recent advances in the field of tissue engineering have provided clues on how the construction of a human colon model could help us to understand the host's intestinal physiology and its changes following amoebic infection.

### Investigating the pathogenesis of severe malaria: a multidisciplinary and cross-geographical approach [^112VFQ52]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

More than a century after the discovery of Plasmodium spp. parasites, the pathogenesis of severe malaria is still not well understood. The majority of malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, which differ in virulence, red blood cell tropism, cytoadhesion of infected erythrocytes, and dormant liver hypnozoite stages. Cerebral malaria coma is one of the most severe manifestations of P. falciparum infection. Insights into its complex pathophysiology are emerging through a combination of autopsy, neuroimaging, parasite binding, and endothelial characterizations. Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding why some patients develop life-threatening conditions while the majority of P. falciparum-infected individuals do not, and why clinical presentations differ between children and adults. For P. vivax, there is renewed recognition of severe malaria, but an understanding of the factors influencing disease severity is limited and remains an important research topic. Shedding light on the underlying disease mechanisms will be necessary to implement effective diagnostic tools for identifying and classifying severe malaria syndromes and developing new therapeutic approaches for severe disease. This review highlights progress and outstanding questions in severe malaria pathophysiology and summarizes key areas of pathogenesis research within the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research program.

### Plasmodium blood stage development requires the chromatin remodeller snf2L [^112N5y1C]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Endogenous C-terminal tagging of Pf Snf2L in 3D7 parasites reveals its expression during all asexual blood stages, peaking in the late-ring/trophozoite stage (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of Pf Snf2L showed nuclear localization with uneven distributed in the nucleoplasm and spots of local enrichment (Fig. 1e). Pf Snf2L immunoprecipitation (IP) combined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis identifies specific interactions with proteins associated with chromatin organization (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Table 1). In total, we detected 21 Apicomplexan- or Plasmodium -specific proteins, including several uncharacterized proteins. Neither the IP experiment nor in silico attempts identify orthologues of characteristic subunits of ISWI-type complexes in P. falciparum, pointing towards the existence of novel, divergent CRE complexes. Some detected interactors are associated with transcriptional regulation and chromatin assembly, remodelling and organization (Fig. 1f). For example, the FACT complex has an important role in nucleosome assembly during transcription elongation, while CAF and NAP proteins function in replication-coupled assembly. Other likely interactors are one or more versions of the GCN5 complex, as multiple GCN5 complex subunits are detected in the Pf Snf2L IP, and their interaction has been confirmed in a GCN5 IP study. These results reveal a role for Pf Snf2L in nucleosome assembly and imply chromatin-dependent regulation of gene expression –.

Amoebiasis

The parasite, its cycle, and human infection

Amoebiasis is widely spread all over the world, but is more prevalent in India, the Far East, Africa, and Central and South America. It is mainly caused by the Entamoeba histolytica protozoa. Other amoeboids such as Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba astronyxis, and Balamuthia mandrilaris can also cause human infections. Humans become infected by ingestion of contaminated food or water containing amoebic cysts. These cysts become trophozoites that invade the bowel wall mucosa entering the portal circulation.

E. histolytica infects the gastrointestinal tract sometimes remaining in a latent stage for many years, but other times it can cause more aggressive forms of the disease ranging from colitis to dysentery, or liver, thoracic, and more rarely brain abscesses and meningoencephalitis.

### Induction of multidrug tolerance in plasmodium falciparum by extended artemisinin pressure [^111TMC7b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin derivatives in Southeast Asia threatens global malaria control strategies. Whether delayed parasite clearance, which exposes larger parasite numbers to artemisinins for longer times, selects higher-grade resistance remains unexplored. We investigated whether long-lasting artemisinin pressure selects a novel multidrug-tolerance profile. Although 50% inhibitory concentrations for 10 antimalarial drugs tested were unchanged, drug-tolerant parasites showed higher recrudescence rates for endoperoxides, quinolones, and an antifolate, including partner drugs of recommended combination therapies, but remained susceptible to atovaquone. Moreover, the age range of intraerythrocytic stages able to resist artemisinin was extended to older ring forms and trophozoites. Multidrug tolerance results from drug-induced quiescence, which enables parasites to survive exposure to unrelated antimalarial drugs that inhibit a variety of metabolic pathways. This novel resistance pattern should be urgently monitored in the field because this pattern is not detected by current assays and represents a major threat to antimalarial drug policy.

### Cyst-wall-protein-1 is fundamental for golgi-like organelle neogenesis and cyst-wall biosynthesis in giardia lamblia [^112SFoY5]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Deposition of an extracellular matrix is a common strategy for intestinal protozoan parasites to survive outside a host. The underlying matrix architecture of most of these environmentally resistant infectious forms consists of a tightly woven glycan mesh complexed with abundant and extensively cross-linked protein. These mechanically and chemically resistant biopolymers protect parasites after excretion into the outside world and during stomach passage after ingestion by a new host. The cyst wall (CW) of G. lamblia is disassembled during stomach passage, allowing for emergence of a non-adherent precursor cell in the duodenum, which divides twice rapidly to form four flagellated trophozoites, which in turn initiate the new infection in the small intestine.

Encystation of G. lamblia trophozoites is induced by increased pH and lack of available lipids in the distal ileum. These conditions can be replicated in vitro where they initiate a differentiation process driven by the synthesis, trafficking, maturation and deposition of three cyst-wall proteins (CWPs 1–3), complexed with a unique β-1,3-linked N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) glycan polymer. Unlike the CW glycan synthesis pathway, which is up-regulated during encystation, the genes coding for CWPs are completely silenced in trophozoites and transcribed only in encysting cells. Accumulation of CWPs 1–3 in unique Golgi-like organelles called encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs) after export via distinct endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites initiates the stage-specific, de novo establishment of a regulated secretory pathway in encysting cells. After post-translational modifications of CWPs, and partitioning within ESVs, the mature cyst-wall material (CWM) is sorted into two biophysically and functionally distinct fractions that are secreted sequentially onto the plasma membrane to form a bi-layered CW. Although the role played by the acidic tail of CWP2 in promoting condensed core formation in maturing ESVs has been described, we know very little about the individual contribution of each CWP to CW formation.

### Medical parasitology taxonomy update: January 2012 to December 2015 [^111WJA6G]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Parasites of medical importance have long been classified taxonomically by morphological characteristics. However, molecular-based techniques have been increasingly used and relied on to determine evolutionary distances for the basis of rational hierarchal classifications. This has resulted in several different classification schemes for parasites and changes in parasite taxonomy. The purpose of this Minireview is to provide a single reference for diagnostic laboratories that summarizes new and revised clinically relevant parasite taxonomy from January 2012 through December 2015.

### Fatal naegleria fowleri meningoencephalitis, Italy [^116pEByD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Figure 1
A) Computed tomographic scan: note the right fronto-basal collection (arrow) with a midline shift right to left. B) Brain histology: three large clusters of amebic vegetative forms are seen (H-E stain, x 250). Inset: Positive indirect immunofluorescent analysis on tissue section with anti– Naegleria fowleri serum.

Autopsy was performed 30 hours postmortem after obtaining permission from the parents. Body development was normal, and no chronic diseases were evident. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, and other abdominal viscera showed no abnormalities. Gross neuropathologic findings consisted of swollen and edematous brain with opaque and congested leptomeninges. A cerebellar tonsillar herniation and soft, easily breakable frontal lobes were found. Coronal sections of cerebral hemispheres showed diffuse and multiple foci of hemorrhagic necrosis in both gray and white matter. A preliminary histopathologic examination showed a massive and diffuse inflammatory infiltrate, characterized by a high number of neutrophils, few eosinophils or macrophages, and numerous large clusters of cells that morphologically resembled amebic vegetative forms, tentatively classified as Entamoeba or Naegleria.

When the case was referred to the parasitology laboratory (Infectious Diseases Department, Pavia University Hospital), a definitive diagnosis of PAM was made on the basis of morphology of amebic trophozoites, which exhibited a conspicuous karyosome, a vacuolated cytoplasm, and a mean diameter of 10 µm to 12 µm. Amebic trophozoites were present in high numbers, often located in perivascular spaces (Figure 1 B), and cysts were conspicuously absent, a characteristic feature of PAM.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded slides and frozen brain specimens were also sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) for final identification and characterization of the species. Based on the reactivity of amebas in tissue sections with anti– Naegleria fowleri serum in indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) analysis (Figure 1 B, inset), the etiologic agent was identified as N. fowleri.

### Recent insights into apicomplexan parasite egress provide new views to a kill [^114auXmQ]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

A hallmark of apicomplexan pathogens such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium is that they invade, replicate within, and then egress from their host cells. Egress usually results in lysis of the host cell, with deleterious consequences for the host. In the case of malaria, for example, much of the disease pathology is associated with cyclical waves of host erythrocyte destruction. This review highlights recent advances in mapping the signaling pathways that lead to egress and the parasite molecules involved in responding to and transmitting those signals. The review also discusses new findings for effector molecules that mediate disruption of the bounding membranes that enclose the intracellular parasite and the manner in which membrane rupture occurs to finally release invasive forms of the parasite.

### Molecular markers for sensitive detection ofAsexual stage parasites and their application in a malaria clinical trial [^114yvuEU]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Selection of novel ring-stage trophozoite markers and primer design and validation.

Novel ring-stage trophozoite markers were identified from a recent computational approach to determine stage specificity of P. falciparum transcripts, determining the ratio of early ring-stage trophozoite expression over gametocyte expression. Among the genes with the highest differential expression, we selected potential targets specific to ring-stage trophozoites that showed the highest expression levels in asexual stages, and that had an intron. In addition to these potential markers, we tested two previously reported ring-stage trophozoite markers, RESA (PF3D7_0102200)and SBP1by qRT-PCR. Primers were designed in an intron-spanning fashion whenever possible to avoid amplification of genomic DNA while avoiding the requirement for a digest step; multiple primer sets were tested to select primers resulting in the most sensitive, linear amplification (and Figure 1

Amplification efficiency and limit of detection of the primers were assessed by cloning the PCR-amplified products into the pTOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Thermoscientific, Boston, MA) by strictly following the manufacturer's protocol (and Table 1

### Detection of protozoan and helminth parasites in concentrated wet mounts of stool using a deep convolutional neural network [^112tMH7K]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing global burden of parasitic diseases continues to demand sensitive laboratory testing for appropriate detection and management of these organisms. With increased global travel and recent mass human migration/displacement events, lab testing is even more critical today for laboratories outside of regions traditionally endemic for many parasites. Despite advancements in diagnostic methods such as antigen detection, nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAATs), and genomic-based assays in both clinical microbiology and parasitology specifically, manual microscopy remains the gold standard for the detection and identification of most parasites. Unfortunately, traditional parasitology faces numerous challenges in the clinical laboratory, such as the length of time it takes to be competent or proficient in the discipline and, in turn, maintaining competency when dealing with staff turnover. It is also laborious, time-consuming, and interpretation is largely subjective. Being a sub-discipline of applied zoology, parasitology requires a deep understanding of anatomy, biology, taxonomy, and epidemiology, adding additional challenges to maintaining competency.

Traditional stool microscopy for parasitology involves the ova-and-parasite (O&P) exam, which consists of a concentrated wet mount for detecting helminth eggs/larvae and protozoan cysts, and a permanent stained smear for detecting protozoan cysts and trophozoites; however, in many parts of the world, only wet mounts are performed. Because of progress seen in areas such as infrastructure, sanitation, health care, and hygiene and personal habits, fewer parasite cases are seen in developed countries. Those infections that are seen are often in immigrants from, or people who traveled to, areas with a higher incidence of endemic parasitic diseases. As such, laboratorians can spend considerable time manually examining stool specimens only to see positive rates of 2%–5%. Over time, this can lead to low job satisfaction, fatigue, and "burnout", which can lead to diagnostic errors.

Since traditional parasitology still relies on the recognition and identification of morphological features, digital microscopy and artificial intelligence provide an excellent opportunity to assist in the screening and detection of clinical specimens for parasites. Proof-of-concept technologies have been described, but there are very few commercially available assays available for detecting and identifying gastrointestinal parasites.

The work described here represents a functional extension of a 2020 study; this time, it analyzed the wet mount portion of the O&P exam using a novel detection model and an additional scanner system. The goal of this study was to demonstrate improved sensitivity for the detection of parasites in true-positive specimens while reducing the need to review true-negative specimens on a microscope.

### Prevalence and characteristics of plasmodium vivax gametocytes in duffy-positive and duffy-negative populations across Ethiopia [^117RHe4j]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Most of the infections had mixed parasite stages, and the proportion of parasite stages varied among regions. In the SNNPR, 71 of 140 (50.7%) P. vivax samples had trophozoites; 66 (47.1%) had mixed trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte stages; and three (2.1%) had gametocytes only. In Oromia, 99 of the 118 (83.9%) P. vivax samples had trophozoites; followed by 16 (13.6%) with mixed trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte stages; and three (2.5%) with gametocytes only. In Amhara, a similar proportion was observed, where 44 of 85 (51.8%) P. vivax samples had mixed trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte stages; followed by 40 (47.1%) with trophozoites; and one (1.2%) with gametocytes. In Benishangul/Gumuz, 16 of 21 (76.2%) P. vivax samples had trophozoites and five (23.8%) had mixed trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte stages. In Gambella, 4 of 15 (2.7%) P. vivax samples had trophozoites and 11 of 15 (73.3%) had trophozoites mixed with gametocytes. In Afar, all five mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum samples had trophozoites. In Sidama, the two P. vivax samples had mixed trophozoite, schizont, and gametocyte stages. Overall, almost all samples had trophozoites and mixed stages across study sites (Figure 3).

### Sequential roles for red blood cell binding proteins enable phased commitment to invasion for malaria parasites [^116BPmKR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

While deformation strength is predictive of invasion success, it is unclear what factors determine a merozoite's ability to initiate deformation. Pk merozoites frequently contact many human RBCs before commitment to invasion. The deformation scores of interactions occurring prior to interactions resulting in invasion ('intermediate interactions' in Fig. 1b) are comparable to those for interactions made by merozoites which never invade ('Non-invader events'). Fewer 'intermediate interactions' are observed when Pk merozoites invade macaque RBCs, which are highly permissive to Pk invasion — suggesting that deformation strength is an indicator of host cell 'suitability' (for example, receptor availability or deformability), rather than merozoite 'readiness' to invade. A significant fraction of gliding interactions on human RBCs (44/134 events) did not progress to deformation (e.g. blue arrow in Supplementary movie 2; Fig. 1a). Thus, whilst gliding is required for deformation, deformation of RBC membranes is not a prerequisite for traversal of RBC surfaces.

### Improving basic skills in celiac-like disease diagnosis: a case report [^116YxwYA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of Coeliac disease (CD) requires a combination of sign/symptoms, positivity of specific antibodies and duodenal histological evidence of villous atrophy. Duodenal villous atrophy, despite representing the CD landmark, is not specific since it is found in many gastrointestinal disorders. Giardiasis is one of the most common human intestinal protozoan infestations in industrialized countries whose histological duodenal mucosa damage could mimic that of CD. The present report shows how a wise clinical and laboratory assessment led us shortly to a correct diagnosis.

Case Presentation

A 42-year-old outpatient woman without previous significant gastrointestinal diseases, was referred with dyspeptic symptoms, fatigue and mild diarrhea from 4 months. Her first investigations including immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) and stool parasitological and cultural analysis were negative. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) showed no mucosal alteration. But histology demonstrated a Helicobacter Pylori (HP) pan-gastritis while duodenal mucosa showed villous atrophy consistent with a diagnosis of CD Marsh type 3b. While on gluten-free diet (GFD) the patient didn't experience any improvement of symptoms. Duodenal biopsies were then reviewed showing the presence of trophozoites of Giardia on the luminal surface of the duodenal wall and at the same time, a second stool examination revealed the presence of trophozoites and cysts of Giardia. Treated with metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 6 days the patient reduced diarrhea after few days. After about 2 months of GFD she was invited to discontinue it. At the same time stool examination was repeated with negative results. She subsequently performed eradication for Hp with triple therapy (Pylera®). Around 6 months later, the patient did not complain any gastrointestinal symptoms. Serological tests were normal and at a follow-up EGDS, duodenal mucosa had normal histology with normal finger-like villi and absence of Giardia trophozoites.

Conclusion

This case report shows how CD diagnosis can sometimes be manifold. Intestinal villous atrophy alone may not automatically establish a diagnosis of CD. In the present case the clinical scenario could be fully explained by giardiasis. Indeed, different diagnostic tools and a multi-step approaches have been used to determine the final correct diagnosis.

### Antibodies to variable surface antigens induce antigenic variation in the intestinal parasite giardia lamblia [^115hnHGU]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the intestinal parasite G. lamblia, anti-VSP antibodies may cause not only antigenic switching at early stages of antibody production by the host but also parasite detachment from the gut epithelium when antibody concentrations increase during infections. Due to peristalsis, agglutinated trophozoites can thus reach the lower portions of the small intestine, where they differentiate into cysts. Released cysts containing trophozoites already expressing different VSPs are prone to reinfect the same individual and expand the range of potential hosts.

Since many pathogenic protozoa regulate the expression of a unique variant by post-transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, antibodies might reset these control systems through an increase of intracellular [Ca 2+], which may likely occur occasionally in culture. However, regardless of the mechanisms each pathogen uses to switch its surface antigens, one tempting hypothesis is that the antibody-stimulated release of MVs produces stochastic changes in the cytoplasmic levels of specific molecules in individual cells, resetting the epigenetically controlled antigen-expression program. This possibility might explain the stochastic nature of the switching response and the need for an increasing antibody exposure to complete antigenic switching of the whole parasite population.

In sum, our results demonstrate a host-induced tuning of AV, which has significant consequences for understanding the course of protozoan infections and the propensity for multiple reinfections.

### Practice bulletin no. 151: cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster, and toxoplasmosis in pregnancy [^114xwQSv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Toxoplasmosis — organism, transmission, clinical features, and fetal risk in pregnancy: Toxoplasmosis is caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii), which exists as a trophozoite (invasive form) and as latent cyst or oocyst. Human infection is acquired by consumption of cysts in undercooked meat, insect-contaminated food, contact with oocysts from the feces of infected cats, or contact with infected materials or insects in soil. Infection is usually asymptomatic after an incubation period of 5–18 days, with symptoms occurring in only 10–20% of infected adults, most often presenting as asymptomatic cervical lymphadenopathy. Parasitemia can seed the placenta in pregnancy and cause fetal infection. Without treatment, the overall risk of congenital toxoplasmosis ranges from 20% to 50%, and vertical transmission increases from 10% to 15% in the first trimester, to 25% in the second trimester, and to more than 60% in the third trimester. The severity of fetal infection depends on gestational age at transmission, with earlier infection being more severe. Most infected infants lack clinical signs at birth, but as many as 90% will develop sequelae.

### G protein signaling in the parasite entamoeba histolytica [^114GqYGH]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Parasite factors in pathogenesis

A number of E. histolytica molecular components have been thoroughly established as contributors to its pathogenesis. During initial intestinal colonization, E. histolytica adheres to the colonic mucin layer primarily through a galactose-inhibitable lectin, known as the Gal/GalNAc lectin (reviewed in Petri et al.). The trimeric surface protein is also a dominant factor in parasite attachment to host cells and subsequent tissue destruction and functions interdependently with the dynamic actin cytoskeleton of E. histolytica. Trophozoites also secrete pore-forming peptides known as 'amebapores' that assemble within host cell membranes to trigger cell death (reviewed in Leippe and Herbst). A relatively large family of E. histolytica -encoded cysteine proteases also contributes to host cell killing, as well as degradation of the host extracellular matrix during invasive amebic infection and evasion of the host immune response through proteolysis of immunoglobulins and complement (reviewed in Que and Reed). Many regulators of the actin-rich cytoskeleton within E. histolytica are also emerging as contributors to pathogenesis-related processes, such as phagocytosis of host cells, trophozoite motility and tissue invasion, and shedding of host antibodies by surface receptor capping (reviewed in Voight and Guillen, Tavares et al. Meza et al. and Labruyere and Guillen).

### Entamoeba histolytica: a snapshot of current research and methods for genetic analysis [^115stYf2]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Entamoeba histolytica represents one of the leading causes of parasitic death worldwide. Although identified as the causative agent of amebiasis since 1875, the molecular mechanisms by which the parasite causes disease are still not fully understood. Studying Entamoeba reveals insights into a eukaryotic cell that differs in many ways from better-studied model organisms. Thus, much can be learned from this protozoan parasite on evolution, cell biology, and RNA biology. In this review we discuss selected research highlights in Entamoeba research and focus on the development of molecular biological techniques to study this pathogen. We end by highlighting some of the many questions that remain to be answered in order to fully understand this important human pathogen.

### Disruption of antigenic variation is crucial for effective parasite vaccine [^113a5V2g]. Nature Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Giardia lamblia is a human intestinal pathogen. Like many protozoan microorganisms, Giardia undergoes antigenic variation, a mechanism assumed to allow parasites to evade the host's immune response, producing chronic and/or recurrent infections. Recently, we found that the mechanism controlling variant-specific surface protein (VSP) switching in Giardia involves components of the RNA interference machinery and that disruption of this pathway generates trophozoites simultaneously expressing many VSPs. Here we use these altered trophozoites to determine the role of antigenic variation in a gerbil model of giardiasis. Our results show that either primary infection with trophozoites simultaneously expressing many VSPs or immunization with purified VSPs from the transgenic cells protects gerbils from subsequent Giardia infections. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence that antigenic variation is essential for parasite survival within hosts and that artificial disruption of this mechanism might be useful in generating vaccines against major pathogens that show similar behavior.

### Use of real-time polymerase chain reaction to differentiate between pathogenicand the nonpathogenicin Ecuador [^117VEspE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Amebiasis is a common intestinal parasitic infection caused by Entamoeba histolytica, approximately 500 million people are estimated to be infected worldwide. The prevalence of Entamoeba infection varies being more common in developing countries where poor sanitation leads to ingestion of food or water contaminated with Entamoeba spp. cysts. Generally, infections are asymptomatic but in some cases, colitis and extraintestinal infection can occur.

The diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis is based on the microscopic examination of stool samples in search of cyst and/or the trophozoite stages of the parasite. At least six different species of the genus Entamoeba can be found in human intestinal lumen; two of them, Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii, are morphologically identical to E. histolytica, thus making it nigh impossible to differentiate them by microscopy. In addition, E. histolytica is the only recognized pathogenic species, although the potential pathogenicity of E. dispar and E. moshkovskii has not been completely ruled out. Therefore, new diagnostic techniques are needed to differentiate Entamoeba species; a rapid diagnostic immunochromatographic antigen test to differentiate E. histolytica from the nonpathogenic species exists but has a low specificity for E. histolytica sensu stricto. Molecular DNA-based tools have been shown to be useful to differentiate between E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. moshkovskii.

### Cyst-wall-protein-1 is fundamental for golgi-like organelle neogenesis and cyst-wall biosynthesis in giardia lamblia [^114WgDa1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The genome of the protozoan parasite Giardia lamblia is organized in two diploid nuclei, which has so far precluded complete analysis of gene function. Here we use a previously developed Cre/ loxP -based knock-out and selection marker salvage strategy in the human-derived isolate WB-C6 to eliminate all four copies of the Cyst-Wall-Protein-1 locus (CWP1). Because these loci are silenced in proliferating trophozoites and highly expressed only in encysting cells, CWP1 ablation allows functional characterization of a conditional phenotype in parasites induced to encyst. We show that encysting Δcwp1 cells are unable to establish the stage-regulated trafficking machinery with Golgi-like encystation-specific vesicles required for cyst-wall formation but show morphological hallmarks of cyst development and karyokinesis. This 'pseudocyst' phenotype is rescued by transfection of Δcwp1 cells with an episomally maintained CWP1 expression vector. Genome editing in genera Giardia and Trypanosoma are the only reported examples addressing questions on pathogen transmission within the Excavata supergroup.

### Variable microtubule architecture in the malaria parasite [^111mN6DR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Microtubules are a ubiquitous eukaryotic cytoskeletal element typically consisting of 13 protofilaments arranged in a hollow cylinder. This arrangement is considered the canonical form and is adopted by most organisms, with rare exceptions. Here, we use in situ electron cryo-tomography and subvolume averaging to analyse the changing microtubule cytoskeleton of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, throughout its life cycle. Unexpectedly, different parasite forms have distinct microtubule structures coordinated by unique organising centres. In merozoites, the most widely studied form, we observe canonical microtubules. In migrating mosquito forms, the 13 protofilament structure is further reinforced by interrupted luminal helices. Surprisingly, gametocytes contain a wide distribution of microtubule structures ranging from 13 to 18 protofilaments, doublets and triplets. Such a diversity of microtubule structures has not been observed in any other organism to date and is likely evidence of a distinct role in each life cycle form. This data provides a unique view into an unusual microtubule cytoskeleton of a relevant human pathogen.

### Efficient oral vaccination by bioengineering virus-like particles with protozoan surface proteins [^116RRMqz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Successful vaccination against infectious diseases is considered one of the major accomplishments of medical sciences in history. However, the current trend of vaccine refusal and hesitancy, in part due to perceived potential hazards of parenteral vaccines and the aversion to needles, calls for the development of more friendly and efficient vaccines. Mucosal vaccines provide painless and safe administration. While the oral route would be the most convenient mucosal vaccination approach, the nature of the digestive system causes degradation of the ingested antigen by the low gastric pH and digestive enzymes of the small intestine. Consequently, for oral immunization to be effective, protein antigens must be protected from the harsh environment of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT).

The early-branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia is perhaps the only protozoan capable of colonizing the lumen of the upper small intestine of many vertebrates, including humans. Giardia has a simple life cycle consisting of the intestinal flagellated trophozoite and the environmentally resistant cyst. How Giardia trophozoites can survive in the hostile milieu of the small intestine is unclear, but the Giardia surface is completely covered with molecules belonging to a family of cysteine-rich proteins called variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs) –. To evade the host immune responses, Giardia undergoes antigenic variation by continuously switching its VSPs generated from a repertoire of ~200 homologous genes present in the parasite genome. Previously, we reported that a mechanism similar to RNA-interference (RNAi) ensures that only one VSP is expressed on the surface of Giardia at any time. By knocking down key enzymes of the RNAi pathway, we generated trophozoites expressing their entire repertoire of VSPs. Importantly, adjuvant-free oral administration of native VSPs purified from these altered trophozoites afforded efficient vaccination against Giardia without causing any symptoms of giardiasis. This result indicated that VSPs remain stable and immunogenic after passage through the GIT environment and that they are not toxic to cells or animals.

Human infections with Entamoeba histolytica sporadically become pathogenic, unknown triggers converting the parasite to its invasive phenotype.

### Comparative 3D ultrastructure of plasmodium falciparum gametocytes [^1174jtZe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Parasites from the genus Plasmodium are the causative agents of malaria. This mosquito-borne infectious disease remains a huge burden on global public health with more than 200 million cases and > 600 thousand fatalities in 2021 alone. Humanity's efforts to combat this disease have shown impressive results during the years 2000–2015 but have since stalled. This is largely driven by continuing emergence of resistance to all frontline antimalarialsas well as the inability of most antimalarials to combat directly the asymptomatic but transmissible sexual stages. To stop parasite transmission and eliminate malaria, there is an urgent need for drugs with novel mechanisms of action, particularly those that are effective against sexual stages. The apicomplexan phylum, among which are the malaria parasites, and other related single-cell eukaryotes diverged very early in evolution from more commonly studied species including plants, yeast, animals and humans –. Consequently, various basic cellular processes and structures are comparatively poorly understood in Apicomplexa despite their immense significance for global health. In particular, Plasmodium organelle biology has been shown to deviate from standard eukaryotic models and varies drastically between the different life-cycle stages. Furthermore, Apicomplexa are almost exclusively parasitic, a strategy that drives additional divergence in cellular features related to their survival strategy, such as feeding, locomotion, secretion, invasion, and adaptation to their respective hosts. As a result, we are in the situation where there is urgency to find drug or vaccine candidates for cellular systems that are relatively poorly understood. In the case of Plasmodium, this holds particularly true for life-cycle stages, like the sexual gametocytes, that are less accessible than the pathogenic asexual blood-stage parasites (ABS).

INTRODUCTION

The protozoan flagellate Giardia duodenalis (syn. Giardia intestinalis and Giardia lamblia) parasitizes the human small intestine and is the etiological agent of giardiasis, a globally prevalent diarrheal disease. The life cycle of G. duodenalis entails a dormant yet infectious cyst phase and a motile, replicating trophozoite phase, with its morphology typified by an adhesive disc significantly implicated in virulence. – Genomic analyses suggest that G. duodenalis is a species complex comprised of eight distinct groups, assemblages A–H, with assemblages A and B commonly associated with human hosts. Although many infections are asymptomatic, giardiasis manifests with diverse symptomology and may contribute to physical and cognitive stunting in chronic cases. Children are often at high risk for G. duodenalis infection relative to other age-groups. –

Although microscopic assessment of ova, cysts, and parasites from bulk stool is the current standard of practice for enteric parasite diagnostics, – it has been shown to be insensitive and subject to misclassification error relative to molecular methods for both protozoa and helminths. – As evidence supports the adoption of molecular pathogen detection in lieu of microscopy, bulk stool remains the recommended specimen type for G. duodenalis diagnosis. For some enteropathogens, however, evidence suggests that rectal swabs may provide comparable diagnostic sensitivity with multiple potential benefits. Rectal swabs may offer greater ease of storage and transport in the absence of flammable or toxic preservatives commonly used for stool, reduced hazardous and biohazardous waste generation during sample collection and processing, and rapid collection. The latter may be important for short-stay inpatient care, pediatric diagnostics, field settings, or other contexts in which sample collection and diagnostic turnaround must be streamlined. In addition, as rectal swabs are much faster and easier to obtain from young children than bulk stool while remaining minimally invasive, their use could facilitate greater child enrollment in epidemiological studies targeting this at-risk demographic.

### Roles of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton activity in entamoeba histolytica pathogenesis: a delicate balance [^113MQr2S]. Infection and Immunity (2005). Low credibility.

The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica colonizes the human large bowel. Invasion of the intestinal epithelium causes amoebic colitis and opens the route for amoebic liver abscesses. The parasite relies on its dynamic actomyosin cytoskeleton and on surface adhesion molecules for dissemination in the human tissues. Here we show that the galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) lectin clusters in focal structures localized in the region of E. histolytica that contacts monolayers of enterocytes. Disruption of myosin II activity impairs the formation of these structures and renders the trophozoites avirulent for liver abscess development. Production of the cytoplasmic domain of the E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin in engineered trophozoites causes reduced adhesion to enterocytes. Intraportal delivery of these parasites to the liver leads to the formation of a large number of small abscesses with disorganized morphology that are localized in the vicinity of blood vessels. The data support a model for invasion in which parasite motility is essential for establishment of infectious foci, while the adhesion to host cells modulates the distribution of trophozoites in the liver and their capacity to migrate in the hepatic tissue.

### Simultaneous expression of different variant-specific surface proteins in single giardia lamblia trophozoites during encystation [^1179vFiP]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

A novel variant-specific surface protein (VSP) from Giardia was identified using the monoclonal antibody 9B10, raised against purified cyst walls. VSP9B10B is preferentially induced during encystation and expressed simultaneously with other VSPs on the surface of encysting trophozoites. These results support the hypothesis that encystation and antigenic variation are processes that are mechanistically related.

### Spermatozoa and plasmodium zoites: the same way to invade oocyte and host cells? [^111cYXng]. Microbes and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Cell movement or motility is essential for a large variety of processes. Fertilization and host cells invasion by parasites are among the mostly studied models so far. Body of evidences into the literature raises the question that common mechanisms may be found in the sequential events that lead to cell motility in these two particular models. This short review aims at highlighting these common features by comparing knowledge on motile forms of Plasmodium falciparum and one of the best known motile cell namely the spermatozoa. Emphasis will be done on the substantial changes affecting the biochemical, electrophysiological and functional properties of both models.

### Chloroquine phosphate [^117Vp8vu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action: Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, is an anti-protozoal agent. The precise mechanism by which chloroquine exhibits activity is not known. Chloroquine, may exert its effect against Plasmodium species by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.

Activity in Vitro and in Clinical Infections: Chloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and the exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites.

In vitro studies with Chloroquine demonstrated that it is active against the trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica.

Drug Resistance: Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use in Malaria and WARNINGS).

Plasmodium parasites exhibiting reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to chloroquine.

Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see WARNINGS and INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use).

Merozoite apex-RBC fusion precedes re-orientation

We examined individual invasion events to determine precisely when Pk merozoites are irreversibly attached to RBCs or 'committed' to invasion. Pf merozoites have been described to "pause" for several seconds on the host cell surface as deformation subsides but before internalisation begins. During this stage, a merozoite-RBC fusion event takes place, visualised as a fluorescent signal appearing at the interface between the merozoite apex and Fluo-4-AM loaded RBCs. However, the much smaller size and the more spherical morphology of Pf merozoites makes it difficult to determine when this step occurs relative to reorientation and junction formation.

Analysis of events immediately prior to internalisation showed that Pk merozoites appear to cease gliding motility — and thus forward movement across the host cell — as deformation subsides and a median 4 s (N = 30 events; Supplementary Fig. 1B) prior to the RBC returning to its biconcave morphology. At this point, the stationary merozoite lies lengthwise across the RBC surface, with its apical end firmly pinned to the host cell surface (Fig. 1c, panel 1; Supplementary movie 1 at ~9 s). The posterior end of the merozoite then dissociates from the RBC surface, while the merozoite pivots from the apical end until perpendicular to the RBC membrane (Supplementary movie 1 from 9.5–11.5 s and Fig. 1c, panels 2–4). Reorientation consistently began immediately after deformation ceased, and the RBC had returned to its original morphology (N = 28 events). Therefore deformation does not mechanically facilitate re-orientation as previously proposed, but rather deformation and re-orientation are distinct, sequential steps.

### Gambian children successfully treated with chloroquine can harbor and transmit plasmodium falciparum gametocytes carrying resistance genes [^111Hn5Dg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2002). Low credibility.

Polymorphisms in two genes of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 [pfmdr1] and P. falciparum chloroquine [CQ] resistance transporter [pfcrt]) are associated with CQ treatment failure. We found significant linkage disequilibrium between these loci among isolates from symptomatic Gambian children (P = 0.026) and strong selection for the resistance-associated alleles pfmdr1-86Tyr and pfcrt-76Thr in children with persistent or re-emerging P. falciparum trophozoites during post-treatment follow-up (P = 1.9 × 10⁻⁷). Therefore, this genotype is characteristic of resistant infections among our study population. Since the long-term public health impact of parasites carrying such resistant genotypes depends upon their transmissibility, we examined the prevalence of pfmdr1-86Tyr and pfcrt-76Thr among Gambian children harboring sexual stage parasites during post-treatment follow-up. Gametocytes that emerged after successful treatment with CQ were significantly more likely to be of this genotype than were those emerging after other treatments (P = 4.83 × 10⁻⁴), and were infective to Anopheles mosquitoes. Therapeutic success may thus be accompanied by public health failure as cured children pass resistance genes on to mosquitoes at an enhanced rate.

The phylum apicomplexa consists of more than 5000 species, including important human and veterinary pathogens that have a huge, global effect on human and animal health. While Plasmodium spp. (the causative agent of malaria) is the most notorious member of this phylum causing approximately 660 000 deaths a year, other apicomplexans are among the most relevant foodborne pathogens of global socio-economic relevance. For example Eimeria spp. are the most important protozoan pathogens of poultry. Other important apicomplexan pathogens include Cryptosporidium spp. Neospora caninum, Theileria spp. or Toxoplasma gondii. While most apicomplexans show a relatively small host range, Toxoplasma gondii, infects all nucleated cells from warm blooded animals and has a huge impact on both human and animal health. This parasite is a major cause of abortion in livestock, with significant economic losses to sheep and goat breeders. In addition, it is one of the leading causes of death attributed to foodborne illness. Especially the primary infection during pregnancy, which can cause serious damage of the unborn child and the reactivation of dormant tissue cysts in immunocompromised patients are the most common complications caused by a Toxoplasma infection.

### DPDx-giardiasis… [^114ewKUB]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Life Cycle: Cysts are resistant forms and are responsible for transmission of giardiasis. Both cysts and trophozoites can be found in the feces. The cysts are hardy and can survive several months in cold water. Infection occurs by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated water, food, or by the fecal-oral route. In the small intestine, excystation releases trophozoites. Trophozoites multiply by longitudinal binary fission, remaining in the lumen of the proximal small bowel where they can be free or attached to the mucosa by a ventral sucking disk. Encystation occurs as the parasites transit toward the colon. The cyst is the stage found most commonly in nondiarrheal feces. Because the cysts are infectious when passed in the stool or shortly afterward, person-to-person transmission is possible. While animals are infected with. G. duodenalis trophozoites in wet mounts.

Giardia duodenalistrophozoites are pear-shaped and measure 10–20 micrometers in length. In permanent, stained specimens, 2 large nuclei are usually visible. The sucking disks, median bodies, and flagella may also be seen. Treatment Information Causal Agents Giardia duodenalis is a protozoan flagellate.

### Analysis of erythrocyte signalling pathways during plasmodium falciparum infection identifies targets for host-directed antimalarial intervention [^112fkBgU]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

c-MET signalling in infected erythrocytes

Following the identification of the MAPK pathway activation, we focused our attention on signalling components that lay upstream of the MAPK pathway and found that the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET, which is known to signal to MAPK pathways in other systems, was clearly activated by infection (Fig. 3). C-MET is expressed in many cells of mesenchymal origins, and its activation occurs through the binding of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to the extracellular domain, prompting activation through homodimerization and trans -autophosphorylation. C-MET controls several key downstream pathways including (but not limited to) the MAPK pathway (proliferation, motility and cell cycle progression) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway (cell survival). There is no homologue of c-MET (or any member of the tyrosine kinase group) in P. falciparum.

The array contained a total of nine phospho-specific antibodies targeting c-MET, seven of which passed cross-reactivity and low-intensity signal thresholds (Fig. 5a). There was no noteworthy change in the phosphorylation of any of these residues at the ring stage. In contrast, five out of the seven sites show an increase in phosphorylation in trophozoite-infected cells (fold change > 1.38, Fig. 5a). The signals from two antibodies against c-Met phosphorylation sites decreased at the trophozoite stage. One of these is directed against Y1230 + Y1234 + Y1235; this antibody is affected by high error between duplicates (848% at the trophozoite stage) and was deemed unreliable. The other antibody recognizes pY1230 and is the only reliable c-MET antibody to show a decrease of phosphorylation at the trophozoite stage. At the schizont stage, most sites were slightly higher than the uninfected control. Two unique pan-specific c-MET antibodies were also present on the array. Both pan-specific antibodies showed minimal signal variation between samples, indicating that the level of c-MET remained relatively constant as expected (Fig. 5a).

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^114XkXZs]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis, Giardia, and small-bowel bacterial overgrowth — adjunctive endoscopic evaluation may be appropriate in select cases: "Because concurrent celiac disease and microscopic colitis are common, celiac serology and/or upper endoscopy with proximal small-bowel biopsy may be considered to rule out celiac disease in patients with a diagnosis of microscopic colitis who do not respond to treatment". For protozoal infection, "Patients at high risk of Giardia infection with negative findings on stool studies may benefit from upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies for touch preparation and/ or duodenal aspirates to identify trophozoites". For overgrowth, "Upper endoscopy with quantitative culture of small-bowel biopsies or aspirate is useful for the diagnosis of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth", and endoscopy-assisted pancreatic function testing "may be useful" in chronic pancreatitis.

### Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis presenting as neuropsychiatric lupus in a pediatric patient [^112tJBc1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 16-year-old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with altered mental status and regressive behaviour. She was worked up and empirically treated for common and opportunistic infectious agents. All work-up was negative and after an extensive course of antibiotics she was treated for neuropsychiatric lupus with cytoxan. She initially responded, but this was short-lived and she eventually became comatose and passed away. On brain biopsy she was found to have numerous trophozoites with round nucleus, prominent nucleolus and thin nuclear membrane. Methenamine silver stain showed encysted amoeba, corresponding with a diagnosis of acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis. Making the diagnosis of acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis requires a high degree of suspicion. Specific serum antibodies may not be a reliable measure in immunocompromised patients and trophozoites in CSF can be confused with monocytes. Brain biopsy may be required to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important for clinicians treating immunocompromised patients to keep this agent in mind in an immunocompromised patient with neurological manifestations. Acanthamoeba infections have only been reported in a small handful of patients and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the United States.
