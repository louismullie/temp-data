Sleep in teen association any studies

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about associations between sleep and outcomes in adolescents and whether there are studies on this topic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative recommendations for adolescent sleep duration. Then, I should verify the biological and contextual mechanisms that make adolescents vulnerable to sleep loss. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence linking sleep to mental health, cardiometabolic outcomes, and neurocognitive function. After that, I should review modifiable determinants at the individual, family, and environmental levels. Finally, I will translate this into clinical guidance and highlight uncertainties and research gaps that temper inference and practice recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the consensus on adolescent sleep duration. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours for teenagers aged 13 to 18 years, and this range is consistently cited across multiple AASM consensus statements and summaries, which also note that regularly sleeping fewer than recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems, as well as increased risks of accidents, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression, and suicidality, whereas regularly sleeping more than recommended may also be associated with adverse outcomes in some contexts [^115EMhWX] [^1173fBv3] [^113tVzM7].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic reality against those recommendations. Large adolescent cohorts show average weeknight sleep around 7.7 hours, indicating a substantial proportion below the 8–10 hour range, and trajectory studies document a decline from roughly 9–10 hours at age 13 to slightly less than 8 to slightly more than 9 hours by age 18, reinforcing the gap between need and actual sleep time during adolescence [^11347pDy] [^113GuNYg].

> I need to check the mechanisms that make adolescents uniquely vulnerable. Puberty triggers a circadian phase delay with slower homeostatic sleep drive accumulation, while environmental pressures such as early school start times, academic and social demands, and evening screen exposure compound the mismatch, producing chronic sleep restriction and social jet lag; light exposure patterns further entrench circadian misalignment, making adolescents particularly sensitive to evening light and daytime underexposure [^111kt2RU] [^111zFQyC] [^116PicE6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I should confirm the strength and direction of associations with mental health. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses and cohort studies indicate that disturbed sleep prospectively predicts later depression in children and youths, with pooled effect sizes around a 50% increased odds and small but significant standardized beta coefficients, and bidirectional models suggest sleep and depression mutually influence each other, with some evidence for a sensitive window in late childhood for sleep-focused prevention efforts [^114TLexZ] [^115HziAp] [^112L4eoc]. I should double-check broader mental health correlates: nationally representative adolescent data link later bedtimes, shorter duration, and weekend sleep irregularity with increased odds of mood, anxiety, substance use, and behavioral disorders, and experimental work shows that improving sleep quality in adults yields downstream mental health gains, supporting modifiability even if adolescent RCTs remain limited [^11347pDy] [^111QPFWk].

> Next, I should review cardiometabolic outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is consistently associated with higher adiposity and obesity risk in pediatric populations, and sleep variability and irregularity appear to independently predict obesity and adverse cardiometabolic profiles, including dysregulated eating, metabolic dysfunction, and elevated blood pressure; however, I need to ensure I acknowledge heterogeneity and the need for more objective, longitudinal designs before inferring causality [^1113p71J] [^115FNhcB] [^112F6Mk1]. But wait, what about sleep timing and blood pressure? Observational pediatric data associate very short sleep with higher hypertension risk, and some studies suggest a U-shaped relationship with potential risk at longer durations in certain subgroups, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond the evidence base [^1136whgC] [^116Bs9Ks].

> I will now examine neurocognitive and academic outcomes. Let me verify that experimental restriction impairs cognition: a randomized crossover trial showed adolescents with higher adiposity experience greater cognitive decrements after one night of sleep restriction, whereas those with healthy weight did not, highlighting adiposity as a vulnerability factor; consensus statements also note that less than 8 hours in teens is associated with poorer school performance and reasoning, and meta-analytic data in school-aged children link longer sleep with better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral problems, supporting a dose–response interpretation within recommended ranges [^115o6RfJ] [^1172KDVm].

> Let me consider modifiable determinants at the individual level. Screen time, especially nighttime use, is associated with later bedtimes, shorter and poorer quality sleep, and circadian disruption; concurrently achieving higher physical activity and lower screen-based sedentary time is associated with greater odds of sufficient sleep, though effect sizes are modest and observational, so I should avoid overstating causality while still emphasizing practical levers for families and clinicians [^111nUgXA] [^114FWcvY]. I should confirm that homework load shows threshold effects: longer weekday homework is associated with shorter sleep and worse mental health, with school-stage specific thresholds suggesting policy-level levers to protect sleep [^115CLSMk].

> Next, I should review family-level modifiable factors. Parental rule-setting for bedtimes, healthy parent sleep behaviors, family functioning, and parental warmth correlate with longer adolescent sleep duration and better sleep quality, and prospective ABCD analyses indicate that parental monitoring predicts better sleep quality while family conflict and parental psychopathology predict later timing and poorer quality, with screen use and emotional regulation mediating some pathways; importantly, effects can be sex-specific, with parental warmth relating to earlier chronotype particularly in girls, which should inform tailored interventions [^1121cYiw] [^114Tygad] [^113Q5F2d] [^114TMxfD].

> I need to ensure I account for environmental and social determinants. Early school start times conflict with adolescent circadian biology and are linked to chronic sleep restriction; during COVID-19 school closures, delayed start times were associated with longer sleep and potential alignment with circadian preference, though sleep quality and mental health were mixed, underscoring that timing alone is insufficient without addressing sleep hygiene and psychosocial context [^115gyWJj]. Outdoor artificial light at night is associated with later bedtimes, shorter sleep duration, and higher prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders, and neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and safety concerns correlate with shorter, later, and more disrupted sleep, highlighting structural contributors that require policy-level solutions [^113RxJrx] [^113U3XrR] [^111d2hqz].

> Let me translate this into clinical guidance, but I should double-check that I am not overstepping the evidence. For adolescents, target 8–10 hours per night with consistent bed and wake times, minimize evening screen exposure and bright light, and pair higher daytime physical activity with lower sedentary time; involve parents in setting bedtime rules and modeling healthy sleep, and screen for family conflict or parental mental health that may undermine sleep; in clinic, assess sleep duration, timing, regularity, and quality, and consider actigraphy when feasible to objectify patterns, especially in youth with obesity or mental health comorbidity where sleep effects may be amplified [^115EMhWX] [^111zFQyC] [^114FWcvY] [^1121cYiw] [^115o6RfJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and explicitly state limitations. Much of the pediatric sleep literature remains cross-sectional and reliant on self-report, complicating causal inference; while prospective cohorts and meta-analyses strengthen confidence for mental health links, experimental and implementation studies are still limited, and dose–response curves within the 8–10 hour range need refinement; nonetheless, converging evidence from guidelines, epidemiology, and mechanistic models supports sleep as a modifiable determinant of adolescent health with likely bidirectional links to mental health and plausible pathways via stress physiology, circadian biology, and neurocognitive function [^115FUZWk] [^112tVMAs] [^111PRyMZ].

> In summary, adolescents need 8–10 hours of sleep per night, most are getting less, and insufficient or irregular sleep is consistently associated with worse mental health, higher adiposity and cardiometabolic risk, and impaired cognition; modifiable levers include evening screen and light management, physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns, parenting practices and family functioning, school start times, and neighborhood and socioeconomic context, and clinicians should screen comprehensively and intervene at multiple levels while acknowledging that causality is probabilistic and effect sizes are modest but meaningful at the population level [^115EMhWX] [^114TLexZ] [^115FNhcB] [^115o6RfJ] [^114Tygad] [^115gyWJj] [^113RxJrx].

Sleep duration in adolescents is strongly associated with mental health, academic performance, and physical health outcomes [^1173fBv3]. Shorter sleep is linked to **higher risks of depression, anxiety, and suicidality** [^11347pDy] [^1173fBv3], and to **lower academic achievement and cognitive function** [^1172JjDd] [^115o6RfJ]. It also increases risks of obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular problems [^116rmikC] [^1136whgC]. Most adolescents sleep less than the recommended 8–10 hours [^11347pDy], and both short and irregular sleep are harmful [^112TDgLk] [^112F6Mk1]. Interventions that extend sleep or improve sleep hygiene yield measurable benefits in mental health and cognition, supporting causality and the need for public health action [^111QPFWk] [^115o6RfJ].

---

## Mental health outcomes

- **Depression and anxiety**: Shorter sleep duration is consistently associated with higher risks of depression and anxiety [^11347pDy]; meta-analyses show disturbed sleep increases later depression risk by ~50% (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.13–2.00) [^114TLexZ] [^115HziAp].

- **Suicidality**: Insufficient sleep is linked to increased suicidal ideation and attempts, with risk rising as sleep drops below 8 hours [^11347pDy] [^116Q3BYE].

- **Bidirectional relationship**: Sleep problems predict later depression, and depression predicts later sleep problems, indicating a reciprocal relationship [^114aAxhG] [^112iPk52].

---

## Academic performance and cognitive function

Cognitive impairment from **short sleep** is evidenced by reduced attention, memory, and executive function, especially in adolescents with higher adiposity [^115o6RfJ] [^1173fBv3]. Lower academic achievement is also associated with **insufficient sleep**, including poorer grades and test performance [^1172JjDd] [^1172KDVm].

---

## Physical health outcomes

- **Obesity**: Short sleep is associated with increased obesity risk; longer sleep is linked to lower BMI, particularly in males [^1154zqhU] [^1113p71J].

- **Metabolic health**: Insufficient sleep is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes risk in adolescents [^1173fBv3] [^114hjt9m].

- **Cardiovascular health**: Shorter sleep is associated with higher blood pressure and cardiovascular risk markers [^1136whgC] [^116Bs9Ks].

---

## Sleep duration recommendations and prevalence of insufficient sleep

The **recommended duration** for adolescents is 8–10 hours per night [^115EMhWX] [^113tVzM7]. Prevalence of **insufficient sleep** is high, with most adolescents sleeping less than recommended, often due to academic demands, screen time, and circadian shifts [^1158Sv43] [^1156NXSe].

---

## Factors influencing adolescent sleep duration

- **Biological factors**: Puberty-related circadian delays and hormonal changes contribute to later bedtimes and shorter sleep [^116PicE6] [^113EW8vZ].

- **Behavioral factors**: Screen time, caffeine, irregular schedules, and poor sleep hygiene reduce sleep duration [^111nUgXA] [^114FWcvY].

- **Environmental factors**: Early school start times, academic workload, and social pressures limit sleep [^115gyWJj] [^115CLSMk].

---

## Interventions and policy implications

- **School start times**: Later start times are associated with longer sleep and improved health outcomes [^115gyWJj].

- **Sleep hygiene education**: Interventions targeting sleep hygiene and parental involvement improve sleep duration and quality [^notfound].

- **Screen time management**: Reducing evening screen use improves sleep timing and duration [^notfound].

---

## Gaps and limitations in current research

- **Causality**: Many studies are observational; more randomized trials are needed to establish causality [^116gdZmn].

- **Measurement**: Reliance on self-report limits accuracy; objective measures (actigraphy) are underused [^112iPk52].

- **Longitudinal data**: Limited long-term studies obscure sleep's lasting health impacts [^115FUZWk].

---

Sleep duration in adolescents is a **critical modifiable factor** [^1172JjDd] influencing mental health, academic performance, and physical health. Shorter and irregular sleep are consistently linked to adverse outcomes, and improving sleep yields measurable benefits, supporting public health efforts to promote adequate, regular sleep in this population.

### Functional consequences of inadequate sleep in adolescents: a systematic review [^1172JjDd]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

During adolescence, changes in sleep patterns due to biological and environmental factors are well documented. Later bedtimes and inadequate sleep, i.e., short and disrupted sleep patterns, insomnia and daytime sleepiness, have become increasingly common. Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep plays a crucial role in healthy adolescent development. This review systematically explores descriptive evidence, based on prospective and cross sectional investigations, indicating that inadequate sleep is associated with negative outcomes in several areas of health and functioning, including somatic and psychosocial health, school performance and risk taking behavior. Findings highlight the need for longitudinal investigations aimed at establishing the underpinnings of these associations and for developing and implementing interventions designed to achieve healthier and more balanced sleep patterns in the adolescent population.

### Influence of sleep on developing brain functions and structures in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^114wYSRW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review examined the associations between sleep and brain functions and structures in children and adolescents aged 1–17 ys. Included studies (n = 24) were peer-reviewed and met the a priori determined population (apparently healthy children and adolescents aged 1 y to 17 ys), intervention/exposure/comparator (various sleep characteristics including duration, architecture, quality, timing), and outcome criteria (brain functions and/or brain structures, excluding cognitive function outcomes). Collectively, the reviewed studies report some relationships between inadequate sleep and resultant differences in brain functions or structures. Although the research presented supports and offers more insight into the importance of sleep for the developing brain of children and adolescents, no firm conclusions that apply broadly may be drawn from these results, particularly because of the diversity of the sleep variables and outcomes. However, it is clear that sleeping habits in the pediatric population should be prioritized. Health care providers should continue to recommend healthy sleep practices and adequate time for sleep, as they are essential for overall health, including brain health.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^112tVMAs]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Future directions for pediatric sleep duration research — More studies are recommended between 8 and 10 hours in adolescents to systematically vary sleep opportunity and to examine longer time periods (e.g., 30 days), including weekdays and weekend days, to develop more precise dose–response curves; intervention studies are needed to help clarify whether modifying sleep duration improves health outcomes in children and to explain whether sleep duration has a causal role in health and functioning vs operating as a marker; studies are needed to delineate upstream physiologic, behavioral, social, environmental, genetic, and contextual contributors including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, neighborhoods, and school start times; and research should identify inexpensive, reliable, and feasible biomarkers of sleep need or sleep deprivation to advance clinical care, public health, policy, and more accurate sleep schedule recommendations.

### Recommended amount of sleep for pediatric populations: a consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^115EMhWX]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine consensus — pediatric sleep duration ranges by age: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Recommendations for infants younger than 4 months are not included due to the wide range of normal variation in duration and patterns of sleep, and insufficient evidence for associations with health outcomes.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^113GuNYg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

General health outcomes across childhood — sleep duration patterns and associations: In this domain, study sizes ranged from less than 25 to over 74,000. In the 4-months to < 12 months age range, two large prospective birth cohorts indicated healthy infants slept slightly > 13 to slightly > 14 hours. For children in the 1 to < 3 years and 3 to < 6 years age ranges, one cohort reported sleep durations between 11 and 12 hours, and limited data suggested that sleeping less than 10 hours was associated with greater risk of accidental injury and reduced quality of life. In the 6 to < 13 years age group, a large meta-analysis of children from 20 countries indicated children between 9 and 12 years of age slept approximately 10 hours per night, and children sleeping 10 hours or more per night reported better health. In the 13–18 year age range, increased rates of injury were noted for those sleeping less than 7 or 8 hours, with better health for those sleeping 9 hours or more; a meta-analysis found sleep declined from between 9 and 10 hours at age 13 to slightly less than 8 to slightly greater than 9 hours at age 18 years.

### Group-based sleep trajectories in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^112TDgLk]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep is crucial for health and development. Evidence indicates that sleep changes over time and distinct subgroups may experience different longitudinal patterns. This study systematically reviewed the studies that used latent trajectory modeling to investigate sleep trajectories of children and adolescents aged 0–18 years, and summarized the associated determinants and health-related outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, identifying 46 articles that met our criteria. To ensure the reliability of the review, only studies rated as good or fair in terms of methodological quality were included, resulting in a total of 36 articles. Group-based trajectories were identified on several sleep dimensions (i.e., sleep duration, general and specific sleep problems, and bed-sharing behavior) and three or four trajectories were reported in most studies. There was a convergence trend across sleep duration trajectories during the first six years of life. Studies on specific sleep problem (i.e., insomnia, night-waking, and sleep-onset difficulties) typically identified two trajectories: consistent, minimal symptoms or chronic yet fluctuating symptoms. Lower socioeconomic status, maternal depression, and night feeding behaviors were the most frequently reported determinants of sleep trajectories. Membership in a group with certain adverse patterns (e.g., persistent short sleep duration) was associated with increased risks of multiple negative health-related conditions, such as obesity, compromised immunity, neurological problems, substance use, or internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Generally, there is potential to improve the quality of studies in this field. Causality is hard to be inferred within the current body of literature. Future studies could emphasize early life sleep, incorporate more assessment timepoints, use objective measures, and employ experimental design to better understand changes of and mechanisms behind the various sleep trajectories and guide targeted interventions for at-risk subpopulations.

### Sleep patterns and mental health correlates in US adolescents [^11347pDy]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate systematically the associations of sleep patterns with a range of mental disorders and other outcomes among a nationally representative sample of US adolescents.

Study Design

Using the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 10123 US adolescents 13–18 years of age, we assessed associations between adolescent-reported sleep patterns (tertiles of weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mental disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, smoking, injury, suicidality, and perceived mental and physical health, assessed via direct diagnostic interview.

Results

The average weeknight bedtime was at 22:37 and sleep duration was 7.72 hours. Average weekend bedtime delay was 1.81 hours and average weekend oversleep was 1.17 hours. Later weeknight bedtime, shorter weeknight sleep duration, greater weekend bedtime delay, and both short and long periods of weekend oversleep were associated with increased odds of mood, anxiety, substance use, and behavioral disorders, as well as suicidality, tobacco smoking, and poor perceived mental and physical health. ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.15. The only outcomes not associated with any sleep patterns were past-year injury and eating disorder.

Conclusions

Suboptimal sleep patterns were associated with an array of mental disorders and other health-related outcomes among adolescents. Abnormal sleep patterns may serve as markers of prodromal or untreated mental disorders among adolescents, and may provide opportunities for prevention and intervention in mental disorders.

### Sleep duration in schooldays is associated with health-related quality of life in Norwegian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^1156NXSe]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep is an essential factor for children's and adolescents' health and wellbeing. Adolescence is a developmental period, wherein healthy sleep patterns often are neglected, and thus insufficient sleep is commonly reported in adolescence. Further, adolescence is also an important period for mental, physical, and social development. Across countries and cultures, evidence suggests that adolescents do not get the recommended nine hours of sleep per night. Insufficient sleep in adolescence affects a wide range of health outcomes negatively. Research evidence shows that the risk for physical, psycho-social and behavioral problems increases with insufficient sleep. Causes of insufficient sleep in adolescence are often divided into internal biological processes related to puberty including the shift in the circadian rhythm, and external factors such as excessive homework load, caffeine intake, less parental supervision of bedtime, perceived stress, later preferred sleeping time and evening use of electronic media.

Currently, there is extensive research investigating bedtime screen hours´ harmful effects on sleep and well-being, such as the systematic literature review of Hale & Guan. which advised to limit or reduce screen time exposure in adolescence especially at bedtime. In addition, Mireku et al. revealed consistent associations between night-time screen-based media device use and poor sleep outcomes and worse general health-related quality of life (HRQOL). With less sleep duration during the schooldays, adolescents have reported using the weekends for catch-up sleep. In the systematic review of Sun et al. 72 studies were included to examine the associations of weekday-to-weekend sleep differences on health-related outcomes in school aged children and youths. Findings revealed that a larger discrepancy in weekday-to-weekend difference in bedtime was associated with depressive symptoms in youths, particularly in secondary school pupils. This review highlighting need for examine underlying mechanisms related to the impacts of weekday-to-weekend sleep duration. A way to grasp the complicated challenge of sleep patterns impact adolescents´ everyday life is by examining the relationship between sleep duration in schooldays and weekends on different HRQOL subscales. HRQOL is a multidimensional construct that includes the individual's subjective perspectives on the physical, psychological, social and functional aspects of health. Due to the multidimensionality of HRQOL, it may provide essential insight into the diverse and complicated impacts of insufficient sleep in adolescents, and thus contribute to potentially mapping relevant aspects to improve. Hence, HRQOL serves as a framework relevant to sleep, due to the positive focus on the individuals' subjective perception of resources rather than problems.

### A systematic review of the association between sleep health and stress biomarkers in children [^113F4QYi]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep is intimately linked with the stress response system. While the evidence for this connection has been systematically reviewed in the adult literature, to our knowledge no studies have examined this relationship in young children. Recent scientific interest in understanding the effects of adverse environments in early childhood, including an emphasis on understanding the role of sleep, highlights the importance of synthesizing the current evidence on the relationship between sleep and the stress response system in early childhood. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between sleep health and biomarkers of physiologic stress (neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, cardiovascular) in healthy children ages 0–12 y. Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified 68 empirical articles and critically reviewed and synthesized the results across studies. The majority of studies included school-age children and reported sleep dimensions of duration or efficiency. Overall, evidence of associations between sleep health and stress biomarkers was strongest for neuroendocrine variables, and limited or inconsistent for studies of immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic outcomes. Gaps in the literature include prospective, longitudinal studies, inclusion of children under the age of 5 y, and studies using objective measures of sleep.

### Inadequate sleep as a contributor to type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^116rmikC]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sleep is an important component of physical and mental health in humans. However, sleep deprivation has become common in modern societies. Children and adolescents sleep less now compared with decades ago, and the steeper decline in sleep duration is found in adolescents and on school days. Lack of sleep is associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression, poor academic achievement and reduced quality of life/well-being. Healthy sleep comprises many dimensions, including adequate duration, good quality, appropriate timing and regularity and the absence of disturbances or disorders. Fortunately, insufficient sleep is a potentially remediable health risk. A better understanding of the connection between insufficient sleep and health across the life cycle is important to help inform the development of interventions aimed at improving sleep habits and, subsequently, health outcomes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a global public health concern and lifestyle changes, such as improving diet composition, increasing physical activity and weight management have traditionally been the cornerstones of prevention efforts. Owing to the lack of effectiveness of most programs, other modifiable determinants of the disease should be targeted for providing more comprehensive and tailored prevention strategies and hopefully optimize success. Healthy sleep is gaining recognition worldwide as an important lifestyle habit associated with the prevention of chronic diseases, including T2D. For example, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the risk of developing T2D associated with insufficient sleep was comparable to that of traditional risk factors, such as excess weight, family history of diabetes and physical inactivity. Thus there is increased recognition that sleep should be considered in clinical guidelines for T2D.

Several meta-analyses have confirmed the independent association between sleep duration and the risk of developing T2D in adults. A U-shaped dose–response relationship is observed between sleep duration and the risk of T2D in adults, with the lowest risk observed at a sleep duration of 7–8 h per day. The mechanisms that underlie these associations are not fully understood; however, insufficient sleep is associated with insulin resistance, increased food intake and impaired glucose tolerance. The mechanisms underlying the association between long sleep duration and increased T2D risk are more speculative and may be associated with other health problems that confound the relationship (for example, depression, undiagnosed medical disease and poor physical health).

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^116jXYeg]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Synthesis of Studies Without Meta-analysis

For 6 studies, inclusion in the meta-analysis was precluded owing to effect size estimates being incomplete (eTable 7 in the Supplement). For the dichotomous outcome, disturbed sleep was significantly associated with an increase of depression in 1 studyand not significantly associated in another. For the continuous outcome, disturbed sleep was significantly associated with an increase of depression in 1 studyand was significantly associated with an increase of depression for the female subgroup only in an another study. Finally, 3 studies reported that findings were nonsignificant, although the direction of the findings was not clear. According to GRADE, the overall body of evidence was rated very low, which means that confidence in the effect size estimates is very limited (eTable 9 in the Supplement). Based on studies that provided direction of associations, the overall pattern supported an association between disturbed sleep and increased depression.

### Inadequate sleep as a contributor to type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^114hjt9m]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Lack of sleep is a modifiable risk factor for adverse health in humans. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are common in the pediatric population; the largest decline in sleep duration over the past decades has been seen in children and adolescents. The objective of the present narrative review was to provide for the first time an overview of the literature on sleep and its association with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) biomarkers in children and adolescents. For this narrative review, 23 studies were retained (21 observational and 2 experimental studies). Notwithstanding the conflicting results found in these studies and despite being attenuated by adiposity level, maturity, sex and age, there is still some compelling evidence for an association between sleep duration (for both objective or subjective measurements of duration) and architecture with one or more T2D biomarkers in children and adolescents. The majority of the studies reviewed did focus on sleep duration and one or more T2D biomarkers in children and adolescents, but sleep architecture, more precisely the suppression of slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, has also been shown to be associated with insulin resistance. Only two studies looked at sleep quality, and the association between sleep quality and insulin resistance was not independent of level of adiposity. Future experimental studies will help to better understand the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep with T2D. Work also needs to be carried out on finding novel and effective strategies aimed at improving sleep hygiene and health outcomes of children and adolescents.

### Associations between 24-hour movement compositions and cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents: a five-part compositional analysis using data from the international children's accelerometery database (ICAD) [^113519nE]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the current study, the average self-reported sleep duration was 594.8 ± 52.2 min·day⁻¹ (9.9 hours·night⁻¹) for boys and 604.5 ± 53.3 min·day⁻¹ (10.0 hours·night⁻¹) for girls which are both within the recommended sleep guidelines for children aged 6–12 years. Interestingly, sleep was the only movement behaviour in isolation that significantly predicted all cardiometabolic health outcomes after accounting for age, sex, ethnicity or PA seasonal variation. In adults, a 'U'-shaped relationship between sleep duration and cardiovascular outcomes occurs with both short (≤ 6 hours∙night⁻¹) and long durations (≥ 8 hours∙night⁻¹) posing an increased risk of CVD. However, the relationship between sleep and cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents is less well understood with evidence suggesting that short sleep duration is associated with an increase in some, but not all, CMR factors. More specifically, short sleep duration has been strongly linked to obesity, increased blood pressureand a reduced basal metabolic ratedue to alterations in autonomic, metabolic and endothelial functions which influence both hormone levels and eating behaviours in children and adolescents. However, the evidence on abnormal sleep patterns and dyslipidaemia or irregular resting glucose/insulin remains inconsistent, and there is a need for more high-quality evidence using objective measures of sleep duration with methodological inconsistencies likely contributing to the equivocal findings.

### Sleep variability and regularity as contributors to obesity and cardiometabolic health in adolescence [^115FNhcB]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adolescence is a developmental stage of critical changes in sleep and its circadian timing when the contribution of abnormal sleep variability (amount) and sleep regularity (timing) to obesity and its associated adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes appears to increase. The aim of this study was to summarize findings from studies conducted in adolescents examining both sleep variability and regularity in relation to obesity and cardiometabolic health. Gaps in research and potential causal pathways that future studies should examine are highlighted.

Results

Nightly deviations in sleep duration and sleep midpoint appear to contribute to the development of obesity and associated adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in youth. Studies show that increased sleep variability and irregularity are associated with obesity, decreased physical activity, dysregulated eating and inadequate diet, metabolic dysfunction, impaired cardiac autonomic balance, and elevated blood pressure in adolescents.

Conclusions

A stable circadian timing of sleep is essential to the overall physical well-being of youth. Emerging evidence supports that sleep variability and circadian misalignment, including sleep irregularity, contribute to adverse obesity-related health outcomes early on in adolescence. Future studies should focus on the underlying behavioral and biological mechanisms in the causal pathway between day-to-day deviations in the amount and timing of sleep and obesity.

### Testing bidirectional, longitudinal associations between disturbed sleep and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents using cross-lagged models [^112L4eoc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Taken together, our findings suggest that there might be a sensitive window between 5 and 12 years for sleep interventions to mitigate the emergence and/or growth of later depressive symptoms. Up to now, randomized clinical trials of sleep interventions in depressed adolescents have targeted mid adolescence (ie, 15 years), and yielded small effect sizes (pooled standardized mean difference = −0.27 [95% CI, −0.50 to −0.04]). Starting prevention efforts in childhood may have a similar, or even greater impact on depression compared with treatment initiated in adolescence, because it would reduce the risk before depression consolidates. To date, we are not aware of any randomized clinical trials of sleep interventions specifically addressing depressed children. To expand our understanding, randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up and in children with different levels of baseline depression are needed. According to our findings, a sample of 100 individuals would be adequately powered for a sleep intervention for the prevention of depression in a children community sample.

The magnitude of the cross-lagged estimates that we found was overall small (β range, 0.05–0.15), but quite in line with previous reportsand with etiological models of depression. Indeed, multiple risk factors, each with a small effect, underlie the vulnerability to depression, and this may partly explain why sleep interventions, albeit having a significant effect, are limited in preventing depression in adolescents. The potential for a larger impact could be achieved by simultaneously addressing multiple risk factors of depression. Disturbed sleep often co-occurs with other lifestyle risk behaviors associated with depression, including poor diet, poor physical activity, and excessive recreational screen time. Future research should examine whether a multiple health behavior change approach could be a viable option for depression prevention.

Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying the developmental cascade linking disturbed sleep and depression is of paramount importance. Key outstanding questions include whether an early sensitive window of vulnerability can be identified, which could explain why cascade processes concentrate in early childhood and fade in adolescence. Both conditionsare heritableand share common genetic risk factors. Both disturbed sleepand depressionhave been associated bidirectionally with inflammatory processes, suggesting that inflammation may be one mechanism driving the spiraling process. Interestingly, treating disturbed sleep and depression attenuates inflammation, and using anti-inflammatory medications to treat depression seems promising in adults. Future research is needed to determine whether patterns of proinflammatory responses may be one of the biological mechanisms through which disturbed sleep accelerates depression and whether it can be targeted for depression prevention in children and adolescents.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^115FUZWk]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sleep duration and longevity — evidence limitations and lack of direct associations are emphasized: Most studies reviewed were cross-sectional with correlational findings, and some studies included participants aged 8–18 years; additionally, without prospective, long-term studies, pediatric sleep duration data on outcomes such as longevity are lacking. None of the articles either evaluated or demonstrated any direct relationship between sleep duration and longevity in the pediatric population, and therefore, no recommendation was made for optimal sleep duration at any age as related to longevity. Methods limitations included reliance on parent- or self-reported duration, variation in reporting per 24 hours or overnight sleep, and experimental manipulations almost always < 2 weeks with few studies examining sleep duration in the range between 8 and 12 hours.

### Longitudinal associations between high school sleep characteristics and young adult health outcomes [^114PfgCy]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Short sleep duration and evening chronotype are independently associated with negative health outcomes. However, it is unclear how adolescent sleep duration and chronotype are longitudinally associated with health outcomes during early adulthood.

Methods

Participants from the NEXT Generation Health Study (n = 2,783; 54.5% female) completed measures of sleep duration (scheduled day and unscheduled day) and chronotype in high school. Sleep duration, chronotype, general health, depressive symptoms, and psychosomatic symptoms were also assessed 4 years after high school. Latent variables estimated high school scheduled-day sleep duration, unscheduled-day sleep duration, and chronotype using the during high school measures. Two path analyses tested the prospective associations between high school sleep duration (separate models for scheduled and unscheduled days) and chronotype with 4 years after high school health outcomes as mediated by concurrent sleep duration and chronotype.

Results

In the scheduled-day model, longer high school sleep duration and later chronotype were associated with longer duration and later chronotype in early adulthood. Longer high school sleep duration was directly associated with fewer psychosomatic symptoms and indirectly associated with fewer depressive and psychosomatic symptoms through longer sleep duration in early adulthood. Later chronotype in high school was indirectly associated with poorer general health, greater depressive symptoms, and greater psychosomatic symptoms in early adulthood through later chronotype.

Conclusions

Findings highlight the roles of scheduled-day sleep duration and evening chronotype in shaping health outcomes and suggest the importance of chronotype and optimal sleep habits among adolescents.

### Is sleep duration related to obesity? A critical review of the epidemiological evidence [^1113p71J]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

1. Observational studies have implicated habitual sleep duration as a risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Part of this association might be mediated by obesity, which has also been associated with habitual sleep duration. These studies generate wide media attention because of the public's health concerns surrounding increasing obesity and the temporal association with the other modern "epidemic" of sleep loss. Some commentators have recommended public health interventions to control obesity via habitual sleep duration modification. We conducted a critical review of the available literature describing the relationship between habitual sleep duration and obesity in community-based studies in both adults and children, with particular emphasis on longitudinal studies and on studies with objective measures of habitual sleep duration. 2. Existing data have variable consistency. Only one study objectively measured sleep duration for more than one 24-h period. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in adults often demonstrated an association of short sleep duration with BMI. However, some of these studies also showed that long sleep duration was also associated with obesity. In contrast, other studies showed that neither long nor short sleep was associated with obesity. In paediatric populations there appeared to be a clear pattern where shorter sleep durations were associated with obesity. We did not locate any interventional studies where sleep duration had been manipulated in order to prevent or treat obesity. 3. We contend that the evidence base is not yet strong enough to give public health advice to the general population or specific groups about sleep duration being a modifiable risk factor for obesity. We need to experimentally clarify whether sleep duration variability is a risk factor for obesity, in what manner, and in which populations. If a reliable aetiological model could be found, we would ideally then need community-based randomised controlled trials that show that sleep duration can be changed and that sleep duration manipulation produces actual weight loss and/or prevents the development of obesity without undue side-effects.

### Modifiable parental factors in adolescent sleep: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121cYiw]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Sleep problems are prevalent during adolescence, but parents may be able to support adolescents to sleep better. A systematic search of records from six databases from inception up to November 2019, identified 103 peer-reviewed publications that examined behaviourally and cognitively modifiable parental factors associated with sleep in adolescents aged 12–18 years. Although included studies were largely cross-sectional and heterogeneous, with heavy reliance on self-reported measures, associations with sound, convergent levels of evidence were found for: 1) parental rule-setting for bedtimes and parent sleep behaviours with longer sleep duration in adolescents; 2) healthy parent sleep and family functioning with better adolescent sleep quality; and 3) parental warmth with better adolescent daytime functioning. Effect sizes were in the small to moderate range. The identified parental factors are recommended targets for inclusion in parenting programs to support adolescent sleep, however, would require validation in intervention studies. Opportunities for research are outlined for the identified parental factors, sleep domains with limited evidence, and better understanding the mechanisms or possible moderators in the associations between parental factors and sleep outcomes.

### Sleep duration in schooldays is associated with health-related quality of life in Norwegian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^111QGJW5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Insufficient sleep is commonly reported in adolescence and is negatively associated with a wide range of health outcomes. A way to grasp the complicated challenge of how sleep impact different aspects of the adolescents´ everyday life is by examining the relationship between sleep duration in schooldays and weekends on different health-related quality of life (HRQOL) subscales. Furthermore, to expand the understanding of possible underlying mechanisms between sleep and HRQOL, testing for self-efficacy as a possible mediator is of importance.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed among 696 adolescents aged 13–15 years from a school-based setting. All participants completed an electronic survey in their respective classrooms. The survey included demographic data, the School Sleep Habits Survey, the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire measuring HRQOL, and the General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics software including PROCESS macro by Andrew Hayes.

Results

Our findings revealed overall similar sleep patterns in boys and girls including longer sleep duration in the study sample during weekends (10:09 h) than in schooldays (08:36 h). Regression analyses revealed that sleep duration in schooldays was positively and statistically associated with HRQOL subscales psychological well-being (95% CI [0.44 to 1.33]), autonomy and parents (95% CI [0.12 to 1.06]), school environment (95% CI [0.47 to 1.40]), and self-efficacy (95% CI [0.01 to 0.47]). Sleep duration in weekends revealed no associations with the HRQOL subscales, except for the HRQOL subscale psychological well-being (95% CI [0.09 to 0.85]). Mediation analyses revealed that sleep duration in schooldays explained most of the associations (64–75%) in 4 out 5 HRQOL subscales, except in the association with the HRQOL subscale physical well-being revealing an indirect effect of 71.9%.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study described sleep among Norwegian adolescents and demonstrated that sleep durations in weekends and schooldays impact HRQOL and self-efficacy, revealing overall better outcome in HRQOL and self-efficacy with sufficient sleep during schooldays. These findings support the regularity of sleep and highlight the importance of sufficient sleep during schooldays, especially in a school-based sample of adolescents.

### Association of child and adolescent mental health with adolescent health behaviors in the UK millennium cohort [^114aAxhG]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Findings in the Context of Previous Evidence

Not achieving the recommended 9 hours sleep was associated with self-reported mental health problems at both time points and at age 14 years only. The reciprocal association of sleep problems and depression has been established in large adolescent cohorts, additionally strengthened by depression treatment interventions through which sleep has been shown to improve as a residual. Proposed mechanisms include improved immune functioning resulting from quiet, deep sleep and enhanced learning, memory, and emotional health through rapid eye movement sleep. Critically, insomnia has also been established as a risk factor associated with development of future depression in adults and adolescents. A 2016 meta-analysisreported that individuals with insomnia experienced a more than 2-fold risk of developing depression compared with those who do not experience insomnia. There have been subsequent calls for prevention of depression to be a primary aim for individuals experiencing sleep disturbance, in addition to insomnia being considered a symptom of depressive disorders. While having parent-reported mental health problems at age 7 years only was not associated to sleep at age 14 years in our study, it is possible that the time of onset of depression and underlying symptoms are more likely to have occurred with the onset of adolescence. We also note that the characteristics of sleep behaviors, such as quality of sleep and timing, as opposed to purely duration, may have important implications for mental health and vice versa. Further examination of the association of mental health during adolescence with sleep behavior is warranted, as is the consideration of the utility of public health sleep guidelines that may overlook such complexity with a cutoff that may be considered arbitrary.

Fewer individuals who self-reported mental health problems at both time points and at age 14 years only were fruit and vegetable consumers, compared with individuals without mental health problems at either time point. This is consistent with the wider nutritional psychiatry evidence base that suggests an association of mental health problems with diet quality. It was notable that having parent-reported mental health problems in early life only was not associated with fruit, vegetable, or soft drink consumption, as these indicators are regularly used as proxies for overall diet quality in the epidemiological literature. There have been criticisms that using individual intakes of single food items is unlikely to reflect an overall dietary pattern and that it is consumption patterns that interact over time through various inflammatory mechanisms that contribute to mental and brain health. It is highly probable that our dietary assessment inadequately captured such mechanisms. This demonstrates the need for including comprehensive dietary intake measures in large population-representative surveys, with such methods holding far greater insight and implications for population health inferences.

### How much homework is too much? Identifying thresholds for adolescent sleep and mental health by school stage [^115CLSMk]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study examined the associations between homework duration and mental health, focusing on sleep duration as a mediator and identifying optimal homework duration thresholds by school stage.

Methods

We analyzed data from 68,891 Chinese adolescents (52.3% boys) in 2021, stratified by school stage (primary/middle/high) and gender. Mental health outcomes included well-being and ill-being (anxiety, depression) indicators. Weekday homework and weekend homework durations were examined separately. The mediating role of sleep duration was tested by structural equation modeling. Non-linear associations between homework and outcomes were explored by generalized additive modeling. Critical thresholds were identified by segmented regression.

Results

Longer homework durations were consistently associated with shorter sleep, lower well-being, and higher ill-being. Sleep duration mediated the associations between homework and mental health outcomes. Non-linear analysis demonstrated that the associations between homework duration and both sleep and mental health outcomes followed curvilinear patterns. While specific thresholds varied by gender, outcomes, and weekday vs. weekend, optimal thresholds were identified by school stage: 1.00 h for primary schoolers, 1.32 h for middle schoolers, and 1.80 h for high schoolers. Homework durations exceeding these thresholds were generally associated with less sleep and poorer mental health outcomes, while durations below these thresholds showed either no association or even positive associations with sleep and mental health outcomes.

Conclusions

Excessive homework time was associated with shorter sleep and poorer mental health. The identification of school-stage-specific thresholds supports educational policies to reduce homework loads and promote sleep and mental health in adolescents.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^116Q3BYE]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric sleep duration and mental/behavioral health — age-specific associations are as follows: In a cross-sectional survey of 27,939 adolescents, 7–8 hours versus 6–7 hours was associated with less feelings of hopelessness, less tobacco and alcohol use, less illicit drug use, and fewer suicidal thoughts and attempts; however, after 9 hours increases in these behaviors were noted, and teens sleeping ≤ 5 hours or 10–12 hours had more suicidal attempts than those sleeping 8 hours. For infants 4 months to 1 year, 14.5 hours of sleep seems appropriate, and for toddlers, at least 13 hours are beneficial for future mental health outcomes. In school-aged children, sleeping at least 10 hours is linked to fewer health complaints while < 8 hours is associated with increased reports of ADHD behaviors; experimental data suggest at least 9 hours is necessary for adequate behavioral functioning. In teens, 8–9 hours seems optimal for mental health, < 8 hours is associated with increased inappropriate behavior, and more than 10 hours was also associated with an increase in suicidality.

### Bidirectional associations between accelerometer-based sleep metrics and mental health symptoms from childhood to late adolescence: data from a Brazilian birth cohort [^112iPk52]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep health is a multidimensional construct that includes regularity, satisfaction, alertness, appropriate timing, efficiency, and sufficient duration. It plays a vital role in maintaining cognitive functions and mental health, especially in critical developmental periods such as adolescence. Dysfunctional sleep is one of the most common comorbidities among mental health disorders. Poor sleep quality, insufficient sleep, and circadian disruption can impair brain function and reduce learning and attention, as well as contribute to the development of mental health conditions, particularly during adolescence.

In recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested a causal relationship between sleep disturbances and mental health disorders, including internalizing conditions like major depressive disorder (MDD) and externalizing disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Internalizing disorders are generally characterized by emotional symptoms, including anxiety and depression, while externalizing disorders are associated with outwardly directed behaviors, such as aggression and hyperactivity. Research suggests that these distinct symptom clusters may have divergent long-term implications. For instance, externalizing behaviors in childhood have been shown to predict adverse outcomes in adolescence, such as arrests and early pregnancies, whereas internalizing symptoms do not exhibit the same predictive value.

The relationship between sleep and emotional/behavioral symptoms remains a topic of ongoing debate, with evidence pointing to a complex and bidirectional association. Longitudinal studies consistently indicate that self-reported sleep disturbances, such as reduced sleep duration, may predict and result from externalizing behaviors. Similarly, internalizing symptoms demonstrate bidirectional associations with self-reported sleep behavior, although the evidence for these links is comparatively weaker. While sleep disturbances contribute significantly to the emergence of internalizing difficulties, the reverse relationship — where internalizing symptoms precede sleep problems — has not been consistently observed in non-clinical, prospective studies.

Despite these findings, the reliance on self-reported measures of sleep introduces potential bias, as objective sleep metrics — widely regarded as more precise and reliable — remain underutilized in this field of research. For instance, using longitudinal data, Kelly et al. demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between objectively measured sleep duration, sleepiness, and externalizing behaviors. Moreover, a recent systematic review underscores the critical need to prioritize the assessment of sleep duration and incorporate objective sleep measures in future studies. It also highlights the pressing need for research involving more diverse and representative populations, as existing evidence is disproportionately derived from European, North American, and Chinese cohorts.

Strengths and weaknesses of the literature — this body of work includes data on millions of participants across continents and decades, with human performance studies providing strong experimental and objective evidence and population-based outcomes; however, epidemiologic studies are often cross-sectional, frequently rely on retrospective self-report with measurement error, vary in question wording and capture of napping, and use inconsistent sleep-duration definitions where short sleep may be categorized as < 5, 5, 6, or < 8 hours and reference groups as 7, 8, 7–8, 7–9, or 6–8 hours.

### Association between snacking habits and sleep problems in children aged 6 to 12: a cross-sectional study in iran [^111fYpLh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite growing interest in this area, most existing studies have examined the relationship between general snacking habits and sleep quality, often focusing on small, localized populations. Little research has examined the link between specific dietary patterns and distinct sleep problems in children, and even fewer studies have investigated these associations in non-Western populations. For example, while a recent cross-sectional study involving children from multiple countries found that healthier dietary patterns were associated with fewer sleep problems, other studies have reported mixed findings regarding the impact of specific nutrients or food groups on sleep outcomes.

Existing research has predominantly highlighted the adverse effects of high-sugar, energy-dense snacking on children's sleep while overlooking how nutrient-rich snack choices may support sleep quality and rarely examining these associations in non-Western populations. To address these gaps, the present study investigates the relationship between overall snacking habits — including both healthy and unhealthy patterns — and sleep problems in a large sample of Iranian elementary school children. Employing latent class regression analysis (LCA) with distal outcomes, this work aims to delineate distinct snacking–sleep profiles and provide culturally tailored insights for targeted dietary interventions to enhance pediatric sleep health.

### Modifiable parental factors and adolescent sleep during early adolescence [^113Q5F2d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How are modifiable parental factors when children are 9 to 11 years of age associated with adolescent sleep at 13 to 14 years of age, and what are the mediating and moderating factors?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3419 adolescents, family conflict and parental psychopathology were associated with later sleep timing, later chronotype, and poorer sleep quality, whereas parental monitoring was associated with better sleep quality and parental warmth with earlier chronotype in girls. Screen use mediated associations with sleep timing and chronotype, while emotional regulation mediated the association with sleep quality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that sex-informed, family-based interventions may improve adolescent sleep health.

### Sleep duration in schooldays is associated with health-related quality of life in Norwegian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^112tviZE]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

As sleeping habits among adolescents have changed in the last decades, updated research evidence is needed to describe sleep in both schooldays and weekends of Norwegian adolescents. Further, exploring how their sleep duration in schooldays and in weekends may affect different aspects of HRQOL, which may provide new insight of their everyday life. Finally, to date little is known about self-efficacy as possible underlying mechanisms between sleep duration in schooldays and HRQOL in Norwegian adolescents. Hence, to address the current research gaps, the following aims are presented:

1. To describe sleep in Norwegian 13–15-year-old adolescents.

2. To explore possible associations between sleep duration in schooldays and weekends on HRQOL and self-efficacy.

3. Testing self-efficacy as a possible mediator on the relationship between sleep duration in schooldays and HRQOL.

We hypothesized that longer sleep duration in schooldays would reveal higher HRQOL and self-efficacy, and that self-efficacy would mediate the relationship between sleep duration and HRQOL.

### Modifiable parental factors and adolescent sleep during early adolescence [^115fBDJW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Early adolescence is marked by significant neurobiological, hormonal, and sociocontextual changes that impact sleep health. Sleep problems, including difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, delayed sleep timing, and irregular sleep-wake patterns, are prevalent during adolescence, and associated with adverse outcomes such as lower academic and/or cognitive performance, emotional dysregulation, and compromised physical growth. Identifying modifiable factors promoting healthy adolescent sleep is therefore crucial for developing targeted interventions.

Drawing on ecological systems theory by Bronfenbrenner, which highlights the central role of the family environment and its interactions with broader environmental systems in shaping developmental outcomes, we focused on modifiable parental factors, which may play an important role in adolescent sleep. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysisdefined modifiable parental factors as "behavioural or cognitive factors within the capacity of parents to alter, through self-directed action or psychological intervention", and identified parental warmth, parental monitoring, family conflict, and parental psychopathology as having emerging evidence of association with adolescent sleep. However, as discussed by the authors, most research has been cross-sectional, assessed limited parenting and sleep domains, and relied solely on self-reported measures of sleep. Prospective studies incorporating these modifiable parental factors with both objective and subjective sleep measures are needed to verify the associations and identify therapeutic targets.

The adapted bioecological model of Bronfenbrenner emphasizes the importance of proximal processes — the ongoing, reciprocal interactions between adolescents and their immediate environment — as primary engines of development. Within this framework, we conceptualize emotional regulation and screen use as important mediators linking parental factors to adolescent sleep. Parenting practices can directly shape emotional regulation skills, which are essential for healthy sleep patterns through their effects on stress management and bedtime routines. Likewise, parental factors influence adolescents' screen use behaviors, which in turn impact sleep through mechanisms such as circadian rhythm disruption and increased cognitive arousal. Understanding these mediating pathways is critical for designing targeted, scalable interventions.

Additionally, the Bronfenbrenner model accommodates exploration of moderators such as sex, as empirical evidence supports sex-specific responses to parenting and differences in sleep patterns during adolescence. Some studies suggest girls may be more sensitive to parental warmth and family climate, while males may be more affected by parental monitoring or discipline. However, prospective examinations of such mediators and moderators during early to middle adolescence remain absent.

Cardiovascular health — sleep duration and blood pressure associations in children and adolescents: Participant numbers varied from as few as 20 to just over 5,500, and no studies included children younger than 5 years of age. The majority of studies suggested a shorter sleep duration was associated with either an increased risk of hypertension or actual hypertension; for children ≥ 5 years, shorter sleep defined as < 10 hours, some < 9 hours, some < 8 hours, and one < 5 hours was associated with these outcomes. One study showed an increased odds ratio of hypertension in girls who slept > 9.5 hours. Another study suggested that < 10 hours of sleep was associated with hypotension, with systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg in preschoolers.

### Modifiable parental factors and adolescent sleep during early adolescence [^114Tygad]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Sleep problems are common in adolescence and are associated with poorer mental and physical health. Parental factors may be associated with adolescent sleep, providing potential targets for sleep health interventions. Whether these associations are mediated through emotional regulation and screen use and whether they vary by adolescent sex remain unclear.

Objective

To investigate prospective associations between modifiable parental factors and sleep outcomes among adolescents 4 years later, with examination of the mediating roles of screen use and emotional regulation and the moderating role of adolescent sex.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This preregistered prospective cohort study collected data from 3 waves (ages 9–11 [wave 1], ages 12–13 [wave 2], and ages 13–14 years [wave 3]) in the US-based Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study from June 1, 2016, to October 15, 2018. Data were analyzed from February 20 to November 13, 2024. Participants include a nationally representative sample of 3419 youths with sleep data available at wave 3.

Exposures

Parental factors, mediating variables (emotional regulation and screen use), and the moderator variable (adolescent sex).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adolescent duration, timing, chronotype, quality, and regularity of sleep were assessed using actigraphy or questionnaires at wave 3.

Results

Among 3419 adolescents included in the analysis (1806 [52.8%] male; mean [SD] age, 9.49 [0.50] years), greater parental monitoring was associated with better sleep quality (β = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01–0.07; p = 0.04). Higher family conflict was associated with later chronotype (β = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01–0.08; p = 0.04) and poorer sleep quality (β = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.01; p = 0.04). Parental psychopathology was associated with later sleep timing (β = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11; p = 0.03), later chronotype (β = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.09; p = 0.01), and poorer sleep quality (β = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.26; P < .001). Adolescent screen use partially mediated most of these associations, while the mediating role of emotional regulation was limited to sleep quality. Sex moderated the association between parental warmth and earlier chronotype in girls (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.06; p = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this prospective study of the ABCD cohort, modifiable parental factors in early adolescence were associated with specific adolescent sleep outcomes 4 years later, with screen use and emotional regulation serving as mediators. Adolescent sex moderated the association between parental warmth and sleep chronotype. These findings highlight potential targets for evidence-based interventions to improve adolescent sleep health.

### Physical activity and sleep are inconsistently related in healthy children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JFJ3z]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Physical activity is considered an effective method to improve sleep quality in adolescents and adults. However, there is mixed evidence among children. Our objectives were to investigate this association in children and to examine potential moderating variables. Eight databases were systematically searched, and we included all study designs with a sample of healthy children ages 3–13 years-old. We identified 47 studies for meta-analysis. Overall, we found little association between physical activity and sleep (r = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = -0.03 to 0.07). There was a high amount of heterogeneity in the overall model (I² = 93%). However, none of the examined variables significantly moderated the overall effect, including age, gender, risk of bias, study quality, measurement methodology, study direction, and publication year. Exploratory analyses showed some weak, but statistically significant associations for vigorous physical activity with sleep (r = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.17, I² = 66.3%), specifically sleep duration (r = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.00 to 0.14, I² = 41.1%). High heterogeneity and the lack of experimental research suggest our findings should be interpreted with caution. The current evidence, however, shows little support for an association between physical activity and sleep in children.

Sleep duration and general health — In young adults, sleeping < 7 hours was more likely to be associated with poorer general health and low health related quality-of-life (HRQOL) than ≥ 7 hours, and across studies many but not all indicated that < 7 hours is associated with poorer general health and increased risk or presence of disease compared to 7–8 hours of sleep; evidence for longer sleep is less consistent, with only a few studies showing poorer general health or increased risk/presence of disease with ≥ 9 hours of sleep.

### Sleep duration in schooldays is associated with health-related quality of life in Norwegian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^112TxvTA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study described sleep among Norwegian adolescents and demonstrated that sleep durations in weekends and schooldays impact HRQOL and self-efficacy, revealing overall better outcome in HRQOL and self-efficacy with sufficient sleep during schooldays than sleep during weekends. Self-efficacy was found as a mediator on the relationship between sleep duration in schooldays and HRQOL subscales and thus provided insight in underlying mechanisms of the association. Revealing that sleep duration explained most of the associations in 4 out of 5 HRQOL subscales, except in the association with the HRQOL subscale physical well-being. These findings support the regularity of sleep and highlight the importance of sufficient sleep during the schooldays, especially in a school-based sample of adolescents.

### Recommended amount of sleep for pediatric populations: a consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^1173fBv3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine consensus — health outcomes linked to pediatric sleep duration and guidance: Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems, and insufficient sleep also increases the risk of accidents, injuries, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and depression. Insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts. Regularly sleeping more than the recommended hours may be associated with adverse health outcomes such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and mental health problems. Parents who are concerned that their child is sleeping too little or too much should consult their healthcare provider for evaluation of a possible sleep disorder.

Methods

Leading pediatric sleep medicine researchers and clinicians, in collaboration with Brown Medical School, convened a conference to discuss the state of the field. Participants engaged in multiple discussion panels and work groups, ultimately creating recommendations to advance basic and clinical research, clinical practice, sleep education, and public policy.

Results

Participants reached agreement on the major challenges facing the field. Key points of consensus were the need to conduct long-term epidemiologic studies of sleep patterns and sleep disorders in children, standardize polysomnography and other sleep-measurement methodologies, examine the links between insufficient and disrupted sleep in the pediatric population and physical and mental health outcomes, and develop clinical standards of practice. Attendees also agreed on the need to educate more medical health practitioners and the public on pediatric sleep. The importance of research on sleep in children and adolescents to inform public policy decisions was also endorsed.

Conclusions

Pediatric sleep medicine is a related, but unique, discipline within the broader field of sleep medicine. Additional research, both basic and clinical, on all aspects of children's sleep is necessary to elucidate the neurophysiologic basis of normal sleep development; to establish a solid foundation for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sleep disorders; and to formulate evidence-based public policy in sleep health.

### Normal sleep in children and adolescence [^113EW8vZ]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Adequate sleep is essential for healthy development in childhood and adolescence. Healthy sleep contributes to good physical health, immune function, mental health, and academic performance. The regulation and architecture of sleep change greatly across childhood and adolescence, and the ability to obtain sufficient sleep is impacted by a range of factors that change with maturation. This article describes normal sleep across childhood and adolescence and discusses some of the most common barriers to adequate sleep, including early school start times, technology use, and changes to circadian rhythms, and sleep homeostasis across puberty.

### Associations between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health: a systematic review [^112F6Mk1]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

This review explored the associations between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health. It was performed following PRISMA guidelines. We identified 63 studies. Forty-one studies examined the association between sleep variability and body composition, with 29 examined body mass index (BMI). Thirteen studies used social jet lag (SJL), n = 30,519, with nine reporting a null association. Eight studies used variability in sleep duration (n = 33,029), with five reporting a correlation with BMI. Fourteen studies (n = 133,403) focused on overweight/obesity; significant associations with sleep variability were found in 11 (n = 120,168). Sleep variability was associated with weight gain (seven studies; n = 79,522). Twenty-three studies examined glucose outcomes. The association with hemoglobin A1c (16 studies, n = 11,755) differed depending on populations, while associations with diabetes or glucose were mixed, and none were seen with insulin resistance (five studies; n = 6416). Sixteen studies examined cardiovascular-related outcomes, with inconsistent results. Overall significant associations were found in five studies focusing on metabolic syndrome (n = 7413). In summary, sleep variability was likely associated with obesity, weight gain, and metabolic syndrome. It might be associated with hemoglobin A1c in people with type 1 diabetes. The associations with other outcomes were mixed. This review highlighted the possible association between sleep variability and cardiometabolic health.

### 24-hour movement behaviour study-Lithuanian protocol: a comprehensive overview of behaviours and health outcomes in adolescents [^115ZPAQu]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The assessment of 24-h MovBeh, encompassing PA, sedentary time and sleep duration, provides a comprehensive view of adolescent lifestyles and their impacts on health-related quality of life and mental health. A recent systemic review and meta-analysis summarised the studies on 24-hour movement guidelines among children and adolescents. Among the 39 studies included, adherence to all three guidelines was positively associated with adiposity, cardiometabolic health, mental and social health, physical fitness, health-related quality of life, academic achievement, cognitive development, perceived health, dietary patterns and myopia. However, the authors emphasise the need for longitudinal and experimental studies to deepen our understanding of how these 24-hour movement guidelines relate to health indicators which will help refine and improve these guidelines.

This holistic approach recognises the interconnected nature of PA, SB and sleep and their cumulative effects on adolescent well-being. The findings from the 24-h MovBeh study will help determine the optimal balance between these behaviours to improve health-related quality of life and mental health in adolescents. Previous studies have highlighted that higher levels of PA and adequate sleep are consistently associated with better health outcomes including improved mood, greater self-esteem and lower levels of depression and anxiety. Conversely, excessive SB, particularly screen time, is linked to poorer mental health outcomes including negative body image and reduced quality of life. Finally, the present study will assess the impact of the basic psychological needs satisfaction during physical education on children's 24-h MovBeh and other outcomes. No studies up to date assessed motivation for physical education using the 24-h MovBeh paradigm.

The 24-hour MovBeh study will advocate for integrated guidelines that promote regular PA, SB, and ensure adequate sleep, all to improve adolescents' mental and physical health. The goal is to establish a monitoring system that tracks health and lifestyle outcomes, which will be beneficial to epidemiologists, policymakers, educators, and the general public. Furthermore, the study aims to provide data to enhance the training of teachers and public health specialists, thereby supporting more informed decision-making within schools.

The project aims to comprehensively understand adolescent health needs and their relationship with 24-h MovBeh, generating new evidence on this topic in Lithuanian adolescents. Results will be disseminated through academic publications, conferences, workshops and digital platforms to promote evidence-based interventions and healthy lifestyle practices for preventing chronic diseases among adolescents.

### The relationship between sleep duration and mood in adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112BzMFx]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Insufficient sleep has been argued to result in deleterious changes to mood in adolescents and offers promise as a modifiable risk factor. A systematic review of the literature regarding sleep duration and mood in adolescents was conducted using the academic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and EMBASE to identify relevant literature. Seventy-four studies, including 361,505 adolescents were sourced out of the 1534 references identified, 73 of which were appropriate for meta-analysis. Pooled results indicated that less sleep was associated with a 55% increase in the likelihood of mood deficits. Positive mood showed the largest relationship with sleep duration, followed by anger, depression, negative affect and anxiety. Effect sizes also varied according to study design, how sleep was operationalised, and geographical region, but not according to the inclusion of covariates. Sleep duration has a significant negative impact on a range of mood states in healthy adolescents. These effects were witnessed across all geographical regions, highlighting that sleep is a universal and modifiable risk factor for preventing mood deficits in this at-risk population.

### Neighborhood environments and sleep among children and adolescents: a systematic review [^113U3XrR]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Understanding salient environmental determinants of pediatric sleep is essential for informing interventions and public health initiatives. Emerging evidence suggests that the neighborhood environment can impact pediatric sleep, but this evidence has not yet been systematically reviewed. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature on associations between neighborhood environments and sleep in young children (0–5 y), school-aged children (6–12 y) and adolescents (13–18 y). We reviewed 85 articles published between 2003 and 2020. The most commonly examined neighborhood exposure was low socioeconomic status (40 studies), which was associated with sleep outcomes in 58% of studies (primarily shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, or obstructive sleep apnea). Evidence was stronger for neighborhood safety/crime/violence (21 studies), with 86% of studies reporting associations with sleep outcomes (primarily self- or caregiver-reported sleep problems). Fewer studies examined associations of neighborhood physical environment exposures, including noise (15 studies), the built environment (seven studies), and air pollution (six studies). Limitations of the current body of evidence include 1) limited examination of neighborhood exposures other than socioeconomic status or safety, 2) use of primarily cross-sectional observational study designs, 3) lack of objective sleep outcome assessment, and 4) limits of current exposure assessment methods.

### Associations between sleep, obesity, and mental health in adolescents: understanding sex-specific vulnerabilities [^111vNinZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sleep disturbances and mental health challenges often arise during adolescence, with a greater prevalence among females and individuals experiencing obesity. In this study, we examined the intricate relationships between sleep problems, obesity, and biological sex, and their combined relationship with well-being in a large, diverse cohort of US adolescents.

Methods

We analyzed data from 7261 adolescents (Year 2: Mean age = 11.94 years, range: 10–14 years, 47.3% female) participating in the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®. Sleep duration and sleep quality were determined from self-reported questionnaires. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (caregiver-report) and the Brief Problem Monitor (youth-report). Positive affect was measured with the NIH Toolbox (youth-report). Regression models were used to investigate the associations between obesity (body mass index > 95th percentile), sleep patterns, and mental health, while accounting for sex, age and socio-demographic variables.

Results

Shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep quality, and experiencing obesity were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing problems. Longer sleep duration was associated with lower internalizing scores, but only among adolescents who were not experiencing obesity. Additionally, shorter sleep and poorer sleep quality were associated with lower positive affect, with stronger effects observed among adolescent females compared to males.

Conclusion

This study reveals complex interactions between sleep, obesity, and mental health in adolescents, with notable sex differences. The findings emphasize the need for adolescent mental health interventions to address both sleep and obesity, while considering the distinct vulnerabilities associated with sex and obesity.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^1115e9xN]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Immunologic health in older children and adolescents — sleep duration evidence indicates that 13 non-randomized studies with participant counts ranging from as few as 54 to just under 1,500 reported mixed findings: one study linked 8–8.9 hours to a healthier immune profile and another found higher CRP with less than 8 hours; no studies suggested too much sleep was harmful. Overall, sleep durations less than 8 hours are associated with worse overall immunological health, and optimal sleep is between 8–9 hours in older children and adolescents.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^113nPhJ1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine pediatric sleep duration consensus — discussion emphasizes fundamentals and scope: "Sleep is a necessity for health", with variability "explained by psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, and environmental factors", and "Sleep disorders also contribute to this variability". The panel "focused solely on the dimension of sleep duration", and recommendations "provide sleep durations that promote optimal health, but do not address other sleep factors"; studies included excluded "total sleep deprivation (no sleep for 24 hours)" because "Total sleep deprivation is not sustainable and thus not reflective of habitual sleep", In developmental context, "total sleep time is high in infants and toddlers, with gradual reduction over time as one approaches pre-adolescence and adolescence", paralleling cerebral metabolism "studied in 100 healthy children using positron emission tomography", and "The reduction in total sleep time over the first decade is felt to be related to an initial overproduction, and subsequent pruning away of unnecessary synapses". The panel noted that "too little sleep for each age group was unhealthy", discussed longer sleep durations, highlighted that longer sleep can be associated with sleep disorders and limited sleep-extension evidence, identified "a few U-shape curves that showed that both, too little and too much sleep were associated with poorer outcomes", and "strongly encourages future experimental studies to examine the effects of sleep extension on health outcomes". The guidance "reflect typical or habitual sleep duration, i.e., the ideal average sleep duration", while "sleep duration in the real world is a dynamic process" with "variable sleep schedules depending on school start times, work, and extracurricular activities that may curtail sleep on weekdays and extend sleep on weekends", and "More studies are needed to better characterize effects of this "social jet lag".

### Inadequate sleep as a contributor to type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^114TpYci]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Inadequate sleep as a contributor to type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents: observational evidence

The key characteristics and main findings of the 21 observational studies that were retained for this review are presented in Table 1. Among them, 13 studies showed negative associations between one or more sleep characteristic (for example, duration and/or architecture) and one or more T2D biomarkers, 10 studies used an objective sleep measurement (for example, PSG, actigraphy or Fitbit activity watch), 2 studies were longitudinal in design and 1 study explored the phenotypic link between sleep duration and insulin resistance. A little more than a third of the observational studies found no associations between one or two sleep characteristics and one or more T2D biomarkers.

Sleep duration and glucose homeostasis

Ten studies out of the 21 reported no association between sleep duration and glucose homeostasis biomarkers, (Table 1). These findings appear to be independent of the method used to measure sleep duration (that is, subjective vs objective sleep duration measurement); six of these studies employed self- or parent-reported questionnaires, two studies employed a combination of actigraphy and sleep log, one study used PSGand one study provided its participants with a commercial health and activity watch (Fitbit), also accompanied with a sleep log. Although the type of measurement used to assess sleep duration may not be a critical limitation, there are other important factors to consider when examining the association between sleep and glucose homeostasis biomarkers in children and adolescents. These factors include maturation stage, physical activity, nutrition, screen time, other stressors and level of adiposity. Additionally, when measuring sleep duration, it may be useful to also measure sleep quality in order to evaluate if the number of hours are indeed insufficient or sufficient for each participant individually (one size does not fit all when we measure sleep duration; some individuals can cope better than others with less sleep than recommended). Sleep guidelines, discussed later in the present review, are presented as a range of hours for a particular age group; however, some children may require more or less sleep due to many factors (for example, genetics, environmental factors, health status and so on) than what the guidelines stipulate to feel rested. Thus, without assessing how tired each participant feels after a night of sleep, it is very hard to determine if the duration of sleep is indeed sufficient.

### A meta-analysis and model of the relationship between sleep and depression in adolescents: recommendations for future research and clinical practice [^113TV1eS]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to quantify the strength of evidence for a directional relationship between sleep disturbance and depression in adolescents. A literature search was conducted to identify research investigating the relationship between sleep disturbance and depression in adolescent samples (12–20 y). Twenty-three studies were identified; 13 explored associations between depression and sleep disturbance; seven examined the prospective role of sleep disturbance in the development of depression; and three investigated the role of adolescent depression in the development of subsequent sleep disturbance. Average weighted mean differences in sleep/depression-related outcome variables were calculated between adolescents with depression, and non-clinical adolescents, or those in remission. Adolescents with depression experienced significantly more wakefulness in bed (sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, number of awakenings and sleep efficiency), lighter sleep (more stage 1), and reported more subjective sleep disturbance. Overall effect sizes from longitudinal and treatment studies suggest sleep disturbance acts as a precursor to the development of depression. At follow-up, depressed adolescents had significantly longer sleep onset, more wake after sleep onset, and lower sleep efficiency compared to adolescents who were non-clinical, or had undergone remission. Little support was found for a predictive role of depressive symptoms in the development of sleep disturbance. Based on these findings we propose a model to understand the development of depression from initial sleep disturbance, provide recommendations for clinicians and recommendations for future research.

### Associations of sleep time, quality of life, and obesity indicators on physical literacy components: a structural equation model [^114HoSZg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

However, the findings of the present study indicate that obesity has a detrimental impact on the relationships between ideal sleep, health-related quality of life (HQOL), and physical literacy. This outcome raises concerns due to the multifactorial nature of obesity, highlighting the need to address various factors in order to effectively reduce childhood obesity. Consequently, only meeting sleep recommendations is not considered a sufficient strategy for reducing obesity. The existing literature provides further evidence supporting the association between being overweight and experiencing poorer health-related quality of life (HQOL), as well as reduced levels of physical literacy components, such as physical activity practice and sedentary behavior. Additionally, studies have shown that the inverse relationship between sleep duration and adiposity in adolescents also impacts HQOL and physical literacy.

Therefore, present findings have indicated that sleep is fundamental to several health indicators. However, the physical literacy components considered in the present study, especially practicing regular physical activity, physical exercise, and sedentary behaviors also seem to develop beneficial effects to reduce obesity and improve HQOL in adolescents. It is highlighted that strategics of public health should encourage children and adolescents at early bedtime to meet sleep duration recommendations to minimize the harmful association between short sleep duration and worse health indicators. Thus, implementing health interventions becomes crucial in improving sleep duration and promoting physical activity among children and adolescents. Furthermore, gaining a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between sleep, sedentary behavior, and physical activity is essential for enhancing overall health and well-being during adolescence. In addition, improving mental well-being is important to promote physical activity and ideal sleep. It is suggested that an intervention program that includes obesity-related health education, physical activity, and diet control is important to improve HQOL in the child, especially in boys. Also, the HQOL seems to be benefited from an educational intervention program focused on physical activity and nutritional recommendations in children and adolescents with obesity.

### Joint association of sleep onset time and sleep duration with cardiometabolic health outcome [^1151YXeN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep Parameters

Sleep parameters, including sleep onset time and sleep duration, were assessed by the self‐report questionnaire, detailed elsewhere. In the cycle of NHANES 2015 to 2016, sleep onset time was defined as the response to the question: "What time do you usually go to sleep on weekdays or workdays?" However, in the 2017 to 2018 cycle, participants were asked: "What time do you usually fall asleep on weekdays or workdays?" During the 2015 to 2016 cycle, sleep duration was elicited directly by asking for the usual hours of sleep on weekdays or workdays. During the 2017 to 2018 cycle, usual hours of sleep were calculated by asking respondents their normal bedtime and wake time on weekdays or workdays.

Sleep duration was divided into 3 groups: < 7 hours (insufficient), 7 to 8 hours (sufficient), and ≥ 9 hours (excessive) according to appropriate sleep durations recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The sleep onset time was categorized as < 22:00 (early), 22:00 to 23:59 (optimal), and ≥ 24:00 (late).

### Sleep in adolescents: the perfect storm [^111kt2RU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

A reduction in sleep amount from late childhood through the second decade has long been known; however, the weight of current evidence holds that sleep need does not decline across this span. This article will describe how the loss of sleep through adolescence is not driven by lower need for sleep but arises from a convergence of biologic, psychological, and socio-cultural influences.

### Association between mental health status and sleep status among adolescents in Japan: a nationwide cross-sectional survey [^1164Hwjq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous epidemiological studies on relationships between mental health status and sleep status of adolescents have not been sufficiently representative. In the present study, using samples representative of Japanese adolescents nationwide, associations between mental health status and various sleep statuses were examined.

Method

The survey was conducted in December 2004 and January 2005 among students enrolled in randomly selected junior and senior high schools throughout Japan, using self-administered questionnaires that addressed lifestyle, sleep status, mental health status, and personal data. Of 103,650 questionnaires collected, 99,668 were analyzed. Sleep status was assessed according to sleep duration, subjective sleep assessment, bedtime, and insomnia symptoms. The Japanese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire was employed for assessment of mental health status.

Results

Mental health status of subjects whose sleep duration was less than 7 hours, and those who slept 9 hours or more, was poorer than that of subjects who slept for 7 hours or more but less than 9 hours. A U-shaped association was observed between mental health status and sleep duration. Furthermore, a linear association was observed between subjective sleep assessment and mental health status; the worse the subjective sleep assessment, the poorer the mental health status. Mental health status was also inversely proportional to the frequency of insomnia symptoms.

Conclusion

The fact that sleep duration and subjective sleep assessment showed different patterns of association with mental health status indicates that these 2 sleep parameters have independent significance. Considering these associations, it is important to promote mental health care and sleep hygiene education for adolescents.

### Association of outdoor artificial light at night with mental disorders and sleep patterns among US adolescents [^113RxJrx]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Indoor nighttime light exposure influences sleep and circadian rhythms and is known to affect mood-associated brain circuits in animals. However, little is known about the association between levels of nighttime outdoor light and sleep and mental health in the population, especially among adolescents.

Objective

To estimate associations of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) with sleep patterns and past-year mental disorder among US adolescents.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based, cross-sectional study of US adolescents used the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from February 2001 through January 2004. A probability sample of adolescents aged 13 to 18 years was included. Analyses were conducted between February 2019 and April 2020.

Exposures

Levels of outdoor ALAN, measured by satellite, with means calculated within census block groups. ALAN values were transformed into units of radiance (nW/cm²/sr).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported habitual sleep patterns (weeknight bedtime, weeknight sleep duration, weekend bedtime delay, and weekend oversleep) and past-year mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance use disorders, measured via an in-person structured diagnostic interview. Parent-reported information was included in behavior disorder diagnoses.

Results

Among 10 123 adolescents (4953 boys [51.3%]; mean [SE] age, 15.2 [0.06] years [weighted]; 6483 for behavior disorder outcomes), ALAN was positively associated with indicators of social disadvantage, such as racial/ethnic minority status (median [IQR] ALAN: white adolescents, 12.96 [30.51] nW/cm²/sr; Hispanic adolescents: 38.54 [47.84] nW/cm²/sr; non-Hispanic black adolescents: 37.39 [51.88] nW/cm²/sr; adolescents of other races/ethnicities: 30.94 [49.93] nW/cm²/sr; P < .001) and lower family income (median [IQR] ALAN by family income-to-poverty ratio ≤ 1.5: 26.76 [52.48] nW/cm²/sr; > 6: 21.46 [34.38] nW/cm²/sr; p = 0.005). After adjustment for several sociodemographic characteristics, as well as area-level population density and socioeconomic status, this study found that higher ALAN levels were associated with later weeknight bedtime, and those in the lowest quartile of ALAN reported the longest weeknight sleep duration. Those in the highest quartile of ALAN went to bed 29 (95% CI, 15–43) minutes later and reported 11 (95% CI, 19–2) fewer minutes of sleep than those in the lowest quartile. ALAN was also positively associated with prevalence of past-year mood and anxiety disorder: each median absolute deviation increase in ALAN was associated with 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00–1.14) times the odds of mood disorder and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.05–1.16) times the odds of anxiety disorder. Further analyses revealed associations with bipolar disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.05–1.35]), specific phobias (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.11–1.26]), and major depressive disorder or dysthymia (OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00–1.15]). Among adolescent girls, differences in weeknight bedtime by ALAN (third and fourth quartiles vs first quartile) were greater with increasing years since menarche (F3, 8.15; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, area-level outdoor ALAN was associated with less favorable sleep patterns and mood and anxiety disorder in adolescents. Future studies should elucidate whether interventions to reduce exposure to ALAN may positively affect mental and sleep health.

### Sleep among Brazilian adolescents before and after the COVID-19 pandemic: repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses [^1158Sv43]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to compare sleep variables before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of Brazilian adolescents. In our study, cross-sectional data indicate that individuals had more consistent sleep schedules across weekdays and weekends in 2022 than in 2019, and individuals self-reported sleeping slightly shorter on average. The prospective data suggest that individuals had more sleep irregularity across the week, fewer instances of compensating for lost sleep on weekends or days off, which could suggest either more consistent sleep during the week or less overall sleep need, and that individuals were experiencing more fatigue and sleepiness during the day, possibly due to poorer sleep quality or insufficient sleep duration. However, the small effect sizes associated with these differences suggest that while there are statistically significant differences between time points, they are relatively modest and may not be considered meaningful or clinically important, unless they become a trend. Despite of that, more than 50% of the adolescents reported insufficient sleep duration in both years. This persistent pattern of sleep deprivation remains clinically relevant, given its association with a range of negative outcomes across psychological/social, cognitive/academic, and physical health domains, reported in a number of studies.

Some changes in adolescents' sleep patterns during the pandemic were documented, such as longer sleep durations, later bedtimes, and poorer sleep quality. However, our results indicate that once adolescents returned to their routines and school, their sleep behaviors also returned to values like those before the pandemic. These findings are in line with international evidence on adolescent sleep duration before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A prospective study with 28,307 Canadian adolescents showed that sleep duration increased during the early stages of the pandemic but later declined, returning to pre-pandemic levels by 2022. This is not necessarily a positive outcome, given that some sleep behaviors are not adequate, such as the fact that only about half of adolescents are meeting the recommended sleep duration of 8 to 10 hours per night. This underscores the need to promote sleep health within this group.

### Associations of sleep time, quality of life, and obesity indicators on physical literacy components: a structural equation model [^112RKkq7]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

HQOL also seems to be benefited from ideal sleep. It was indicated that adequate sleep duration is positively associated with better HQOL, including in Brazilian young. Other study pointed out that sleep duration is predicted of mental well-being. In children, it is also observed the relationship between ideal sleep and better HQOL. A systematic review found that adolescents with more hours of sleep had better HQOL and lower adiposity compared with individuals with short sleep duration. Regarding obesity indicators, results of a systematic review study suggested that there is an association between adequate sleep duration and the reduction of weight in children and adolescents and vice versa. Sleep disorders seem to be a common complication of being overweight, and sleep disorders are also capable of worse complications associated with adiposity. A meta-analysis identified that short sleep duration is longitudinally associated with childhood obesity. However, it is important to highlight that sleep presents U-shaped patterns, both short-duration and long-duration sleep (> 9 h) demonstrate negative health effects. Therefore, adhering to the recommended sleep duration of 8 to 10 h is essential to promote optimal health in adolescents.

### Trajectory and trend of weight status, emotional wellbeing and sleep from infancy to childhood to adolescence in scotland: an analysis of growing up in scotland birth cohort 1 [^117MsRUu]. Pediatric Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

To effectively integrate sleep and emotional wellbeing into obesity‐focused interventions, it is essential to examine the trajectories and trends of these factors across childhood and adolescence. Existing longitudinal trajectory research examining sleep, weight status and emotional wellbeing in isolation has shown that sleep duration typically declines, emotional wellbeing fluctuates, particularly in early adolescence and BMI follows distinct growth curves. However, to our knowledge, no studies have mapped trends in these three domains concurrently within the same population. This study therefore seeks to describe patterns in these health indicators across childhood and adolescence within a single nationally representative cohort.

The aim of this research was to identify the trajectories and trends of sleep, obesity and emotional wellbeing between the ages of 4 and 14 years using data from the Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) birth cohort 1. Although this study does not directly assess interactions between sleep, emotional wellbeing and obesity, previous research has demonstrated that these outcomes are interrelated, with shared determinants and bidirectional associations across childhood and adolescence. Understanding their co‐developmental patterns can support the design of timely, integrated interventions. Analysing the overlap in the decline of health along these trajectories will help identify critical periods for intervention. This research can guide the development of targeted, multi‐faceted interventions designed to address the complex interplay between sleep, emotional wellbeing and obesity, ultimately helping to combat all three components simultaneously.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^111zFQyC]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Light is a potent circadian entraining agent. For many people, daily light exposure is fundamentally dysregulated with reduced light during the day and increased light into the late evening. This lighting schedule promotes chronic disruption to circadian physiology resulting in a myriad of impairments. Developmental changes in sleep-wake physiology suggest that such light exposure patterns may be particularly disruptive for adolescents and further compounded by lifestyle factors such as early school start times. This narrative review describes evidence that reduced light exposure during the school day delays the circadian clock, and longer exposure durations to light-emitting electronic devices in the evening suppress melatonin. While home lighting in the evening can suppress melatonin secretion and delay circadian phase, the patterning of light exposure across the day and evening can have moderating effects. Photic countermeasures may be flexibly and scalably implemented to support sleep-wake health; including manipulations of light intensity, spectra, duration and delivery modality across multiple contexts. An integrative approach addressing physiology, attitudes, and behaviors will support optimization of light-driven sleep-wake outcomes in adolescents.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^115HziAp]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is disturbed sleep associated with depression in children and youths?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 16 studies including 27 073 patients, pooled estimates supported the role of disturbed sleep as a risk factor for depression in children and youths. Effect size estimates were small but statistically significant.

Meaning

This study suggests that disturbed sleep is a component of the multifaceted risk profile of depression and should be included in prevention programs as early as childhood.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^1139hVbq]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelinewas followed and fulfilled. This study also adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline.

Search Strategy, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

The search strategy is detailed in eMethods 1 in the Supplement. Title and abstract screening was performed by 2 authors (M.W. and X.J.) until a κ scoreof 0.8 was achieved, with the remainder being selected by 1 reviewer (M.W. or X.J.). Full-text screening was performed independently by 2 authors (M.W. and X.J.). Disagreements were solved by discussion and, if needed, referred to a third, senior-author reviewer (C.M.).

Studies were included if they were prospective, observational studies reporting quantitative estimates of the association between disturbed sleep and depression in participants belonging to either community or clinical-based samples with any comorbid psychiatric, neurologic, or medical diagnosis. Case series, case reports, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and retrospective, cross-sectional, treatment, theoretical, and position studies were excluded.

Studies were included if participants' mean age at baseline was between 5 and 24 years. This age range was chosen to cover the whole age range at risk for depression in children and youths and to include the period of peak incidence for depression at 20 years of age. In our review, we identified the following 3 age categories: childhood, between 5 and 9 years of age; adolescence, between 10 and 19 years of age; and young adulthood, between 20 and 24 years of age. Studies were included if both disturbed sleep and depression were measured at a mean age between 5 and 24 years and if the duration between baseline and follow-up was at least 1 month.

Definitions of disturbed sleep and depression are in eMethods 2 in the Supplement. Studies were included if they reported estimates adjusted for depression at baseline and at least 1 common moderating factor, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. To avoid duplicate publications, studies that shared samples, sample sizes, 1 or more authors, setting, numbers of participants at baseline and follow-up, date and duration of the study, and exposure and outcome were excluded. Data extraction is described in eMethods 3 in the Supplement.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^1164GshJ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Light is a potent circadian entraining agent. For many people, daily light exposure is fundamentally dysregulated with reduced light during the day and increased light into the late evening. This lighting schedule promotes chronic disruption to circadian physiology resulting in a myriad of impairments. Developmental changes in sleep-wake physiology suggest that such light exposure patterns may be particularly disruptive for adolescents and further compounded by lifestyle factors such as early school start times. This narrative review describes evidence that reduced light exposure during the school day delays the circadian clock, and longer exposure durations to light-emitting electronic devices in the evening suppress melatonin. While home lighting in the evening can suppress melatonin secretion and delay circadian phase, the patterning of light exposure across the day and evening can have moderating effects. Photic countermeasures may be flexibly and scalably implemented to support sleep-wake health; including manipulations of light intensity, spectra, duration and delivery modality across multiple contexts. An integrative approach addressing physiology, attitudes, and behaviors will support optimization of light-driven sleep-wake outcomes in adolescents.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^1172KDVm]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Developmental health — across studies linking sleep duration with neurobehavioral and neurocognitive measures, sample sizes ranged from 10 participants to 35,956, and short sleep duration has a negative association with cognitive performance in a number of age groups; however, some studies have reported a U-shape relationship with too much sleep time associated with poorer cognitive performance. In early life, short sleep duration at 18 months (< 13 hours) predicted more emotionally reactive and aggressive behavior at 5 years, and persistent short sleep duration (from 0 to 7 years) has been associated with higher child irritability and poorer emotional functioning. In adolescents, one study found that sleeping less than 8 hours per night was associated with poorer cognitive performance on reasoning abilities for boys but not girls, and another study showed positive associations between sleeping less than 8 hours and poorer school grades. A meta-analysis of 35,956 children aged 5 to 12 years did not specify sleep duration but reported that longer sleep duration was associated with better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral problems.

### Joint association of sleep onset time and sleep duration with cardiometabolic health outcome [^114xNYV4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study has several strengths. These results from a large, nationwide, randomized sample survey can be generalized to the adult noninstitutionalized population in the United States. Second, to minimize the effect of reverse causality, we focused on participants without cardiovascular disease, cancer, or pregnancy at enrollment. Despite such rigorous exclusions, adverse associations between nonoptimal sleep parameters and health outcomes were still present. Third, we stratified our findings by age and sex, providing further insight into the characterization of these disparities. More important, we separately examined the independent and joint association of sleep duration and sleep onset timing with the prevalence of cardiometabolic health outcomes, thus improving the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the analysis.

However, several limitations of this study warrant attention. First, sleep health is an important contributor to general health and well‐being, encompassing dimensions such as sleep duration, timing, efficiency, daytime alertness, sleep quality, and insomnia, forming a multidimensional construct. These sleep behaviors are typically correlated and may affect in a concerted manner, and modifications in one sleep behavior usually lead to compensatory changes in other sleep behaviors. Although the study has made efforts to adjust for significant covariates, there remains a possibility that unmeasured factors like obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and shift work could influence both sleep patterns and cardiometabolic health outcomes. It is noteworthy that from a public health perspective, the use of the simple and feasible parameters makes epidemiological findings easier to be interpreted and translated into practice, and therefore to be more informative to the general population. Second, the cross‐sectional nature of this study precludes the determination of causality. Third, this study was susceptible to recall bias and objective sleep data were unavailable. However, a good agreement has been found in previous studies between self‐reported assessments of sleep and data obtained through actigraphic monitoring. Fourth, sleep parameters were collected at a single time point, thereby not allowing us to consider changes in sleep duration and sleep onset over time. Finally, we performed numerous association tests between a large number of outcome measures and sleep patterns, and multiple comparisons might result in potential spurious statistically significant results. However, we have used statistical procedures to control for multiple comparisons and our results were found significant or marginally significant using a stringent cutoff of 0.05 after adjustment for multiple tests, thus limiting the chance of false positive results.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^117BPKAG]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that disturbed sleep was prospectively associated with depression and provides quantitative estimates of the pooled effect sizes among children and youths. Although the pooled effect sizes are small, the high prevalence of children and youths with disturbed sleep implies the existence of a large cohort of vulnerable individuals who could develop depression. Disturbed sleep could be one of the many risk factors to address in depression prevention programs. Randomized clinical trials targeting disturbed sleep as early as childhood are needed to inform the planning and evaluation of depression prevention programs. These findings must be considered in the context of the limitations and the overall very low quality of evidence of the included studies.

### Bidirectional associations between accelerometer-based sleep metrics and mental health symptoms from childhood to late adolescence: data from a Brazilian birth cohort [^115q8caL]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study examined the longitudinal relationship between accelerometer-derived sleep metrics and internalizing and externalizing behaviors across childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence within a large birth cohort from Brazil. To our knowledge, it represents the first integration of a longitudinal design with accelerometer-based sleep assessments in an LMIC context. Our findings suggest that externalizing behaviors may predict prolonged sleep duration and reduced sleep efficiency, particularly during adolescence (ages 11–15). A bidirectional association was observed between internalizing symptoms and sleep duration from adolescence to late adolescence (ages 11–18). These results highlight the distinct effects of internalizing and externalizing behaviors on sleep.

In this study, we observed that higher externalizing symptoms were prospectively associated with both longer sleep duration and poorer sleep efficiency. These findings are consistent with previous research that links elevated externalizing behaviors and adverse mental health outcomes with suboptimal sleep patterns in young children. Importantly, higher externalizing symptoms in our sample predicted decreased sleep efficiency, aligning with patterns observed in studies that utilized self-reported sleep quality measures. Furthermore, studies by Yue et al. and Kelly et al. corroborate the relationship between disrupted sleep and worsening mental health outcomes. A particularly noteworthy study employing objective sleep metrics found that increased variability in weeknight sleep efficiency at age 16 predicted heightened externalizing behaviors at age 17. Even though the direction was the opposite of ours, these findings underscore the critical need to incorporate objective sleep measures in longitudinal research to elucidate the directionality of these associations more accurately.

The findings regarding sleep duration in this study were particularly compelling. While substantial evidence has consistently shown an association between short sleep duration and poorer mental health outcomes, emerging high-quality epidemiological studies suggest that longer sleep duration, particularly when coupled with poor sleep quality, may also be associated with adverse mental health consequences. This underscores the complex and bidirectional relationship between sleep patterns and externalizing behaviors. Specifically, extended sleep durations, often exceeding 8 h, have been correlated with increased inflammation, raising concerns about potential health risks, particularly in older populations. Furthermore, a Mendelian randomization study has indicated that ADHD may contribute to prolonged sleep duration, reinforcing the possibility of a causal relationship between these factors. These observations, in conjunction with our findings, underscore the need for further investigation into the relationship between prolonged sleep duration and mental health outcomes. Future research should broaden its scope to consider short and long sleep durations when exploring their impacts on mental health.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^116gdZmn]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult — future directions specify "five specific areas for future research consideration", including: 1) "Improved sleep duration measures and study designs", where studies "should include objective measures of sleep when possible, well-validated self-report measures, and ecologically valid study designs", and epidemiology "would benefit from using home polysomnography, actigraphy, or other novel objective methods"; laboratory work is "needed that systematically vary sleep opportunity in discrete steps between doses of 6 hours and 8 hours", and "should examine relevant time periods (e.g., 30 days)" and "more systematically mimic the more typical lifestyle of cycling through doses of shorter (restricted) and longer (extended) sleep opportunities". 2) "Investigate downstream mechanisms linking habitual sleep duration to health and functioning", with "Intervention studies [that] could also help to clarify whether modifying sleep improves health outcomes". 3) "Better delineate the upstream physiologic, behavioral, social, and environmental factors that may play a role in sleep duration and health outcomes". 4) "Develop intervention studies", since we "do not yet know whether habitual sleep duration can be modified in the real world", so "a systematic approach, moving from treatment development studies, to efficacy studies, to large-scale pragmatic trials, is warranted".

### Association between homeschooling and adolescent sleep duration and health during COVID-19 pandemic high school closures [^115gyWJj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In spring 2020, the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic was declared. To limit the spread of infection, social contacts were markedly reduced. Many countries were forced to shut down most of public life, including schools. Thus, children and adolescents experienced extreme changes in daily life. Critical concerns about the negative effects of closures were raised and have since been supported by empirical evidence. The prevalence of mental health problems in adolescents increased substantially during lockdown. For example, increases in depressive symptoms and anxiety and decreases in life satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were observed in longitudinal studies. Furthermore, adolescents were less physically active and spent more time being sedentary in front of screens. Findings regarding substance use have been mixed; in general, fewer adolescents consumed substances such as alcohol during the lockdown, but the frequency of consumption seemed to increase.

Although, to our knowledge, there has been no controversy about the negative association of lockdown with adolescents' well-being, a potentially conflicting finding has also appeared consistently; adolescents slept significantly longer during school closures than before them. Sleep plays a crucial role in mental and physical health, and thus, a positive association of increased sleep with adolescent well-being and health could be expected. Studies investigating later school start times (SSTs) in the morning have shown this association; early SSTs conflict with adolescents' late biologic sleep phase and therefore contribute to the well-known chronic sleep deficit of many adolescents by preventing later wake times that compensate for biologically related delayed sleep times. Studies investigating the consequences of later SSTs have consistently found longer sleep duration together with positive associations with adolescents' health. The sleep gains observed during school closures can be interpreted similarly: because students in homeschooling do not need to commute to school, school closures create a naturalistic delay in SSTs. Thus, adolescents appear to have benefitted from school closures that aligned their sleep schedule better with their biologic sleep phase, allowing more sleep. However, to our knowledge, whether the longer sleep duration during school closures was associated with health benefits, as in SST delay studies, has not been investigated.

### 24-hour movement behaviour study-Lithuanian protocol: a comprehensive overview of behaviours and health outcomes in adolescents [^1128wTjo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The 24-hour Movement Behaviour (24-h MovBeh) paradigm, encompassing physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB) and sleep patterns, is recognised as a holistic approach to adolescent health. It emphasises promoting PA, reducing SB and ensuring sufficient sleep, especially in school environments. Understanding the links between lifestyle factors and health outcomes is crucial for clinical and public health, informing interventions for lifestyle changes among adolescents. This study aims to assess adherence to 24-h MovBeh among Lithuanian adolescents, examining the patterns, inter-relationships and impacts on socio-demographic status, 24-h MovBeh, health-related fitness, blood pressure, body composition, dietary patterns, health-related quality of life, mental health, physical and exercise motivation, other lifestyles and health indicators, and academic performance. The 24-h MovBeh study is a prospective cohort study beginning in 2025 with baseline data collected in schools. It will recruit 500 primary and secondary school adolescents (11–14 years old) from Klaipeda and Kaunas, Lithuania. The study will evaluate 11 main categories: Socio-demographic status, 24-h MovBeh, health-related fitness, blood pressure, body composition, dietary patterns, health-related quality of life, mental health, physical and exercise motivation, other lifestyles and health indicators, and academic performance. Statistical analysis will estimate adherence to 24-h MovBeh and its inter-relationships with individual and environmental factors and health outcomes. The 24-h MovBeh study will be a crucial step towards establishing a monitoring system for health and lifestyle outcomes, benefiting researchers, policymakers, adolescents, and parents, while laying the groundwork for future intervention studies.

### Sleep, emotional and behavioral difficulties in children and adolescents [^112YwANa]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Links between sleep and psychopathology are complex and likely bidirectional. Sleep problems and alteration of normal sleep patterns have been identified in major forms of child psychopathology including anxiety, depression and attention disorders as well as symptoms of difficulties in the full range. This review summarizes some key findings with regard to the links between sleep and associated difficulties in childhood and adolescence. It then proposes a selection of possible mechanisms underlying some of these associations. Suggestions for future research include the need to 1) use multi-methods to assess sleep; 2) measure sleep in large-scale studies; 3) conduct controlled experiments to further establish the effects of sleep variations on emotional and behavioral difficulties; 4) take an interdisciplinary approach to further understand the links between sleep and associated difficulties.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^116PicE6]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Adolescence is marked by delays in the timing of sleep which are likely explained by a combination of physiological (i.e. slower accumulation of homeostatic sleep drive, delaying of circadian phase) and contextual-behavioral (e.g. homework burden, extracurricular activities, social interests and pressures) factors that contribute to increased evening light exposure. The principal drivers of these changes in sleep timing are not known and developing a mechanistic understanding is important for designing optimal interventions that support sleep-wake health in adolescents.

Much emphasis has been placed on examining the relation between light emitted by electronic devices as a source of sleep and circadian disruption among adolescents. Despite a tenuous relationship found, particularly at shorter exposures, there are a number of other facets of device use (e.g. timing, intensity, viewing distance, stimulation level of activity, contrast with daylight lighting) which may intersect to impact sleep and circadian rhythms. These characteristics require further investigation in in situ experiments with a special emphasis on the effects of home lighting.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^113DijhV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Data Synthesis and Data Analysis

Data were synthesized by meta-analysis if a minimum of 2 studies were available. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they reported effect size estimates, measures of precision, and P values. The I² index was applied to quantify the heterogeneity among different studies, describing the percentage of variability in effect size estimates that is due to heterogeneity. I² ≥ 50% means substantial heterogeneity. A fixed-effect model was used if I² < 50%. A Dersimonian and Laird random-effects model was used when I² ≥ 50%, based on the assumption that observed variance is due to heterogeneity among studies in populations and methods, rather than sampling error. Pooled estimates of ORs and β coefficients were obtained by the inverse variance–weighted method to account for the precision of the effect size. Odds ratios were log-transformed prior to meta-analysis to achieve approximate normality.

Pooled estimates were calculated for combined insomnia and sleep disturbances. When multiple follow-ups were available from 1 study, the longest follow-up was used in the meta-analysis; if follow-ups were of equal duration, we arbitrarily opted to use the earliest follow-up.

We fit meta-regressions to explore the heterogeneity associated with type of ascertainment, definition of and assessment tool for disturbed sleep and depression, follow-up duration, disturbed sleep at follow-up, and age at baseline. When 3 groups were compared, dummy variables were generated for comparison. A permutation test was implemented to derive P values for each subgroup analysis. Because previous meta-analyses, did not perform metaregressions, no a priori hypotheses were formulated regarding the outcome.

Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding studies with a high risk-of-bias score and studies with less than 200 participants, arbitrarily chosen as a cutoff to denote small sample sizes. Potential publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the symmetry of funnel plots, fail-safe numbers, and Egger tests.

Studies not included in the meta-analysis were synthesized based on Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines (eMethods 4 in the Supplement). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence of synthesis with and without meta-analysis separately. Meta-analysis, metaregression, and a test of heterogeneity were performed using STATA, version 14 (StataCorp). All P values were from 2-tailed tests and results were deemed statistically significant at P < .05.

### Balancing the 24-hour lifestyle: a population-based study on reducing mental health problems, self-injurious thoughts and behaviors among adolescents [^114qVxTt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Grounded in the 24-Hour Activity Cycle framework, this study aimed to quantify dose-response thresholds for seven daily behaviors-sleep, napping, low to high intensity physical activity, sedentary time, and screen time-and to evaluate their associations with mental health problems and self-injurious thoughts or behaviors in Chinese adolescents.

Methods

Between 2022 and 2023, data were collected from 33,397 Chinese students to examine lifestyle patterns and mental health. Adjusted logistic regression estimated associations between behavioral categories and four mental-health outcomes, and generalized additive models captured dose-response relationships.

Results

Compared with non-nappers, adolescents who napped 60–90 min daily had 16% lower odds of suicidal risk (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73–0.97) and other outcomes, while moderate-intensity exercise on at least one to two days per week was associated with up to 31% reduction in odds across all mental health outcomes. Conversely, sleep under 7 h, daily sedentary time equal or over 7 h, and screen time exceeding 4 h were linked to higher risk of adverse outcomes. Generalized Additive Models revealed significant nonlinear dose-response relationships and identified a threshold lifestyle profile for all four mental health outcomes. This profile includes more than 40 minutes of napping per day, a sleep duration ranging from a minimum optimal value of 7.5 hours to a maximum of 10.5 hours per day, at least two days per week of moderate exercise, and no more than 4.4 hours of screen time per day.

Conclusions

These results provide evidence for school-based programs aimed at fostering healthier daily routines, ultimately promoting the mental health and resilience of children and adolescents.

Mental health in children — sleep duration and behavioral/emotional outcomes: Studies included approximately 100 to 30,000 participants, with limited data for children in the 4 months to less than 12 months age range. A longitudinal study of approximately 3,000 children beginning at age 0–1 year with follow-up at age 6–7 years found that persistent short sleepers and poor sleepers within the 12 month to < 3 year old and 3 to < 6 year old age categories had greater difficulties with emotional, social and physical functioning at age 6–7 years compared to "typical sleepers" who slept approximately 14.5 hours at age 0–1 year and 10.75 hours at age 6–7 years. Another study collected almost 33,000 parental surveys regarding child sleep duration and the emotional and behavioral regulation of these children at 18 months and 5 years of age.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^113tVzM7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine developed consensus recommendations for the amount of sleep needed to promote optimal health in children and adolescents using a modified RAND Appropriateness Method. After review of 864 published articles, the following sleep durations are recommended: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems. Insufficient sleep also increases the risk of accidents, injuries, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and depression. Insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with increased risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111QPFWk]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Method

Eligibility criteria

To be included in the present review, studies needed to 1) be a randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention designed to improve sleep; 2) produce a statistically significant effect on sleep quality when compared to a control group or an alternative treatment, 3) report a measure of mental health subsequent to the measure of sleep quality, 4) report sufficient data to compute an effect size representing the impact of the intervention on both sleep quality and mental health, 5) be written in English, or translatable using available resources. In order to reliably and validly assess the independent contribution of changes in sleep on mental health outcomes among adult populations, studies were excluded if 1) the intervention contained elements that specifically target a mental health problem in addition to elements that target sleep; or 2) recruited children and young people (i.e. < 18 years of age).

Search strategy

First, we searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), Embase (1974 to present), PsycINFO (1967 to present), and The Cochrane Library (1898 to present) using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy (i.e. HSSS,) to identify RCTs that included terms relating to sleep quality and/or sleep disorders, and mental health (see Table 1 for a list of the search terms and Supplementary Material 1 for an example search strategy). Second, the reference lists of extant reviews of the relationship between sleep and mental health were searched for any potential articles. Third, a search for any unpublished or ongoing studies was conducted by searching online databases including White Rose Online, The National Research Register, WHO approved clinical trial databases (e.g. ISRCTN), and PROSPERO. Searches were originally conducted in May 2019 and then updated in February 2021.

Search terms used to identify RCT's that examined the effect of improving sleep on mental health.

Data management and study selection

We followed PRISMA guidelines when selecting studies. The first phase of screening removed duplicate records and records that were clearly ineligible based on the title and/or abstract. The second phase of screening cross-referenced full-text versions of articles against the inclusion criteria, with eligible records included in the present review, and ineligible records excluded along with reasons for exclusion. Records were screened by two members of the review team, and a sub-sample of 10% of each reviewer's records were second checked by the other reviewer, with almost perfect agreement between the reviewers (kappa = 1.00 and 0.99).

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^1174kmvR]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Whether treating sleep disturbances reduces depression in children and youths is still debated. A recent meta-analysis reported a pooled effect size in the small range based on 4 RCTs of youths with subthreshold mental health problems. Similar RCTs of children and in clinical populations are lacking, to our knowledge.

The primary aim of this study was to provide an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies that examined the association of disturbed sleep with the development of later depression among 5- to 24-year-old individuals. For a wider scope compared with previous reviews, we opted for broad definitions of disturbed sleep and depression. Based on prior systematic reviews, we expected to find that the pooled effect sizes were significant and in the small range.

### Sleep problems and health outcomes among urban American Indian and Alaska native adolescents [^114Hr23p]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This study also adds to existing literature on how sleep is associated with important health outcomes among American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents. Sleep duration has been the most consistently studied sleep measure and has shown the most robust associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Consistent with previous work among general adolescent samples and American Indian and Alaska Native adults, short sleep duration was associated with increases in depression, anxiety, likelihood of alcohol or cannabis use, DBP, and HbA₁c. Findings support policy initiatives to delay school start times, which have been identified as a factor associated with insufficient sleep among adolescents.

Our findings also add to the limited but emerging literature on indices of circadian misalignment, in this case measured as social jet lag and cardiometabolic outcomes. In the current sample, mean social jet lag was 1 hour and 24 minutes, indicating a significant discrepancy in weekday and weekend sleep-wake patterns. Such discrepancies are partly caused by the conflict between adolescents' biologically based circadian phase delay and early school start times. We found that greater social jet lag was associated with greater increases in DBP. Although mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood, adolescents with greater preferences toward eveningness (and therefore greater likelihood of experiencing social jet lag) tend to have shorter, more irregular, and disturbed sleep. They are also at greater risk for behaviors that can influence blood pressure, including poor diet, physical activity, substance use, and nighttime electronic media use. Unexpectedly, greater self-reported sleep disturbances were associated with lower BMI and waist circumference. This finding contrasts with prior longitudinal work demonstrating that sleep problems are associated with higher BMI, although most of this work has focused on short sleep duration.

Combined, our findings highlight the importance of focusing on multiple sleep parameters for which different interventions may be warranted and emphasize the value of considering multiple health domains potentially associated with sleep. Given that American Indian and Alaska Native youths are disproportionately burdened by mental and behavioral health problems, including depression, suicide, and substance use, as well as increased risk for cardiometabolic disease, these findings support treatment approaches that target sleep as a transdiagnostic process (ie, common pathway) linked with multiple, intersecting domains of health.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^114TLexZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Disturbed sleep represents a potentially modifiable risk factor for depression in children and youths that can be targeted in prevention programs.

Objective

To evaluate the association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths using meta-analytic methods.

Data Sources

Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched for articles published from 1980 to August 2019.

Study Selection

Prospective cohort studies reporting estimates, adjusted for baseline depression, of the association between disturbed sleep and depression in 5- to 24-year-old participants from community and clinical-based samples with any comorbid diagnosis. Case series and reports, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and treatment, theoretical, and position studies were excluded. A total of 8700 studies met the selection criteria. This study adhered to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) statements.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Study screening and data extraction were conducted by 2 authors at all stages. To pool effect estimates, a fixed-effect model was used if I² < 50%; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. The I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. The risk of bias was assessed using the Research Triangle Institute Item Bank tool. Metaregression analyses were used to explore the heterogeneity associated with type of ascertainment, type of and assessment tool for disturbed sleep and depression, follow-up duration, disturbed sleep at follow-up, and age at baseline.

Main Outcome and Measures

Disturbed sleep included sleep disturbances or insomnia. Depression included depressive disorders or dimensional constructs of depression. Covariates included age, sex, and sociodemographic variables.

Results

A total of 22 studies (including 28 895 patients) were included in the study, of which 16 (including 27 073 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled β coefficient of the association between disturbed sleep and depression was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06–0.15; P < .001; n = 14 067; I² = 50.8%), and the pooled odds ratio of depression in those with vs without disturbed sleep was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.13–2.00; p = 0.005; n = 13 006; I² = 87.7%). Metaregression and sensitivity analyses showed no evidence that pooled estimates differed across any covariate. Substantial publication bias was found.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis found a small but statistically significant effect size indicating an association between sleep disruption and depressive symptoms in children and youths. The high prevalence of disturbed sleep implies a large cohort of vulnerable children and youths who could develop depression. Disrupted sleep should be included in multifaceted prevention programs starting in childhood.

### Association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^111sM1BU]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The present study provides summarized quantitative evidence of the prospective association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths after controlling for baseline depression. In line with our expectation, we found that the residual association after controlling for baseline depression was significant and of small magnitude. In fact, it is known that depression results from the joint action of a wide range of risk factors of small effect, and disturbed sleep is increasingly supported as one of these risk factors. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between disturbed sleep and depression, including an activation of inflammatory pathways, altered neuroplasticity and learning, and a disruption of circadian rhythm. Prevention of depression should target multicomponent risk profiles, possibly including sleep, and synthesis data are needed for the selection of the modifiable risk factors to target and the prioritization and timing of the prevention plan.

Compared with previous meta-analyses on the association between disturbed sleep and depression in children and youths, our study is substantiated by a larger number of studies and broader inclusion criteria, which makes the results from this systematic review updated, more robust, and comprehensive. Furthermore, given that we included only studies controlling for baseline depression, pooled estimates depict the association between baseline disturbed sleep and residual depression at follow-up.

The pooled β coefficient of the association between disturbed sleep and depression was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06–0.15) and was based on 9 studies representing 14 067 participants between 5 and 19 years of age. Metaregressions showed no evidence that the pooled estimate differed across any covariate, supporting the applicability of the pooled estimate to a broad spectrum of settings.

### Joint consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and sleep research society on the recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult: methodology and discussion [^112RFT9H]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Long sleep duration and mortality — evidence gaps and panel perspective are outlined as follows: There is a dearth of studies assessing the physiological impact of sleep extension, and evidence on long sleep and poor health was mixed except for mortality, where a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and death was consistently observed. Lacking convincing experimental evidence, the panel judged that the association between long sleep and increased mortality risk most likely represented confounding from uncontrolled chronic illness, noted that the only study in healthy individuals failed to show an association, and strongly encourages future experimental studies to examine the effects of sleep extension on health outcomes.

### Associations between exercise patterns and health outcomes in sedentary and non-sedentary individuals: a longitudinal population-based study in Geneva, Switzerland [^1151xNKh]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

This study also has limitations, including potential reverse causality. This was mitigated by the fact that results considered a longitudinal approach, with baseline exercise patterns and their impact on general health, mental health and sleep over the following 3 years, after adjusting for several covariates including pre-existing comorbidities or mental health conditions. A subgroup analysis considering only individuals without pre-existing mental or physical health conditions showed similar results. Additionally, limitations include a potential selection bias. Participation in the Specchio study is voluntary, and participants were more highly educated compared with the general population. Generalisability might be limited in this case, and further studies in more diverse settings are warranted. Third, the exclusion of individuals who engaged in frequent vigorous exercise may have reduced variability in this subgroup and affected generalisability of findings regarding high-intensity activity. Fourth, physical activity was self-reported and not measured using objective tools or validated scales. Measurements also lacked the duration of the activity, limiting alignment with the WHO recommendations. Future studies can focus on objective measures and comparing different subtypes and durations of physical activity. Finally, while our focus was on long-term associations, studies using cross-sectional designs could further elucidate short-term dynamics between changes in physical activity patterns and health outcomes.

In conclusion, with increasing sedentary behaviour in society, and its negative associations with health outcomes, physical activity remains a strong and important factor in mitigating unhealthy lifestyles. Intermittent vigorous exercise, combining aerobic exercise with limited time in a busy schedule, seems to be associated with favourable health outcomes including mental health. With potentially worsening mental health outcomes, especially in the young, and an increasing risk of sedentary behaviour, intermittent vigorous exercise seems like a good option that primary care physicians can recommend to their patients.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^1131Pkmq]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Light is the primary entraining agent synchronizing human circadian rhythms to the solar day. In humans, the central pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) orchestrates the circadian timing of bodily processes, including sleep-wake patterns, hormone expression (melatonin, cortisol), and body temperature over the 24-h light-dark cycle. Melatonin rises in the evening (typically associated with sleep onset), and peaks in the early morning hours before falling to low levels during the daytime. In tandem, cortisol rises in the early morning (typically associated with wakefulness) and declines across the day until reaching an evening nadir. Among other cues, these hormonal signals synchronize the timing of molecular clocks found in the body and collectively this network of oscillators drives robust daily rhythms throughout our body.

### Nightly sleep duration and symptom burden over 1 month following pediatric concussion [^117DQ9XC]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 30% to 35% of children will have persisting symptoms after a concussion (PSAC) beyond 1 month postinjury, including somatic, emotional, sleep, and/or cognitive abnormalities. PSAC may impair daily activities, quality of life, and mental health, highlighting the pressing need for further research to better understand these symptoms, their correlates, antecedents, and determinants.

Healthy sleep in youth is associated with reduced stress and improved psychological outcomes, emotional regulation, academic performance, and health behaviors. Disruptions to healthy sleep patterns are associated with poor mental health, mood problems, and behavioral and functional impairments. Interestingly, healthy adolescents with reduced sleep durations experience concussion symptoms without having suffered any brain injuries.

Pre- and postconcussion sleep disturbances are thought to be associated with higher concussion symptoms and prolonged recovery. Approximately 51% of children experience sleep disturbances in the first week of acute pediatric concussion, with the most common being drowsiness and increased sleep. In previous pediatric concussion studies, poor sleep quality and short sleep duration have been associated with anxiety and depression, higher symptom burden, prolonged recovery time, and delayed return to school. Others have found no or mixed associations between sleep duration and symptom burden, PSAC or recovery. However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes, the inclusion of sports-related concussion only, or the use of self-reported sleep duration.,

The lack of rigorous prospective studies on the associations between sleep duration and symptom burden that include objective measures has made it challenging to evaluate and establish their relationship following pediatric concussion. Wearable technology, such as accelerometers or actigraphy, can be used to monitor youths' movements and estimate sleep measures; however, limited studies, have used this technology to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and pediatric concussion recovery. This study had 2 goals: (1) To investigate the association between sleep duration and subsequent symptom burden at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postinjury; and (2) to examine the association between sleep duration and reliable change in symptoms at 2 and 4 weeks. We hypothesized that longer sleep duration during the first 2 weeks after concussion would be associated with reduced symptom burden at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postconcussion and lower odds of being reliably symptomatic at 2 and 4 weeks.

### Modifiable parental factors and adolescent sleep during early adolescence [^114TMxfD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study, modifiable parental factors in early adolescence were associated with specific adolescent sleep outcomes 4 years later. Family conflict and parental psychopathology were associated with poorer sleep quality, delayed sleep timing, and evening-type chronotype, while parental monitoring emerged as a protective factor for sleep quality. Screen use and emotional regulation partially mediated the associations between parental factors and sleep outcomes, highlighting their potential mechanistic roles in adolescent sleep patterns. The observed associations between parental warmth and chronotype in girls suggested the value of sex-specific interventions. Recognition of the pathways through which parental factors influence adolescent sleep may inform the development of targeted, evidence-based strategies to promote healthy sleep in adolescents.

### Association of child and adolescent mental health with adolescent health behaviors in the UK millennium cohort [^114cAZgS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adolescence and young adulthood, the age periods from 10 to 24 years, are significant transitional life periods with known unique risks for the development of mental health problems. A 2019 studyestimated that 9% of British adolescent boys experienced depressive symptoms. This proportion was 24% among British adolescent girls. The factors associated with risk of or protection from mental health disorders are understood to be influenced by individual, social, and environmental factors.

Although lifestyle behaviors have been recognized as novel targets for prevention of mental health conditions, there is also potential for mental health status to act as a determinant of an individual's ability to engage in healthful lifestyle behaviors. As an example, depression is characterized by low motivation, low energy, and loss of pleasure in daily activities, and this has been found to be associated adverse outcomes in daily behaviors, such as dietary choices, physical activity, and sleep. This potentially reciprocal association holds important public health implications, particularly regarding the highly elevated rates of cardiometabolic comorbidities associated with poor mental health.

Importantly, evidence also points to lifestyle behaviors, such as sleep and diet, for the promotion of positive mental health. Lifestyle behaviors are appealing targets, given that they are largely modifiable, unlike many other risk factors for mental disorders. There is also great potential for population reach and accessibility, and these factors may carry additional physical health benefits, such as noncommunicable disease prevention. Social media use has emerged as a highly prevalent behavior among young people and has been associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, although its association with mental health has been debated. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in sleep as a health behavior, which is crucial for healthy development in adolescents.

While lifestyle behaviors have been assessed as factors associated with mental health, there is an imperative to understand the association of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence with engagement in health behaviors during adolescence. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the associations of parent-reported mental health during childhood and self-reported mental health problems during adolescence with subsequent diet, sleep, and social media use behaviors at age 14 years among a large, nationally representative cohort of young people in the UK. We hypothesized that owing to the symptoms and experiences that characterize depression and mental health problems generally, worse mental health problems at ages 7 and 14 years would be associated with adverse health behaviors at age 14 years.

### Food insecurity and housing insecurity associated with decreased sleep regularity in adolescents [^114mMjXM]. Academic Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

While disparities in adolescent sleep health are well-recognized, few studies focus on sleep regularity, a sleep parameter associated with negative physical and mental health consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the association between socio-contextual factors and sleep regularity in healthy adolescents recruited from primary care.

Methods

Data were derived from the baseline assessment for a pilot clinical trial that investigated a digital sleep intervention for teens aged 12–14. Socio-contextual factors included: cut-off utilities, food insecurity, housing insecurity, neighborhood social cohesion, amenities, and perceived safety. The primary outcome of interest was actigraphy-measured sleep regularity quantified by the sleep regularity index (SRI; range 0–100; score = 100 indicates max regularity). Multivariable linear regression, adjusted for sex and age, was performed to examine the relationships between socio-contextual measures and sleep regularity.

Results

Sample included 54 youth (mean age 12.94, 44.44% sex assigned female at birth). In the multivariable models, food and housing insecurity were significantly associated with decreased sleep regularity including worry that food would run out (β = -9.23, 95% CI: -13.62 to -4.84, P < 0.001), food running out (β = -10.56, 95% CI: -15.12 to -5.99, P < 0.001), and housing insecurity (β = -17.04, 95% CI: -31.26 to -2.82, P < 0.05). No other significant associations were found.

Discussion

Among healthy adolescents recruited from primary care, those living in food or housing insecure households experienced decreased sleep regularity. Further understanding the interplay between socio-contextual factors and sleep is necessary to inform interventions and anticipatory guidance via clinical guidelines for health care providers.

### Patterns of social determinants of health and child mental health, cognition, and physical health [^111d2hqz]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Social determinants of health (SDOH) influence child health. However, most previous studies have used individual, small-set, or cherry-picked SDOH variables without examining unbiased computed SDOH patterns from high-dimensional SDOH factors to investigate associations with child mental health, cognition, and physical health.

Objective

To identify SDOH patterns and estimate their associations with children's mental, cognitive, and physical developmental outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included children aged 9 to 10 years at baseline and their caregivers enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study between 2016 and 2021. The ABCD Study includes 21 sites across 17 states.

Exposures

Eighty-four neighborhood-level, geocoded variables spanning 7 domains of SDOH, including bias, education, physical and health infrastructure, natural environment, socioeconomic status, social context, and crime and drugs, were studied. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was used to identify SDOH patterns.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Associations of SDOH and child mental health (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) and suicidal behaviors, cognitive function (performance, reading skills), and physical health (body mass index, exercise, sleep disorder) were estimated using mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models.

Results

Among 10 504 children (baseline median [SD] age, 9.9 [0.6] years; 5510 boys [52.5%] and 4994 girls [47.5%]; 229 Asian [2.2%], 1468 Black [14.0%], 2128 Hispanic [20.3%], 5565 White [53.0%], and 1108 multiracial [10.5%]), 4 SDOH patterns were identified: pattern 1, affluence (4078 children [38.8%]); pattern 2, high-stigma environment (2661 children [25.3%]); pattern 3, high socioeconomic deprivation (2653 children [25.3%]); and pattern 4, high crime and drug sales, low education, and high population density (1112 children [10.6%]). The SDOH patterns were distinctly associated with child health outcomes. Children exposed to socioeconomic deprivation (SDOH pattern 3) showed the worst health profiles, manifesting more internalizing (β = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.14–1.37) and externalizing (β = 1.43; 95% CI, 0.83–2.02) mental health problems, lower cognitive performance, and adverse physical health.

Conclusions

This study shows that an unbiased quantitative analysis of multidimensional SDOH can permit the determination of how SDOH patterns are associated with child developmental outcomes. Children exposed to socioeconomic deprivation showed the worst outcomes relative to other SDOH categories. These findings suggest the need to determine whether improvement in socioeconomic conditions can enhance child developmental outcomes.

### Bidirectional associations between accelerometer-based sleep metrics and mental health symptoms from childhood to late adolescence: data from a Brazilian birth cohort [^111te2Ft]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering the internalizing scores, our results suggest a complex relationship between sleep and mental health. While longer sleep duration was protective for higher scores of internalizing symptoms, higher internalizing scores predicted shorter sleep duration. Those results partially align with the literature. For example, Zhao et al. confirmed bidirectional relationships between self-reported sleep duration and emotional symptoms, indicating that shorter sleep duration predicts more severe internalizing symptoms and vice versa, particularly during late childhood. On the other hand, we also observed that higher internalizing symptom scores at age 15 predict a longer sleep duration at 18 years, a finding that was not reported by Zhao et al. The complex bidirectional relationship observed between sleep duration and internalizing symptoms is partially consistent with studies proposing a longitudinal U-shaped pattern, where both short and long sleep durations are associated with heightened symptoms. While our data did not support the presence of a U-shaped pattern, these findings collectively underscore the critical importance of addressing sleep hygiene. Both short and prolonged sleep durations are implicated in mental health difficulties, serving as significant comorbid factors related to emotional well-being. Finally, our findings did not reveal significant results for sleep efficiency, in contrast to Mulraney et al. and Quach et al. who observed reciprocal effects between sleep quality and emotional or behavioral problems over time.

### The need to promote sleep health in public health agendas across the globe [^111PRyMZ]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Consequences of sleep deficiency are a threat to health

Healthy sleep allows us to enjoy good physical and mental health, and experience a general sense of wellbeing. The European Academy of Neurologyand WHO have recognised sleep as a determinant of brain health, and the American Heart Association recently added sleep duration as one of Life's Essential Eight factors for optimal cardiovascular health.

Sleep deficiency, defined as insufficient sleep (eg, duration of sleep < 6 h per night), sleep disturbances (eg, irregular sleep and nightmares), or sleep disorders (eg, insomnia, sleep apnoea, and restless legs syndrome), adversely affects health across the entire lifespan. First, children are particularly vulnerable to sleep deficiencythat leads to behavioural problemsearly in life, and has been associated with sleep deficiency into adulthood. The appendix (p 29) provides sleep disturbance data among adolescents from the global school-based student health survey in 93 countries which shows an estimated average prevalence of 9.6%, ranging from 3.0% in Myanmar to 28.2% in Samoa (for data by country, see appendix pp 30–31). Second, insufficient sleep is associated with several adverse clinical consequences. Data from the CDC (appendix p 32) show that the prevalence of less than 7 h sleep per 24 h period overlaps with poor general health, poor mental health, poor brain health (ie, increased stroke), obesity, and high blood pressure. Lastly, sleep deficiency has been associated with allcause mortality – with potential mechanisms related to telomere lengthand systemic inflammation. As experimental and within-person longitudinal observational studies continue to be conducted to determine causal relationships, it is crucial that we collect sleep data concurrently with nutrition, physical inactivity, smoking, and binge drinking data, and that we do so in all countries. Such an approach would be a crucial step towards achieving global health equity. We report references in this section by study type and level of evidence (appendix pp 33–35).

### Association of child and adolescent mental health with adolescent health behaviors in the UK millennium cohort [^111y6wJp]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are mental health problems during childhood and adolescence associated with health behaviors during adolescence?

Findings

In this cohort study including 9369 participants, adolescents with self-reported mental health problems at both ages 7 years and 14 years and at age 14 years only were less likely to have at least 9 hours of sleep and to consume fruit and vegetables and reported greater use of social media compared with individuals who had no parent-reported mental health problems at age 7 years or self-reported problems at age 14 years.

Meaning

These findings suggest that mental health during childhood and adolescence was associated with health behavioral outcomes, and this should be considered in future efforts to improve health behaviors and in noncommunicable disease prevention efforts.

### Sex differences in the association between sleep and body mass index in adolescents [^1154zqhU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether an association between short sleep duration and increased body mass index (BMI) exists in a sample of U.S. adolescents.

Study Design

Public-use dataset of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Final sample included 4486 adolescents (51% female). Main outcome was BMI transformed into z-scores for age and sex using reference values from the Centers for Disease Control/National Center for Health Statistics. Overweight was defined as ≥ 95th percentile. Linear and logistic regression models were calculated. Sleep duration was self-reported in hours. A quadratic term for sleep was added to test curvilinear association. Covariates included age, race, parental education, activity and inactivity scores.

Results

Among males, linear regression indicated that sleep duration significantly predicted BMI z-score (Beta = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.12, -0.03). Logistic regression indicated that sleep duration predicted risk of overweight among males (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.00). Sleep duration was not a significant predictor among females in either regression model. Quadratic term for sleep was not significant for either sex.

Conclusions

Longer sleep duration was weakly associated with lower BMI and risk of overweight among male adolescents only. This sex-related difference may be due to differences in the physiology of puberty or in sleep characteristics.

### Sleep problems and health outcomes among urban American Indian and Alaska native adolescents [^112AwzVA]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Adolescent sleep problems are prevalent, particularly among racial and ethnic minority groups, and can increase morbidity. Despite the numerous strengths of their racial and ethnic group, urban American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents face significant health disparities but are rarely included in health research. Understanding how sleep problems are associated with health outcomes among American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents may elucidate novel targets for interventions to promote health equity.

Objective

To assess whether baseline sleep problems are associated with changes in behavioral and cardiometabolic health outcomes among urban American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents 2 years later.

Design, Setting, and Participants

American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents were recruited via flyers and community events for an observational cohort study in California. Baseline assessments were conducted among 142 adolescents from March 1, 2018, to March 31, 2020, and follow-ups were conducted among 114 adolescents from December 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022.

Exposures

Baseline actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and efficiency and self-reported sleep disturbances and social jet lag (absolute value of the difference in sleep midpoint on weekends vs weekdays; indicator of circadian misalignment).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcome measures included self-reported depression (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale), past year alcohol and cannabis use, body mass index, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist circumference, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Analyses examined whether baseline sleep was associated with health outcomes at follow-up, controlling for age, sex, and baseline outcome measures.

Results

The baseline sample included 142 urban American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents (mean [SD] age, 14.0 [1.4] years; 84 girls [59%]), 80% of whom (n = 114; mean [SD] age, 14.1 [1.3] years; 71 girls [62%]) completed follow-ups. Linear or logistic regressions showed significant negative associations between shorter sleep duration and depression (β = -1.21 [95% CI, -2.19 to -0.24]), anxiety (β = -0.89 [95% CI, -1.76 to -0.03]), DBP (β = -2.03 [95% CI, -3.79 to -0.28]), and HbA1c level (β = -0.15 [95% CI, -0.26 to -0.04]) and likelihood of alcohol (odds ratio [OR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.36–0.91]) and cannabis use (full week: OR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35–0.99]) at follow-up. Greater social jet lag was associated with significantly higher SBP (β = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01–0.11]) at follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found significant associations between poor sleep and adverse changes in health outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of developing culturally responsive interventions that target sleep as a key modifiable risk factor to improve the health of American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents.

### Sleep duration in schooldays is associated with health-related quality of life in Norwegian adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^112XopaB]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we aimed at describing sleep in Norwegian 13–15-year-old adolescents, explore possible associations between sleep duration in schooldays and weekends on HRQOL and to test self-efficacy as a possible mediator on the relationship between sleep duration in schooldays and HRQOL. Our descriptive findings revealed that sleep duration during weekends were overall higher than in schooldays for both genders. Sleep duration in schooldays was positively associated with higher HRQOL for the subscales psychological well-being, autonomy and parents, school environment and self-efficacy. Sleep duration in weekends was positively associated with higher levels of HRQOL for the subscale psychological well-being. In the association between sleep duration in school days and HRQOL subscales, mediation analyses revealed that sleep duration explained most of the associations in 4 out of 5 HRQOL subscales, except in the association with the HRQOL subscale physical well-being revealing an indirect effect of 71.9%.

### Physical activity, screen-based sedentary behavior, and sleep duration in adolescents: youth risk behavior survey, 2011–2013… [^114FWcvY]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

This study examined the concurrent associations of physical activity and screen-based sedentary behavior with sleep duration among adolescents by using data from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2011–2013. Using latent class analysis, we identified 4 latent subgroups of adolescents with various levels of physical activity and screen-based sedentary behavior. The subgroup with high levels of physical activity and low levels of sedentary behavior generally showed greater odds of having sufficient sleep than the other subgroups. Findings imply that concurrent achievement of a high level of physical activity and low level of screen-based sedentary behavior is necessary to promote sufficient sleep among adolescents. Objective Sleep is a key element in promoting healthy growth and development during adolescence.

Evidence is mounting that adolescents with insufficient sleep are more likely to have degraded cognitive functioning and increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue than adolescents with sufficient sleep. Discussion Our results generally support the evidence for concurrent associations between PA and screen-based SB and sufficient sleep in adolescents. In our study, however, the subgroup who concurrently had high levels of PA and low levels of screen-based SB had greater odds of having sufficient sleep when compared with subgroups who had high levels of screen-based SB regardless of their concurrent levels of PA; however, we found no statistical difference in the odds of having sufficient sleep when comparing the subgroup who concurrently had high levels of PA and low levels of screen-based SB with the subgroup who had both low levels of PA and low levels of screen-based SB.

Furthermore, when comparing the subgroups with either low levels of PA or high levels of screen-based SB or both, we found no statistical differences in the odds of having sufficient sleep between them. Although the latter results are difficult to interpret, they may indicate that PA and screen-based SB interactively influence sleep duration among adolescents and that improvements in sleep duration can be expected particularly when high levels of PA and low levels of screen-based SB are concurrently achieved. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the study design, a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data; the use of subjective measures of PA and screen-based SB; and the unexplained measurement errors in classification of the subgroups in the LCA models. Our study furthers the understanding of the roles of PA and screen-based SB in sleep duration among adolescents by focusing on concurrent associations.

The findings emphasize that, in developing future intervention strategies, both behavioral components should be considered concurrently to promote sufficient sleep among adolescents.

### Effect of sleep restriction on adolescent cognition by adiposity… [^115o6RfJ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question How does adolescent sleep duration impact the association between adiposity and performance-based cognitive function. Findings The results of this randomized crossover trial including 61 participants revealed that adolescents with higher adiposity had lower scores on performance-based measures of global cognition, fluid cognition, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed following 1 night of sleep restriction, while adolescents with lower adiposity showed no decline in performance following 1 night of sleep restriction. Meaning Adolescents with higher levels of adiposity may be more vulnerable to the cognitive effects of sleep restriction compared to adolescents with lower levels of adiposity. Importance Pediatric obesity is associated with impaired cognitive function; however, the mechanisms underlying this association demand assessment. Sleep may be a relevant moderator, as poor sleep predicts both increased adiposity and impaired cognitive function.

This single-blind randomized crossover trial was conducted from September 2020 to October 2022. Parents or caregivers provided demographic information for adolescent participants. Body mass index percentile and bioelectrical impedance analysis assessed adiposity. Adolescents completed 2 actigraphy-confirmed sleep conditions, adequate and restricted, followed by in-person cognitive assessment. The final sample included 61 adolescents. No differences emerged for adolescents with healthy weight. Adolescents with overweight or obesity also had poorer attention scores compared to adolescents with healthy weight following restricted sleep. No differences emerged following adequate sleep.

Findings were similar for total body fat percentage; however, for adolescents with TBF% above 42, restricted sleep also predicted poorer processing speed, and the association between sleep and attention did not vary based on TBF%. Conclusions and Relevance Adolescents with overweight or obesity may be more vulnerable to negative cognitive effects following sleep restriction. Improved sleep hygiene and duration in this group may positively impact their cognitive health. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04346433 Stager LM, Watson CS, Cook EW, Fobian AD. Effect of Sleep Restriction on Adolescent Cognition by Adiposity: A Randomized Crossover Trial. JAMA Neurol. 2024; 81: 712–721. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2024.1332

### Associations between screen time use and health outcomes… [^111nUgXA]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

High screen time can displace important health behaviors, such as physical activity and adequate sleep. Teens with limited physical activity and sleep are at risk for several negative mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and poorer quality of life. The content viewed on screens may also have a direct impact on a teen's mental health. Previous research has found a connection between screen usage and poorer mental health, including perceptions of social connectedness. Sleep Infrequently well-rested. Teens were asked, "In a typical week during the school year, how often do you wake up well-rested. " Response options were "never, " "some days, " "most days, " and "every day. " Teens who selected "never" and "some days" were considered to be infrequently well-rested. Irregular sleep routine.

Teens were also asked whether they had a regular bedtime and waketime. Teens were given the same response options of "never, " "some days, " "most days, " and "every day" for each question, and teens who did not answer "most days" and "every day" for both questions were considered to have an irregular sleep routine. Weight concern Teens were asked "Are you concerned about your weight. " with the response options of "yes, it's too high, " "yes, it's too low, " and "no. " Teens who said their weight was too high or too low were considered to have weight concerns. High screen time has also been associated with later bedtimes, insufficient sleep duration, reduced sleep efficiency, insomnia symptoms, and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Use of screens not only delays the time teens go to bed and fall asleep, but can also affect their circadian timing, sleep physiology, and alertness due to the light emitted from the screens themselves. They may also attempt to better understand the relationship between sleep, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors over a typical teen's day. Conclusions Findings from this study highlight associations between increased screen time and a variety of poorer health outcomes spanning across multiple domains, including mental health and perceived support.
