## Question

Azithromycin use in Covid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether azithromycin should be used to treat COVID-19, in whom, at what doses, and how guidelines position this intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context by setting and severity. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for azithromycin. Next, I will examine randomized trial data in inpatients and outpatients, followed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations and weigh antimicrobial stewardship. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded bottom line and address edge cases and safety monitoring, anchoring to RECOVERY, PRINCIPLE, ATOMIC2, the JAMA outpatient RCT, Cochrane, and IDSA/ACP guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts and why azithromycin was considered: COVID-19 spans asymptomatic/mild outpatients, moderate/severe inpatients, and critically ill ICU patients, and early in the pandemic, azithromycin was repurposed based on in vitro antiviral and hypothesized immunomodulatory effects rather than antibacterial indications, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating antibiotic therapy for bacterial coinfection with antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatment of SARS-CoV-2 itself [^1173WYU4] [^117LnzM8].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility before moving to outcomes. Azithromycin shows in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 via endosomal pH elevation and potential spike–ACE2 interference, and it has anti-inflammatory effects on neutrophils and cytokines, but translating this into in vivo benefit requires pharmacokinetic target engagement and clinically meaningful effect sizes, which remained unproven as trials matured, so I should not over-interpret mechanistic signals without clinical confirmation [^117LnzM8] [^1138Gwo7] [^1148hHtv].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality inpatient data. The RECOVERY platform trial in 7,763 hospitalized patients found no reduction in 28-day mortality with azithromycin versus usual care, and no differences in progression to ventilation or discharge alive, so routine inpatient use for COVID-19 itself is not supported by this large, methodologically rigorous trial [^112t1krb] [^114gXBaQ].

> I will now examine additional inpatient randomized trials. COALITION II, in severe hospitalized COVID-19 where all patients also received hydroxychloroquine, found no improvement in clinical status at day 15 with the addition of azithromycin, and a separate Brazilian COALITION study in mild-to-moderate inpatients likewise showed no benefit for hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin on ordinal outcomes, reinforcing that azithromycin does not improve clinical trajectories in the hospital setting [^116RTcG7] [^114yj8q8].

> Let me consider the outpatient evidence carefully. PRINCIPLE, a large UK community platform trial in higher-risk outpatients, showed no meaningful reduction in time to recovery and only a trivial, non-significant difference in hospitalization or death with a 3-day azithromycin course, indicating no clinically important benefit in the community either [^1174CLUN] [^115ZZXQ7]. ATOMIC2, which tested a 14-day azithromycin course in ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate disease, also failed to reduce hospitalization or death over 28 days, again arguing against routine outpatient use for COVID-19 itself [^111LkuYa] [^1138yjxL]. A blinded JAMA outpatient RCT using a single 1.2 g dose likewise found no improvement in symptom resolution at day 14, and was stopped for futility, aligning with the broader negative signal in early disease [^113pt18u] [^114iJLJn].

> Hold on, I should verify how syntheses and guidelines integrate this. The Cochrane review across 11 RCTs and 11,281 participants concluded azithromycin has little or no effect on mortality, clinical worsening, or improvement in inpatients, and low-certainty evidence of no benefit in outpatients, while IDSA makes a strong recommendation against hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin in hospitalized patients due to demonstrated harm from QT prolongation and uncertain benefit, and explicitly notes no demonstrated benefit for azithromycin in RCTs across severities, with ACP advising against azithromycin for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^115pqQku] [^111HkVz8] [^112noAwt] [^116k4b2G].

> But wait, what about the combination with hydroxychloroquine; could that have changed the calculus. The NEJM COALITION trial and subsequent meta-analyses show no clinical benefit for hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, and pooled analyses signal increased mortality with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin in some datasets, reinforcing that the combination should be avoided outside trials due to harm and lack of efficacy [^114yj8q8] [^115CncxP] [^111HkVz8].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is front and center. COVID-19 bacterial coinfection rates are low at presentation, on the order of about 3–4%, so routine azithromycin use risks driving macrolide resistance without offsetting benefit, and stewardship frameworks emphasize avoiding antibiotics for viral COVID-19 absent a clear bacterial indication, with guideline surveys and society statements consistently discouraging empiric azithromycin solely for COVID-19 [^11278PZc] [^112hp9fX] [^113rYJne] [^115uEoeh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could there be edge cases or timing effects. Some mechanistic and retrospective hypotheses suggest potential benefit if given very early, but prospective randomized data have not validated a meaningful early-window effect for azithromycin in COVID-19, and PRINCIPLE's early-community population did not show benefit despite relatively early treatment windows, so routine early use cannot be recommended outside trials [^1173WYU4] [^1166FuN2] [^1174CLUN].

> I should double-check safety, especially with QT-prolonging combinations. While azithromycin monotherapy generally has a favorable safety profile, when combined with hydroxychloroquine, QT prolongation risk increases and ECG monitoring becomes important in inpatient settings. Pooled cardiovascular analyses from COALITION suggest no excess arrhythmias with the combination in that specific hospitalized cohort, but IDSA still issues a strong recommendation against the combination due to consistent QT signals and lack of benefit, and outpatient QT monitoring is often impractical, so risk remains nontrivial in real-world practice [^112J6U7i] [^111HkVz8] [^113oUfwH] [^112cBm2C].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. High-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show azithromycin does not reduce mortality, hospitalization, or meaningfully improve symptoms in inpatients or outpatients with COVID-19, guidelines from IDSA and ACP recommend against its routine use for COVID-19, and the balance of antimicrobial benefit versus resistance risk is unfavorable outside a clear bacterial indication, so azithromycin should not be used for COVID-19 treatment unless treating a confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial coinfection [^112t1krb] [^1174CLUN] [^111LkuYa] [^115pqQku] [^116k4b2G] [^116eijKF].

> Clinically, I need to ensure we apply this precisely. Do not use azithromycin for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 outpatients, and do not add it for hospitalized COVID-19 in the absence of a bacterial indication. If bacterial pneumonia is suspected or confirmed, treat per pneumonia pathways, and if a macrolide is otherwise indicated for atypical coverage or local resistance patterns, that remains appropriate, but that is a different question than using azithromycin for SARS-CoV-2 itself [^116k4b2G] [^112noAwt] [^116eijKF].

> For dosing context when azithromycin is actually indicated for bacterial infection, standard adult regimens include 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 2–5, or 500 mg daily for 3 days, with the caveat that these schedules pertain to antibacterial therapy and should not be interpreted as validated COVID-19 treatment regimens, reinforcing that the clinical question of "how much azithromycin for COVID-19" is moot outside trials [^115ge6d4] [^1174CLUN].

Azithromycin is **not recommended** for COVID-19 treatment outside clinical trials, as high-quality evidence shows no benefit in mortality, hospitalization, or symptom resolution [^112t1krb] [^1174CLUN] [^115pqQku]. Use is limited to **confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial coinfection**, with typical dosing of 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily on days 2–5. Azithromycin is generally well tolerated, but monitor for QT prolongation and drug interactions, especially with hydroxychloroquine [^113oUfwH] [^114yj8q8]. Routine use is discouraged due to lack of efficacy and risks of antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects [^115pqQku] [^117HGvti].

## Clinical evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19

### Inpatient settings

- **RECOVERY trial**: No reduction in 28-day mortality or clinical progression with azithromycin vs usual care in hospitalized patients [^112t1krb].
- **COALITION II trial**: No improvement in clinical status at day 15 with azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine vs hydroxychloroquine alone in severe COVID-19 [^116RTcG7].
- **Cochrane review**: High-certainty evidence of no mortality benefit and no improvement in clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients [^115pqQku].

---

### Outpatient settings

- **PRINCIPLE trial**: No meaningful reduction in time to recovery or hospitalization risk in community-treated suspected COVID-19 [^1174CLUN].
- **ATOMIC2 trial**: No reduction in hospitalization or death in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed ambulatory [^111LkuYa].
- **JAMA trial**: Single 1.2 g dose did not improve symptom resolution at day 14 in outpatients [^113pt18u].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding azithromycin** |
|-|-|
| IDSA | Strongly recommends against hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin in hospitalized patients; no recommendation for azithromycin alone outside trials [^1155bk2r] |
| ESCMID | Recommends against azithromycin for COVID-19 treatment |
| ACP | Recommends against azithromycin for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^116k4b2G] |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Azithromycin is generally well tolerated; **common adverse effects** include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and nausea [^notfound]. QT prolongation can occur, especially with other QT-prolonging drugs or underlying cardiac disease [^113oUfwH]. Increased antimicrobial resistance is a concern with widespread use [^112hp9fX].

---

## Drug interactions

Key interactions include **hydroxychloroquine**, which increases QT prolongation risk and should be avoided with azithromycin [^111HkVz8] [^112cBm2C], and **QT-prolonging agents** (e.g. amiodarone, haloperidol), which require caution and ECG monitoring when combined with azithromycin [^113oUfwH].

---

## Dosage and administration

When used for bacterial coinfection, typical dosing is **500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily on days 2–5**; alternative regimens include 500 mg daily for 3 days or 1.2 g as a single dose.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Azithromycin is **not recommended** for COVID-19 treatment outside clinical trials, as high-quality evidence shows no benefit in mortality, hospitalization, or symptom resolution [^115pqQku]. Use is limited to **confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial coinfection**, with typical dosing of 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily on days 2–5. Azithromycin is generally well tolerated, but monitor for QT prolongation and drug interactions, especially with hydroxychloroquine [^113oUfwH]. Routine use is discouraged due to lack of efficacy and risks of antimicrobial resistance and adverse effects [^114Vo58M].

Table 1
Medline published studies that assess the effect of AZ in COVID-19

Studies that assess azithromycin monotherapy versus standard of care in hospitalised patients report a wide effect range, from a decreased adjusted OR for mortality of 0.60 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.85) in the retrospective cohort of Albani et al to a non-significantly increased adjusted OR of 1.30 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.64) in Kuderer et al. Even more heterogeneity is seen in studies that assess the addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine, with a survival benefit (adjusted HR of 0.294; 95% CI 0.218 to 0.396) seen by Arshad et al, opposed to a significantly increased 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 2.93; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.79) reported again by Kuderer et al. In an outpatient setting, Guérin et al reported a significant reduction in the mean time to clinical recovery with azithromycin (12.9 days with azithromycin vs 25.8 days without; p < 0.0001). A significant difference in hospitalisation risk was, however, not withheld by Szente et al.(adjusted OR for azithromycin-containing vs no-azithromycin-containing regimens 0.93; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90). The increased mortality reported for hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination by Kuderer et al together with increased incidence of adverse events of this regimen in Rosenberg et al and the randomised controlled trial of Cavalcanti et al strengthen the concerns about QT-prolonging drug–drug interactions. Importantly, no studies reported a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes with azithromycin monotherapy. Cavalcanti et al did not assess efficacy of azithromycin monotherapy, but found no increased adverse events in this treatment group, whereas QTc prolongation and increased transaminases were seen in the hydroxychloroquine containing regimens. Similarly, Rosenberg et al reported an increased incidence of cardiac arrest with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin coadministration (adjusted OR, 2.13; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.05) and when comparing hydroxychloroquine monotherapy with azithromycin monotherapy (adjusted OR, 2.97; 95% CI 1.56 to 5.64) but not for azithromycin vs neither drug (adjusted OR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.56).

### Effect of oral azithromycin vs placebo on COVID-19 symptoms in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a randomized clinical trial [^113pt18u]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Azithromycin has been hypothesized to have activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Objective

To determine whether oral azithromycin in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial of azithromycin vs matching placebo conducted from May 2020 through March 2021. Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization.

Interventions

Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n = 171) or matching placebo (n = 92).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21.

Results

Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: 50%; prevalence difference, 0%; 95% CI, -14% to 15%; P > .99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4%; 95% CI, -1% to 9%; p = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater likelihood of being symptom free at day 14. These findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) — states that, based on the "moderate certainty of increased QT prolongation" and that this "demonstrated certain harm with uncertain benefit", the panel "made a strong recommendation against HCQ+AZ". Under conclusions and research needs, "The guideline panel recommends against the use of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZ in the hospital setting as higher certainty benefits (e.g., mortality reduction) are now highly unlikely even if additional high quality RCTs would become available". The document clarifies that "This recommendation does not address the use of azithromycin for secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 (Supplementary Table s2)".

Methods

Study design

The methodology follows recommendations from the methodological guide for systematic reviews of clinical practice guidelines by Johnston et al. The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (OSF):

Eligibility

Guidelines providing explicit recommendations regarding antibacterial use for prevention or management of infection related to COVID-19 from any jurisdiction, in any language, were eligible for inclusion.

Data source

We searched the eCOVID-19 living map of recommendations (RecMap) for eligible guidelines. COVID-19 RecMap aggregates globally published clinical, public health, and health policy guidelines to support contextualised decision making.

Search strategy

COVID-19 RecMap was searched using the terms 'antibiotic', 'antibacterial', 'antimicrobial', and 'anti-infective' as well as additional search for specific antibacterial agents (i.e. azithromycin, doxycycline) that may be have been prescribed for patients with COVID-19. Searches were performed from August 24 2022 to November 15 2022.

Guideline selection process

Screening was performed by two independent reviewers (BL and VL) to assess guidelines for eligibility. The full-text and any supplementary/accompanying material for each search result was screened by each reviewer.

Data collection process

One independent reviewer (BL) extracted data from eligible guidelines which was checked independently by a second reviewer (VL). A spreadsheet was used for data extraction which was piloted and refined based on initial extraction of eligible guidelines. Data extracted included guideline name, date, location, organisation, panel composition, patient population, and aspect of antibiotic prescribing addressed. Aspects of antibiotic prescribing included a) antibiotic initiation (e.g. empiric use of antibiotics, diagnostic recommendations, timeliness of initiation), b) antibiotic selection (e.g. empiric choice of agent based on local resistance rates or targeted based on culture and susceptibility results, use of institutional or local protocols to support, and c) duration of therapy (e.g. fixed duration of therapy or tailored to diagnostic and microbiological findings).

Outcome

We evaluated whether guidelines incorporated at least one element of antimicrobial stewardship, defined as either a) statement regarding careful/judicious antibiotic use, b) statement regarding risk of contributing to antimicrobial resistance, and/or c) statement on adverse effects associated with antibiotic use.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^116LLfRe]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Since December 2019, the pandemic spread of the new virus SARS-CoV2 has affected over 50 million people.COVID-19 — the disease caused by this virus — has killed over one million people in these past few months. Tremendous progress has already been made in the understanding of the disease. Still, only a few interventions have proven clinically beneficial and, besides thromboprophylaxis, these are mostly reserved for selected patients with an advanced disease stage. Their impact on the global disease burden, therefore, remains limited.

A high initial viral loadand occurrence of a disproportional inflammatory response thereafter, the so-called cytokine storm, relate to adverse outcomes and are potentially modifiable. Hence, they are the target of most currently considered therapeutic strategies. Interference with the viral cycle is pursued through (1) inhibition of viral cell entry with TMPRRS2 inhibiting molecules such as camostat or aprotinin, (2) inhibition of viral lysosome escape with molecules as hydroxychloroquine, (3) antiretroviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir that interfere with posttranslational processing through the main protease and (4) inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase with remdesivir or favipiravir. The excessive host's inflammatory response is mitigated by (1) broad-spectrum molecules as dexamethasoneor (2) targeted drugs as tocilizumab (anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6)), anakinra (anti-IL-1) or baricitinib (janus kinase inhibitor). Finally, anticoagulants are effectively used to counter the inflammation-induced hypercoagulative state. Overall, time pressure has sparked a special interest into the repurposing of marketed or late stage molecules for COVID-19, parallel to the development of new and more selective drugs.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^114q49JX]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

A repurposing drug candidate of special interest is azithromycin. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic with a broad gram-positive and gram-negative spectrum. Moreover, it has well-documented anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects, through modulation of both the innate and adaptive immune response. These are effective to treat chronic inflammatory disorders such as diffuse bronchiolitis, post-transplant bronchiolitis, non-eosinophilic asthma or rosacea. Azithromycin has also been associated with improved outcome in other viral pneumonias, such as influenzaor rhinovirus, and in patients with acute lung injury admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This has in some centres led to the early adoption of azithromycin in routine COVID-19 care, further fuelled by reports of in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a suggested benefit in non-controlled case series early on in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While more data of randomised controlled studies are eagerly awaited, we comprehensively review the rationale of its use against SARS-CoV-2, its window of opportunity and its possible limitations.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^113fakDf]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Overall, the limited and low-quality evidence does not endorse azithromycin's widespread use in the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, monotherapy is safe and therefore justifiable in a clinical trial setting. The data at least urges close monitoring when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs like hydroxychloroquine, or when other risk factors for long QT exist. A risk mitigation strategy such as applying strict ECG criteria to initiate (eg, only if QTc < 450) and halt (eg, if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases > 60 ms since start of treatment) azithromycin may be warranted.

### Azithromycin versus standard care in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (ATOMIC2): an open-label, randomised trial [^111LkuYa]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Background

The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties of azithromycin suggest therapeutic potential against COVID-19. Randomised data in mild-to-moderate disease are not available. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospital admission in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Methods

This prospective, open-label, randomised superiority trial was done at 19 hospitals in the UK. We enrolled adults aged at least 18 years presenting to hospitals with clinically diagnosed, highly probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with fewer than 14 days of symptoms, who were considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg once daily orally for 14 days) plus standard care or to standard care alone. The primary outcome was death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation. The primary and safety outcomes were assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381962) and recruitment is closed.

Findings

298 participants were enrolled from June 3, 2020, to Jan 29, 2021. Three participants withdrew consent and requested removal of all data, and three further participants withdrew consent after randomisation, thus, the primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants (145 in the azithromycin group and 147 in the standard care group). The mean age of the participants was 45.9 years (SD 14.9). 15 (10%) participants in the azithromycin group and 17 (12%) in the standard care group were admitted to hospital or died during the study (adjusted OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.43–1.92], p = 0.80). No serious adverse events were reported.

Interpretation

In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospital admission or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Antiviral effects

Azithromycin has direct and indirect antiviral activity in bronchial epithelial cellsand other host cells. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this has also been shown for influenza, rhinovirus, dengue, ebolavirus, parainfluenza virus, zika virus and enterovirus.

There are multiple mechanisms for azithromycin's antiviral effect. For host-cell entry, the prerequisite binding of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein to ACE2 has been repeatedly described. Virtualised mechanical modelling techniques demonstrated that azithromycin may interfere due to its affinity with the binding interaction point of the spike protein and ACE2. Also, azithromycin may competitively inhibit a viral cofactor binding site due to its striking molecular similarity with GM1, a host-cell ganglioside that binds the ganglioside binding domain of the spike protein. Further experimental work is needed to confirm these possible modes of action. After receptor binding, the virus enters host cells either through membrane fusion, or through receptor mediated endocytosis. In the second route, endosome acidification facilitates viral escape and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid. Azithromycin interferes at this level, as it is a weak base that accumulates intracellularly and inside endosomes.

During the remainder of the viral cycle, viruses are known to hijack intracellular antiapoptotic signalling pathways to promote their survival and replication. As an example, blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-pathway decreases MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a known mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) -inhibiting macrolide, but azithromycin has also shown to interfere with mTOR-signalling, although to a lesser extent. It remains unclear if and how this affects SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Furthermore, azithromycin also has indirect antiviral effects. It induces intracellular mRNA expression of antiviral genes, IFN-stimulated genes and IFN production in infected host cells. This may enhance the cellular antiviral response mediated by the IFN pathway and help to retain balance in the early innate immune response.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

Hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin — QT prolongation risk and monitoring are highlighted with quantitative signals and conditional actions: One randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggests increased risk of QT prolongation with HCQ+AZ vs no HCQ (RR: 8.50; 95% CI: 1.16, 62.31; Low CoE), and two studies reported significant QT prolongation in 10 of 95 HCQ+AZ recipients. A case-control study found higher QTc metrics with HCQ+AZ among COVID-19 cases vs healthy controls, including minimum (415 vs. 376 ms), mean (453 vs. 407 ms) and maximum QTc-interval (533 vs. 452 ms) with cases (n = 22) vs controls (n = 34). Additional reports note risk of prolonged QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia with AZ alone, and a large cohort observed increased sudden cardiac death risk during a five-day AZ course (HR 2.71 [1.58–4.64] vs 0.85 [0.45–1.60] compared to no antibiotic or amoxicillin, respectively). Given cumulative conduction effects with HCQ and AZ, if used together, baseline and follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring would be indicated along with careful surveillance for other QT‑prolonging medications. Although azithromycin has a low risk for cytochrome P450 interactions, gastrointestinal effects and QT prolongation should be carefully considered, particularly in the outpatient setting where frequent ECG monitoring is not feasible.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^1147nCSh]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

For the primary outcome analyses, assuming a median time to first recovery of 9 days in the usual care alone group, around 400 participants per group (800 participants in total if only a single intervention vs usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a difference of 2 days in median time to first recovery (approximate hazard ratio [HR] 1.3). Additionally, around 1500 participants per group (3000 participants in total if only a single intervention v s usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation or death, assuming a hospitalisation rate of 5% in the control group and 2.5% in the intervention group. These calculations are approximations that do not explicitly account for adaptations of the platform design. In the adaptive design report (appendix pp 68–80), we provide a more complete justification of sample size by simulating the operating characteristics of the adaptive design in multiple scenarios, which explicitly account for response adaptive randomisation, early stopping for futility or success, and multiple interventions.

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19… [^116zPAB9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are antibiotics effective in treating patients with COVID-19. Evidence-Based Answer Azithromycin is the most consistently studied antibiotic for use in treating patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus; it does not improve mortality after 28 days or affect the clinical course for hospitalized adults with COVID-19. 1 In outpatient adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, azithromycin does not reduce mortality, risk of hospitalization, or disease progression.

1. This Cochrane review involved 11 randomized controlled trials and 11, 281 patients.

1 Seven studies included inpatients, and four studies investigated outpatients. All of the included studies compared azithromycin with placebo, standard of care, or another antibiotic as a direct therapy against COVID-19. Among inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the authors found no significant difference with azithromycin use on all-cause mortality or improvement of clinical status at 28 days of follow-up. Regarding risks, no adverse events occurred during the study period, and there was no increased risk of serious adverse events. Among outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, the authors found no evidence that azithromycin improved all-cause mortality, decreased hospitalization rates at 28 days of follow-up, or resolved symptoms by 14 days of follow-up.

No outpatient studies reported any adverse events or cardiac arrhythmias within the follow-up time frame. Antibiotic overuse and resulting antimicrobial resistance predate the pandemic as a global health threat. 3 Specifically, macrolides have a high resistance potential and have been identified as key targets of stewardship and monitoring to reduce antibiotic resistance. 4 With little evidence to support the effectiveness of azithromycin against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, family physicians should not routinely prescribe it for patients with COVID-19. The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD015025.

### Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^114yj8q8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been used to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, evidence on the safety and efficacy of these therapies is limited.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-group, controlled trial involving hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 who were receiving either no supplemental oxygen or a maximum of 4 liters per minute of supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard care, standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily, or standard care plus hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg twice daily plus azithromycin at a dose of 500 mg once daily for 7 days. The primary outcome was clinical status at 15 days as assessed with the use of a seven-level ordinal scale (with levels ranging from one to seven and higher scores indicating a worse condition) in the modified intention-to-treat population (patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19). Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 667 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients had confirmed Covid-19 and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. As compared with standard care, the proportional odds of having a higher score on the seven-point ordinal scale at 15 days was not affected by either hydroxychloroquine alone (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69 to 2.11; P = 1.00) or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.73; P = 1.00). Prolongation of the corrected QT interval and elevation of liver-enzyme levels were more frequent in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, than in those who were not receiving either agent.

Conclusions

Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care. (Funded by the Coalition Covid-19 Brazil and EMS Pharma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04322123.).

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^1148hHtv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin (AZ) is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a large volume of distribution. It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established. 1 This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy data from phase II and phase II/III studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination. This paper may also serve to facilitate the consideration and use of a priori-defined control groups for future research.

### Pragmatic recommendations for therapeutics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries [^113kz5Y5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The COALITION II Trial was a randomized comparison of azithromycin in addition to standard care versus standard care alone among 447 hospitalized patients in Brazil with suspected COVID-19. Standard care included hydroxychloroquine in both arms, and patients required at least 4 L/minute of oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation. In the modified intention to treat population of 397 patients with confirmed COVID-19, there was no difference in the primary outcome of clinical status at day 15, as assessed by a blinded independent adjudication committee on a six-point ordinal scale. There was also no increase in the incidence of QT prolongation in azithromycin arm when compared with the control arm.

There are also multiple trials studying the role of hydroxychloroquine in the prophylaxis of COVID-19. – Two randomized controlled trials did not show any benefit to pre- or postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine. Thus, we do not recommend hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin for this purpose at this time.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

We recommend against the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, regardless of availability or cost for LMICs.

Recommendation for LMICs.

We recommend against using hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin in treating COVID-19 (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).

3. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should lopinavir–ritonavir be given?

Rationale.

Numerous antimicrobial drugs are being evaluated for management of COVID-19 patients, including lopinavir–ritonavir.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 Guidelines: We recommend that antivirals including lopinavir/ritonavir not be administered as treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials.

NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against using lopinavir/ritonavir (AI) or other HIV protease inhibitors (AIII) for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial.

Surviving Sepsis COVID Guidelines: In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir (weak suggestion).

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^114Tpvr5]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

This literature review focuses on pharmacological agents that have promising features for the treatment of COVID-19. These agents are organised according to their mechanism of action and hypothesised activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its sequelae. The first chapter is dedicated to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathogenic actions to illuminate possible important drug targets. Thereafter, drugs with hypothetical antiviral properties, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and remdesivir, drugs with immunomodulatory properties, tocilizumab and corticosteroids, as well as anticoagulants are analysed for the potential use of clinical treatment of COVID-19.

### Effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Hyf9H]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine or its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combined with or without azithromycin (AZ) have been widely investigated in observational studies as a treatment option for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The network meta-analysis aims to summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine if AZ or HCQ is associated with improved clinical outcomes. PubMed and Embase were searched from inception to March 7, 2021. We included published RCTs that investigated the efficacy of AZ, HCQ, or its combination among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and the use of mechanical ventilation. The pooled odds ratio was calculated using a random-effect model. A total of 10 RCTs were analyzed. Participant's mean age ranged from 40.4 to 66.5 years. There was no significant effect on mortality associated with AZ plus HCQ (odds ratio [OR] = 0.562 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.168–1.887]), AZ alone (OR = 0.965 [95% CI: 0.865–1.077]), or HCQ alone (OR = 1.122 [95% CI: 0.995–1.266]; p = 0.06). Similarly, based on pooled effect sizes derived from direct and indirect evidence, none of the treatments had a significant benefit in decreasing the use of mechanical ventilation. No heterogeneity was identified (Cochran's Q = 1.68; p = 0.95; τ² = 0; I² = 0% [95% CI: 0%-0%]). Evidence from RCTs suggests that AZ with or without HCQ was not associated with a significant effect on the mortality or mechanical ventilation rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. More research is needed to explore therapeutics agents that can effectively reduce the mortality or severity of COVID-19.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^113ppjtE]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

All three randomised clinical trials that we identified were in hospital settings, and only one assessed azithromycin as a standalone therapy for COVID-19. To our knowledge, PRINCIPLE is the first randomised trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin as a standalone treatment for patients with COVID-19 in the community. We found that azithromycin did not substantially improve time to recovery and found little evidence of an effect on admissions to hospital, when used in the community to treat COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidence

Taken together, our findings plus the evidence to date suggest that azithromycin is not a sufficiently effective treatment to justify routine use for treatment of COVID-19, neither in the community nor in hospitals.

Randomised trials have found that azithromycin is not an effective treatment for patients who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19, either alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of suspected COVID-19 in the community, where earlier treatment might speed recovery and prevent hospital admissions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat COVID-19 in the platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in older people (PRINCIPLE) study.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19 infection [^112WJdTM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are quinoline derivatives used to treat malaria. To date, these medications are not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there are no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical studies or evidence to support their use in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are being studied alone or in combination with other agents to assess their effectiveness in the treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19. The effective use of any medication involves an understanding of its pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanism of action. This work provides basic clinical pharmacology information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and summarizes safety data from phase II and phase II/III clinical studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of azithromycin and chloroquine in combination. In addition, this work presents data describing the proposed mechanisms of action against the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 and summarizes clinical efficacy to date.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^1173WYU4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Azithromycin has rapidly been adopted as a repurposed drug for the treatment of COVID-19, despite the lack of high-quality evidence. In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase. Safety data warrant monitoring of drug-drug interactions and subsequent cardiac adverse events, especially with hydroxychloroquine. More prospective data of large randomised controlled studies are expected and much-needed. Uniform reporting of results should be strongly encouraged to facilitate data pooling with the many ongoing initiatives.

### Favorable impact of azithromycin on patients in the intensive care unit with coronavirus disease 2019: insights from the first wave using a Japanese database [^11354xuS]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Azithromycin has favorable effects on critical respiratory diseases owing to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, azithromycin was frequently administered before specific treatments were developed. However, the efficacy of this treatment has not been verified. We retrospectively investigated the effects of its intravenous (IV) administration in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 using the National Administrative Database of Japan during the first wave (February-April 2020).

Methods

Patients were categorized based on whether they received IV azithromycin within three days of hospitalization. An overlap weighting method with estimated propensity scores was used to reduce bias.

Results

Among the 830 patients with severe/critical COVID-19, 148 (17.8%) received azithromycin, and 682 (82.2%) did not. After adjustment, the use of azithromycin was associated with a shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) management (-3.48 days, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.59 to -2.38). However, other endpoints, including mortality rate, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospital stay, did not suggest any associations. Furthermore, of the 115 ICU patients, 27 (23.5%) were treated with IV azithromycin and 88 (76.5%) were not. After adjustment, azithromycin was associated with favorable outcomes, including reduced in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.92), 30-day mortality (OR, 0.46, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.94), and a shorter duration of ICU management (-2.94 days, 95% CI: 5.15 to -0.73).

Conclusion

We verified that IV azithromycin was associated with favorable impact in patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU management.

### ESCMID COVID-19 living guidelines: drug treatment and clinical management [^114ey6gV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

In January 2021, the ESCMID Executive Committee decided to launch a new initiative to develop ESCMID guidelines on several COVID-19-related issues, including treatment of COVID-19.

Methods

An ESCMID COVID-19 guidelines task force was established by the ESCMID Executive Committee. A small group was established, half appointed by the chair, and the remaining selected with an open call. Each panel met virtually once a week. For all decisions, a simple majority vote was used. A long list of clinical questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format was developed at the beginning of the process. For each PICO, two panel members performed a literature search with a third panellist involved in case of inconsistent results. Voting was based on the GRADE approach.

Questions Addressed By The Guideline and Recommendations

A synthesis of the available evidence and recommendations is provided for each of the 15 PICOs, which cover use of hydroxychloroquine, bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, casirivimab combined with imdevimab, ivermectin, azithromycin and empirical antibiotics, colchicine, corticosteroids, convalescent plasma, favipiravir, remdesivir, tocilizumab and interferon β-1a, as well as the utility of antifungal prophylaxis and enoxaparin. In general, the panel recommended against the use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, colchicine and interferon β-1a. Conditional recommendations were given for the use of monoclonal antibodies in high-risk outpatients with mild-moderate COVID-19, and remdesivir. There was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for use of favipiravir and antifungal prophylaxis, and it was recommended that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed in patients with COVID-19 unless bacterial coinfection or secondary infection is suspected or confirmed. Tocilizumab and corticosteroids were recommended for treatment of severe COVID-19 but not in outpatients with non-severe COVID-19.

Scope

The aim of the present guidance is to provide evidence-based recommendations for management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More specifically, the goal is to aid clinicians managing patients with COVID-19 at various levels of severity including outpatients, hospitalized patients, and those admitted to intensive care unit. Considering the composition of the panel, mostly clinical microbiologists or infectious disease specialists with no pulmonology or intensive care background, we focus only on pharmacological treatment and do not give recommendations on oxygen supplement/support. Similarly, as no paediatricians were included in the panel; the recommendations are only for adult patients with COVID-19. Considering the current literature, no guidance was given for special populations such as the immunocompromised.

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115pqQku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during the study period (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone. Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the study period (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any relevant outcome for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days. Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no beneficial effect for COVID-19 individuals. There is no evidence from RCTs available for other antibiotics as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of COVID-19. With accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. However, in relation to the evidence for azithromycin and in the context of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside well-designed RCTs.

### Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of early SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk outpatient adults: a randomized clinical trial [^11725pGn]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment options for outpatients with COVID-19 could reduce morbidity and prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, three-arm (1:1:1) placebo-equivalent controlled trial conducted remotely throughout the United States, adult outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (400 mg BID x1day, followed by 200 mg BID x9days) with or without azithromycin (AZ) (500 mg, then 250 mg daily x4days) or placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid (HCQ) and folic acid (AZ)), stratified by risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (high-risk vs. low-risk). Self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, FLUPro symptom surveys, EKGs and vital signs were collected daily. Primary endpoints were: (a) 14-day progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalization, or death; (b) 14-day time to viral clearance; secondary endpoints included time to symptom resolution (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04354428). Due to the low rate of clinical outcomes, the study was terminated for operational futility.

Findings

Between 15th April and 27th July 2020, 231 participants were enrolled and 219 initiated medication a median of 5.9 days after symptom onset. Among 129 high-risk participants, incident LRTI occurred in six (4.7%) participants (two control, four HCQ/AZ) and COVID-19 related hospitalization in seven (5.4%) (four control, one HCQ, two HCQ/AZ); no LRTI and two (2%) hospitalizations occurred in the 102 low-risk participants (one HCQ, one HCQ/AZ). There were no deaths. Among 152 participants with viral shedding at enrollment, median time to clearance was 5 days (95% CI = 4–6) in HCQ, 6 days (95% CI = 4–8) in HCQ/AZ, and 8 days (95% CI = 6–10) in control. Viral clearance was faster in HCQ (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.01–2.60, p = 0.047) but not HCQ/AZ (HR = 1.25, p = 0.39) compared to control. Among 197 participants who met the COVID-19 definition at enrollment, time to symptom resolution did not differ by group (HCQ: HR = 1.02, 95% CI-0.63–1.64, p = 0.95, HCQ/AZ: HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.57–1.45, p = 0.70).

Interpretation

Neither HCQ nor HCQ/AZ shortened the clinical course of outpatients with COVID-19, and HCQ, but not HCQ/AZ, had only a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. HCQ and HCQ/AZ are not effective therapies for outpatient treatment of SARV-CoV-2 infection.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: a systematic survey [^113rYJne]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of recommendations

Of the 63 recommendations that pertain to antibiotic use, 49 (78%) focused on general antibiotic use, whereas 14 (22%) specifically addressed azithromycin use in the context of COVID-19. Healthcare setting varied across recommendations; all patients (n = 22, 35%); hospitalised (n = 19, 30%); ICU only (n = 13, 21%); outpatient (n = 5, 8%); inpatient non-ICU (n = 3, 5%), and outpatient and inpatient non-ICU (n = 1, 2%). Guidelines focused on adult patients (n = 40, 63%), both adults and children or not specified (n = 22, 35%), or children only (n = 1, 2%).

Recommendations were most likely to address antibiotic initiation (n = 52, 83%) and less commonly antibiotic selection (n = 13, 21%), and duration of therapy (n = 15, 24%). The full list of guidelines and recommendations is available in Supplementary Table S1.

Of recommendations focusing on empiric antibiotic use in COVID-19, 6/43 (14%) suggest empiric antibiotic therapy regardless of evidence of bacterial infection. All but one of these recommendations apply to critically ill patients with COVID-19. A single guideline recommended "usual antimicrobial treatment" for pneumonia for all patients with COVID-19 (e.g. with and without radiographic abnormalities, in all levels of severity). Five of the above six recommendations suggest bacteriological microbiological sampling in order to rule out co-infection. Similarly, four of the six guidelines recommend de-escalating or discontinuing antimicrobial on the basis of additional (e.g. microbiological) findings.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^115oP2jV]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

We included patients with no SARS-CoV-2 PCR results because this reflects many primary care settings, where timely testing might not be available. At the beginning of the trial, shortages of swabs and restricted community testing resulted in a high proportion of participants with no timely SARS-CoV-2 test result available. We do not know how many participants who did not have a test, or who tested negative with a self-swab, might have tested positive if the swab had been taken by a health-care professional or earlier in their illness. Increased test availability has meant that the prevalence of known SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants enrolling into PRINCIPLE is now much higher. However, in the present analysis, only 434 (31%) of 1388 participants with suspected COVID-19 had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In analyses of the primary outcomes restricted to this group, the estimated benefits of azithromycin remained below the predefined thresholds of clinically meaningful benefit. The low proportion of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections reflects the management of COVID-19 in UK primary care at the time of the study, when testing was not always available to many patients, and might reflect current practice in other community settings or low-income hospital settings, where access to timely SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing remains restricted and early empirical treatment might be used in symptomatic patients. This approach is supported by primary care data, which suggest that during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, mortality was similar among people with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and people with COVID-19 diagnosed clinically by GPs.

Our trial was open label, as the study question concerned whether the addition of azithromycin to usual care was effective, rather than a comparison between azithromycin and placebo. In the context of a rapidly adapting platform trial, it would be logistically difficult to produce a placebo for the multiple drug treatments that are being added to PRINCIPLE as new evidence emerges. As participants were not masked to the intervention, self-reported outcomes might have been influenced by a placebo effect, although the effect of masking on estimates of effect has not been clearly shown. In our study, any potential placebo effect will have probably biased results towards a positive effect of azithromycin, meaning our finding of no effect on self-reported time to first recovery is robust to potential type II error. Our findings were similar for the hospitalisation or death outcome, which is less susceptible to ascertainment bias.

### COVID-19 and antimicrobial stewardship: what is the interplay? [^112hp9fX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently in the spotlight, attracting all the attention of the world's medical community. Meanwhile, other longer-term public health issues, such as antimicrobial resistance caused by misuse and/or overuse of antimicrobials, may have been relegated to the shadows. At this stage of the pandemic, and under the pressure caused by the absence of specific antivirals and vaccines, antimicrobials are being used in several ways. First, they are being repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19, as it is happening with the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. In addition, antimicrobials are being used as empirical coverage for possible coexisting community-acquired infection of the respiratory tract, especially in severe cases of COVID-19. They are also being used as empirical coverage for possible hospital-acquired superinfection of the respiratory tract, taking into account that a significant proportion of COVID-19 hospitalized patients will have prolonged hospitalizations or will require intensive care unit admission. Furthermore, antimicrobials are being prescribed for the targeted treatment of community or hospital-acquired respiratory tract co- or superinfections. Finally, antimicrobials are being used in empirical or targeted treatment for co- or superinfection outside the respiratory tract.

### Effect of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin on the mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CncxP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin have been widely promoted to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) following early in vitro antiviral effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Objective

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care.

Participants

Patients ≥ 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19.

Interventions

Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin.

Methods

Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety.

Results

The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65–1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97–1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04–1.54, n = 7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Hydroxychloroquine alone was not associated with reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients but the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin significantly increased mortality.

### Azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^112t1krb]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Azithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Methods

In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936.

Findings

Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65.3 years (SD 15.7) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.07; p = 0.50). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to > 28] vs 11 days [5 to > 28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.98–1.10; p = 0.19). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, no significant difference was seen in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.87–1.03; p = 0.24).

Interpretation

In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, azithromycin did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Azithromycin use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients in whom there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^115iMHBq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies

Table 3 summarizes available clinical data on the efficacy of AZ alone, or in combination with other drugs, against various viral infections. With some exceptions, the studies in Table 2 have been observational, single‐arm, nonrandomized studies or retrospective evaluations. Many of these studies have reported clinical observations or conducted post hoc analyses. Studies in COVID‐19 patients have mainly focused on viral load as an end point, and detailed evaluation of clinical outcomes has not been reported. Notwithstanding the limitations of these studies, collectively they present preliminary evidence that inclusion of AZ in various treatment regimens can influence the course of viral infection and has the potential to influence clinical outcomes. Confirmatory evidence with randomized controlled trials is essential to understand the role of AZ in the treatment of COVID‐19.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^114nfdE4]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HC) ± azithromycin (AZ) is widely used for Covid-19. The Qatar Prospective RCT of Expediting Coronavirus Tapering (Q-PROTECT) aimed to assess virologic cure rates of HC ± AZ in cases of low-acuity Covid-19.

Methods

Q-PROTECT employed a prospective, placebo-controlled design with blinded randomization to three parallel arms: placebo, oral HC (600 mg daily for one week), or oral HC plus oral AZ (500 mg day one, 250 mg daily on days two through five). At enrollment, non-hospitalized participants had mild or no symptoms and were within a day of Covid-19 positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After six days, intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the primary endpoint of virologic cure was assessed using binomial exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and χ² testing. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04349592, trial status closed to new participants.).

Findings

The study enrolled 456 participants (152 in each of three groups: HC+AZ, HC, placebo) between 13 April and 1 August 2020. HC+AZ, HC, and placebo groups had 6 (3.9%), 7 (4.6%), and 9 (5.9%) participants go off study medications before completing the medication course (p = 0.716). Day six PCR results were available for all 152 HC+AZ participants, 149/152 (98.0%) HC participants, and 147/152 (96.7%) placebo participants. Day six ITT analysis found no difference (p = 0.821) in groups' proportions achieving virologic cure: HC+AZ 16/152 (10.5%), HC 19/149 (12.8%), placebo 18/147 (12.2%). Day 14 assessment also showed no association (p = 0.072) between study group and viral cure: HC+AZ 30/149 (20.1%,), HC 42/146 (28.8%), placebo 45/143 (31.5%). There were no serious adverse events.

Interpretation

HC ± AZ does not facilitate virologic cure in patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19.

Funding

The study was supported by internal institutional funds of the Hamad Medical Corporation (government health service of the State of Qatar).

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^1128qJNf]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Prophylaxis against bacterial superinfection

The reported rate of antibiotic prescription in COVID-19 patients, especially in-hospital, is very high. Driving forces are the sometimes-difficult differential diagnosis with atypical pneumonias and fear of bacterial superinfection. Early bacterial coinfection has indeed been a well-known source of morbidity and mortality in historic influenza pandemics. In COVID-19, however, pooled data suggest a much lower risk of bacterial co-infection, and do not support routine administration of antibiotics. Even though azithromycin may improve outcomes in the limited cases of superinfection, antibacterial prophylaxis is no grounded argument for its systematic use, and must be weighed against the risk of bacterial resistance.

In vivo data

Non-COVID-19

Azithromycin is an established treatment modality in several chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases. Different clinical trials have proven its efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, asthma and lung transplantation. While undeniable proof of azithromycin's immunomodulatory potential, it is unsure if this can also be exploited in the acute setting.

Before COVID-19, the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin have been clinically demonstrated in other viral pneumonias and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In a retrospective cohort evaluation of hospitalised patients with moderate or severe ARDS treated with azithromycin or not, azithromycin was associated with a significant improvement in 90-day survival rate and a shorter time to successful discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Also, azithromycin-use was associated with decreased 60-day mortality and shorter time of ventilator dependency in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. For the treatment of influenza, combination therapy of oseltamivir-azithromycin compared with oseltamivir alone showed improved clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohortand a faster decline of inflammatory parameters in a randomised controlled trial. On the other hand, a tendency towards lower ICU mortality, lower 90-day mortality and shorter hospital stay did not achieve statistical significance in a cohort study on the use of macrolides (of which 71.3% was azithromycin) in critically ill patients with MERS. Possibly, the higher risk of coinfection in influenza, especially with influenza A, may contribute to the larger effect size.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115qGkSR]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin (AZM) is commonly used in Covid-19 patients based on low-quality evidence, increasing the risk of developing adverse events and antimicrobial resistance. The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the safety and efficacy of AZM in treating Covid-19 patients using published randomized controlled trials. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, MEDLINE, bioRxiv and medRxiv were searched for relevant studies. The random-effects model was used to pool estimates using the Paule-Mandel estimate for heterogeneity. The odds ratio and raw difference in medians were used for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. The analysis included seven studies with 8822 patients (median age, 55.8 years; 61% males). The risk of bias was assessed as 'low' for five of the seven mortality results and as 'some concerns' and 'high' in one trial each. There were 657/3100 (21.2%) and 1244/5654 (22%) deaths among patients randomized to AZM and standard of care, respectively. The use of AZM was not associated with mortality in Covid-19 patients (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88–1.05, p = 0.317 based on the random-effect meta-analysis). The use of AZM was not associated with need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.49–1.87, p = 0.85) and length of stay (Δ = 1.11, 95% CI -2.08 to 4.31, p = 0.49). The results show that using AZM as routine therapy in Covid-19 patients is not justified due to lack of efficacy and potential risk of bacterial resistance that is not met by an increased clinical benefit.

### Azithromycin versus standard care in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (ATOMIC2): an open-label, randomised trial [^1138yjxL]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Added value of this study

The ATOMIC2 trial was uniquely designed to assess azithromycin as a standalone therapy in those with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 presenting to emergency care but assessed as appropriate for initial ambulatory management without hospital admission. ATOMIC2 also uniquely assessed high-dose, long-duration treatment to investigate the efficacy of putative anti-inflammatory effects. We found that azithromycin 500 mg daily for 14 days did not reduce the proportion of participants who died or required hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation compared with standard care.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings, taken together with existing data, suggest there is no evidence that azithromycin reduces hospital admission, respiratory failure, or death compared with standard care, either in early disease in the community, or those admitted to hospital with severe disease, or in those with moderate disease managed on an ambulatory pathway.

We did a randomised, open-label clinical trial to establish whether azithromycin is effective in preventing hospital admission or death in adult patients with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection being managed on an ambulatory care pathway.

Pathophysiology of COVID-19

Normal antiviral response

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single stranded enveloped RNA β-coronavirus that spreads through aerosols, droplets, respiratory secretions and direct contact. One can distinguish different disease stages (figure 1).(A) After transmission, SARS-CoV-2 binds and enters respiratory epithelial cells through the ACE II (ACE2) receptor. The quick viral replication and high cytopathogenicity cause a strong release of danger signals, (B) Binding of these danger signals to specific pattern recognition receptors induces an innate antiviral immune response and clinical disease becomes apparent,(C) In the following days an adaptive immune response is gradually mounted, comprising a T-helper-1 (T h 1) and often also a T h 2 activation. In the latter case, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IIgM and IgG antibodies appear and their levels correlate with disease severity. Assuming the patient is able to overcome the infection, a convalescent phase commences and (D) Inflammatory markers decrease and, in most patients, pulmonary infiltrates slowly wane.

### The gut microbiome: an under-recognised contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic? [^117HGvti]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The gut microbiome and proposed treatments for COVID-19 infection

In parallel with the efforts being made to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, the pandemic has prompted the rapid development and roll out of an unprecedented number of investigational treatment studies. As of October 2020, over 3800 clinical trials targeting COVID-19 are registered across the globe. The gut microbiome is well established as a modulator of a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in clinical practice, including anti-virals, anti-hypertensives, and anti-diabetic medications, and baseline gut microbiome profiles have been shown to predict responses to cancer therapies. It is possible that inter-individual variation in gut microbiomes will have an impact on the success of proposed treatments for COVID-19.

A wide array of drugs are being trialled to combat COVID-19, with some showing evidence that they interact with the gut microbiome. Specifically, the macrolide antibiotic Azithromycin is being tested widely as a treatment for COVID-19, predominantly in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Azithromycin's action on gut bacteria is well recognised, hence its use in the treatment of Campylobacter infection in many parts of the world. In a blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study in young children, a 3-day course of Azithromycin (10 mg/kg) was shown to reduce alpha diversity of the gut microbiota characterised by loss of the genus Bifidobacterium at 14 days. Furthermore, functional analysis of the metagenomes of African children treated with Azithromycin showed under-representation of metabolic pathways involved in immune regulation and inflammation. The aforementioned studies concern children, and their applicability in the population severely affected by COVID-19, mainly older adults, is perhaps moot, although, in an adult population, azithromycin treatment has been associated with a diminishment of Lachnospiraceae.

Other considerations — The panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence against treatment with hydroxychloroquine was moderate due to imprecision around a trend toward increased mortality harms, and when considering the addition of azithromycin, the overall certainty of the evidence was low.

### Azithromycin and COVID-19: prompt early use at first signs of this infection in adults and children, an approach worthy of consideration [^112gbjvT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The devastating effects of the coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have led to urgent attempts to find effective therapeutic agents for inpatient and outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Initial enthusiasm for the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has abated. However, as a result of positive clinical experience with azithromycin used alone during the first few days of the flu-like illness caused by this coronavirus, we recommend formal clinical trials using azithromycin early in the course of a COVID-19 infection. There is one clinical trial initiated, the individually randomized, telemedicine-based, "Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment in Outpatients Nationwide" based at the University of California San Francisco. This placebo-controlled trial is designed to determine the efficacy of a single 1.2-g dose of oral azithromycin to prevent COVID-19 patient progression to hospitalization. We recommend formal clinical trials of azithromycin in its prepackaged form at the first sign of COVID-19 infection in adults and children, using an initial adult dose of 500mg followed by 250mg per day for 4days, a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g, and for children 5 to 18years of age, 10 mg/kg on the first day followed by 5 mg/kg for 4days.

In conclusion, the most beneficial pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 are corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, for the treatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Other promising agents are remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring minimal supplemental oxygen therapy, and IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies in severe COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin demonstrate the least efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The clinical benefits of the treatment of a COVID-19-specific coagulopathy with increased dosing of anticoagulation need further research and confirmation of randomised controlled trials.

The COVID-19 pandemic, as devastating as it is, is teaching humanity an important lesson in dealing with crises. Instead of getting defeated by this pandemic, we need to evaluate what we have done correctly and admit what we have done wrong to be prepared for the next crisis.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^112sQLjQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that one of the two double-blinded Covid-19 HC RCTs addressed post-exposure prophylaxis only. The otherwas limited by performance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in only 58% of participants. While both of the blinded trials undoubtedly advanced the state of Covid-19 knowledge, neither assessed the concrete endpoint of virologic cure in a PCR-positive Covid-19 population. Q-PROTECT is the first double-blinded RCT that assesses in virtually all of its participants, an objective virologic endpoint in cases (those with mild or no symptoms) in whom virologic clearance is critical to pandemic control.

It is not the case that virologic cure is more important than clinical outcomes, but Q-PROTECT's laboratory-assessed endpoints fill a gap in the blinded-RCT Covid-19 evidence base. Specifically, a blinded RCT could inform national decisions on utility of HC ± AZ to expedite viral clearance and thus reduce transmission. When Q-PROTECT commenced in mid-April 2020, approximately 50,000 people in Qatar had been tested for Covid-19. There had been over 3000 positive SARS-CoV-2 results and seven deaths, with 252 new cases in the 24 h prior to study commencement. As enrollment closed in August 2020, the Covid-19 epidemic in Qatar was a few months past its peak but the daily PCR-positive n was still over 200. Approximately a half-million Covid-19 tests had been done in the country between March and August, with over 100,000 positive results and a death rate of roughly 1 in 1000. Q-PROTECT set out to determine whether HC ± AZ could expedite viral clearance and thus likely reduce transmission.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^113JAC8E]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world extraordinarily. This disease has a potential to cause a significantly severe course of disease leading to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure and possibly death. In the fight against this pandemic-causing disease, medical professionals around the world are searching for pharmacological agents that could treat and prevent disease progression and mortality. To speed the search of promising treatment options, already existing pharmacological agents are repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19 and tested in clinical trials. The aim of this literature review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed pharmacological agents for the treatment of COVID-19 at different pathophysiologic stages of the disease. For this literature review, online-databases PubMed and Google Scholar were utilised. Keywords "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "pathogenesis", "drug targets", "pharmacological treatment", "cytokine storm", "coagulopathy" and individual drug names were used. Scientific articles, including reviews, clinical trials, and observational cohorts, were collected and analysed. Furthermore, these articles were examined for references to find more clinical trials testing for the potential treatment of COVID-19. In total, 97 references were used to conduct this research paper.

Results

The most beneficial pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 are corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, for the treatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Other promising agents are remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring minimal supplemental oxygen therapy, and IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies in severe COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin demonstrate the least efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The clinical benefits of the treatment of a COVID-19-specific coagulopathy with increased dosing of anticoagulation need further research and confirmation of randomised controlled trials.

Conclusion

The search for pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 has elicited great controversy. Whereas drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir have not shown proven benefit, the agents remdesivir and dexamethasone are recommended for clinical use for the treatment of COVID-19. Further randomised trials for other pharmacological treatment strategies are awaited.

### Effect of high vs low doses of chloroquine diphosphate as adjunctive therapy for patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a randomized clinical trial [^116TPTGH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, a high-dosage of CQ (12 g) given for 10 days concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir was not sufficiently safe to warrant continuation of that study group. Age was an important confounder and might be associated with the unfavorable outcomes. We recommend that similar dosages no longer be used for the treatment of severe COVID-19, especially because treatment based on older patients with previous cardiac diseases who are receiving concomitant cardiotoxic drugs should be the rule. No apparent benefit of CQ was seen regarding lethality in our patients so far. To better understand the role of CQ or HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19, we recommend the following next steps: (1) randomized clinical trials evaluating its role as a prophylactic drug and (2) randomized clinical trials evaluating its efficacy against the progression of COVID-19 when administered to patients with mild or moderate disease. Even if we fail to generate good evidence in time to control the current pandemic, the information will affect how we deal with coronavirus outbreaks in the future.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^11278PZc]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

These data, in conjunction with our findings, suggest that despite potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, azithromycin is not effective in treating COVID-19 without additional indications, even when used in the community and earlier in the course of the disease. A meta-analysis of 24 hospital-based studies found that bacterial co-infection (estimated from respiratory or blood isolates on presentation with COVID-19) was identified in 3.5% of patients (95% CI 0.4–6.7), suggesting that bacterial co-infection in the community is not common and, therefore, a beneficial effect through an antibacterial mechanism of action is unlikely in this setting.

Strengths of the PRINCIPLE trial include the evaluation of azithromycin as a standalone treatment in the community, with a focus on patients at a high risk of complications, and the use of 28-day patient-reported outcomes, which, in the case of hospitalisation and deaths, were confirmed by medical record review. Only around three-quarters of participants reported feeling recovered within 28 days, reflecting emerging evidence concerning the long-term nature of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, recovery is not always sustained and COVID-19 symptoms can recur or relapse, which we measured using the secondary outcomes of sustained recovery and symptom alleviation. We did not assess the potential effects of azithromycin on long-term outcomes beyond 28 days.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^1138Gwo7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential mechanisms of antiviral activity

The precise mechanism is unknown; however, multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the putative antiviral properties observed with AZ. Endosome maturation and function require an acidic environment. AZ is a weak base and preferentially accumulates intracellularly in endosomal vesicles and lysosomes, which could increase pH levels, and potentially block endocytosis and/or viral genetic shedding from lysosomes, thereby limiting viral replication. An acidic environment is also required for the uncoating of enveloped viruses such as influenza and HIV, and a similar mechanism is plausible for coronaviruses, also enveloped viruses. These mechanisms have also been proposed for the antiviral effect noted with HCQ and chloroquine (CQ);, in fact, evidence suggests that AZ causes a more severe impairment of acidification than CQ.

The putative antiviral effects of AZ may also be mediated by a global amplification of the host's interferon (IFN) pathway‐mediated antiviral responses. Data suggest that AZ has the ability to induce pattern recognition receptors, IFNs, and IFN‐stimulated genes, leading to a reduction of viral replication. In addition, AZ directly acts on bronchial epithelial cells to maintain their function and reduce mucus secretion to facilitate lung function.

Specific to SARS‐CoV‐2, recent quantum mechanical modeling suggests a potential role of AZ in interfering with viral entry via binding interaction between the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein and host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme‐2) protein; further experimental work on this is necessary to confirm the model.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^115ge6d4]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

The intervention presented in this manuscript is oral azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days plus usual care, compared with usual care alone. Usual care in the NHS for suspected COVID-19 in the community is largely supportive and focused on managing symptoms. Antibiotics are only recommended for use if bacterial pneumonia is suspected, in which case guidelines recommend doxycycline. Azithromycin was either prescribed or issued directly by the participant's general practitioner (GP), or issued centrally by the trial team and delivered to the participant. Azithromycin 500 mg is commonly used in primary care for bacterial respiratory infections and is similar to the dose used in early studies for COVID-19.

The PRINCIPLE trial initially had two groups, with 1:1 allocation between usual care and hydroxychloroquine. The first participant was recruited on April 2, 2020, and the hydroxychloroquine group of the trial was closed by the UK MHRA on May 22, 2020, at which point azithromycin was introduced. Participants were followed up by responding to questions about their symptoms, antibiotic use, and use of health-care services in a daily, online diary for 28 days after random assignment, supplemented with telephone calls on days 2, 14, and 28. Participants were encouraged to nominate a friend, relative, or carer to be a study partner, who could help them provide follow-up data, and be contacted for information if the participant was unable to complete the daily diary themselves. We obtained consent to ascertain relevant outcome data from GP and hospital records about hospital assessments, admissions, intensive care treatment, and mechanical ventilation. We aimed to give all participants the opportunity to provide a self-swab test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, analysed by the Public Health England virology reference laboratory but, because of supply issues during the early stages of the pandemic, swabs were not available for all participants.

### Cardiovascular safety of azithromycin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: a prespecified pooled analysis of the COALITION I and COALITION II randomized clinical trials [^112J6U7i]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular safety from azithromycin in the treatment of several infectious diseases has been challenged. In this prespecified pooled analysis of 2 multicenter randomized clinical trials, we aimed to assess whether the use of azithromycin might lead to corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation or clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias. In the COALITION COVID Brazil I trial, 667 patients admitted with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, or standard of care. In the COALITION COVID Brazil II trial, 447 patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly allocated to hydroxychloroquine alone versus hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. The principal end point for the present analysis was the composite of death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or ventricular arrhythmias. The addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine did not result in any prolongation of the QTc interval (425.8 ± 3.6 ms vs 427.9 ± 3.9 ms, respectively, mean difference -2.1 ms, 95% confidence interval -12.5 to 8.4 ms, p = 0.70). The combination of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine compared with hydroxychloroquine alone did not result in increased risk of the primary end point (proportion of patients with events at 15 days 17.2% vs 16.0%, respectively, hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.49, p = 0.65). In conclusion, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 already receiving standard-of-care management (including hydroxychloroquine), the addition of azithromycin did not result in the prolongation of the QTc interval or increase in cardiovascular adverse events. Because azithromycin is among the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents, our results may inform clinical practice. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT04322123, NCT04321278.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^114Vo58M]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK. Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.

### ACMT position statement: off-label prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic [^116PLb1e]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). High credibility.

Background — There are currently no FDA approved direct pharmacotherapies for COVID-19, and because of the lack of other options clinicians are using medications approved for other indications such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin; although some of these medications have demonstrated in vitro activity against coronaviridae and others enhance immune function, all have had mixed results in the available, but methodologically-limited clinical trials reported to date.

### Azithromycin versus standard care in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (ATOMIC2): an open-label, randomised trial [^113wbqAi]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Three trials in primary care have randomly assigned participants with early disease to 3 daysor 5 days, of therapy. Azithromycin was assessed as standalone therapy only in the PRINCIPLE trial; a large, adaptive platform trial in the UK, which randomly assigned 540 participants to 3 days treatment with azithromycin 500 mg daily versus 875 participants to standard care. This study found no difference in time to first reported recovery (HR 1.08 [95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0.95 to 1.23]), and, although only 3% of participants were admitted to hospital, there was no significant difference between groups (absolute benefit in 0.3% [95% BCI −1.7 to 2.2]). The remaining two trials also used short courses of azithromycin 500 mg for 1 day followed by 250 mg for 4 days and taken in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine. Q-PROTECT recruited healthy, SARS-CoV-2-positive men in a quarantine site in Qatar and found no difference in time to virological cure (p = 0.82), with low rates of hospital admission in all groups (2.4%). A study in the USA assessed progression to lower respiratory tract infection, hospital admission, or death and time to viral clearance in SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients, but was stopped early for futility because of a low rate of clinical outcomes in this population, and found no difference in the co-primary outcome of time to virological clearance (HR 1.25 [95% CI 0.75 to 2.07], p = 0.39). No studies have assessed azithromycin in patients presenting to hospital with substantial symptoms, but early enough in the disease process to be managed in ambulant care, and neither have previous studies assessed high-dose, long-duration azithromycin therapy in early disease.

### Effect of oral azithromycin vs placebo on COVID-19 symptoms in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^114iJLJn]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Data Sharing Statement aDid not complete survey at day 3. bLoss to follow-up numbers are cumulative. Question Does a single oral dose of azithromycin lead to absence of symptoms at day 14 in outpatients with COVID-19 compared with placebo. Findings In this randomized trial that included 263 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single oral dose of azithromycin, 1. 2 g, vs placebo resulted in self-reported absence of COVID-19 symptoms at day 14 in 50% vs 50%; this was not statistically significant. Meaning Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of oral azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in a greater likelihood of being free of symptoms at day 14. Importance Azithromycin has been hypothesized to have activity against SARS-CoV-2. Objective To determine whether oral azithromycin in outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day
14. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier: NCT04332107 Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum azalide antibiotic that has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties and that has been hypothesized to have activity against SARS-CoV-2. 1 The anti-inflammatory effects of azithromycin may reduce cytokine levels that may help prevent progression to tissue damage and severe COVID-19, especially if administered early in the disease course. 1 If found to be effective, azithromycin is inexpensive, widely available, and has an excellent safety profile and would be an attractive candidate for outpatient use. Alternatively, if found to be ineffective, its use should be curtailed to prevent the selection for macrolide resistance.
2. Randomized clinical trials of hospitalized patients and in outpatients with presumed COVID-19 have failed to find evidence to support the use of azithromycin for COVID-19 treatment with or without the use of hydroxychloroquine.

3–6 Comparing treatment with azithromycin without concurrent hydroxychloroquine vs placebo in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection could provide more definitive evidence of its efficacy for COVID-19. This randomized clinical trial of outpatients with documented recent SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluated whether a single oral dose of azithromycin was effective for prevention of progression of COVID-19 in outpatients.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^112qk957]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin (AZ) is a broad‐spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half‐life and a large volume of distribution. It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well‐controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID‐19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID‐19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established. 1 This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID‐19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy data from phase II and phase II/III studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination. This paper may also serve to facilitate the consideration and use of a priori –defined control groups for future research.

### Azithromycin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients… [^117U2Yam]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine has been a broadly-utilized anti-malaria agent which back in 2006, had been proved to be a powerful wide-spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days.

The new study published in 16th March, pointed out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19. The reported clinical benefits of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for patients with COVID-19 come either from media reports or nonrandomized trials with small numbers of participants. The documented benefit of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin is very limited, especially in severe disease.

While these medications, individually or in combination, may prove efficacious, these benefits need to be established with randomized clinical trials prior to widespread adoption of these treatments.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^115Wtk25]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Per the prespecified protocol, the primary analysis model included all participants randomly allocated to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, and other trial interventions, from the start of random assignment in the platform to the time of the last random allocation to azithromycin (Nov 30, 2020). Data were extracted from the database after all randomly allocated participants had the opportunity to complete 28 days follow-up. Because this population included participants randomly assigned to usual care alone before the azithromycin group was opened, the time to recovery model also includes parameters to adjust for temporal drift in the study population. This adjustment can capture temporal drift due to changes in SARS-CoV-2, usual care, or the pandemic situation, as well as changes in the inclusion or exclusion criteria over time, when including participants receiving non-concurrent usual care in the analyses.

We did sensitivity analyses of the primary outcomes on the concurrent randomisation analysis population, defined as all participants who were randomly assigned to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, or other interventions only during the time interval when azithromycin was open to random allocation. Analyses of the coprimary outcomes for the concurrent randomisation analysis population were done using the same methods as described for the primary analysis population. Analysis of the secondary outcomes was done in the concurrent randomisation analysis population, but restricted to those in the azithromycin plus usual care and usual care alone groups only. Secondary time-to-event outcomes were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, and binary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression, adjusting for comorbidity status, age, duration of illness, and eligibility for azithromycin at baseline. We did not adjust for baseline covariates for outcomes with low event rates. We did prespecified subgroup analyses of time to recovery for baseline severity score and duration of illness before random assignment, age, comorbidity, and SARS-CoV-2, using the concurrent randomisation analysis population to assess whether treatment effects varied across subgroups.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^117SSFPy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During drug development, it is essential to demonstrate robust in vitro evidence of activity prior to further study in humans. Subsequently, for a development candidate to have potential to elicit the desired effect over the necessary period of time in vivo, three fundamental "pillars" need to be demonstrated:
Exposure at the target site of action over a desired period of time
Binding to the pharmacological target as expected for its mechanism of action
Expression of pharmacological activity commensurate with the demonstrated target exposure and target binding

The in vitro evidence presented here suggests that AZ has antiviral properties, including activity against SARS‐CoV‐2, at concentrations that are physiologically achievable with doses used to treat bacterial infections in the lung. One plausible mechanism for the antiviral properties is the intracellular sequestration of AZ resulting in an increase in endosomal and/or lysosomal pH. Lack of an optimal acidic environment in the intracellular milieu potentially attenuates viral replication. This mechanism is similar to that proposed for CQ and HCQ, and could explain how two drugs, both weak bases, can act in a complementary manner to inhibit viral replication. In a companion in vitro study by investigators in Marseilles, France, when AZ was dosed in combination with HCQ, a synergistic effect was observed in vitro against SARS‐CoV‐2; however, no EC₅₀ was determined. The determination of in vitro EC₅₀ for agents administered alone and in combination against SARS‐CoV‐2 under similar experimental conditions is needed to further understand the putative antiviral effect of this combination. Other possible mechanisms including the amplification of the host's IFN pathway‐mediated antiviral responses as well as AZ's potential to interfere with viral entry requires further experimental work.

### Azithromycin versus standard care in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (ATOMIC2): an open-label, randomised trial [^112byHLB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this trial of people with clinically diagnosed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospital admission or death, or of time to hospital admission.

Three recent, large, open-label, randomised controlled trials have assessed the use of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19, and none have found a clinically significant benefit in those populations. COALITION I randomly assigned 667 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to standard care, hydroxychloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin 500 mg for 7 days and found no difference in clinical status on an ordinal score at 15 days between hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.47–1.43]; p = 1.00). Likewise, COALITION II randomly assigned 447 patients admitted to hospital to azithromycin 500 mg daily for 10 days or standard care, and again found no difference in day 15 ordinal score (OR 1.36 [0.94–1.97], p = 0.11).RECOVERY randomly assigned 7763 of its participants to azithromycin 500 mg for 10 days or standard care and found no difference in 28-day mortality (rate ratio 0.97 [95% CI 0.87–1.07], p = 0.50), length of stay, or invasive mechanical ventilation and death. However, none of these trials assessed the potential for efficacy in early, milder disease.

### Pragmatic recommendations for therapeutics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries [^115NqmRw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Questions

We formulated seven questions, as listed in the following. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, the following questions were formulated:
1 Should remdesivir be given?
2 Should hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin be given?
3 Should lopinavir–ritonavir be given?
4 Should broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy be given empirically for potential coinfections?
5 Should corticosteroids be given?
6 Should convalescent plasma be transfused?
7 Should interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, be given?

Table 1 shows a summary of our recommendations and suggestions.

Table 1
Recommendations and suggestions for therapeutics of COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries

1. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should remdesivir be given?

Rationale.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved remdesivir for the management of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and severe disease. It is important to consider whether this should be the standard care for similar patients in LMICs.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

### Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of early SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk outpatient adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1168FYGV]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that most COVID-19 infections occur in the outpatient setting, it is essential to continue to search for interventions that could alter the course of early disease and decrease risk of community transmission. Although we assumed that progression to severe COVID-19 would be a robust endpoint based on initial observations, we found that this was rare. Validated virologic or clinical risk factors for disease progression would greatly facilitate early treatment studies. Symptom resolution outcomes have been used in interventional trials of antivirals for influenza, and could be considered for outpatient COVID-19 trials.

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to disrupt life around the world, we must continue to search for therapies that reduce morbidity and transmission. Early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an important goal for pandemic control. Although this study showed that HCQ and HCQ/AZ are not effective in shortening the time to COVID-19 symptom resolution or decreasing viral shedding in a way that would interrupt transmission, important lessons from this trial can be applied to future trials of outpatient treatment for early SARS-CoV-2.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^116eijKF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of severe COVID-19 — criteria and therapies are specified: Patients with severe COVID-19 are those with pulmonary involvement and hypoxia or needing low flow oxygen, and most existing criteria for trials consider either a SpO₂ level less than 94% or 90% or tachypnea (respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute) as severe COVID-19. Corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, are recommended as the cornerstone of therapy in severe COVID-19. Remdesivir may be considered as it has shown to decrease time to recovery or discharge, though it has not been shown to improve mortality. The IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and JAK inhibitors baricitinib and tofacitinib have shown a benefit in severe, but non-critical COVID-19 when used with corticosteroids, and we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in those with elevated inflammatory markers like CRP and progressive severe COVID-19; since there is greater supportive data for tocilizumab and baricitinib we recommend them preferentially over sarilumab and tofacitinib, though the latter agents are suitable alternatives if the former are not available. We do not recommend using hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, or convalescent plasma, and we also recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of the context of a clinical trial given the low certainty of evidence for its benefit.

Second, despite the pleiotropic effects of azithromycin, it is certainly not the most potent molecule. Targeted antiviral drugs will likely have a more robust effect on the viral load. However, experience with influenza has taught us to start antivirals as soon as possible after host infection. Likewise, the anti-inflammatory effects of targeted anti-IL1, anti-IL6 or steroids are stronger, though probably only warranted when clear signs of hyperinflammation are present. If anything, one should not expect azithromycin to be put forward as 'the standard treatment', but rather as a part of a multimodal approach of antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and — in selected cases — antibiotic drugs, depending on the patient's presentation, immune status and disease stage.

Lastly, it is important to consider treatment effects that surpass acute pulmonary inflammation. Azithromycin has antifibrotic properties and crosses the blood–brain barrier. Possible morbidity of sequellar fibrotic lung disease and of prolonged neurological complaints extends well beyond the acute phase, and attenuating this later phase will significantly impact quality adjusted life years of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive clinical trial assessment with extended follow-up is, therefore, crucial to confirm or exclude the hypothetical benefits of azithromycin in COVID-19.

In conclusion, its favourable safety profile, affordability and pleiotropic mechanisms have raised a large interest in azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Its effect on the early inflammatory phase is best supported by the current evidence, which is typically when the first symptoms arise and a patient contacts his caretaker. Before starting azithromycin, a comprehensive assessment for drug–drug interactions and cardiovascular risk factors is prerequisite, especially when use in the first line is advocated. Beyond that, the current data remain equivocal. Due to the scale of the current pandemic, however, even a small treatment effect could mean a significant absolute reduction in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Moreover, we have currently no idea on how a second primary infection will be eradicated by the hosts' primed immune system. Beneficial modes of action should not be discarded based on short-term results obtained during the first wave of hospital admissions. In the next months, results of adequately performed randomised trials will provide better insight into the true role of azithromycin and other repurposed drugs in this historic pandemic. Still, as the field of intervention studies in COVID-19 is currently highly scattered, large coordinated international initiatives will be needed to pool aggregated and individual patient data to come to optimal conclusions.

### Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for virologic cure of non-severe COVID-19 [^115N3jBp]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

As of 1 August 2020, the date of closure of enrollment in Q-PROTECT, existing data on HC ± AZ use in hospitalized Covid-19 cases seems weighted toward the negative. However, as an early August commentary by Cohen states, the question of HC's potential utility in Covid-19 has not been definitively answered. There is a void in the existing evidence base that is filled by the current study.

In its blinded RCT design, Q-PROTECT differs from all but two of the preceding studies (both of which were published by the same group of North American investigators). The preponderance of the HC Covid-19 evidence – even the largest, high-quality trials such as RECOVERY and Solidarity – comes from observational or open-label designs and addresses treatment in hospitalized patients.

### Azithromycin versus standard care in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (ATOMIC2): an open-label, randomised trial [^116AdqGH]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Despite these theoretical considerations, large-scale clinical trials of azithromycin either alone or co-administered with hydroxychloroquine have not shown clinical efficacy in reducing mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital admission, or clinical status on ordinal outcome scores in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. However, these trials were all done in late-stage, severe disease with 17–40% mortality. They did not study patients at earlier stages of disease in the community and are not able to make conclusions about the effectiveness of azithromycin outside the hospital setting. The efficacy of therapies in COVID-19 depends on the timing in the course of disease and in the populations being studied. Dexamethasone showed a strong survival benefit with treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 but no benefit, or even potential harm, in those not requiring oxygen therapy. Conversely, studies of neutralising antibodies showed benefits in early diseasebut not in patients admitted to hospital. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin are suited to earlier-stage disease; thus, we studied an ambulatory population to establish whether it averts disease progression.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials with the terms ("azithromycin") AND ("COVID" OR "COVID-19") AND ("clinical trials"), until March 25, 2021, with no language restrictions. We identified 42 studies, among which there were four completed randomised trials of azithromycin (with or without hydroxychloroquine) in patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 disease, and three completed randomised trials of azithromycin in patients with mild COVID-19 in primary care. The four randomised trials in patients admitted to hospital assigned 8988 participants to azithromycin or standard care or hydroxychloroquine and found no evidence of a difference in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or peak disease severity. The three trials in primary care settings randomly assigned participants with early disease to 3 days or 5 days of therapy, and only one assessed azithromycin as standalone therapy. That trial was a large, adaptive platform trial in the UK that randomly assigned 540 participants in primary care to 3 days of treatment with azithromycin and 875 participants to standard care alone and found no meaningful difference in time to first reported recovery or in rates of hospital admission (3% in both groups), and there were no deaths. We did not identify any randomised trials in patients with COVID-19 managed in ambulatory care.

The same Brazilian study group conducted a trial of azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 10 days plus usual care versus usual care alone in 447 adult, hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 (COALITION II). At the time of the trial, usual care for patients with severe COVID-19 was hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily for 10 days. Thus, patients in the azithromycin group additionally received hydroxychloroquine. The authors reported no difference between the groups in the primary outcome of the odds of poorer clinical status at day 15, according to a 6-point ordinal scale of clinical status, among patients with confirmed COVID-19 (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.94–1.97; p = 0.11). The proportion of serious adverse events between the intervention and control groups were similar (42% vs 38%; p = 0.35), and there was no difference in patients with a prolonged corrected QT interval between the intervention and control groups (20% vs 21%; p = 0.66). These studies provide good evidence that azithromycin is not an effective treatment in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, there is no evidence of synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19, as has previously been suggested.

1 Introduction

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged the pandemic status of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease Covid-19. As of August 2020, there is neither a Covid-19 vaccine nor definitive therapy.

One therapeutic approach that was ultimately dropped from the UK's RECOVERY (in June 2020) and the WHO's Solidarity (in July 2020) is the repurposed antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HC). Initial enthusiasm for HC, administered with or without the macrolide azithromycin (AZ), was fueled by a March 2020 report from a Marseille open-label (non-RCT) studyand a mid-April follow-up from the same group. Covid-19 HC treatment attained a level of notoriety that was arguably disproportionate to the strength of supporting evidence.

In assessing the evidence in April 2020 – evidence that included a study from another French groupthat failed to replicate Marseille's favorable results – reviewers concluded there was insufficient evidence to support HC as a standard of Covid-19 care. Given the lack of certainty, in April 2020 a multidisciplinary group from the Qatari national healthcare system designed the Qatar Prospective RCT of Expediting Coronavirus Tapering (Q-PROTECT).

Pre-symptomatic transmission warrants focus as a target to protect a population from SARS-CoV-2. Q-PROTECT focuses on non-hospitalized low-acuity, emphasizing a dichotomous endpoint: presence of SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary aim was to determine whether, as compared to placebo, use of HC or HC+AZ was associated with higher rates of viral clearance after six days of therapy. There were two secondary study aims: assessment of day 14 virologic cure, and assessment of semi-quantitative change in viral load from baseline to day six.

### Azithromycin in addition to standard of care versus standard of care alone in the treatment of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19 in Brazil (COALITION II): a randomised clinical trial [^116RTcG7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 remain uncertain. We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised clinical trial at 57 centres in Brazil. We enrolled patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and at least one additional severity criteria as follows: use of oxygen supplementation of more than 4 L/min flow; use of high-flow nasal cannula; use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation; or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg via oral, nasogastric, or intravenous administration once daily for 10 days) plus standard of care or to standard of care without macrolides. All patients received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 10 days) because that was part of standard of care treatment in Brazil for patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome, assessed by an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation, was clinical status at day 15 after randomisation, assessed by a six-point ordinal scale, with levels ranging from 1 to 6 and higher scores indicating a worse condition (with odds ratio [OR] greater than 1.00 favouring the control group). The primary outcome was assessed in all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by molecular or serological testing before randomisation (ie, modified ITT [mITT] population). Safety was assessed in all patients according to which treatment they received, regardless of original group assignment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321278.

Findings

447 patients were enrolled from March 28 to May 19, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed in 397 patients who constituted the mITT population, of whom 214 were assigned to the azithromycin group and 183 to the control group. In the mITT population, the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (OR 1.36 [95% CI 0.94–1.97], p = 0.11). Rates of adverse events, including clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney failure, and corrected QT interval prolongation, were not significantly different between groups.

Interpretation

In patients with severe COVID-19, adding azithromycin to standard of care treatment (which included hydroxychloroquine) did not improve clinical outcomes. Our findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19.

### Azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19… [^115ai2i9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: 9, 049 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 1, 917 patients not hospitalized with COVID-19 Efficacy End Points: For patients who were hospitalized: all-cause mortality, clinical status, and death within 28 days of diagnosis; for patients not hospitalized: all-cause mortality, hospital admission, death within 28 days of diagnosis, and symptom resolution within 14 days. A Cochrane review including 10 randomized controlled trials evaluated azithromycin vs. standard of care or placebo in 10, 966 inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 or outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.

Azithromycin dosages included the usual dose, low dose, or high dose. Standard-of-care and placebo arms were considered the control groups. The Cochrane review excluded studies that compared antibiotics with other treatments. Compared with standard of care or placebo, azithromycin in the outpatient setting did not affect all-cause mortality within 28 days, inpatient admission within 28 days, death within 28 days, or symptom resolution within 14 days. There was no difference in serious adverse events compared with placebo or standard of care, and no study reported adverse events or cardiac arrhythmias.

For total and serious adverse events, there was a high risk of bias and imprecision of results due to the limited number of studies reporting adverse events, and most of the studies were underpowered to adequately address harm outcomes. Conclusion: The Cochrane review summarized here found that azithromycin did not reduce mortality or improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in the inpatient or outpatient setting compared with standard of care or placebo. These findings are consistent with results from guideline recommendations and other meta-analyses. 9, 10 Based on this evidence, we have assigned a color recommendation of red for the use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19 in the inpatient or outpatient setting.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^112ZyTFX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

To help determine the validity of these early clinical findings, it is important to understand if AZ demonstrates antiviral properties in vitro and in vivo, and the activity of AZ and HCQ in combination. AZ is a broad‐spectrum macrolide antibiotic primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections and has a well‐established safety profile. AZ is indicated for infections caused by susceptible bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for AZ against most of these bacterial pathogens are ≤ 2.0 mg/L (2.67 µM). The antibacterial mechanism of action of AZ is the binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of microorganisms, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit. AZ is not approved for antiviral therapy but has been studied in vitro and in clinical trials for activity against several viruses. This review was undertaken to assess key AZ published data on in vitro antiviral activity and clinical studies across a variety of viral infections to support the design of future controlled studies.

Summary and results of the time to first self-reported recovery

(A) Primary analysis population. (B) SARS-CoV-2-positive analysis population. Pr(meaningful effect) is the Bayesian model-based estimated probability that the benefit in median time to recovery compared with usual care is at least 1.5 days. Pr(superiority) is the probability of superiority; treatment superiority is declared if Pr(superiority) ≥ 0.99 versus usual care. HR = hazard ratio. BCI = Bayesian credibility interval.

16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0.3%, 95% BCI −1.7 to 2.2; table 2). There were no deaths in either study group. The probability that hospitalisations or deaths were lower in the azithromycin plus usual care group compared with the usual care alone group (probability of superiority) was 0.64, and was not formally analysed for significance due to the gate-keeping hypothesis structure. The probability that there was a reduction in hospitalisations or deaths of at least 2% (the predefined threshold of a clinically meaningful benefit) was 0.042. Results of both primary outcomes were consistent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 and the concurrent randomisation analysis population (table 2; figure 3).

Figure 3
Subgroup analysis of time to recovery outcome (concurrent randomisation analysis population)

Analysis of the secondary outcomes using the concurrent randomisation analysis population showed that there was no evidence of any difference between the two study groups in the daily score (1–10) of how well participants felt over 28 days (appendix p 217), nor the WHO wellbeing score at any of the follow-up timepoints, nor any of the hospitalisation secondary outcomes (table 3). Similarly, we found no evidence of treatment benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first alleviation of symptoms, time to sustained alleviation of symptoms, and time to initial reduction of severity of symptoms (appendix p 218). More GP health-care service use was reported in the azithromycin plus usual care group compared with the usual care alone group (table 3). We found some evidence that sustained recovery from nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea was more rapid in the azithromycin plus usual care group compared with the usual care alone group (appendix p 218).

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^115ZZXQ7]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this trial of interventions for people with suspected COVID-19 within 14 days of symptom onset, and at increased risk of complications, azithromycin plus usual care did not substantially shorten the time to first self-reported recovery or decrease the risk of hospitalisation.

There are over 80 clinical trials of azithromycin for COVID-19 planned or underway, but few have reported results and none, to our knowledge, are in a community setting. Similar to our findings, several randomised trials among patients admitted to hospital have found that azithromycin was not effective as a treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin has been evaluated as part of a hospital-based, platform, open-label randomised clinical trial of different COVID-19 treatments in the UK.2582 patients were randomly assigned to azithromycin (500 mg once a day for 10 days, or until discharge if this occurred sooner) plus usual care and 5181 received usual care alone. Azithromycin did not improve the primary outcome of mortality at 28 days (22% in both groups; rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.07; p = 0.50). Similarly, the authors reported no difference in 28-day mortality between groups when the analyses were limited to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (rate ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.86–1.06; p = 0.38). There was no difference in the occurrence of new cardiac arrhythmias between groups. One serious adverse event attributed to azithromycin was reported (pseudomembranous colitis).

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^1166FuN2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The use of azithromycin in COVID-19 is mechanistically well grounded and indirectly supported by prior experiences with other viral pneumonias, chronic pulmonary diseases and inflammatory disorders. Yet, the empirical practice of azithromycin treatment for COVID-19 has not been substantiated by good quality clinical data. Despite — maybe even because of — the limitations, a critical appraisal of the currently available evidence is valuable. It should contextualise the results of ongoing trials and could improve the set-up of future trials.

First, most interventions have an optimal time window. From a mechanistic point of view, initiation of azithromycin before or during the early inflammatory phase is more sensible. At that early stage, an antiviral effect could still be relevant. It remains unclear, however, if azithromycin significantly inhibits viral replication in vivo. Better supported by the data in this review are the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin on early inflammatory pathways that are key in the progression to severe COVID-19. They are supposed to balance the adaptive immune response, stimulate cellular immunity and avoid a subsequent cytokine storm. Results of large randomised controlled trials for hospitalised patients (eg, RECOVERY)are soon expected. However, a significant share of hospitalised patients may already be beyond this window. The primary care setting may be more suited to evaluate early interventions. Compared with the hospital though, this is a much less controlled environment, which makes retrospective data collection very challenging. A few studies are published, and the positive signals of Guérin et al and Esper et al.(preprint article, not included in table 1) are contradicted by Szente Fonseca et al. At least, with only a short follow-up time needed to assess the risk of hospital admission, prospective data In this context (eg, ATOMIC2, ACTION)should soon be able to provide more clarity.

COVID-19

The positive reports on azithromycin in other respiratory viral diseases have prompted the rapid initiation of interventional trials to evaluate its efficacy in COVID-19. At the time of writing, 121 trials with azithromycin are listed in clinical trials.gov. At the start of the pandemic, however, following the example of early non-randomised series of a French group in Marseille, azithromycin has most often been prescribed as an adjuvant to hydroxychloroquine. The use of hydroxychloroquine is now largely abandoned and few published studies have assessed azithromycin alone. The reported effects of azithromycin are thus often derived from patients treated with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination versus hydroxychloroquine alone. Table 1 gives an overview of currently published peer-reviewed studies in the MEDLINE database, in which the effect of azithromycin is assessed. Studies only comparing combination regimens versus standard of care were not considered (eg, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin vs neither therapy), as no inference about the individual treatment effect of azithromycin could be deduced (see online supplemental material for detailed description of the individual studies and study selection).

4 Discussion

This 3-arm randomized, placebo-equivalent, remotely-conducted trial showed that HCQ or HCQ/AZ did not expedite resolution of COVID-19 symptoms compared to placebo-equivalent control among outpatients with COVID-19. We noted a modestly faster time to viral clearance with HCQ but not HCQ/AZ; however, this effect was not retained in sensitivity analyses, either adjusting for baseline viral load or excluding samples with low viral load that are unlikely to be significant for transmission. Given these findings, we caution against overinterpretation of the virologic data. We designed the trial to explore whether HCQ and HCQ/AZ decreased the frequency of disease progression to clinically significant endpoints – LRTI, hospitalization, and death. Although we recruited a population at substantial risk for developing severe COVID-19, few participants progressed, resulting in trial discontinuation for operational futility.

Although we were not able to analyze whether HCQ and HCQ/AZ decreased the risk of COVID-19 disease progression due to rare events, our findings are consistent with two published randomized trials of HCQ treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients; both trials showed that HCQ did not decrease the duration of COVID-19 symptoms. A trial by Skipper et al. was conducted remotely in the US and similarly had few hospitalization endpoints and shifted the primary outcome to symptom resolution; there were no virologic outcomes in this study. An open-label trial conducted in Spain found that HCQ was not associated with faster resolution of symptoms and the quantity of virus detected at three time points did not differ by randomization group. Both studies recruited younger health care workers without risk factors for severe COVID-19. A third trial randomized, placebo-controlled trial by Omrani et al. showed HCQ with or without AZ was not associated with a difference in proportion of participants with viral clearance at day 6, among healthy young men recruited within one day of symptom onset. The current trial extends these findings in a population enriched with high-risk participants with laboratory-confirmed infection and provides daily viral shedding and granular detail on COVID-19 symptoms, along with careful safety monitoring.

### Cardiovascular safety of potential drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 [^116ZF2sE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. It is still uncontrolled in most countries and no therapies are currently available. Various drugs are under investigation for its treatment. The disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease. Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise. Conduction disorders, heart failure, and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs. It is important to have knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for COVID-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed on Jan 24, 2021, using the following search terms [(randomised OR trial) AND (azithromycin OR macrolide) AND (COVID* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV)], with no language restrictions, and identified 243 results. Adding a filter for clinical trials limited the number of results to 16. Of these, we identified two randomised clinical trials with over 100 participants that provided some data on the effectiveness of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with control treatment or usual care. Additional searches of medRxiv and Google Scholar on Jan 24, 2021, using similar search terms with no language restrictions, identified a further randomised clinical trial of azithromycin. All identified trials were in hospitalised patients. A large randomised trial among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK found no difference in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay or treatment in hospital, or intensive care unit admissions among 2582 participants randomly assigned to receive azithromycin versus 5181 participants randomly assigned to receive usual care alone. A randomised trial in Brazil among 675 patients admitted to hospital with mild to moderate COVID-19 found no difference in clinical status by 15 days among patients randomly assigned to receive usual care plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine versus usual care plus hydroxychloroquine, versus usual care alone. A trial by the same group, among 447 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19, found that patients randomly assigned to azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, had poorer clinical status at 15 days, although outcomes were more similar between the two groups by 29 days. We identified no randomised clinical trials of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 in the community.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: a systematic survey [^115uEoeh]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Certainty of evidence for recommendations pertaining to all antibiotics was generally very low (n = 11), followed by low (n = 4) or moderate (n = 3). Recommendation strength for those pertaining to all antibiotics was split between strong (n = 14) and conditional (n = 12). However for recommendations pertaining to azithromycin certainty of evidence ranged from high (n = 3), moderate (n = 4), low (n = 3), to very low (n = 3). The strength of recommendation was higher for azithromycin than those focusing on general antibiotic prescribing, with 9 recommendations considered strong and 3 recommendations conditional.

Similar to AGREE II score, there was a wide range in AGREE-REX score between guidelines across items, domains, and overall. Based on the overall AGREE-REX score, most guidelines recommendations were deemed moderate quality (n = 19, 70%), followed by high quality (n = 7, 26%), whereas only one guideline met the criteria for classification as low quality recommendations (n = 1, 4%) Supplementary Table S2.

Guideline incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship concepts

Of the 28 guidelines, twenty (71%) incorporated at least one antimicrobial stewardship concept. Ten (36%) contained explicit statements regarding judicious antibiotic use (i.e. regarding the need for appropriate, careful prescribing, or explicitly mentioning antimicrobial stewardship). Twelve (43%) incorporated explicit statements on antimicrobial resistance as a potential outcome (e.g. indiscriminate of antibiotics drive selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance). Fifteen (54%) mentioned other harms of antibiotics as part of the guideline (e.g. adverse effects, C. difficile infection). Four (14%) guidelines incorporated all three concepts, explicitly mentioning antimicrobial stewardship, antimicrobial resistance, and other antimicrobial-associated harms (Panel 1 for examples).

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^1174CLUN]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Azithromycin, an antibiotic with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has been used to treat COVID-19, but evidence from community randomised trials is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications.

Methods

In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone. The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580.

Findings

The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. 402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days. We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0.95 to 1.23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0.94 days (95% BCI -0.56 to 2.43). The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1.5 days in time to recovery was 0.23. 16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0.3%, 95% BCI -1.7 to 2.2). There were no deaths in either study group. Safety outcomes were similar in both groups. Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19.

Interpretation

Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.

### Azithromycin in viral infections [^112Nrbca]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin (AZM) is a synthetic macrolide antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacterial and mycobacterial infections. Due to an additional range of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, it has been given to patients with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is now being investigated as a potential candidate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 having been identified as a candidate therapeutic for this virus by both in vitro and in silico drug screens. To date there are no randomised trial data on its use in any novel coronavirus infection, although a large number of trials are currently in progress. In this review, we summarise data from in vitro, murine and human clinical studies on the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of macrolides, particularly AZM. AZM reduces in vitro replication of several classes of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza A, Zika virus, Ebola, enteroviruses and coronaviruses, via several mechanisms. AZM enhances expression of anti-viral pattern recognition receptors and induction of anti-viral type I and III interferon responses. Of relevance to severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by an over-exuberant innate inflammatory response, AZM also has anti-inflammatory properties including suppression of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF and GM-CSF. AZM inhibits T cells by inhibiting calcineurin signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin activity and NFκB activation. AZM particularly targets granulocytes where it concentrates markedly in lysosomes, particularly affecting accumulation, adhesion, degranulation and apoptosis of neutrophils. Given its proven safety, affordability and global availability, tempered by significant concerns about antimicrobial stewardship, there is an urgent mandate to perform well-designed and conducted randomised clinical trials.
