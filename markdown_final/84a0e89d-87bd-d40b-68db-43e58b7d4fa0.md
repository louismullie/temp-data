## Question

How long to stay off of aspirin with hemoperitoneum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to stay off aspirin after hemoperitoneum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of aspirin and platelet recovery. Then, I should verify the clinical context of hemoperitoneum and whether it changes the usual perioperative rules. Next, I will review high-quality guidelines for aspirin interruption and resumption in bleeding patients. After that, I need to weigh thrombotic risk from withdrawal against rebleeding risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm any exceptions or caveats that could modify timing in real-world scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and platelet kinetics. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1, so new platelets are required to restore aggregation; platelets regenerate at roughly 10% per day, and functional recovery typically takes about 5 to 7 days after the last dose, with some studies showing normalization by 4 to 6 days, which is why many guidelines default to a 5 to 7 day interruption window in high-bleeding-risk settings [^247870bc] [^76c71650].

> Now, I need to check the clinical context. Hemoperitoneum is a major intra-abdominal hemorrhage, often from solid organ rupture or vascular injury, and it carries high bleeding risk; this aligns with the highest-risk noncardiac surgical scenarios where aspirin interruption is prioritized to mitigate ongoing or recurrent bleeding, even though the evidence base is largely extrapolated from perioperative and gastrointestinal bleeding literature rather than hemoperitoneum-specific trials [^997bc42b] [^7d5c4922].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance for interruption. The ESAIC 2023 perioperative bleeding guideline recommends discontinuing aspirin 3 days before procedures with moderate bleeding risk and extending to 5 days for high-risk procedures; given hemoperitoneum's severity, a 5-day hold is appropriate, and in practice many clinicians extend to 7 days to ensure full platelet recovery, especially if there was massive transfusion or ongoing coagulopathy [^7d5c4922] [^76c71650].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about resumption. I should confirm when to restart. For patients on aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, multiple high-quality guidelines advise resuming as soon as hemostasis is secured, often within 24 hours, because the thrombotic risk of withdrawal rises quickly and can exceed bleeding risk; this applies across perioperative and gastrointestinal bleeding contexts and is extrapolated to major intra-abdominal hemorrhage when hemostasis is reliable [^a6570540] [^17754e7d] [^eb8689a7].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit balance. Aspirin withdrawal increases major adverse cardiovascular events, with meta-analytic data showing a roughly threefold increase in major cardiac events when aspirin is stopped in secondary prevention, and even higher risk in patients with coronary stents; conversely, early resumption after hemostasis increases rebleeding risk modestly but reduces mortality, which supports timely resumption once bleeding is controlled [^34f2a883] [^033985ad].

> But wait, what if the indication for aspirin is primary prevention rather than secondary prevention. I should double-check that nuance. In primary prevention, the ischemic benefit of aspirin is smaller, so the threshold to interrupt and the threshold to resume are lower; guidelines suggest discontinuing aspirin in primary prevention after a major bleed and often not resuming it unless the cardiovascular risk profile is high, which can justify a longer hold or even permanent cessation in some cases [^625a3185] [^34f2a883].

> Let me consider special scenarios that could modify timing. If the patient has recent coronary stents, particularly within 6 to 12 weeks, the thrombotic risk of stopping aspirin is extreme, so aspirin should generally be continued or resumed within 24 hours once hemostasis is secure, ideally with cardiology input; conversely, if there is ongoing bleeding, unstable hemodynamics, or uncorrected coagulopathy, I should extend the interruption beyond 5 to 7 days until the bleeding phenotype is definitively controlled [^18161933] [^d5e86b63].

> I should confirm practical steps. Before restarting, I need to ensure hemodynamic stability, adequate hemoglobin recovery, no active oozing on imaging or clinical exam, and consideration of gastroprotection if the bleed was gastrointestinal in origin; if uncertainty remains, a short additional delay of 1 to 2 days is reasonable, but prolonged cessation beyond 7 to 10 days should be avoided in secondary prevention unless the bleeding risk remains unacceptably high [^17754e7d] [^eb8689a7].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is as follows: for hemoperitoneum, hold aspirin for 5 to 7 days to allow platelet function recovery, then resume within 24 hours of confirmed hemostasis if the indication is secondary cardiovascular prevention; if the indication is primary prevention, consider not resuming or delaying resumption and reassess cardiovascular risk; if there are recent coronary stents or very high thrombotic risk, prioritize earlier resumption with multidisciplinary agreement, and if there is ongoing bleeding or coagulopathy, extend the interruption until hemostasis is secure [^7d5c4922] [^a6570540] [^17754e7d] [^625a3185].

Hold aspirin for **5–7 days** after hemoperitoneum to allow platelet function to recover [^76c71650] and reduce rebleeding risk [^notfound]. Resume aspirin **within 24 hours of confirmed hemostasis** if there is a strong cardiovascular indication, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks [^a6570540] [^17754e7d]. For primary prevention, consider stopping aspirin indefinitely; for secondary prevention, prioritize early resumption with close monitoring [^625a3185] [^34f2a883].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for aspirin interruption

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), suppressing thromboxane A2 and impairing aggregation for the platelet lifespan (~7–10 days) [^247870bc]. New platelets restore function over 5–7 days, so **holding aspirin for 5–7 days** allows near-normal aggregation before procedures or during active bleeding [^76c71650].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for aspirin interruption

Although direct data for hemoperitoneum are limited, perioperative and GI bleeding guidance supports a **5–7 day interruption** for high-bleeding-risk scenarios:

- **ESAIC 2023**: stop aspirin 3 days before moderate-risk procedures; 5 days before high-risk procedures [^7d5c4922].
- **ACCP 2022**: stop aspirin ≤ 7 days before elective surgery when interruption is needed [^79af3b8d].
- **GI bleeding guidance**: hold aspirin 3–5 days after hemostasis, then resume if indicated [^5ac196d6].

---

## Risks associated with aspirin interruption

Interrupting aspirin increases **thrombotic risk**, especially in secondary prevention [^34f2a883]. Meta-analyses show a threefold rise in major adverse cardiovascular events when aspirin is stopped, with an 89-fold increase in stent thrombosis [^34f2a883]. Thus, decisions must weigh bleeding against thrombosis [^4215f829].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of aspirin interruption** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemoperitoneum without active bleeding | 5–7 days | Allow platelet recovery and reduce rebleeding risk [^76c71650] |
| Hemoperitoneum with active bleeding | Hold until hemostasis confirmed | Prevent ongoing bleeding [^notfound] |
| Secondary cardiovascular prevention (e.g. CAD, stroke) | Resume within 24 hours after confirmed hemostasis | Minimize thrombotic risk [^a6570540] [^17754e7d] |
| Primary cardiovascular prevention | Consider indefinite cessation | Bleeding risk likely outweighs benefit [^625a3185] [^34f2a883] |

---

## Factors influencing decision-making

Several factors influence the **duration of interruption**:

- **Bleeding severity**: More severe bleeds may require longer interruption.
- **Hemostasis confirmation**: Resume only after confirmed hemostasis [^17754e7d].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk favors earlier resumption [^34f2a883].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications matter [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During interruption, monitor for **rebleeding** and **thrombotic events**. Check hemoglobin, vital signs, and clinical status regularly, and resume aspirin promptly once hemostasis is secure and bleeding risk is acceptable [^a6570540].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard interruption**: 5–7 days after hemoperitoneum to restore platelet function [^76c71650].
- **Active bleeding**: Hold until hemostasis is confirmed.
- **Secondary prevention**: Resume within 24 hours after confirmed hemostasis [^a6570540] [^17754e7d].
- **Primary prevention**: Consider stopping indefinitely [^625a3185] [^34f2a883].
- **Individualize**: Base decisions on bleeding severity, hemostasis, and cardiovascular risk [^4215f829].

---

Hold aspirin for **5–7 days** after hemoperitoneum, then resume within 24 hours of confirmed hemostasis if there is a strong cardiovascular indication, with individualized decisions for primary prevention or ongoing bleeding.

### Perioperative aspirin management after POISE-2: some answers, but questions remain [^c523dfc2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Aspirin constitutes important uninterrupted lifelong therapy for many patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease or significant (CV) risk factors. However, whether aspirin should be continued or withheld in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is a common clinical conundrum that balances the potential of aspirin for decreasing thrombotic risk with its possibility for increasing perioperative blood loss. In this focused review, we describe the role of aspirin in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease, summarize the most important literature on the perioperative use of aspirin (including the recently published PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation [POISE]-2 trial), and offer current recommendations for managing aspirin during the perioperative period. POISE-2 suggests that aspirin administration during the perioperative period does not change the risk of a cardiovascular event and may result in increased bleeding. However, these findings are tempered by a number of methodological issues related to the study. On the basis of currently available literature, including POISE-2, aspirin should not be administered to patients undergoing surgery unless there is a definitive guideline-based primary or secondary prevention indication. Aside from closed-space procedures, intramedullary spine surgery, or possibly prostate surgery, moderate-risk patients taking lifelong aspirin for a guideline-based primary or secondary indication may warrant continuation of their aspirin throughout the perioperative period.

### Reintroduction of anti-thrombotic therapy after a gastrointestinal haemorrhage: if and when? [^5ac196d6]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is a common clinical scenario and, in those using antithrombotic agents, the risk is significantly increased. Management of these patients, in terms of initial resuscitation is well established and numerous guidelines exist in this area. However, few studies have addressed the subsequent dilemma of if and when antithrombotic agents should be reintroduced. Consequently, practice is variable and not necessarily evidenced-based. Overall, for patients that are either anticoagulated or using antiplatelet drugs for secondary prophylaxis, there is a clear benefit to restarting these agents. However, there is limited data to guide when this should occur. For individuals at low risk of re-bleeding, current guidelines suggest single agent aspirin can be continued without interruption, assuming haemostatic control has been confirmed endoscopically. For those at higher bleeding risk, aspirin should be withheld, but reintroduced early (within 3 days of index endoscopy). However, randomised evidence is lacking, as are studies including more modern agents or combined anticoagulant/ antiplatelet regimens. As such, guidance statements are limited and management suggestions must be extrapolated from clinical trials, retrospective studies and data relating specifically to warfarin and aspirin. The intention of this review is to summarise what evidence is available and, where this is lacking, suggest pragmatic management options based on a risk-benefit assessment of thromboembolism and recurrent bleeding.

Platelet inhibitors: (including Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Dipyridamole, Ticagrelor)

Patients taking antiplatelet medications may be considered for platelet transfusion if warranted given the risk of bleeding from the planned operation. There is some evidence that transfused platelets may partially reverse the effects of these medications. If a patient is taking only aspirin at the time of surgery, many surgeons elect to proceed without reversal. Patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy are likely at higher risk of bleeding complications and transfusion. P2Y12 and aspirin response assays are available in some hospitals to assess the impairment of platelet function by these drugs. If the risk of surgical delay is high, a reasonable approach may be to proceed to surgery and transfuse platelets if excess bleeding is encountered. For patients with recent coronary artery stenting, given the risk of adverse cardiac events consultation and co-management of antiplatelet therapy with a cardiologist is recommended.

Recommendation:
Consider platelet transfusion in patients taking antiplatelet therapy when the planned procedural bleeding risk is high. In patients with a strong indication for antiplatelets, specialty consultation should be obtained for perioperative co-management of these medications.

Level of evidence: Low.
Recommendation grade: Weak.

7. Assessment of venous thromboembolism risk

Compared with elective surgical patients undergoing a comparable intra-abdominal procedure, emergency patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients should be assessed for risk with a validated tool at admission, and VTE prophylaxis (mechanical and/or pharmacologic) should be initiated as soon as possible even if surgery is planned. If pharmaceutical prophylaxis is not an option, mechanical prophylaxis should be used. The patient should be reassessed at regular intervals pre and postoperatively.

Recommendation:
Patients should be risk assessed with a validated tool for VTE risk on admission. If pharmaceutical prophylaxis is not possible mechanical prophylaxis should be used. Reassessment should occur daily postoperatively.

Level of evidence: Strong (extrapolated from studies in elective major abdominal surgery).
Recommendation grade: Strong.

Management of antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period

Inadequate data are available to establish firm recommendations regarding cessation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy in the elective or urgent perioperative setting. The risks of bleeding and outcomes from bleeding must be weighed against the thrombotic risks and substantial associated mortality. Studies of bleeding risk have provided conflicting information. One randomized study involving only 52 patients receiving ASA did not find a significant difference in the incidence of perioperative hemorrhage in patients undergoing cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, or inguinal hernia repair. Patients in this study were randomized to stop aspirin for 5 days before and after operation versus continuing aspirin throughout the perioperative period. A number of retrospective and prospective cohort studies have examined the risk of bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy with disparate results. A recent systematic review found no difference in the incidence of bleeding in gastrointestinal surgery when all studies were considered. Of the various studies performed, only one involved pancreatectomy, five involved cholecystectomy, and eight involved endoscopic polypectomy. The largest study involving general surgery patients included 1075 patients and similarly did not find a significant difference in the probability of bleeding related to ongoing use of single antiplatelet agents following various laparoscopic operations. However, use of dual antiplatelet agents was associated with a higher rate of hemorrhage in multivariable analysis. In total, there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation regarding perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy. Clinical discretion is needed to weigh the risk of bleeding versus the risk of thrombosis.

This paper describes a case of spontaneous rupture of the spleen that was misdiagnosed as pulmonary embolism. Because of a lack of history of trauma, rarity of occurrence, and confusing clinical presentations, an unwary clinician may fail to diagnose this condition in time. It may result in erroneous treatment of a condition, which is potentially curable.

### Should more patients continue aspirin therapy perioperatively? clinical impact of aspirin withdrawal syndrome [^1e75f7a4]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based focused review of aspirin use in the perioperative period along with an in-depth discussion of the considerations and risks associated with its preoperative withdrawal.

Background

For patients with established cardiovascular disease, taking aspirin is considered a critical therapy. The cessation of aspirin can cause a platelet rebound phenomenon and prothrombotic state leading to major adverse cardiovascular events. Despite the risks of aspirin withdrawal, which are exacerbated during the perioperative period, standard practice has been to stop aspirin before elective surgery for fear of excessive bleeding. Mounting evidence suggests that this practice should be abandoned.

Methods

We performed a PubMed and Medline literature search using the keywords aspirin, withdrawal, and perioperative. We manually reviewed relevant citations for inclusion.

Results/Conclusions

Clinicians should employ a patient-specific strategy for perioperative aspirin management that weighs the risks of stopping aspirin with those associated with its continuation. Most patients, especially those taking aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, should have their aspirin continued throughout the perioperative period. When aspirin is held preoperatively, the aspirin withdrawal syndrome may significantly increase the risk of a major thromboembolic complication. For many operative procedures, the risk of perioperative bleeding while continuing aspirin is minimal, as compared with the concomitant thromboembolic risks associated with aspirin withdrawal. Those cases where aspirin should be stopped include patients undergoing intracranial, middle ear, posterior eye, intramedullary spine, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy surgery.

### Aspirin: questions and answers… [^90074b9e]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

What are the different uses for aspirin. Strokes: Aspirin use recommended in both men and women to treat mini-strokes or ischemic stroke to prevent subsequent cardiovascular events or death. Heart Attacks: Aspirin:

- reduces the risk of death in patients with suspected acute heart attacks
- prevents recurrent heart attacks and
- reduces the risk of heart attacks or sudden death in patients with unstable and chronic stable angina pectoris. Other coronary conditions: Aspirin can be used to treat patients who have had certain revascularization procedures such as angioplasty, and coronary bypass operations — if they have a vascular condition for which aspirin is already indicated.

Rheumatologic diseases: Aspirin is indicated for relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondylarthropathies, and arthritis and pleurisy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Pain relief: Aspirin is indicated for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains. What should consumers who are taking low dose aspirin for disease maintenance or prevention know about alcohol use. Patients who consume 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. Can consumers safely use aspirin to treat suspected acute heart attacks. If consumers suspect they are having a heart attack, their most important action must be to seek emergency medical care immediately. The advise and supervision of a doctor should direct this use of aspirin and patients are encouraged to speak with their doctor about this use.

What do we know about how aspirin works for heart conditions and stroke. The mechanism by which aspirin works in the treatment of heart attack and stroke is not completely understood. However, as an antiplatelet drug, we do know that aspirin help reduce platelet clumping which helps cause blockage in blood vessels. What other side effects are associated with aspirin. There is a wide range of adverse reactions that may result from aspirin use including effects on the body as a whole, or on specific body systems and functions. High doses can cause hearing loss or tinnitus — ringing in the ears.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^4465becc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely.

Objectives

To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy, for at least two weeks, and were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthetic or sedation in which bleeding that required transfusion or additional surgery was unlikely. We included studies which compared perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or versus substitution of antiplatelet therapy with a placebo for at least five days before surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Our primary outcomes were: all-cause mortality at longest follow-up (up to six months); all-cause mortality (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included: blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products; blood loss requiring further surgical intervention; risk of ischaemic events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with 666 randomized adults. We identified three ongoing studies. All study participants were scheduled for elective general surgery (including abdominal, urological, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery) under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. Studies compared continuation of single or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) with discontinuation of therapy for at least five days before surgery. Three studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and two reported methods to conceal allocation. Three studies were placebo-controlled trials and were at low risk of performance bias, and three studies reported adequate methods to blind outcome assessors to group allocation. Attrition was limited in four studies and two studies had reported prospective registration with clinical trial registers and were at low risk of selective outcome reporting bias. We reported mortality at two time points: the longest follow-up reported by study authors up to six months, and time point reported by study authors up to 30 days. Five studies reported mortality up to six months (of which four studies had a longest follow-up at 30 days, and one study at 90 days) and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 4.27; 659 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from eight fewer to 40 more). Combining the four studies with a longest follow-up at 30 days alone showed the same effect estimate, and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.27; 616 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from nine fewer to 42 more). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring transfusion (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.26; 368 participants; absolute effect of 42 more participants per 1000 requiring transfusion in the continuation group, ranging from 19 fewer to 119 more; four studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring additional surgery (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.58; 368 participants; absolute effect of six more participants per 1000 requiring additional surgery in the continuation group, ranging from seven fewer to 71 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to incidences of ischaemic events (to include peripheral ischaemia, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction) within 30 days of surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.77; 616 participants; absolute effect of 17 fewer participants per 1000 with an ischaemic event in the continuation group, ranging from 39 fewer to 40 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade evidence for all outcomes owing to limited evidence from few studies. We noted a wide confidence in effect estimates for mortality at the end of follow-up and at 30 days, and for blood loss requiring transfusion which suggested imprecision. We noted visual differences in study results for ischaemic events which suggested inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery may make little or no difference to mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischaemic events. We found moderate-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery probably makes little or no difference to bleeding requiring transfusion. Evidence was limited to few studies with few participants, and with few events. The three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed.

Aspirin (ASA) management for elective non-cardiac surgery — In patients receiving ASA who are undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery, we suggest ASA continuation over ASA interruption; for patients who require interruption, we suggest stopping ASA ≤ 7 days instead of 7 to 10 days before the surgery, and guideline implementation considerations state this guidance may be modified on a case-by-case basis and that, in select high-bleed-risk non-cardiac surgeries (eg, intracranial, spinal), if ASA interruption is adopted, we suggest interruption for ≤ 7 days.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^c6c0769a]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include: a history of co-morbidities and medications that promote bleeding; hemodynamic parameters; physical examination (including digital rectal examination); and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid, but should not replace, clinician judgment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that, in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7-9g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends that, in patients with major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy should be performed sometime during their hospital stay because there is no high quality evidence that early colonoscopy influences patient outcomes. Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence. 6: ESGE recommends that patients with hemodynamic instability and suspected ongoing bleeding undergo computed tomography angiography before endoscopic or radiologic treatment to locate the site of bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends withholding vitamin K antagonists in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding and correcting their coagulopathy according to the severity of bleeding and their thrombotic risk. In patients with hemodynamic instability, we recommend administering intravenous vitamin K and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma if PCC is not available. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends temporarily withholding direct oral anticoagulants at presentation in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9: ESGE does not recommend withholding aspirin in patients taking low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. If withheld, low dose aspirin should be resumed, preferably within 5 days or even earlier if hemostasis is achieved or there is no further evidence of bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 10: ESGE does not recommend routinely discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy (low dose aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist) before cardiology consultation. Continuation of the aspirin is recommended, whereas the P2Y12 receptor antagonist can be continued or temporarily interrupted according to the severity of bleeding and the ischemic risk. If interrupted, the P2Y12 receptor antagonist should be restarted within 5 days, if still indicated. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^b0670789]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Bleeding time and platelet function tests for preoperative risk stratification are not supported for routine use, as multiple studies indicate that routine preoperative measurement of bleeding time is not useful in predicting hemorrhage; newer techniques to assess platelet function have not been validated for perioperative bleeding risk, results have been contradictory regarding clinical endpoints such as bleeding, and it is unclear whether these tests are clinically useful in patients with renal failure or in those receiving aspirin or other antiplatelet agents.

### Antithrombotic drugs have a minimal effect on intraoperative blood loss during emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis: a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Japan [^3814d03e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We previously reported no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss after adjustment for confounding factors by propensity score matching in patients taking AT drugs undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgery in a single institution. In this study with a nationwide large-scale cohort, we focused on patients with generalized peritonitis, which needed surgical intervention immediately and was frequently accompanied by septic shock and coagulopathy. While this study shows a statistically significant increase in blood loss in patients taking AT drugs, the difference is minimal and the impact of intake of AT drugs on blood loss was lower compared with other factors. Other outcomes related to the use of AT drugs such as major intraoperative bleeding or the need for transfusion were also related with only a slight increase. These results suggest that AT drugs have a minimal effect on intraoperative blood loss in patients undergoing emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis after adjusting for confounding factors and are likely of minimal clinical significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate safety for patients taking AT drugs with regard to perioperative bleeding and thrombotic complications, who undergo emergency gastrointestinal surgery for generalized peritonitis.

There is a wide range of opinions about the perioperative use of AT drugs. The American College of Surgeons' guideline recommends cessation of aspirin for 7 to 10 days before procedures with a high risk for bleeding such as gastrointestinal surgery, while the Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines recommends continuation of aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The difference in the guidelines is at least partially due to the low quality of available evidence. The incidence of difficulty obtaining intraoperative hemostasis is rarely mentioned in existing studies. The present study results shows that AT drugs were not related to difficult intraoperative hemostasis during emergency surgery for generalized peritonitis because the increase in intraoperative blood loss and rate of blood transfusions was not clinically significant although it was statistically significant. Due to study design in patients undergoing emergency surgery, a randomized controlled study cannot be carried out. The results of this nationwide study have important implications for the clinical management of patients taking AT drugs who undergo emergency gastrointestinal surgery.

### Life threatening retroperitoneal haemorrhage due to therapeutic fondaparinux [^dfca4c84]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a patient with pulmonary embolism, treated with fondaparinux as bridging therapy until therapeutic levels were achieved on warfarin, who developed a non-traumatic massive retroperitoneal haematoma requiring substantial resuscitation with blood products and arterial embolisation. To our knowledge, this condition has not been reported with therapeutic doses of fondaparinux. Our patient, however, may have been more predisposed to bleeding due to the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux secondary to his morbid obesity, reduced clearance of the drug due to renal insufficiency and concomitant treatment with low dose aspirin and warfarin. Another consideration was the lack of a specific reversing agent for fondaparinux in the setting of a life threatening haemorrhage.

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^6b573978]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. Continuation of these agents, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be a particular challenge in the emergency setting.

Methods

A literature review of published articles sourced using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin and surgery was undertaken. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

Results and Conclusion

Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^44740c1a]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents — evidence and consensus indicate that one nonrandomized comparative observational study is equivocal regarding discontinuing warfarin and replacing it with low-molecular-weight heparin on transfusion requirements (Category B1-E evidence). Observational studies report blood loss volumes ranging from 265 to 756 mL and transfusion requirements ranging from a mean of 0.08 to 0.5 units when clopidogrel is discontinued preoperatively (Category B3 evidence). The literature is insufficient to evaluate discontinuing aspirin before surgery, with two RCTs versus placebo reporting equivocal findings (P > 0.01) for perioperative blood loss, transfusion, or postoperative adverse events (Category A2-E evidence). Survey findings state both consultants and ASA members strongly agree regarding discontinuing anticoagulation therapy for elective surgery in consultation with a specialist, if clinically possible discontinuing nonsurgical antiplatelet agents sufficiently in advance except in patients with prior percutaneous coronary interventions, and considering thrombosis versus increased bleeding risk when altering anticoagulation status.

### Safety of perioperative aspirin therapy in minimally invasive endometrial cancer staging [^8bdfd6fa]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To investigate if low-dose aspirin influences the risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications during minimally invasive surgical staging for endometrial cancer.

Design

Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2.)

Setting

University teaching hospital.

Patients

Three hundred seventeen endometrial cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic staging.

Interventions

Laparoscopic surgical staging included total laparoscopic hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ± retroperitoneal staging.

Measurement and Main Results

Forty-three (14%) low-dose aspirin users were compared with 274 (86%) nonaspirin users. Aspirin-treated patients were older than patients in the control group (71 [range, 50–85] vs. 64 [range, 27–92] years old, p < .001). No between-group differences in intraoperative bleeding (p = .32), hemoglobin drop (p = .91), transfusions (p = .09), and hemorrhagic complications rate (p = .58) were recorded. Aspirin users had a lower lymphadenectomy rate in comparison with patients in the control group (p = .001). However, according to a subanalysis of patients undergoing retroperitoneal staging (20 aspirin users vs. 200 patients in the control group), no differences in bleeding (p = .53), hemorrhagic complications (p = 1.0), or transfusion rate (p = .25) were observed.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin does not influence the risk of bleeding and hemorrhagic complications in endometrial cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive staging. Hence, the choice to continue or cease the use of low-dose aspirin should be guided only by perioperative cardiovascular risk stratification.

### Duration of increased bleeding tendency after cessation of aspirin therapy [^76c71650]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin has a significant effect on hemostasis, so it is often recommended that patients taking aspirin discontinue treatment before elective surgery. While off aspirin, these patients may be at risk of thrombosis. The optimum period of time that aspirin should be withheld is controversial. The aim of this study was to establish the duration of the antihemostatic effect of prolonged aspirin therapy.

Study Design

In a prospective study, 51 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned into 3 groups, each receiving an identical tablet for 14 days. One group received a placebo tablet; individuals in the other two groups received either 75 mg or 300 mg of aspirin once a day. Template bleeding times and specific platelet function testing (using the PFA-100; Dade Behring) were carried out on subjects before therapy and again after its completion until they returned to baseline.

Results

Thirty-eight volunteers complied sufficiently with the protocol to provide useful results. All bleeding times normalized within 96 hours and all platelet function tests within 144 hours after stopping aspirin. There was no demonstrable hemostatic defect in any volunteer persisting by or beyond the sixth day after treatment cessation. There was no apparent difference in duration of effect between those taking either 75 mg or 300 mg of aspirin.

Conclusions

This study uses sensitive measures of platelet function to demonstrate the duration of increased bleeding tendency after withdrawal of aspirin therapy. It supports discontinuation of aspirin therapy 5 days before elective surgery (with the operation being performed on the sixth day).

### Radical prostatectomy with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy under low-dose aspirin does not significantly increase blood loss [^0f0a0fdd]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether maintaining use of low-dose aspirin confers a higher risk of bleeding events in patients undergoing laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. There is no consensus on maintaining or withdrawing aspirin in these patients.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between January 2009 and December 2010 were included in a prospective cohort study. Among them, 54 aspirin-treated patients were compared with 569 non-aspirin-treated patients. We evaluated the between-group difference in bleeding event: intraoperative blood loss ≥ 700 mL and/or need for transfusion and/or postoperative hemorrhagic complication (symptomatic abdominal wall hematomas, major bleeding requiring reoperation). Differences in each component of the bleeding event, in hemoglobin level changes, and hospital stay length were also evaluated. Patients' data were compared using the χ(2) or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Student t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.

Results

A bleeding event occurred in 18 (33.3%) aspirin-treated patients and 176 (32.5%) non-aspirin-treated patients (P = 0.66). Median blood loss was similar in the 2 groups (aspirin: 450 ml, 50–7100 ml; no aspirin: 450 ml, 100–2800 ml; P = 0.93). Aspirin was not associated with a significant hemoglobin level variation (median decrease, 2.9 g/dL with aspirin and 3.2 g/dL without aspirin, P = 0.23). Median hospital length of stay, rates of blood transfusion, and postoperative hemorrhagic complications were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy can be performed safely without discontinuing aspirin, as this policy does not increase significantly blood loss, blood transfusion requirements, postoperative hemorrhagic complications. or hospital length of stay.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^17754e7d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

The panel weighed the important and well-documented cardiovascular benefit of secondary preventive ASA therapy and the potential risk of further GI bleeding with continued ASA therapy. The trend to reduced mortality in an observational study of patients with myocardial infarction with continued aspirin coupled to the significant reduction in mortality among patients with high-risk ulcer bleeding who had aspirin resumed immediately after endoscopic hemostasis were important considerations in the panel's decision to recommend continuation rather than an interruption of aspirin therapy. If ASA is discontinued at clinical presentation, we recommend rapid resumption within 24 hours of successful endoscopic hemostasis.

Increased further bleeding with continued ASA at presentation was not shown in the observational study, but results of the RCT did raise the possibility of increased rebleeding with early resumption of ASA in patients with high-risk ulcer bleeding. The panel also weighed the preferences of providers and patients for a cardiovascular event vs a GIB event, as discussed in Supplementary Digital Content (see Appendix 2,) in formulating their recommendation.

### Is preoperative withdrawal of aspirin necessary in patients undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair? [^e87e74e2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelets such as aspirin are widely used to reduce thrombotic events in patients with various cardiovascular comorbidities. Continuing aspirin through noncardiac surgery has been shown to reduce risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) but may lead to higher bleeding complications. Inguinal hernia repair is a commonly performed surgical procedure among such patients, but no guideline exists regarding perioperative use of aspirin.

Objective

We aim to investigate the safety profile of aspirin continuation in the perioperative period in patients undergoing elective primary inguinal hernia repair.

Methods

All patients who underwent elective primary inguinal hernia repair from 2008 to 2015 and were on aspirin preoperatively were identified. The patients were divided into two groups: those who continued aspirin through the morning of the operation and those who were advised to stop aspirin therapy 3–7 days prior to operation. All patients underwent either open Lichtenstein mesh repair or laparoscopic total extra-peritoneal mesh repair. Outcomes measured include intraoperative blood loss, operative time, bleeding complications, wound site complications and MACE.

Results

Among 1841 patients who underwent elective primary inguinal hernia mesh repair, 142 (7.7%) patients were on preoperative aspirin. Fifty-seven patients underwent laparoscopic repair, while 85 underwent open mesh repair. Twenty-seven out of fifty-seven (47.3%) from the laparoscopic group and 55/85 (64.7%) from the open group were instructed to stop aspirin (p = 0.040). There were no significant differences between those who stopped aspirin and those who continued in terms of intraoperative blood loss and operative timing. Immediate postoperative bleeding complications and follow-up wound complications were also similar between the two groups. Overall, there were no MACE among those who underwent laparoscopic repair. Three MACE were recorded in the open group (2 stopped vs. 1 continued; p = 0.943). There was no perioperative mortality.

Conclusion

Continuation of aspirin is safe and should be preferred in patients with higher cardiovascular risk.

### To continue or discontinue aspirin in the perioperative period: a randomized, controlled clinical trial [^030d9d36]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) are a common cause of death after non-cardiac surgery. Despite evidence for the benefit of aspirin for secondary prevention, it is often discontinued in the perioperative period due to the risk of bleeding.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in order to compare the effect of low-dose aspirin with that of placebo on myocardial damage, cardiovascular, and bleeding complications in high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Aspirin (75 mg) or placebo was given 7 days before surgery and continued until the third postoperative day. Patients were followed up for 30 days after surgery.

Results

A total of 220 patients were enrolled, 109 patients received aspirin and 111 received placebo. Four patients (3.7%) in the aspirin group and 10 patients (9.0%) in the placebo group had elevated troponin T levels in the postoperative period (P = 0.10). Twelve patients (5.4%) had an MACE during the first 30 postoperative days. Two of these patients (1.8%) were in the aspirin group and 10 patients (9.0%) were in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Treatment with aspirin resulted in a 7.2% absolute risk reduction [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3–13%] for postoperative MACE. The relative risk reduction was 80% (95% CI, 9.2–95%). Numbers needed to treat were 14 (95% CI, 7.6–78). No significant differences in bleeding complications were seen between the two groups.

Conclusions

In high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, perioperative aspirin reduced the risk of MACE without increasing bleeding complications. However, the study was not powered to evaluate bleeding complications.

### Contemporary approaches in the peri-endoscopic management of antithrombotic agents: current paradigms, challenges, and prognostications [^1ab97688]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Adherence to antithrombotic guidelines among patients undergoing elective endoscopy. The chart above presents the guideline compliance rates for various antithrombotic medications across different countries and years.

Paradoxically, emerging data document preventable thrombotic events from overly aggressive drug cessation. A retrospective cohort analysis identified two serious adverse outcomes: (1) ischemic stroke occurring 30 days post-elective surgery in a patient with long-term aspirin therapy discontinued during preoperative preparation; (2) recurrent venous thromboembolism in a DOAC user maintained off therapy for 12 weeks despite guideline-recommended 1-week interruption.

These findings highlight critical knowledge gaps in antithrombotic stewardship. Current literature remains inconclusive regarding subgroup-specific risks due to: (1) lack of dedicated risk stratification frameworks; (2) insufficient power in existing trials to detect rare thrombotic events; and (3) heterogeneity in defining "inappropriate" discontinuation across studies. Prospective multicenter registries with standardized outcome definitions and extended follow-up (⩾90 days post-procedure) are urgently required to: (a) quantify bleeding-thrombosis trade-offs in real-world practice; (b) establish evidence-based discontinuation thresholds; (c) develop predictive models for high-risk subpopulations.

### Recommencing aspirin following a peptic ulcer bleed: when is the time right? [^97aae957]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Opinion

It is well recognized that patients with significant comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, have an increased mortality when presenting with a GI bleed. Indeed, this has been recognized in widely used prognostic scoring systems such as Rockall and Blatchford.

The study by Sung et al demonstrated a significant increase in mortality when the patient on long-term aspirin had this withheld for 8 weeks following presentation with a peptic ulcer bleed, as is common practice. The difference between groups was striking (1.3% vs.12.9% at 8 weeks). Although the authors were unable to conclude that there was not an increased incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding in the group treated with aspirin, the majority of recurrent bleeds were within the first 5 days post-endoscopy and were not associated with increased hospital stay or blood transfusion requirements.

This study reminds us that the majority of deaths from peptic ulcer bleed are not as direct complications of the ulcers themselves. This has been found in other studies, but is a timely reminder to the gastroenterologist to be holistic in their approach to patients with ulcer bleeds and pay particular attention to the chest (for sepsis or fluid overload), heart and renal function. We would suggest that elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities should have a more prolonged hospital stay with close monitoring of these organ systems. We generally discharge this group of patients after 5–7 days inpatient stay.

Following the publication of the Sung paper, and on consideration of its findings, our clinical practice has changed. In patients requiring aspirin for secondary prophylaxis of significant cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease we would consider restarting aspirin at 3 days post endoscopy (i.e. once IV PPI infusion has stopped) and then monitor patients for at least a further 48 hours prior to discharge. In these cases we have a low threshold for repeat endoscopy prior to discharge in order to assess ulcer healing. We also recommend vigilance regarding Helicobacter pylori diagnosis, eradication and confirmation of eradication with a subsequent breath test six weeks to three months later in patients who require lifelong aspirin therapy. In such patients on aspirin, PPIs should also be co-prescribed long term.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

Although interruption of a P2Y 12 inhibitor should decrease a patient's risk of bleeding, the available evidence reported a nonsignificant increased bleeding risk in patients who stop a P2Y 12 inhibitor for an elective endoscopic procedure compared with those who continue the medication. This result is biologically implausible and, coupled to the very large confidence intervals, speaks to the very low certainty of evidence. Ultimately, the panel was unable to make a recommendation.

15. For patients on ASA 81–325 mg/d (monotherapy) for secondary cardiovascular prevention, we suggest against interruption of ASA (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Association of aspirin use with major bleeding in patients with and without diabetes… [^899fb033]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

A meta-analysis based on individual patient data demonstrated that the benefits of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease are modest. 3 Any benefit of low-dose aspirin might be offset by the risk of major bleeding. 4 It is known that aspirin is associated with gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhagic complications. 5 However, randomized controlled trials have shown that these risks are relatively small. 3, 6. Patients had to be at least 30 years old on the index date with no prescription for aspirin in the past year. Current low-dose aspirin users were defined as those who had the last prescription of aspirin at least 75 days before hospitalization for major bleeding events or the end of follow-up; this allowed for a tolerance of 15 days between prescriptions, each covering a period of 60 days of treatment.

All those individuals who did not receive aspirin throughout the study period were considered controls, and were assigned an index date corresponding to the same year of the cases. The outcomes of interest were hospitalization for major gastrointestinal bleeding or cerebral hemorrhage occurring after the initiation of antiplatelet therapy. All patients were followed up from their index date to the earliest hospitalization for gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhages, death, or the end of the study period, providing a maximum follow-up of 6 years. The overall IR of total hemorrhagic events was 5. 58 per 1000 person-years for those with aspirin use and
3. 60 per 1000 person-years for those without aspirin use.

This study provides information for the evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of aspirin use in a real-world setting. Our study demonstrated that the incidence of major bleeding events is much higher than that recorded in randomized, prospective clinical trials. Data from the meta-analysis by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration3 reported an IR of major gastrointestinal and other extracranial bleeding of 0. 10% per year in patients treated with aspirin and
0. 07% in those not treated with aspirin in a population with a comparable age range.

### Aspirin, acetaminophen, and bleeding… [^b762ef62]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The relationship between aspirin and increased bleeding in hemophiliacs was described many years ago. 1 This was later found to be secondary to interference with platelet function. It has since become apparent that many drugs other than aspirin, including antihistamines, thorazine derivatives, and probably guaifenesin, interfere with platelet function. 2 As such, these compounds render anyone with a bleeding diathesis more likely to have problems with hemostasis. Although the safest measure from the standpoint of bleeding is to avoid all such medication in patients with bleeding problems, this often becomes impractical. For example, an antipyretic is frequently needed in the pediatric age group, where high fevers may predispose to febrile convulsions. Antihistamines and guaifenesin are contained in many "overthe-counter" remedies, and both of these, as well as thorazine derivatives, are commonly prescribed.

Therefore, suitable alternatives to such medications have been sought. Acetaminophen has been used with increasing frequency Czapek EE. Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Bleeding. JAMA. 1976;

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^7aaab3c7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Statement 13: In patients receiving dual antiplatelet agents, at least one antiplatelet agent should be resumed in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

(Accept — agreement: 94.4%, level of evidence: low)

The most commonly used antiplatelet agents are ASA (aspirin), a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor and thienopyridines that bind to P2Y12 component of the adenosine diphosphate receptors. After stopping ASA, 7–9 days are required to regain full platelet function, whereas in the case of thienopyridines (such as clopidogrel or prasugrel), the minimum duration to restore platelet function is 5–7 days. Use of dual antiplatelet agents, often ASA plus a thienopyridine, may confer a threefold increase in the risk of UGIB over single-agent antithrombotic therapy. There are no data guiding the management of these patients using dual antiplatelet therapy when they develop UGIB. We do not recommend withholding both antiplatelet drugs because the median time to coronary stent thrombosis can be as short as 7 days with both drugs withheld as compared with 122 days with only clopidogrel withheld. Balancing the risk and benefit of discontinuation of antiplatelet agents, the ASGE recommends that cessation of all antiplatelet therapy after PCI should be avoided, and furthermore, when only one antiplatelet agent is used, aspirin should be continued as it is associated with a lower risk for causing recurrent bleeding. On the other hand, for patients with a high risk of thrombosis, such as those with drug-eluting coronary stents, clopidogrel should not be discontinued for more than 5 days.

Cardiologists' opinion should be sought for the commencement of antiplatelet agents. In patients with low risk of recurrent bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, antiplatelet agents should not be discontinued at all. The working group consider that this statement is primarily based on pharmacological characteristics of the antiplatelet agents. Clinical trials to test the safety of this strategy are eagerly awaited. The level of evidence was considered low.

Statement 14: Among direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or warfarin users with high cardiothrombotic risk who develop ulcer bleeding, DOAC or warfarin should be resumed as soon as haemostasis is established

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and aspirin [^a3b61410]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Aspirin has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and prolonged bleeding time.

Hemorrhage

Aspirin may increase the likelihood of hemorrhage due to its effect on the gastric mucosa and platelet function (prolongation of bleeding time). Salicylates should be used with caution in the presence of peptic ulcer or coagulation abnormalities.

Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use

Hydrocodone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intra-abdominal surgery with use of opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented.

### Recommencing aspirin following a peptic ulcer bleed: when is the time right? [^0e2e4611]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The results demonstrated a recurrent bleed rate of 10.3% (95% CI 3.4–17.2) in the aspirin group compared with 5.4% (95% CI 0.3–10.5) in the placebo group (a difference of 4.9 percentage points (95% CI -3.6–13.4) at 30 days. The authors therefore concluded that continuing aspirin was not equal to stopping aspirin therapy in terms of the risk of a recurrent ulcer bleed.

Regarding the secondary endpoints of the study there was no significant difference in the amount of blood transfused or hospital stay between each arm of the study. However there was a significant difference in mortality between groups at 8 weeks: 1.3% in the aspirin group (1 patient died of congestive cardiac failure) vs. 12.9% in the placebo group (including 5 participants who died of vascular complications including myocardial infarction and stroke; 2 who died of perforated ulcer and 1 who died of uncontrolled bleeding); p = 0.005. The difference in mortality remained significant when deaths only due to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and gastrointestinal causes were included.

### A comprehensive update on aspirin management during noncardiac surgery [^4215f829]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is considered critical lifelong therapy for patients with established cardiovascular (CV) disease (including coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial diseases) and is consequently one of the most widely used medications worldwide. However, the indications for aspirin use continue to evolve and recent trials question its efficacy for primary prevention. Although one third of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and at risk for a major adverse CV event receive aspirin perioperatively, uncertainty still exists about how aspirin should be optimally managed in this context, and significant practice variability remains. Recent trials suggest that the risks of continuing aspirin during the perioperative period outweigh the benefits in many cases, but data on patients with high CV risk remain limited. We performed a comprehensive PubMed and Medline literature search using the following keywords: aspirin, aspirin withdrawal, perioperative, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and CV disease; we manually reviewed all relevant citations for inclusion. Patients taking aspirin for the primary prevention of CV disease should likely discontinue it during the perioperative period, especially when there is a high risk of bleeding. Patients with established CV disease but without a coronary stent should likely continue aspirin during the perioperative period unless undergoing closed-space surgery. Patients with a history of coronary stenting also likely need aspirin continuation throughout the perioperative period for nonclosed space procedures. Perioperative clinicians need to balance the risks of ceasing aspirin before surgery against its continuation during the perioperative interval using a patient-specific strategy. The guidance on decision-making with regard to perioperative aspirin cessation or continuation using currently available clinical data from studies in high-risk patients along with nonclinical aspirin studies is conflicting and does not enable a simplified or unified answer. However, pertinent guidelines on CV disease management provide a basic framework for aspirin management, and large trial findings provide some insight into the safety of perioperative aspirin cessation in some contexts, although uncertainty on perioperative aspirin still exists. This review provides an evidence-based update on perioperative aspirin management in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery with a focus on recommendations for perioperative clinicians on continuing versus holding aspirin during this context.

### Outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in patients continuing aspirin therapy [^1ea4b523]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

A clinical dilemma surrounds the use of aspirin therapy during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Despite reduced cardiac morbidity with perioperative aspirin use, fear of bleeding related complications often prompts discontinuation of therapy before surgery. We evaluate perioperative outcomes among patients continuing aspirin and those in whom treatment is stopped preoperatively.

Materials and Methods

A total of 430 consecutive cases of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy performed between January 2012 and October 2014 were reviewed. Patients on chronic aspirin therapy were stratified into on aspirin and off aspirin groups based on perioperative status of aspirin use. Primary end points evaluated included estimated intraoperative blood loss and incidence of bleeding related complications, major postoperative complications, and thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes included operative time, transfusion rate, length of hospital stay, rehospitalization rate and surgical margin status.

Results

Among 101 (23.4%) patients on chronic aspirin therapy, antiplatelet treatment was continued in 17 (16.8%). Bleeding developed in 1 patient in the on aspirin group postoperatively and required angioembolization. Conversely 1 myocardial infarction was observed in the off aspirin cohort. There was no significant difference in the incidence of major postoperative complications, intraoperative blood loss, transfusion rate, length of hospital stay and rehospitalization rate. Operative time was increased with continued aspirin use (181 vs 136 minutes, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is safe and effective in patients on chronic antiplatelet therapy who require perioperative aspirin for cardioprotection. Larger, prospective studies are necessary to discern the true cardiovascular benefit derived from continued aspirin therapy as well as better characterize associated bleeding risk.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7f847bcd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding management — hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed, and risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24 h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation, and endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by endoscopist experience, the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities, and repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia, and patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin (secondary prophylaxis) should generally resume aspirin as soon as possible after bleeding ceases and at least within 7 days. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — antiplatelet and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) management after diverticular hemorrhage: We recommend discontinuing nonaspirin NSAIDs after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest discontinuing aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage given the risks of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest continuing aspirin after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage for patients with an established history of cardiovascular disease given the benefits of reducing future ischemic events. (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We recommend that providers re-evaluate the risks vs benefits of continuing nonaspirin antiplatelets such as P2Y12 receptor antagonists in a multidisciplinary setting after hospitalization for diverticular hemorrhage given the demonstrated risks of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting data include that the use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of recurrent LGIB (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.3), platelet aggregation inhibitors were associated with a second diverticular hemorrhage (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15–1.88), and in a 295-patient cohort continuation of aspirin increased recurrent bleeding (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26–6.07) while being protective against serious cardiovascular events (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37–0.91) and death (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17–0.63).

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^247870bc]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Antiplatelet drug interruption and resumption — For aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, and prasugrel, which irreversibly inhibit platelet function, 7 to 10 days (ie, platelet life span) of interruption is needed to restore platelet function, whereas for ticagrelor, which reversibly inhibits platelet function, at least 2 to 3 days of interruption is needed. After surgery, maximal antiplatelet effect occurs within minutes after ASA, within 2 hours after ticagrelor, 4 to 5 days after resuming clopidogrel, and after 3 days after resuming prasugrel, with a clopidogrel loading dose producing effect between 2 and 6 hours. Less commonly used reversible inhibitors include cilostazol, dipyridamole, and pentoxifylline with half-lives of 2 to 10 hours, and vorapaxar has a prolonged, 3- to 15-day antiplatelet effect. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have reversible antiplatelet properties with half-lives from 2 to 6 hours and approximately 20 hours depending on the agent.

### Management of patients on antithrombotic agents undergoing emergency and elective endoscopy: joint Asian pacific association of gastroenterology (APAGE) and Asian pacific society for digestive endoscopy (APSDE) practice guidelines [^36f0aa95]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

While ASGE Practice Guidelines mention platelet transfusion as an option for patients on antiplatelet agents with life-threatening or serious bleeding, we do not recommend platelet transfusion as a treatment option because there is no good evidence to support this practice. In a retrospective cohort study of 204 patients receiving antiplatelet agents with GI bleeding, platelet transfusion did not reduce rebleeding but was associated with higher mortality. Although the increase in mortality could be due in part to residual bias associated with more severe bleeding in cases than controls, the lack of benefit of platelet transfusion does not support its use in patients with GI bleeding who are receiving antiplatelet agents.

The timing of resuming aspirin after non-variceal upper GI bleeding is critical in terms of the risks of early rebleeding and serious cardiovascular outcomes. In a double-blind randomised trial conducted in Hong Kong, 156 aspirin users with established cardiovascular diseases who had actively bleeding peptic ulcers were randomised to resume aspirin or placebo immediately after endoscopic haemostasis. At 8 weeks, all-cause mortality was 10 times lower in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (1.3% vs 12.9%; 95% CI 3.7% to 19.5%), although the 30-day rebleeding rate was numerically two times higher in the aspirin group. In another retrospective study of 118 aspirin users who had peptic ulcer bleeding, 40% of patients discontinued aspirin. In a median follow-up of 2 years, patients with cardiovascular comorbidities who discontinued low-dose aspirin therapy had an almost sevenfold increase in risk for death or acute cardiovascular events (HR 6.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 34.8) compared with patients who continued this therapy during the first 6 months of the follow-up period.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

The Task Force recommends discussion with the cardiologist before discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, particularly in patients with acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, because these patients have a higher risk of stent thrombosis than patients with stable coronary artery disease. As a general principle, we do not recommend withholding both antiplatelet agents simultaneously because the median time to coronary stent thrombosis can be as short as 7 days with both drugs withheld compared with 122 days with only clopidogrel withheld. Whether one should temporarily discontinue aspirin or clopidogrel in acute non-variceal upper GI bleeding remains controversial. The ESGE Guidelines recommend continuation of aspirin without interruption and consultation with a cardiologist for resumption of second antiplatelet agent after GI bleeding. However, no justification was provided for this recommendation.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^34f2a883]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Antiplatelet treatment

Combined guidelines from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and British Society of Gastroenterology advise that in patients presenting with a proven UGIB, aspirin should be stopped (potentially indefinitely) when used for primary cardiovascular prevention but continued in secondary prevention. A meta-analysis of 50 279 patients showed that aspirin discontinuation in the context of secondary prevention was associated with a three times increase in the risk of major cardiac events (odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 5.61). This risk increased 89-fold in patients with stents (89.78, 29.90 to 269.60). A placebo controlled, single centre randomised controlled trial of 156 patients reported that although patients continuing aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention had an increased risk of recurrent bleeding versus controls (10.3% (95% confidence interval 3.4% to 17.2%) v 5.4% (0.3% to 10.5%)), patients who stopped aspirin had a significantly higher 30 day mortality verus those who were continuing aspirin use (9% (2.7% to 15.3%) v 1.3% (0.1% to 3.8%) in the aspirin group). If aspirin is temporarily withheld in patients who have a life threating bleed, the recommended time to resumption varies across guidelines from time of haemostasis to five days.

A meta-analysis of aspirin in primary prevention trials of 95 000 patients showed only a 0.07% annual reduced risk of serious adverse vascular events; therefore, the risk of bleeding by continuing aspirin probably outweighs the benefit, except in patients who have a calculated cardiovascular risk that is high.

Limited evidence exists for the management of patients on dual antiplatelet treatment. In patients with stents, the risk of occlusion is high and must be balanced against the risk of bleeding. European guidelines recommend that treatment is continued in this group, if possible, and a consultation with cardiology is sought. In cases of severe bleeding, aspirin use should be continued and a P2Y12 antagonist withheld, but recommenced within five days.

When to stop and resume antiplatelet drugs?

If endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risks are deemed necessary, we recommend withholding P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for 5–7 days before the procedure while aspirin should be continued. In a large US registry, the median time to stent thrombosis can be as short as 7 days when both antiplatelet drugs are withheld whereas the median time is prolonged to 122 days when one antiplatelet drug is continued. Among patients without coronary stents the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke depends on the indication of antiplatelet therapy. The thrombotic risk without antiplatelet therapy is 10-fold higher in secondary prevention than in primary prevention (3.11% vs 0.34% yearly).

Given the high bleeding risks associated with ultra-high risk procedures, our Task Force recommends withholding all antiplatelet agents provided that the perceived benefits of the procedure outweigh the patient's thrombotic risk. The total duration of interruption should not exceed 7 days due to a high risk of coronary stent thrombosis. Decisions have to be individualised after liaison with cardiologists or neurologists.

We recommend discontinuing a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor — with the exception of ticagrelor which has a shorter duration of action — 5 days before high-risk procedures while continuing aspirin based on the following expert opinion: (1) the effect of non-aspirin antiplatelet drugs will last for up to 5 days (about 3 days for ticagrelor) after taking the last dose; and (2) P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is more potent than aspirin, thereby carrying a high bleeding risk. In contrast, the ASGE guidelines recommend withholding P2Y12 receptor inhibitors for at least 5–7 days before high-risk procedures. We are concerned about the thrombotic risk of prolonged discontinuation of these antiplatelet drugs, especially in patients with DES.

There are no data on the optimal timing of resuming antiplatelet drugs after elective endoscopic procedures. In patients who are at risk of coronary stent thrombosis, our Task Force recommends resumption of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor once adequate haemostasis has been achieved.

Interruption of anticoagulants

The BSG-ESGE Guidelinesstratify the risk of thromboembolism into two groups (low risk and high risk) whereas the ASGE Guidelinesstratify patients into three groups according to the estimated annual risk of thromboembolism without anticoagulation (low risk (< 5%), medium risk (5–10%) and high risk (> 10%)). Our Task Force has made recommendations on the use of heparin bridging with interruption of warfarin (box 2).

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^bb3a9633]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A single fully published study directly relevant to this PICO was identified: a cohort study in patients without thrombocytopenia taking antiplatelet agents and admitted with GI bleeding. This study compared 204 patients who received platelet transfusion with a matched control group of 204 patients who did not. Adjusted analyses revealed a significant increase in mortality (OR = 5.57, 95% CI: 1.52–27.1) and small, nonsignificant increases with platelet transfusion vs no transfusion in further bleeding (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.73–3.05) and thrombotic events (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.74–2.49).

Studies of platelet transfusion in patients for indications other than GI bleeding provide additional indirect evidence. An RCT of 190 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage reported an increase in the primary endpoint of death or dependence (because of significant neurological deficit) with platelet transfusion vs standard care (adjusted OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.18–3.56), as well as a small, nonsignificant increase in mortality (RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.78–2.44) and a large, nonsignificant increase in thrombotic events (RR = 3.84, 0.44–33.68) with platelet transfusion. A retrospective analysis of data from double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery reported higher mortality with platelet transfusion on multivariable analysis with propensity scoring (OR = 4.76, 95% CI: 1.65–13.73).

Conclusions.

Given a possible mortality increase in patients with GI bleed and other medical conditions, and the lack of benefit in decreasing further bleeding in patients with GI bleeding, the panel suggests against platelet transfusion in patients with antiplatelet-related GI bleeding who are not thrombocytopenic.

Holding ASA vs continuing ASA.

### Does antiplatelet therapy affect outcomes of patients receiving abdominal laparoscopic surgery? Lessons from more than 1, 000 laparoscopic operations in a single tertiary referral hospital [^cb56e867]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of antiplatelet therapy (APT) on surgical blood loss and perioperative complications in patients receiving abdominal laparoscopic surgery still remains unclear.

Study Design

A total of 1,075 consecutive patients undergoing abdominal laparoscopic surgery between 2005 and 2011 were reviewed. Our perioperative management protocol consisted of interruption of APT 1 week before surgery and early postoperative reinstitution in low thromboembolic risk patients (n = 160, iAPT group). Preoperative APT was maintained in patients with high thromboembolic risk or emergent situation (n = 52, cAPT group). Perioperative and outcomes variables of cAPT and iAPT groups, including bleeding and thromboembolic complications, were compared with those of patients without APT (non-APT group, n = 863).

Results

In this cohort, 715 basic and 360 advanced laparoscopic operations were included. No patient suffering excessive intraoperative bleeding due to continuation of APT was observed. There were 10 postoperative bleeding complications (0.9%) and 3 thromboembolic events (0.3%), but the surgery was free of both complications in the cAPT group. No significant differences were found between the groups in operative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, and the occurrence of bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Multivariable analyses showed that multiple antiplatelet agents (p = 0.015) and intraoperative blood transfusion (p = 0.046) were significant prognostic factors for postoperative bleeding complications. Increased thromboembolic complications were independently associated with high New York Heart Association class (p = 0.019) and history of cerebral infarction (p = 0.048), but not associated with APT use.

Conclusions

Abdominal laparoscopic operations were successfully performed without any increase in severe complications in patients with APT compared with the non-APT group under our rigorous perioperative assessment and management. Maintenance of single APT should be considered in patients with high thromboembolic risk, even when an abdominal laparoscopic approach is considered.

### Postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage [^20bf52c8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in the postoperative period is an uncommon complication of surgery. The management of GI bleeding within the postoperative period is complex because of a larger differential for the source of bleeding and a more complex risk/benefit analysis. There is minimal published literature specific to the management of postoperative GI bleeding, and the infrequency, complexity, and variability of the clinical setting of this complication confound simplistic consideration of its cause and therapy. This article outlines a systematic evaluation of the patient, treatment options, and assessment of risk/benefit ratio for various treatment options.

### Oxycodone and aspirin [^0482c754]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Aspirin has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and prolonged bleeding time.

Hemorrhage

Aspirin may increase the likelihood of hemorrhage due to its effect on the gastric mucosa and platelet function (prolongation of bleeding time). Salicylates should be used with caution in the presence of peptic ulcer or coagulation abnormalities.

Ambulatory Surgery and Postoperative Use

Oxycodone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility. Ileus is a common postoperative complication, especially after intra-abdominal surgery with use of opioid analgesia. Caution should be taken to monitor for decreased bowel motility in postoperative patients receiving opioids. Standard supportive therapy should be implemented.

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Storage and Disposal

Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store oxycodone and aspirin tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home (see WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Inform patients that leaving oxycodone and aspirin tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home.

Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused oxycodone and aspirin tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take-back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines.

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Inform patients that the use of oxycodone and aspirin tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death (see WARNINGS). Instruct patients not to share oxycodone and aspirin tablets with others and to take steps to protect oxycodone and aspirin tablets from theft or misuse.

### Resuming aspirin in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^033985ad]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Our primary and secondary aims were to analyze the evidence surrounding mortality and re-bleeding risks in patients on aspirin with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) as a function of whether or not aspirin was resumed after the bleeding episode, and to determine whether aspirin intake upon admission affected the outcomes.

Methods

A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies was performed. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done. Generic inverse variance and random-effects model were employed. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I 2 test. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach for each comparison and outcome, and an evidence profile was created.

Results

Evidence from 1 RCT and 4 observational studies suggests that early aspirin resumption reduced mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.63) while increasing re-bleeding risk (HR 1.90, 95%CI 0.60–6.00); moderate certainty of evidence. The observational evidence was inconsistent for both mortality (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.54–1.33) and re-bleeding (HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.47–1.55); very low certainty of evidence. Nine observational studies addressed our secondary aim: 6 provided inconsistent results regarding mortality (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95%CI 0.80–1.50) and 4 provided inconsistent results regarding re-bleeding risk (pooled OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.53–1.59); very low certainty of evidence for both outcomes.

Conclusion

Evidence supporting a protective effect of aspirin resumption soon after NVUGIB is of low-to-moderate certainty, and is not informative as to the optimal timing of aspirin resumption.

Results

Selection process

The initial bibliographic search identified 9845 citations. Fig. 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram and details of the study selection. We identified 14 eligible studies: 13 observational and 1 RCT. Four observational studies and the single RCT addressed our primary aim. Nine observational studies addressed our secondary aim.

Primary aim: resuming vs. not resuming aspirin

provides detailed information regarding the characteristics of the included studies and the RoB assessment.

Characteristics of studies

Five studies addressed our primary aim, 4 retrospective with prospective follow up, and 1 RCT. Three were conducted in single centers, while 2 were multi-center. Observational studies provided a prospective follow up for 2953 patients on aspirin prior to admission, while the RCT provided follow up for 156 patients. Two studies exclusively included patients with peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), while one exclusively included patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Timing of aspirin resumption varied from 24 h following endoscopic intervention to up to 60 days following the bleeding episode. Timing was not specified in 1 study.

Follow-up time varied from 8 weeks to 5 years. All 5 studies addressed mortality. All except for Gonzalez-Perez et al addressed re-bleeding rates. Re-bleeding required endoscopic verification in 2 studies.

RoB assessment for observational studies

RoB for development and application of appropriate eligibility criteria was considered low for all studies except one, where patients could have been taking antithrombotics other than aspirin. In all 4 observational studies, the assessment of aspirin use was based solely on trusted medical databases. We considered the RoB for measurement of exposure to be unclear for all studies, as patients could have been prescribed aspirin and not taken it. Aspirin is available over the counter, and could have been taken without prescription.

RoB for assessment of outcomes was considered low for all studies addressing mortality except for one, and for all those addressing re-bleeding except for one, where it was not clear how these outcomes were assessed. Controlling for important confounders was established in 2 studies and RoB was deemed high in the other two. There was no mention of missing data in any of the 4 studies. RoB for data completeness was therefore considered unclear.

RoB assessment for the RCT

There was a low risk for potential bias in the RCT.

### Updated guidelines to reduce venous thromboembolism in trauma patients: a Western Trauma Association critical decisions algorithm [^c57447f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

L

Trauma patients with TBI, orthopedic or spine injuries, and those who undergo major surgery are at particular VTE risk and should be considered for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis.

Pharmacologic prophylaxis after discharge for high VTE risk trauma patients is supported by evidence that demonstrates the practice is efficacious, safe, and cost-effective and may be considered for patients with TBI, orthopedic or spine injuries, and those who undergo major surgery.– The highest VTE risk occurs during the first 3 months after injury with approximately 1 year required until the VTE rate returns to that of the general population. Venous thromboembolism–related readmissions account for 1.2% of 1-year trauma readmissions at a cost of US $250 million annually.

Postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis with enoxaparin is efficacious, associated with a low rate of clinically relevant bleeding complications, and is cost-effective in patients at high VTE risk. The introduction of postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis following abdominal or pelvic surgery for malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease was associated with a decrease in VTE events. Because the optimal postdischarge dose and duration of enoxaparin after trauma are not well studied, doses more than 30 mg twice daily should be avoided, and the duration of pharmacologic prophylaxis may be considered for up to 4 weeks after the date of admission. For those who undergo major orthopedic surgery, pharmacologic prophylaxis may be extended up to 35 days from the date of surgery. Aspirin may be initiated for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis for high VTE risk trauma patients, as it has been shown to be as effective as enoxaparin with less bleeding complications and better postdischarge adherence, and is not limited by the constraints of insurance oversight. Direct oral anticoagulants may also be considered for postdischarge pharmacologic prophylaxis after isolated orthopedic injury.

### Resuming aspirin in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ee350966]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Effects of aspirin resumption on mortality

In the RCT, HR for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who did not was 0.20 (95%CI 0.06–0.63; Fig. 2A), with moderate certainty of evidence, rated down due to imprecision (Table 1).

Figure 2
Effects of aspirin resumption on mortality in patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB); (A) randomized controlled trial (RCT); (B) observational studies; and effects of aspirin resumption on re-bleeding in patients with NVUGIB; (C) RCT; (D) observational studies

CI, confidence interval

Table 1
Evidence profile for the primary aim

A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies for mortality generated a pooled HR of 0.84 (95%CI 0.54–1.33; I² = 67%) in patients who resumed aspirin after NVUGIB compared to those who did not (Fig. 2B), with very low certainty of evidence due to inconsistency and imprecision (Table 1).

A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies and the RCT combined for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who did not generated a pooled HR of 0.69 (95%CI 0.42–1.15; I² = 72%), with very low certainty of evidence, rated down due to the RoB in observational studies as well as imprecision and inconsistency (Table 1).

A subgroup analysis was performed to determine whether the relative effect of aspirin resumption on mortality might be modified by whether patients were taking aspirin for primary or secondary prevention. When considering studies with less than 6 months of follow up after resumption of aspirin, a meta-analysis of 3 studies where aspirin was used for secondary prevention revealed a pooled HR of 0.35 (95%CI 0.09–1.29; I² = 78%) for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who did not (Fig. 3A). Certainty of evidence was judged very low. On the other hand, one observational study where aspirin was used for primary prevention found a HR of 4.07 (95%CI 0.54–30.74) for mortality in patients who resumed aspirin compared to those who discontinued it (Fig. 3A). Certainty of evidence was deemed very low. The P-value of the test for the subgroup effect was 0.05.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin — dose-dependent platelet effects and bleeding considerations are summarized as follows: Platelet COX is inhibited by low-dose aspirin (60–325 mg), whereas larger doses (1.5–2 g/d) also inhibit prostacyclin synthesis; as a result, low-dose aspirin (81–325 mg/d) is theoretically a greater risk factor for bleeding than higher doses. For prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death, the optimal aspirin dose lies within 75 to 160 mg/d. Spontaneous postoperative spinal hematomas have been reported with low-dose aspirin therapy. Platelet function is affected for the life of the platelet after aspirin ingestion, while short-acting NSAIDs normalize platelet aggregation after 24 hours, with more than 50% restored after 6 hours and full normalization within 3 days. Celecoxib (COX-2 selective) does not cause platelet dysfunction, and after single or multiple doses there have not been findings of significant disruption of platelet aggregation nor a history of undesirable bleeding events.

### Reversal and removal of oral antithrombotic drugs in patients with active or perceived imminent bleeding [^a4aaf6a3]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress has been made in the pharmacological management of patients with cardiovascular disease, including the frequent use of antithrombotic agents. Nonetheless, bleeding complications remain frequent and potentially life-threatening. Therapeutic interventions relying on prompt antithrombotic drug reversal or removal have been developed to assist clinicians in treating patients with active bleeding or an imminent threat of major bleeding due to urgent surgery or invasive procedures. Early phase studies on these novel strategies have shown promising results using surrogate pharmacodynamic endpoints. However, the benefit of reversing/removing antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs should always be weighed against the possible prothrombotic effects associated with withdrawal of antithrombotic protection, bleeding, and surgical trauma. Understanding the ischemic-bleeding risk tradeoff of antithrombotic drug reversal and removal strategies in the context of urgent high-risk settings requires dedicated clinical investigations, but challenges in trial design remain, with relevant practical, financial, and ethical implications.

### Low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention-cardiovascular risks after its perioperative withdrawal versus bleeding risks with its continuation-review and meta-analysis [^715fca45]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Low-dose aspirin given for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is frequently withdrawn prior to surgical or diagnostic procedures to reduce bleeding complications. This may expose patients to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aim of the study was to review and quantify cardiovascular risks because of periprocedural aspirin withdrawal and bleeding risks with the continuation of aspirin.

Methods

We screened MEDLINE (January 1970-October 2004) with additional manual cross-referencing for clinical studies, surveys on the opinions of doctors and guidelines.

Results

Studies reporting the relative risk of acute cardiovascular events after aspirin withdrawal when compared with its continuation were not found. However, retrospective investigations revealed that aspirin withdrawal precedes up to 10.2% of acute cardiovascular syndromes. The time interval between discontinuation and acute cerebral events was 14.3 ± 11.3 days, 8.5 ± 3.6 days for acute coronary syndromes, and 25.8 ± 18.1 days for acute peripheral arterial syndromes (P < 0.02 versus acute coronary syndromes). On aspirin-related bleeding risks, we obtained 41 (12 observational retrospective, 19 observational prospective, 10 randomized) studies, reporting on 49 590 patients (14 981 on aspirin). Baseline frequency of bleeding complications varied between 0 (skin lesion excision, cataract surgery) and 75% (transrectal prostate biopsy). Whilst aspirin increased the rate of bleeding complications by factor 1.5 (median, interquartile range: 1.0–2.5), it did not lead to a higher level of the severity of bleeding complications (exception: intracranial surgery, and possibly transurethral prostatectomy). Surveys amongst doctors on the management of this problem demonstrate wide variations. Available guidelines are scarce and in part contradictory.

Conclusions

Only if low-dose aspirin may cause bleeding risks with increased mortality or sequels comparable with the observed cardiovascular risks after aspirin withdrawal, it should be discontinued prior to an intended operation or procedure. Controlled clinical studies are urgently needed.

### The efficacy of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine in the treatment of pediatric postoperative pericardial effusion [^1177607b]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

An interesting finding did, however, result from an analysis of the adult literature. It is notable that in studies, aspirin, an NSAID, was administered to CABG patients in both groups, and these studies also did not find significant differences in treatment outcome between their study groups. On the other hand, part of the procedure in study was to withhold any aspirin from participants and only provide non-aspirin analgesics on demand, and this study did in fact find significant differences in outcome between their study groups. This indicates that the etiology of PPE might be inflammatory; the administration of NSAIDs to participants in both placebo and drug groups may have reduced the apparent effect of the drug being studied in, since the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin may have led to greater resolution of PPE in the placebo group than might otherwise have been observed. A major limitation to being able to draw this conclusion with greater certainty, however, is the aforementioned potential risk of bias found in; the only study that did not administer any aspirin to its participants and also the only study to have found significant differences in treatment outcome. (It should be noted that the pediatric study by Wilson et al. also withheld aspirin from its participants and also found significant results, but its sample size was too small (n = 21) for this finding to truly be of much significance, and as mentioned above, it also raised some concerns over risk of bias in randomization procedure and selection of reported results.)

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) management of bleeding — "It is essential to rule out other potential causes and treat any coexisting causes, as necessary". "Aspirin should be withheld until bleeding is under control and the use of appropriate cytoreductive therapy should be considered to optimize platelet counts while minimizing hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities". "Testing for acquired VWS (plasma VWFA measurement, von Willebrand activity) should be considered for patients with elevated platelet count undergoing surgical procedures or for those with unexplained bleeding". "In unanticipated gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and gastric varices, special consultation (for endoscopic evaluation) with a hepatologist or a gastrointestinal specialist is recommended".
