## Question

what is the suggestion for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation population, especially asian population?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about stroke prevention strategies in atrial fibrillation, with a particular focus on recommendations for Asian populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and risk profile of AF in Asia. Then, I should verify the stroke risk stratification framework and how it applies to Asian patients. Next, I will examine the comparative efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in Asians, including dose nuances. After that, I need to align with contemporary guideline thresholds and shared decision-making. I will then consider special populations and edge cases, followed by implementation and monitoring strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, Asian-specific recommendation and note uncertainties and knowledge gaps that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic context and risk profile in Asia. Although AF prevalence is often reported lower in Asia than in Western cohorts, the absolute burden is high due to population size and aging, and Asian patients with AF demonstrate higher ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage risks than non-Asians, a phenomenon sometimes termed the "East Asian paradox", which necessitates careful anticoagulant selection and dosing strategies tailored to bleeding risk [^115ParQA] [^115fKkRT] [^111ThppP].

> I need to check the stroke risk stratification framework next. The CHA2DS2-VASc score remains the most widely endorsed tool internationally, with the first step being to identify truly low-risk patients who do not require antithrombotic therapy, typically CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in men or 1 in women, and then to offer oral anticoagulation for those with at least one non–sex-related stroke risk factor. Female sex functions as a risk modifier rather than an independent driver, and this nuance is reflected in contemporary consensus and guideline positions [^1178m1Bv] [^115tzdTQ] [^115FJntU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about applying the same thresholds everywhere. Asian datasets suggest higher ischemic stroke rates even at low CHA2DS2-VASc scores, and several analyses propose a lower net-benefit threshold for anticoagulation around 0.9% to 1% annual stroke risk in Asians, implying that men with CHA2DS2-VASc 1 and women with 2 may accrue meaningful benefit from NOACs, though I should confirm this is framed as a reasonable consideration rather than a mandate in shared decision-making [^111mpZxF] [^112qJB1D] [^115fKkRT].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in Asian populations. Pooled randomized data and real-world meta-analyses consistently show that standard-dose NOACs reduce stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding more than warfarin in Asians, with particularly pronounced reductions in intracranial hemorrhage; importantly, the relative efficacy and safety advantages appear larger in Asian subgroups than in non-Asian cohorts, supporting a preference for NOACs in this population [^116DZbRg] [^115ExW9v] [^114qik6o].

> Wait, let me verify dose considerations, because Asia-Pacific practice has historically included lower-dose NOAC regimens, particularly for rivaroxaban. While standard-dose NOACs demonstrate robust benefits across Asian datasets, some Japanese and region-specific programs have used reduced rivaroxaban doses and still observed favorable outcomes, but this should be interpreted in the context of local labeling, pharmacokinetics, and bleeding risk. The generalizable conclusion is that standard-dose NOACs are preferred when not contraindicated, with careful attention to renal function, body weight, age, and drug interactions to determine label-based dose adjustments rather than indiscriminate dose reduction [^111TkzXv] [^116PJXGq] [^1148RSsD].

> I should confirm how contemporary guidelines translate this into practical thresholds. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline recommends anticoagulation for patients with an estimated annual thromboembolic risk of 2% or higher and considers anticoagulation reasonable for those with risk of 1% to less than 2%, with DOACs preferred over warfarin in eligible patients. Aspirin is not recommended for stroke prevention in AF without another indication, and decisions should be reassessed periodically as risk evolves [^114zYr9z] [^114sKXey] [^1112Nufz].

> But wait, what if the patient has very high bleeding risk or a specific contraindication to long-term OAC? In such cases, left atrial appendage occlusion is a reasonable alternative strategy endorsed by guidelines for patients with nonvalvular AF who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation, and Asian data suggest feasibility and safety in experienced centers, though careful selection and procedural expertise are critical [^114izerD] [^114YVHvX].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In patients with prior stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation is indicated and DOACs are preferred over warfarin. In acute ischemic stroke, early initiation timing should balance hemorrhagic risk, with delayed starts in large infarcts and earlier starts after minor strokes or TIAs in line with secondary prevention guidance, and AF type does not change the indication for anticoagulation. For very elderly Asians, the relative advantage of NOACs in reducing intracranial hemorrhage remains relevant, and careful renal dosing is essential [^116JH2Bw] [^114zYr9z] [^111VLwmF].

> Let me think about implementation and monitoring, because real-world effectiveness hinges on correct dosing and follow-up. NOAC overdosing and underdosing are associated with worse outcomes, so I should double-check renal function at baseline and periodically, adjust doses per label, avoid inappropriate dose reductions, and reassess stroke and bleeding risk at least annually, with closer follow-up for high HAS-BLED scores and modifiable bleeding risks such as uncontrolled hypertension or concomitant NSAIDs. Structured programs and pharmacist-led initiatives can improve uptake and persistence [^1148RSsD] [^116oV7Wb] [^114FwV5R].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are not overgeneralizing. Although multiple meta-analyses show consistent advantages of NOACs over warfarin in Asians, some subgroup and region-specific differences exist, and underrepresentation of Asians in pivotal trials means we must integrate registry and real-world evidence with caution. Nonetheless, the convergence of trial and observational data supports a class-wide advantage of NOACs over warfarin for stroke prevention with lower intracranial bleeding in Asian AF populations [^116DZbRg].

> Let me synthesize a practical, Asian-specific approach. For Asian patients with nonvalvular AF, use CHA2DS2-VASc to stratify risk, avoid aspirin monotherapy for stroke prevention, prefer a standard-dose NOAC when not contraindicated, consider anticoagulation at CHA2DS2-VASc 1 in men or 2 in women after shared decision-making given higher background stroke risk and favorable NOAC safety, ensure label-concordant dosing and periodic reassessment, and consider LAA occlusion if long-term OAC is truly infeasible, all aligned with contemporary guideline frameworks and the available Asian-specific evidence base [^114zYr9z] [^1178m1Bv] [^116DZbRg].

> Finally, I should double-check key caveats. Female sex is a risk modifier, not a standalone driver. Dynamic reassessment is essential as new comorbidities accrue. NOACs are preferred over warfarin unless mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis are present. And in the highest-risk scenarios, the balance may occasionally favor individualized intensity of VKA or alternative strategies, but the prevailing Asian data still support NOACs as first-line for most patients with actionable stroke risk [^115FJntU] [^11369Unb] [^114zYr9z].

---

For Asian patients with atrial fibrillation, **NOACs are preferred over warfarin** because they reduce stroke and intracranial bleeding more effectively in this population [^114zYr9z] [^114qik6o]. Use **standard-dose NOACs** when indicated, reserving lower doses only for approved criteria (e.g. renal impairment, low body weight, advanced age) [^1148RSsD]. Anticoagulation is recommended for CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, and considered for 1 in men or 2 in women after shared decision-making [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey]. Aspirin is ineffective and not recommended for stroke prevention in AF [^114zYr9z] [^114FL5jM]. Monitor renal function regularly and adjust dosing to maintain efficacy and safety [^1148RSsD].

---

## Stroke risk in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation

Asian patients with AF have a **higher stroke risk** than non-Asian patients, including higher rates of ischemic and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) [^115fKkRT]. This elevated risk persists even after adjusting for traditional risk factors, indicating population-specific susceptibility [^notfound].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants

### Warfarin

Warfarin reduces stroke risk but is limited by **narrow therapeutic windows**, frequent INR monitoring, and drug–food interactions [^114G973q]. Asian patients also experience higher rates of ICH and poor INR control, limiting its effectiveness and safety in this population [^115fKkRT] [^115gUU4R].

---

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs)

NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are **preferred over warfarin** for stroke prevention in Asian patients with AF due to superior efficacy and safety profiles:

- **Efficacy**: NOACs significantly reduce stroke/systemic embolism compared to warfarin in Asian patients [^116DZbRg].
- **Safety**: NOACs substantially reduce intracranial bleeding, a critical concern in Asian populations [^116DZbRg].
- **Mortality**: NOACs reduce all-cause mortality compared to warfarin in Asian patients [^116DZbRg].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

Standard-dose NOACs are **recommended for most Asian patients** with AF, with dose adjustments based on renal function, body weight, and age:

| **Noac** | **Standard dose** | **Dose adjustment criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Dabigatran | 150 mg BID | 110 mg BID if age ≥ 80 years, creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30–50 mL/min, or high bleeding risk |
| Rivaroxaban | 20 mg OD | 15 mg OD if CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min |
| Apixaban | 5 mg BID | 2.5 mg BID if ≥ 2 of: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL |
| Edoxaban | 60 mg OD | 30 mg OD if CrCl 15–50 mL/min, weight ≤ 60 kg, or concomitant verapamil/dronedarone |

---

Lower doses are **not recommended** unless the above criteria are met, as underdosing increases stroke risk without improving safety [^1148RSsD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized risk assessment** and **shared decision-making** for Asian patients with AF:

- **Risk assessment**: Use CHA2DS2-VASc for stroke risk and HAS-BLED for bleeding risk [^115tzdTQ] [^11369Unb].
- **Anticoagulation**: Recommended for CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women; consider for 1 in men or 2 in women after shared decision-making [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey].
- **NOACs**: Preferred over warfarin for most patients due to superior safety and efficacy profiles [^114zYr9z] [^111VLwmF].

---

## Special considerations in Asian populations

Asian patients have **unique clinical characteristics** that influence anticoagulation management:

- **Renal function**: Lower average body weight and renal function necessitate careful dose adjustments.
- **Bleeding risk**: Higher ICH risk requires vigilant monitoring and risk mitigation strategies [^115fKkRT].
- **Genetic factors**: Pharmacogenetic differences may influence drug metabolism and response, necessitating individualized therapy [^114YybGX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to ensure optimal outcomes:

- **Renal function**: Monitor regularly and adjust NOAC dosing accordingly [^1148RSsD].
- **Adherence**: Educate patients on adherence and recognize symptoms of bleeding and stroke.
- **Reassessment**: Periodically reassess stroke and bleeding risk to guide ongoing therapy [^11369Unb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **NOACs**: Preferred over warfarin for stroke prevention in Asian patients with AF [^115gUU4R].
- **Standard dosing**: Use standard doses unless dose adjustment criteria are met [^1148RSsD].
- **Risk assessment**: Use CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores to guide therapy [^115tzdTQ] [^11369Unb].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function and adjust dosing as necessary [^notfound].
- **Aspirin**: Not recommended for stroke prevention in AF [^114zYr9z] [^115FJntU].

---

NOACs are the **preferred anticoagulants** for stroke prevention in Asian patients with AF because they offer superior efficacy and safety compared to warfarin. Standard dosing should be used unless specific criteria necessitate adjustment, and regular monitoring of renal function and adherence is essential for optimal outcomes.

Nevertheless, populations from RCTs are generally selected with strict eligibility criteria under careful protocol-based follow-up. As such, data from RCTs are not always valid for real-world AF patients. Prior meta-analyses of real-world studies have compared the efficacy and safety outcomes between NOAC and warfarin users in the worldwide population, – but the relationship in Asian real-world patients with AF is still unknown. The incidence of AF and AF-associated complications are substantially higher in Asians than non-Asians because Asia is a region with the largest population and has the rapidly aging population. Of particular note, Asian patients with AF have higher risks of stroke and bleeding (in particular intracranial bleeding) than non-Asians. Furthermore, there are important differences in baseline characteristics between Asian and non-Asian patients. For example, compared with non-Asians, Asian patients generally have a younger age, lower body weight, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, but show a higher risk of prior cerebrovascular events. In addition, since Asians are the major factor attributable to stroke and intracranial bleeding in anticoagulated patients, more Asian patients would have been deemed ineligible for treatment because of higher stroke and bleeding risks. As such, stroke prevention in AF represents an urgent issue of public health in Asia. However, whether the use of NOACs is effective and safe in Asians is still exploratory. In recent years, several observational studies have investigated the effect of NOACs versus warfarin in Asian patients with AF, but their results remain controversial. Therefore, the second section of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin for stroke prevention in the real-world Asians with AF.

### Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines on atrial fibrillation: a commentary [^111XyVVA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide a commentary on the recommendations for stroke prevention from the 2012 focused update of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation and the evidence (or lack of it) supporting these recommendations. These guidelines strongly advocate a major clinical practice shift towards initially focusing on the identification of 'truly low risk' patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy. After this initial decision-making step, effective stroke prevention - that is, oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled adjusted dose warfarin or with one of the novel oral anticoagulants) - could be offered to patients with atrial fibrillation with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. The 2012 focused update guideline also provides additional guidance on advances in stroke and bleeding risk assessment that are evident since publication of the 2010 guideline, as well as recommendations on the use of the novel oral anticoagulants and the left atrial appendage occlusion devices that have been increasingly used in European clinical practice over the last 2 years.

### Secondary stroke prevention in people with atrial fibrillation: treatments and trials [^112M92vA]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias and is a major cause of ischaemic stroke. Recent findings indicate the importance of atrial fibrillation burden (device-detected, subclinical, or paroxysmal and persistent or permanent) and whether atrial fibrillation was known before stroke onset or diagnosed after stroke for the risk of recurrence. Secondary prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and stroke aims to reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke. Findings from randomised controlled trials assessing the optimal timing to introduce direct oral anticoagulant therapy after a stroke show that early start (ie, within 48 h for minor to moderate strokes and within 4–5 days for large strokes) seems safe and could reduce the risk of early recurrence. Other promising developments regarding early rhythm control, left atrial appendage occlusion, and novel factor XI inhibitor oral anticoagulants suggest that these therapies have the potential to further reduce the risk of stroke. Secondary prevention strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a stroke despite oral anticoagulation therapy is an unmet medical need. Research advances suggest a heterogeneous spectrum of causes, and ongoing trials are investigating new approaches for secondary prevention in this vulnerable patient group. In patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, the latest data from randomised controlled trials on stroke prevention shows that oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke but more data are needed to define the safety profile.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate DOACs over VKAs in combination with antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding in patients with AF and an increased risk for stroke undergoing PCI.

### Outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation newly recommended for oral anticoagulation under the 2014 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Rhythm Society guideline [^112fN41Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5‐fold increase in stroke and thromboembolism risk. 1 Oral anticoagulation has been shown to reduce this risk by ≈60% 2; however, anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding. Although the benefits of stroke prevention outweigh the risk of bleeding in patients with moderate to high risk of stroke, 3 the benefit/risk ratio of anticoagulation in patients with low risk remains unclear. In March 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) updated their guidelines for the use of anticoagulation in patients with AF, recommending oral anticoagulation therapy for patients with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc ≥ 2. 3 Before 2014, only patients with CHADS 2 ≥ 2 were recommended for anticoagulation. 4 CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc are 2 validated scores that predict the risk of stroke in patients with AF: CHADS 2 score is calculated as the sum of 6 points: 1 for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and age older than 75 years, and 2 for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 5 In addition to these factors, female sex, vascular disease, and age 65 to 74 years are assigned 1 point in the calculation of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, and age older than 75 years is assigned 2, for a possible sum of 9 points. 5

### Methodologic differences across studies of patients with atrial fibrillation lead to varying estimates of stroke risk [^112ky6CW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who take oral anticoagulants (OACs) have a dramatically reduced risk of ischemic stroke, 1 but face an increased risk of bleeding, which can be fatal. As a result, the decision to anticoagulate an individual patient should be based on the expected net clinical benefit of OAC (ie, the difference between the reduction in stroke risk and the increase in bleeding risk, weighted by the severity of each of these respective outcomes). 2 Because of this balance of benefits and harms, patients at low risk of ischemic stroke may have little or even negative net clinical benefit from OAC treatment. Decision analyses have shown that the threshold of absolute stroke risk for an average individual patient at which OAC treatment yields a net clinical benefit is between 0.9% and 2% per year. 3

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) have recommended the use of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc stroke risk scoring system. 4, 5, 6 The CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score incorporates patient characteristics to create a point score, with increasing scores corresponding to higher risks of ischemic stroke. 7 The most recent ESC and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines both recommend using OAC at a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2 or greater (not including "female" as a risk factor for the ESC threshold).

An underlying assumption of these guidelines is that each CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc point score corresponds to a fixed stroke rate off anticoagulant therapy, which can be extrapolated to a positive or negative net clinical benefit should anticoagulants be taken. To support this assumption, the guidelines cite off‐anticoagulant stroke rates from large cohort studies. 7, 8, 9 However, our and others' previous work has shown wide variation in the reported stroke rates from different cohorts of patients with AF. 5, 10 Depending upon AF cohort, a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2 would lead to a positive or a negative expected net clinical benefit, calling into question the general applicability of guideline recommendations. The fact that wide variation in stroke rates is seen in studies from the same or adjacent countries argues that variation in study methodology is an important contributor to variation in observed rates. The current study seeks to explain this variation by comparing relevant worldwide AF cohorts according to core methodologic features.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112DuD31]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance of atrial fibrillation epidemiology and stroke risk notes that atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 0.2% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. AF is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke, and approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF are first diagnosed with AF at the time of the stroke or shortly thereafter.

### Safety and effectiveness of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in real-world patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a retrospective analysis of contemporary Japanese administrative claims data [^116PJXGq]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is observed in < 1% of the total population in Japan. The prevalence of AF increases with age, rising to approximately 14% in patients aged > 80 years. AF is a well-established risk factor for stroke, systemic embolism (SE) and death. Recent guidelines recommend treatment with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (ie, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) for eligible oral anticoagulant (OAC)-naïve patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have supported the benefits of NOACs versus warfarin in patients with NVAF, with a meta-analysis confirming that NOACs significantly lower the risk of stroke/SE with a risk of major bleeding similar to that associated with warfarin.

While RCTs are the gold standard for demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions, they are not fully representative of an unselected real-world population, thereby limiting the relevance of their findings to clinical practice. Consequently, a number of observational, real-world evidence studies have emerged to provide supportive evidence of the safety and/or effectiveness of NOACs in clinical practice. However, there remain several unmet knowledge gaps in the literature regarding the clinical outcomes of NOAC treatment in patients with NVAF, particularly in patient subgroups at high risk of adverse outcomes.

All four NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) have been approved in Japan for the prevention of stroke and SE in patients with NVAF. Importantly, dosing of NOACs in Japan differs slightly from that in other countries given the higher bleeding complication rates reported in East Asian patients; for example, the approved dose of rivaroxaban is 10/15 mg daily in Japan. Given the unique setting surrounding the use of NOACs, and considering they are often initiated at reduced doses, the impact of NOACs on safety (ie, the risk of bleeding) and effectiveness (ie, the risk of stroke or SE) outcomes in Japanese patients with NVAF requires further elucidation.

### Future of stroke prevention: 7 updates in the 2024 AHA / ASA primary prevention of stroke guideline [^114MHrse]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, recommendations regarding aspirin and/or direct oral anticoagulant therapy for individuals with decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction ≤ 35%-40%) and no atrial fibrillation (AF) or LV thrombus are provided. Based on evidence from the WARCEF (Warfarin vs Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction)and COMMANDER HF (A Study to Assess the Effectiveness and Safety of Rivaroxaban in Reducing the Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction or Stroke in Participants with Heart Failure and Coronary Artery Disease Following an Episode of Decompensated Heart Failure)trials, the 2024 Guideline does not recommend the use of anticoagulation among individuals with a reduced LV ejection fraction and no AF or LV thrombus due to an increased risk of major bleeding events (Class 3 recommendation, harm).

Although not directly addressed in the 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline, anticoagulation for primary prevention of thromboembolic stroke among individuals with AF is covered in the 2023 Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation Guideline. Among individuals with AF who have an annual risk of thromboembolic stroke ≥ 2% (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women), selection of anticoagulation is recommended to be based upon the annualized stroke rather than the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent).

It is important for clinicians to have shared decision-making conversations with patients about their individualized stroke and bleeding risk, particularly for patients at very high stroke risk but whom have no other clear indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and near-future directions [^112cgGni]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.

### Atrial fibrillation: a review [^111VLwmF]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the US, approximately 10.55 million adults have atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is associated with significantly increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms of AF include palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, exertional intolerance, and fatigue, although approximately 10% to 40% of people with AF are asymptomatic. AF can be detected incidentally during clinical encounters, with wearable devices, or through interrogation of cardiac implanted electronic devices. In patients presenting with ischemic stroke without diagnosed AF, an implantable loop recorder (ie, subcutaneous telemetry device) can evaluate patients for intermittent AF. The 2023 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Guideline writing group proposed 4 stages of AF evolution: stage 1, at risk, defined as patients with AF-associated risk factors (eg, obesity, hypertension); stage 2, pre-AF, signs of atrial pathology on electrocardiogram or imaging without AF; stage 3, the presence of paroxysmal (recurrent AF episodes lasting ≤ 7 days) or persistent (continuous AF episode lasting > 7 days) AF subtypes; and stage 4, permanent AF. Lifestyle and risk factor modification, including weight loss and exercise, to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications are recommended for all stages. In patients with estimated risk of stroke and thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year, anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant reduces stroke risk by 60% to 80% compared with placebo. In most patients, a direct oral anticoagulant, such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban, is recommended over warfarin because of lower bleeding risks. Compared with anticoagulation, aspirin is associated with poorer efficacy and is not recommended for stroke prevention. Early rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation to restore and maintain sinus rhythm is recommended by the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for some patients with AF. Catheter ablation is first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF to improve symptoms and slow progression to persistent AF. Catheter ablation is also recommended for patients with AF who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to improve quality of life, left ventricular systolic function, and cardiovascular outcomes, such as rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Conclusions and Relevance

AF is associated with increased rates of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Lifestyle and risk factor modification are recommended to prevent AF onset, recurrence, and complications, and oral anticoagulants are recommended for those with an estimated risk of stroke or thromboembolic events of 2% or greater per year. Early rhythm control using antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation is recommended in select patients with AF experiencing symptomatic paroxysmal AF or HFrEF.

### Left atrial appendage closure for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and perspectives [^114izerD]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention: rationale for left atrial appendage closure

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Current prevalence is estimated to be 2%–4%, but is expected to increase, in part due to increased life expectancy (Graphical Abstract).

AF is a strong, independent risk factor for stroke, and thromboembolic strokes in AF patients are particularly large and severe contributing to the high medical, social, and economic burden.

The left atrial appendage (LAA) has been identified as the principal source of intracardiac thrombi in AF patients, and thrombogenesis within the LAA has been related to local abnormalities in haemostasis, endothelial function, blood stasis, and LAA remodelling (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Present recommendations for left atrial appendage closure. Current guideline recommendations for left atrial appendage closure (ESC 2020, published before LAAOS III, and ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023). AF, atrial fibrillation; LAA, left atrial appendage; LAAC, LAA closure; OAC, oral anticoagulation; pLAAO, percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion

Efforts to improve stroke prevention in patients with AF are therefore of paramount clinical importance. Risk assessments for stroke and bleeding in AF patients share several overlapping variables so that the highest risk of stroke is frequently associated with a particular high bleeding risk. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is currently the mainstay of stroke preventive therapy in AF, but LAA closure (LAAC) is a rapidly developing field in this respect.

### Anticoagulant therapy in initially low-risk patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who develop risk factors [^111QPQmn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of a large cohort of low‐risk patients with AF(CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 0 [male] or 1 [female]) who were not on OAC therapy at baseline, patients with ≥ 1 new‐onset risk factor subsequently treated with OACs at follow‐up had significantly lower event rates of ischemic stroke and composite clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke, major bleeding, all‐cause death) compared with non‐OAC users. This study provides the first report of a significant benefit with antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF who have ≥ 1 incident nonsex CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc risk factor. Of note, approximately 13.9% of patients with AF per year would have an increasing CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 1 with new comorbidities acquired during follow‐up, the most common being hypertension.

International guidelines suggest that antithrombotic therapy is not recommended for low‐risk patients with AF (ie. CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 0 [male] or 1 [female]) without nonsex stroke risk factors. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The 2006 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association AF guidelines and the 2018 CHEST (American College of Chest Physicians) guidelines state that individual risk varies over time, so the need for anticoagulation must be reevaluated periodically in all patients with AF. 9 This step is particularly important for low‐risk patients with AF at baseline because these patients usually do not receive OAC therapy when AF is diagnosed. However, new comorbidities could develop thereafter that could substantially increase the risk of ischemic stroke.

Indeed, stroke risk of patients with AF is not static. The CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score could increase as patients get older and accumulate more comorbidities. 8 In addition, the 2018 CHEST guidelines and the 2019 focused update of the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society AF guidelines both recommend the reassessment of stroke risk and the need for anticoagulant therapy at periodic intervals. 5, 10 Data from the current study show that CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score should be regularly reassessed for optimizing stroke prevention with antithrombotic therapy. 11, 12 The current age threshold for OAC treatment (age < 65 years) that defines "low risk" has even been proposed to be lowered to age < 50 or < 55 years among Asian patients. 13, 14

### Viewpoint: stroke prevention in recent guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: an appraisal [^113G6AX5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Formal guidelines play an important role in disseminating the best available evidence knowledge and are expected to provide simple and practical recommendations for the most optimal management of patients with various conditions. Such guidelines have important implications for many disease states, which thereby could be more professionally managed in everyday clinical practice by clinicians with divergent educational backgrounds, and also more easily implemented in wards or outpatient clinics, eliminating inequalities in health care management. In this brief Viewpoint we provide an appraisal on the recommendations pertinent to the prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke or systemic thromboembolism, as provided in recently published guidelines for the management of this arrhythmia.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Asians with atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized trials and real-world studies [^116DZbRg]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Several randomized trials and real-world studies have reported the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation; and therefore, this meta-analysis was aimed to compare the effects of NOACs with warfarin for atrial fibrillation stroke prevention in Asians. Methods- The PubMed and Embase databases were searched from January 2009 to February 2019 for studies on comparisons of NOACs versus warfarin in Asians. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were pooled using a random-effects model. Results- Five NOAC trials and 21 observational cohorts were included. For the NOAC trials, compared with warfarin, NOACs was associated with reduced risks of stroke or systemic embolism (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90), all-cause death (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.95), major bleeding (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48–0.72), and intracranial bleeding (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.26–0.49). For the real-world data, compared with warfarin, NOACs was associated with decreased rates of stroke or systemic embolism (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68–0.82), ischemic stroke (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59–0.83), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.93), all-cause death (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59–0.77), major bleeding (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55–0.73), intracranial bleeding (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43–0.59), and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51–0.84). The results did not change in the subgroup analyses based on the type and dose of NOACs. Conclusions- Based on published NOAC trials and real-world studies, the use of NOACs is noninferior to warfarin in Asians with atrial fibrillation irrespective of the NOAC type and dose.

### Stroke risk reduction in atrial fibrillation through pharmacist prescribing… [^114FwV5R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate whether pharmacist-led OAC prescription can increase the delivery of stroke risk reduction therapy in individuals with AF. Design, Setting, and Participants. Patients with undertreated or newly diagnosed AF eligible for OAC therapy were considered to have actionable AF. Data were analyzed from April 3 to November 30, 2023. Interventions In the early intervention group, pharmacists prescribed OAC using guideline-based algorithms with follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months. In the delayed intervention group, which served as the usual care control, the primary care physician was sent a notification of actionable AF along with a medication list. After 3 months, patients without OAC optimization in the control group underwent delayed pharmacist intervention. Pharmacies offer an attractive setting for community-based AF screening.

53, 54 Screening for AF with pulse check and a smartphone-based ECG device in Australian pharmacies was found to be a feasible and cost-effective screening strategy53 and well-accepted among pharmacists and patients. 55 In prior work, Sandhu et al54 enrolled individuals who were 65 years or older and were not taking OAC therapy into a stroke risk screening program that included an assessment for AF using a single-lead handheld ECG device, blood pressure measurements using an automated device, and diabetes risk calculated using a validated questionnaire over a 6-month period in Canadian community pharmacies. Screening results and recommendations for 1145 participants were provided to the primary care physician and among the 29 individuals identified as having actionable AF, only 5 had initiation of OAC therapy within 3 months.

54 Although the findings of that study demonstrated a high prevalence of individuals who could benefit from stroke risk reduction therapy and that the intervention was cost-effective, 56 the investigators highlighted the need for screening to be coupled with a defined care pathway. In this RCT, we found pharmacist-led OAC prescription for patients with actionable AF resulted in significant and meaningful increases in appropriate stroke risk reduction therapy for AF without an increase in adverse events or use of health care services. This study provides evidence of a potentially high-yield opportunity to effectively close gaps in the delivery of stroke risk reduction therapy for AF. Scalability and sustainability of pharmacist OAC prescription will require larger trials demonstrating effectiveness and safety.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^115xrLo8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common dysrhythmia in the United States, with a prevalence that is expected to rise significantly as the population ages. Despite the recognition of several modifiable risk factors for AF, such as obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and alcohol use, its prevalence and incidence continue to grow, making it an attractive target for preventive interventions. The preventive approach for AF is 2‐fold: (1) targeting and treating risk factors and (2) promptly diagnosing and initiating antithrombotic therapy to minimize thromboembolic complications.

Although limiting symptoms may significantly affect one's quality of life, the most feared complication associated with AF is stroke or systemic embolism. To this end, selective ECG screening for clinically asymptomatic disease in otherwise healthy persons may be indicated for stroke prevention. In the recently presented STROKESTOP (Population screening of 75‐ and 76‐year‐old men and women for silent atrial fibrillation) trial, population‐based screening of asymptomatic patients in Sweden identified 5% of the population as candidates for oral anticoagulation. The full study is currently under way.

Once AF has been diagnosed, thromboembolic risk assessment should be performed to determine optimal antithrombotic therapy. The 2014 ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society AF guidelines recommend risk stratification using the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, which performs better than the CHADS 2 score alone. Although not formally recommended in the guidelines yet, biomarkers, including high‐sensitivity troponin, have been shown to improve risk assessment. Although aspirin and warfarin have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in AF, – most patients warrant anticoagulant therapy. Until recently, warfarin was the sole anticoagulant approved for AF patients. Novel oral anticoagulants now offer alternatives that do not require prothrombin time monitoring and are associated with superior efficacy and/or safety in nonvalvular AF. – These agents inhibit the coagulation cascade either as a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or a factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, which has not yet received US Food and Drug Administration approval).

### Risk factors associated with ischemic stroke in Japanese NVAF patients… [^1168VPXR]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What risk factors are associated with ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Findings This cohort study examined data from 12 289 individual patients in 5 atrial fibrillation registries in Japan and found that previous stroke, advanced age, hypertension, type of atrial fibrillation, and low body mass index were significant, independent risk factors associated with ischemic stroke. Meaning These risk factors may be useful for identifying patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. Importance Despite the development of risk stratification schemes that have been widely used to determine the risk for thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, risk stratification schemes in Asian patients with NVAF remain undetermined.

In the present study, we pooled the data from the 5 AF prospective registries in Japan and assessed risk factors associated with ischemic stroke in the Japanese patients with NVAF. The J-RHYTHM Registry showed that hypertension at enrollment is not a risk factor, but a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 136 mm Hg at the time closest to the event was associated with the incidence of thromboembolism. 20 The Fushimi AF Registry showed that a systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg at enrollment was a risk factor for stroke, although history of hypertension was not. 21 All these results indicate that blood pressure control is critical for preventing ischemic stroke in patients with NVAF. More detailed and stratified analysis using the pooled data will be of great interest. The Fushimi AF Registry previously found that low body weight or low BMI is a risk factor associated with stroke.

7, 22 A recent meta-analysis23 found that low BMI was associated with an increased thromboembolism risk in Asian patients with AF. Persistent or permanent AF was shown to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in the Fushimi AF Registry and Hokuriku-Plus AF Registry. 8, 11 Furthermore, in the global ROCKET-AF and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials and recent meta-analysis, 26–28 patients with persistent or permanent AF had more strokes or systemic embolic events than those with paroxysmal AF. The present results were consistent with those of the global studies, and when the risk for ischemic stroke is assessed, the AF type should be considered.

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation-is it worth the effort? [^111kpbfY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Who should be screened?

Few guideline recommendations on AF screening exist, and their implementation is perhaps even rarer. As for primary prevention, the current AF guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology [7, 70 (ESC) recommend opportunistic AF screening by pulse taking or ECG rhythm strip amongst those aged above 65 (class I, level B recommendation) and consideration of systematic AF screening in patients aged > 75 years or those at high risk (class IIa, level B recommendation). There is also a recommendation on the regular interrogation of implanted cardiac devices to detect atrial high rate episodes (AHRE) suggestive of atrial fibrillation. In a consensus document from European Heart Rhythm Association [71] (EHRA) endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society, the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and the Sociedad Latinoamericana de Estimulación Cardíaca y Electrofisiología (SOLAECE), the primary prevention screening recommendations from the ESC [7] are applied. The National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand issued AF guidelines in 2018, including AF screening recommendations for opportunistic point‐of‐care screening in those aged above 65 years as well as AF screening by interrogation of cardiac devices [72]. For now, there are no specific recommendations on AF screening issued by the American Heart Association. No national‐level AF screening programmes have been introduced so far.

Mainly based on the lack of randomized studies on the stroke reduction efficacy of AF screening and on the lack of data on stroke risk of shorter asymptomatic AF episodes, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [73] and the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) [74] have recommended against AF screening.

### Participation by patients from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in trial evidence supporting secondary stroke prevention guideline recommendations [^115sb4L8]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

One out of every four strokes is a highly preventable recurrent stroke. However, while low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) experience a disproportionate global burden of stroke, individuals in these regions seldomly participate in pivotal clinical trials, which form the basis for international expert consensus guideline recommendations.

Objective

To evaluate a contemporary and globally prominent expert consensus secondary stroke prevention guideline statement for the participation of clinical trial subjects recruited from LMICs in formulating key therapeutic recommendations.

Methods

We examined the 2021 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients with Stroke and TIA. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited in the Guideline were independently reviewed by two authors for study populations and participating countries with a focus on trials for vascular risk factor control and management by underlying stroke mechanism. We also reviewed all cited systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the original RCTs.

Results

Among 320 secondary stroke prevention clinical trials, 262 (82%) focused on vascular risk control addressing diabetes (n = 26), hypertension (n = 23), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 13), dyslipidaemia (n = 10), lifestyle (n = 188) and obesity (n = 2); and 58 focused on stroke mechanism management including atrial fibrillation (n = 10), large vessel atherosclerosis (n = 45) and small vessel disease (n = 3). Overall, 53 of 320 studies (16.6%) had contributions from LMICs ranging from 55.6% for dyslipidemia, 40.7% for diabetes, 26.1% for hypertension, 15.4% for OSA, 6.4% for lifestyle, 0% for obesity, and by mechanism: 60.0% for atrial fibrillation, 22.2% large vessel atherosclerosis and 33.3% for small vessel disease trials. Only 19 (5.9%) of the trials had participatory contributions from a country in sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa only).

Conclusions

Compared to their global burden of stroke, LMICs are underrepresented in key clinical trials used in formulating a prominent global stroke prevention guideline. While current therapeutic recommendations are likely applicable to practice settings throughout the world, greater involvement of patients from LMIC settings will enhance the contextual relevance and generalizability of recommendations to these disparate populations.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113FG6fN]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 0.2% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. It is uncertain whether the prevalence of AF differs by race and ethnicity. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF are first diagnosed with AF at the time of the stroke or shortly thereafter.

Objective

To update its 2018 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for AF in older adults, the accuracy of screening tests, the effectiveness of screening tests to detect previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of screen-detected AF in older adults.

Population

Adults 50 years or older without a diagnosis or symptoms of AF and without a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF. (I statement).

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb: In patients 75 y of age and older at increased risk of bleeding but without frank contraindications, and in other patients with moderate risk factors for thromboembolism who are unable to safely tolerate anticoagulation at the standard intensity of INR 2.0 to 3.0, a lower INR target of 2.0 (range 1.6 to 2.5) may be considered for primary prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (Level of Evidence: C). When surgical procedures require interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy for longer than 1 wk in high-risk patients, unfractionated heparin may be administered or low-molecular-weight heparin given by subcutaneous injection, although the efficacy of these alternatives in this situation is uncertain (Level of Evidence: C).

Table 7 — meta-analyses of anti-coagulation strategies in atrial fibrillation (AF) relating to stroke report quantified effects across randomized comparisons. Adjusted-dose warfarin vs placebo (6 RCTs; n = 2900) shows RR 64% reduction with absolute reductions of 2.7% per year for primary prevention and 8.4% per year for secondary prevention; aspirin vs placebo or no therapy (7 RCTs; n = 3900) shows RR 19% reduction with absolute reductions of 0.8% per year for primary prevention and 2.5% per year for secondary prevention; and warfarin vs aspirin (8 RCTs; n = 3647) shows RR 38% reduction with primary and secondary prevention absolute reductions of 0.7% per year each. In pooled trials of non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) vs warfarin, stroke/systemic emboli outcomes (n = 29 312 NOAC; n = 29 272 warfarin) show RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.73–0.91; P < 0.0001; I2 = 47%: P = 0.03); subgroup analyses report n = 41 257 with no prior stroke (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–1.01) and n = 17 269 with prior stroke (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77–1.02; Pinteraction = 0.30). For ischaemic stroke the pooled RR is 0.92 (95% CI 0.83–1.02; P = 0.10; I2 = 32%: P = 0.22), while for haemorrhagic stroke it is 0.49 (95% CI 0.38–0.64; P < 0.0001; I2 = 34%: P = 0.21).

Thromboembolism — stroke burden and risk in elderly atrial fibrillation (AF) patients are highlighted as follows: Up to 25% of strokes in patients with AF may be due to other sources, and in patients 80 to 89 y old, 36% of strokes occur in those with AF. The annual risk of stroke for octogenarians with AF is in the range of 3% to 8% per year, depending on associated stroke risk factors. Among elderly AF patients, about half have hypertension and approximately 12% harbor carotid artery stenosis, while carotid atherosclerosis is probably a relatively minor contributing epidemiological factor in AF-associated stroke.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation… [^114rBC6q]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity, with a substantial increase in stroke and systemic thromboembolism. Strokes related to AF are associated with higher mortality, greater disability, longer hospital stays, and lower chance of being discharged home than strokes unrelated to AF. Objective. To provide an overview of current concepts and recent developments in stroke prevention in AF, with suggestions for practical management. Evidence Review A comprehensive structured literature search was performed using MEDLINE for studies published through March 11, 2015, that reported on AF and stroke, bleeding risk factors, and stroke prevention. Findings. The risk of stroke in AF is reduced by anticoagulant therapy. Thromboprophylaxis can be obtained with vitamin K antagonists or a non-VKA oral anticoagulant.

Major guidelines emphasize the important role of oral anticoagulation for effective stroke prevention in AF. Initially, clinicians should identify low-risk AF patients who do not require antithrombotic therapy. Subsequently, patients with at least 1 stroke risk factor should be offered OAC. A patient's individual risk of bleeding from antithrombotic therapy should be assessed, and modifiable risk factors for bleeding should be addressed. The international normalized ratio should be tightly controlled for patients receiving VKAs. Conclusions and Relevance. Stroke prevention is central to the management of AF, irrespective of a rate or rhythm control strategy.

Following the initial focus on identifying low-risk patients, all others with 1 or more stroke risk factors should be offered OAC. Lip GYH, Lane DA. Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review. JAMA. 2015; 313: 1950–1962.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

### Label adherence of direct oral anticoagulants dosing and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1148RSsD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is rapidly increasing globally, especially in the Asian population, 1, 2 and oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the principal management for stroke prevention in patients with AF. 3, 4 The efficacy and safety of the non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have all been shown at least as effective and safe as warfarin in large randomized controlled trials. 5, 6, 7, 8

Dose adjustment of NOACs is indicated in some AF patients, based on selected patient factors such as renal function, age, body weight, or concomitant medications. 9 However, whether these dose recommendations are adhered to in community practice remains a major concern. In a study with ORBIT‐AF II (Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II) database, 10 NOAC over‐ and underdosing were shown to be associated with increased risk for adverse events. In addition, a previous study using a large US administrative database with about 15 000 AF patients revealed that the prescribed doses were often inconsistent with the renal dose recommendation by Food and Drug Administration labeling. 11 In that study, inappropriate dose reduction was related to reduced effectiveness for stroke prevention without any safety benefit. Recently, we reported the real‐world effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in Korean AF patients in relationship to renal function. 12 Interestingly, low‐dose edoxaban had lower effectiveness for stroke prevention compared with warfarin at higher levels of creatinine clearance, which is called super normal renal function.

Therefore, in the current study, we sought to assess the frequency of label adherence of NOAC dosing among Korean AF patients, and to analyze the associations between off‐label NOAC dosing and clinical outcomes in real‐world clinical practice.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, general indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to decide on the therapy to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF with an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2% based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent.

### Is an oral anticoagulant necessary for young atrial fibrillation patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 (men) or 2 (women)? [^111mpZxF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this real‐world nationwide cohort study of nonanticoagulated Taiwanese AF patients, we demonstrated that AF patients with 1 risk factor in addition to sex (CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score 1 for men and 2 for women) had an ischemic stroke rate of 1.33% for patients aged 20 to 49 years, 2.90% for those aged 50 to 64 years, and 3.60% for those aged 65 to 74 years. Consequently, AF patients with 1 risk factor in addition to sex who are aged < 50 years should still be considered for stroke prevention using OACs because the annual risk of ischemic stroke (1.33%) was above the tipping point for the use of NOACs (0.9% per year). This approach could minimize the risk of a potentially fatal or disabling thromboembolic event and the public health burden of stroke related to AF.

Stroke Prevention for AF Patients With 1 Risk Factor in Addition to Sex

The 2012 focused update of the ESC AF management guidelines suggested that OACs should be prescribed for AF patients with 1 risk factor in addition to sex. 3 Recommendations for these patients were less clear in the 2014 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association AF guidelines, which suggested that "no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin or an OAC" be considered (class IIb recommendation). 4 Numerous registry studies and randomized trials suggested that the risk of ischemic stroke is higher for Asian compared with non‐Asian AF patients. 8, 17, 18, 19, 20 We showed, for example, that the annual risk of ischemic stroke was 2.75% for Asian men with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 1 and 2.55% for Asian women with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 2 5; therefore, these patients should receive OACs for stroke prevention, given the greater mortality and disability for AF‐related strokes.

Anticoagulation effects on stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) — Adjusted-dose warfarin is associated with a 64% (95% CI 49–74%) significantly lower risk of stroke, whereas aspirin alone is associated with a 19% (95% CI -1 to 35%) non-significant lower stroke risk; in head-to-head comparisons warfarin is associated with a 38% (95% CI 18–52%) stroke reduction versus aspirin. Compared with warfarin, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) reduce overall stroke and systemic emboli (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.91), driven in part by reduced haemorrhagic stroke (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39–0.59).

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^112DPRxR]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is a risk factor for stroke in elderly patients. Although warfarin has been used to prevent AF-associated stroke for more than 50 years, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban recently have been developed to overcome the disadvantages of warfarin. Based on the results of NOAC clinical trials, Savelieva and Camm made recommendations regarding selection of NOACs in patients with nonvalvular AF. Recent accumulating evidence indicates that NOACs work differently in Asian and non-Asian individuals. In this review, we discuss the results of the large, randomized, phase 3 international clinical trials on NOACs, the subanalyses of Asians, and a Japanese phase 3 clinical trial of rivaroxaban to discriminate Japanese patient-specific characteristics with regard to their responses to NOACs and make recommendations. Our analysis revealed that rivaroxaban decreased the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding compared with warfarin in Japanese patients. The efficacy results showed that rivaroxaban significantly decreased the incidence of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio: 0.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.96) compared with warfarin. The lower incidence of GI bleeding and ischemic stroke may be specific to Japanese patients. Based on the present and previous results, the following recommendations regarding the selection of NOACs are added in the Camm chart for Japanese patients: edoxaban for patients with a high risk of bleeding and those with a previous stroke; and rivaroxaban for patients with a high risk of ischemic stroke and a low bleeding risk, and those with previous GI bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack — treatment recommendations include that in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation (e.g., apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin) is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent; in patients with stroke or TIA and AF who do not have moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban is recommended in preference to warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with atrial flutter and stroke or TIA, anticoagulant therapy similar to that in AF is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, without moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, who are unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke at high risk of hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it is reasonable to delay initiation of oral anticoagulation beyond 14 days to reduce the risk of ICH; in patients with TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF, it is reasonable to initiate anticoagulation immediately after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke or TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF who have contraindications for lifelong anticoagulation but can tolerate at least 45 days, it may be reasonable to consider percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage with the Watchman device to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke and bleeding; in patients with stroke at low risk for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it may be reasonable to initiate anticoagulation 2 to 14 days after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; and in patients with AF and stroke or TIA who have end-stage renal disease or are on dialysis, it may be reasonable to use warfarin or apixaban (dose adjusted if indicated) for anticoagulation to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation from east Asia: a subanalysis of the apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial [^114qik6o]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The perceived risk of serious bleeding is an obstacle to the use of oral anticoagulation in East Asia. The efficacy and safety of apixaban in East Asian patients with atrial fibrillation are unknown.

Methods

ARISTOTLE included 18,201 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation randomized to apixaban 5mg twice daily or warfarin. The efficacy and safety of apixaban and warfarin among patients recruited from East Asia (n = 1,993) were compared with those recruited from outside East Asia (n = 16,208).

Results

Compared with warfarin, apixaban resulted in a consistent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism in East Asian (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.50–1.10) and non-East Asian (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99) patients (interaction P = .70). Consistent benefits of apixaban over warfarin were also seen for major bleeding in East Asian (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35–0.80) and non-East Asian (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62–0.83) patients (interaction P = .17). There was a greater reduction in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin in East Asian (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35–0.67) than in non-East Asian (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63–0.79) patients (interaction P = .03). Numerically higher rates of intracranial bleeding were seen in East Asian patients with warfarin but not with apixaban.

Conclusions

Apixaban resulted in similar reductions in stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and greater reductions in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in patients from East Asia. Warfarin is associated with more intracranial bleeding, particularly in patients from East Asia.

### Preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation… [^1145Uqvu]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke by 5-fold, and more than 40% of all strokes in patients older than 80 years are attributable to AF. 1 Worse yet, AF-related thromboembolic events lead to larger infarcts and poorer outcomes, such that patients with AF are more likely to develop significant disability after a stroke. 2 Moreover, AF-related strokes are 2. 5-fold more likely to be fatal. 1 Despite the significant morbidity and mortality due to AF, AF-related strokes can be prevented. Oral anticoagulation has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 64% and the risk of death by 26% in patients with AF. 3 In fact, oral anticoagulation has been the only intervention to improve survival in randomized clinical trials of AF therapy. For decades, warfarin sodium was the sole oral anticoagulant available for the prevention of AF-related stroke and systemic embolization.

In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Hsu and colleagues6 sought to determine how frequently patients with AF receive oral anticoagulation and whether or not the use of anticoagulation increased in patients with higher risk for stroke. Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence prospective, office-based quality improvement registry, they analyzed the use of oral anticoagulation in more than 429 000 patients with AF from 144 cardiology practices in 38 states. After adjusting for patient, physician, and practice characteristics, the authors found that increasing stroke risk was associated with an increased likelihood of oral anticoagulation. However, prescription of oral anticoagulation by cardiovascular specialists did not surpass 50% even in higher-risk patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score exceeding 4.

So, based on the data from the PINNACLE Registry, it seems that the more things have changed, the more they have stayed the same, despite recent advances in pharmacotherapy for stroke prevention. First, electronic medical record systems should be configured to remind health care professionals when a patient has an indication for oral anticoagulation and to provide clinical decision support tools. Second, while health care professionals have a key role in improving treatment, better patient education and shared decision making are also of paramount importance. Survey data indicate that only 64% of patients with AF understand that they are at increased risk for stroke. 8 If patients do not understand the importance of drug therapy, they may be less likely to assent or adhere to oral anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation treatment or intervention — care generally has 2 components (managing symptomatic arrhythmia and preventing stroke); symptomatic arrhythmia can be managed by rate control or restoring normal rhythm, with methods including electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and surgical or catheter ablation; to reduce stroke risk, oral anticoagulants include warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants; guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy for persons at high risk of stroke; and stroke risk stratification instruments such as CHA2DS2-VASc, which include age ≥ 75 years [doubled] and age 65–74 years among factors, were developed from clinically diagnosed rather than screen-detected AF populations.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation – an Asian stroke perspective [^111o6624]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Despite relatively lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Asians (~1%) than in Caucasians (~2%), Asia has a much higher overall disease burden because of its proportionally larger aged population. For example, on the basis of reported age-adjusted prevalence rates and projected population figures in China, there will be an estimated 5.2 million men and 3.1 million women with AF older than 60 years by year 2050. Stroke is a disabling complication of AF that is of increasing cause for concern in Asians patients. Implementing consensus expert recommendations for managing stroke risk in patients with AF can considerably reduce stroke rates. However, caution is necessary when aligning management of Asian patients with AF to that of their Caucasian counterparts. Current international guidelines and risk stratification tools for AF management are based on findings in predominantly Caucasian populations and may therefore have limited relevance, in certain respects, to Asian patients. Oral anticoagulants play an important role in preventing AF-related stroke. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin is recommended for reducing the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in high-risk patients with nonvalvular AF; however, warfarin interacts with many drugs and food ingredients, which may pose significant challenges in administration and monitoring among Asian patients. Further research is needed to inform specific guidance on the implications of different stroke and bleeding profiles in Asians vs Caucasians. Moreover, there is scope to improve physician perceptions and patient knowledge, as well as considering alternative new oral anticoagulants, for example, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors.

Aspirin for antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) — Meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials showed a stroke reduction of 19% (95% CI 2% to 34%), but effects varied; aspirin reduced stroke by 33% in primary prevention studies (placebo 5% per year) versus 11% in secondary prevention trials (placebo 14% per year). Aspirin may be more efficacious for AF patients with hypertension or diabetes and for reduction of noncardioembolic versus cardioembolic ischemic strokes; cardioembolic strokes are, on average, more disabling than noncardioembolic strokes. Aspirin appears to prevent nondisabling strokes more than disabling strokes, and thus the greater the risk of disabling cardioembolic stroke in a population of patients with AF, the less protection is afforded by aspirin.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic efficacy — adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation versus aspirin: Adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation is more efficacious than aspirin for prevention of stroke in patients with AF, with a 33% risk reduction (95% CI 13% to 49%) in a meta-analysis of 5 trials. Randomized trials involving high-risk AF patients (stroke rates greater than 6% per year) show larger relative risk reductions by adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation relative to aspirin, whereas relative risk reductions are consistently smaller in trials of AF patients with lower stroke rates; accordingly, oral anticoagulation may be most beneficial for AF patients at higher intrinsic thromboembolic risk, and the need for anticoagulation must be reevaluated periodically in all patients with AF.

Atrial fibrillation anticoagulation benefits in clinical AF populations are as follows: The USPSTF found no trials that reported on the benefits of anticoagulant therapy in screen-detected populations. In a pooled analysis of trials, warfarin treatment over a mean of 1.5 years was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50–0.93]), ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20–0.51]), and moderate to severely disabling stroke (pooled RR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19–0.78]) compared with the control group. Another meta-analysis of 21 studies found that all anticoagulant treatments (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) were associated with a lower risk of outcomes such as stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality compared with placebo or control groups.

### Stroke prevention in nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: a stakeholder perspective [^111ng4oX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The growing epidemic of atrial fibrillation worldwide has raised concerns about the dire need for effective stroke prevention systems in these patients. Fortunately, the last decade has witnessed a plethora of data on novel stroke prevention methods in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, optimal selection and effective implementation of these preventative strategies require an integrative approach that takes into account not only the available clinical data but also the perspective of each of the stakeholders involved (patient, physician, and society). The goal of this review was to discuss the contemporary issues surrounding stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation from the perspective of these 3 major stakeholders.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Asians with atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized trials and real-world studies [^115fKkRT]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Asia has the rapidly aging population; and the estimated population with AF and AF-associated stroke will be 72 million and 2.9 million in 2050, respectively. As such, oral anticoagulation therapy is mandatory for AF patients with a high risk of stroke in Asia. In the subanalyses of these NOAC trials, racial differences in baseline characteristics (eg, age, body weight, comorbidities), and rates of clinical outcomes between Asian and non-Asian patients have been reported. – Of particular note, Asian patients with AF have higher incidences of stroke and bleeding (in particular intracranial bleeding) than non-Asians. Therefore, more evidence should be explored to determine whether the use of NOACs is as effective and safe in Asians as that in non-Asians. Here, our meta-analysis suggested that compared with warfarin, (1) for the NOAC trials, standard-dose NOACs had reduced risks of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, whereas low-dose NOACs showed decreased rates of bleeding events and comparable thromboembolic risks; and (2) for the real-world data, both standard-dose and low-dose NOACs had reduced risks of efficacy and safety outcomes. Therefore, our findings would strengthen the current recommendation of standard-dose NOACs in Asians. However, our real-world data indicated that low-dose NOACs might also be an appealing therapeutic option for stroke prevention in Asian patients, but further studies should take more information into consideration before any recommendation could be made. Finally, although current publications supported that the use of NOACs was at least noninferior to warfarin in Asians irrespective of the NOAC type, further studies should focus on this issue and confirm the finding in relation to edoxaban. Our meta-analysis on NOAC data from observational studies in the Asians added important information and might help to overcome the under-use of oral anticoagulation therapy in Asian countries.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis [^115ExW9v]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the cornerstone treatment for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, is limited by the perceived risk of serious bleeding in Asia. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are safer alternatives. Here, we evaluate performance differences of NOACs between Asians and non-Asians.

Methods

We compared efficacy and safety of NOACs between patients enrolled in Asian and non-Asian countries using aggregative data from phase III clinical trials. The odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) were calculated by a random effects model.

Results

Comparing with VKAs, standard-dose NOACs reduced stroke or systemic embolism (OR = 0.65 [0.52–0.83] versus 0.85 [0.77–0.93], P interaction = 0.045) more in Asians than in non-Asians and were safer in Asians than in non-Asians about major bleeding (OR = 0.57 [0.44–0.74] versus 0.89 [0.76–1.04], P interaction = 0.004), hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 0.32 [0.19–0.52] versus 0.56 [0.44–0.70], P interaction = 0.046) in particular, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly increased in non-Asians (OR = 0.79 [0.48–1.32] versus 1.44 [1.12–1.85], P interaction = 0.041). Generally, low-dose NOACs were safer than VKAs without heterogeneity in efficacy and safety between Asians and non-Asians, except for ischemic stroke, major, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that standard-dose NOACs were more effective and safer in Asians than in non-Asians, whereas low-dose NOACs performed similarly in both populations.

Anticoagulation thresholds in atrial fibrillation — intermediate risk: although risk stratification schemes identify patients who benefit most and least from anticoagulation, the threshold for use of anticoagulation is controversial, and opinion is particularly divided about anticoagulation for those at intermediate risk (stroke rate 3% to 5% per year); some advocate routine anticoagulation at this level, whereas others favor selective anticoagulation with weight given to bleeding risks and preferences, and the threshold of benefit at which AF patients choose anticoagulation varies, with some at intermediate risk electing anticoagulation whereas others do not.

### Comparisons of rivaroxaban following different dosage criteria (ROCKET AF or J-ROCKET AF trials) in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^111TkzXv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with a global prevalence of 2% to 3%, which significantly increases the risk for thromboembolic events, congestive heart failure, and mortality. 1, 2, 3 Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants is important for the management of patients with AF. Vitamin K antagonist (eg, warfarin) has been recommended for stroke prevention among patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) for several decades. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are effective and safe alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF. 4, 5, 6, 7 The global ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 20 mg/d (15 mg/d if moderate renal impairment) compared with warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF. The results indicated that rivaroxaban was associated with comparable efficacy and safety to warfarin in patients with NVAF. 5 J‐ROCKET AF (Japanese Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) was a similar but much smaller study comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 15 mg/d (10 mg/d if moderate renal impairment) and warfarin in Japanese patients with NVAF, which showed a comparable risk of major bleeding and a strong trend for the reduction in the risk of stroke/systemic embolism with rivaroxaban 15/10 mg/d versus warfarin. 8 Of note, Taiwan is the only country that approved either a standard‐dose regimen (20/15 mg/d), following the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) dosage criteria, or low‐dose regimen (15/10 mg/d), following the J‐ROCKET AF dosage criteria, for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF around the world. However, 2 different dosage recommendations of rivaroxaban have not been previously compared. Also, data about the comparisons of rivaroxaban at the dose following J‐ROCKET AF and warfarin in daily practice outside Japan were limited. In the present study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban following ROCKET AF (20/15 mg/d) and J‐ROCKET AF (15/10 mg/d) among Asians with NVAF. In addition, the safety and efficacy of warfarin and rivaroxaban at either dosage criteria were also compared.

### Oral anticoagulants for Asian patients with atrial fibrillation [^115ParQA]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is the most-important intervention to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite a lower point prevalence of AF in Asian communities and Asian countries than in other populations, individuals of Asian ethnicity are at a disproportionately high risk of stroke and have greater consequent mortality. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are conventionally used for anticoagulation, and demonstrably reduce the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality in patients with AF. The use of warfarin in Asian countries is suboptimal, primarily owing to the universal challenge of achieving controlled anticoagulation with an unpredictable drug as well as concerns about the particularly high-risk of haemorrhage in Asian patients. Instead, antiplatelet therapy has been favoured in Asian communities, this strategy is neither safe nor effective for stroke prevention in these individuals. The non-vitamin K antagonist, oral anticoagulant drugs offer a solution to this challenge. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, and the direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have demonstrated noninferiority to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in international, randomized, controlled trials. Importantly, some of these drugs are also associated with a significantly lower incidence of major haemorrhage, and all result in lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage and haemorrhagic stroke than warfarin. In this article, we review the use of the non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in the management of AF in Asian populations.

### Two-year follow-up of patients with atrial fibrillation receiving edoxaban in routine clinical practice: results from the global ETNA-AF program [^112eCymF]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The annual risk of any stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is between 1% and 20%. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as edoxaban, are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF for the prevention of ischemic stroke. In a meta‐analysis of four pivotal studies, DOACs were associated with a combined 19% risk reduction for any stroke and systemic embolic events (SEEs), a 51% reduction in hemorrhagic stroke, and a 10% risk reduction of all‐cause mortality compared with VKAs. Major society guidelines recommend DOACs as the preferred drug class for stroke prevention in eligible patients with AF. In the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial, treatment with edoxaban versus warfarin prevented any stroke or SEEs with similar efficacy, lower rates of bleeding, and significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular (CV) causes.

Randomized controlled trials have strict inclusion criteria, which limit the selection of patients. In addition, randomized controlled trials have historically included limited representation from various geographical regions, including Asian countries. These limitations have contributed to trial populations that may not fully capture the diversity observed in real‐world settings. Noninterventional studies overcome this limitation by including patients without specific criteria or restrictions, leading to a more diverse study population. Data from real‐world and randomized controlled trials are consistent and show that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, effectively prevent thromboembolic events and exhibit similar or decreased risk of major bleeding compared with VKAs. Given these findings, additional data from real‐world analyses are needed demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of edoxaban in a diverse patient population over a long‐term follow‐up.

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — general clinical assumptions for arrhythmia monitoring after stroke state that the principal focus applies to patients at risk for recurrent stroke, and the writing committee endorses the evidence-based approaches to AF (atrial fibrillation) management recommended in the 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation and endorses the evidence-based approaches to stroke management recommended in the 2024 AHA/ASA Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke, the 2019 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease, and the 2021 AHA/ASA Guideline for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack. The algorithms assume the treating clinician will seek input as needed from a neurologist, cardiologist, cardiac electrophysiologist, pharmacist, hematologist, or palliative care specialist to guide clinical management, and Shared decision making (SDM) should be utilized to ensure optimal patient care decisions are made, with decisions jointly reflecting patient preference and the managing clinician. It also clarifies that This ECDP does not supersede good clinical judgment, that The treating clinician should seek input as needed from relevant experts, and that Clinicians should be careful to stay current on relevant information published after this ECDP.

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) — EHRA consensus recommendations emphasize that ECG confirmation of AF is needed before considering the patient for anticoagulation therapy, and detection of AF is of crucial importance in stroke survivors with efforts to screen for AF that should include prolonged ECG monitoring, eventually using external, or implanted loop recorders. Regular interrogation of PMs and ICDs memories, possibly using tele-surveillance, should be considered for earliest detection of subclinical AF and of AHRE. Intracardiac electrograms, rather than mode switching counters or marker channel analysis of AHRE episodes are recommended to confirm subclinical AF, and patients with AHRE should be referred for further individualized evaluation. In patients with AF or AHRE, but without additional stroke risk factors, anticoagulation is not recommended for stroke prevention. AHRE of > 5–6 min burden in combination with stroke risk factors (e.g. CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2) is associated with an increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism, although the low incidence of stroke associated with AHRE duration below 24 h makes uncertain the risk–benefit ratio of anticoagulation in this setting (randomized studies are ongoing). Repeated recordings can be considered to document AF in selected asymptomatic patients. When performed in high risk populations, screening for AF is advised because of its cost-effectiveness, and screening for AF should not be limited to symptomatic patients. All stakeholders in healthcare systems, and especially those in closest contact with patients, should be involved to increase awareness and education, increase patient's consciousness about the risks of untreated AF; and increase auto-surveillance, resulting in an earlier management of these patients as soon as AF is confirmed.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Asians with atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized trials and real-world studies [^115gUU4R]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the pooled data of the NOAC trials, we found that standard-dose NOAC users had reduced risks of both efficacy and safety outcomes in real-world patients with AF. Thus, our findings strengthen the recommendation of standard-dose NOACs in Asians. In addition, our data from the NOAC trials indicated that low-dose NOACs versus warfarin showed reduced risks of safety outcomes but comparable thromboembolic risks. By contrast, our real-world data suggested that low-dose NOACs were associated with reduced risks of both efficacy and safety outcomes of interest, indicating both standard-dose and low-dose NOACs might be appealing therapeutic options for stroke prevention in Asian patients. We speculate that the superiority of low-dose NOACs regarding the risk of thromboembolism may be due to the worse quality control of warfarin in real-world settings compared with that in the NOAC trials. Warfarin is commonly under-dosed to maintain a lower target international normalized ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 in the real-world practice in Asia, which may reduce the antithrombotic effects. Clinical outcomes would be better in warfarin users with time within therapeutic range ≥ 60% than in those with time within therapeutic range < 60%. Further studies could take time within therapeutic range of warfarin users into consideration to confirm if the advantage of low-dose NOACs over warfarin existed. And before that, NOACs (standard dose in particular) might be preferentially indicated in Asian patients with AF rather than warfarin.

Although our main results included data from > 1 NOAC (mostly from dabigatran), the subgroup analysis based on the NOAC type suggested that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban had better efficacy and safety profiles than warfarin in Asians with AF. Data on the efficacy and safety profiles of edoxaban in real-world settings are scarce. To date, Lee et alhave separately reported the effect of edoxaban versus warfarin in Asians, suggesting that the use of edoxaban has lower risks of thromboembolic and bleeding events. In the subgroups of age ≥ 65 or ≥ 75 years, NOACs versus warfarin was associated with reduced risks of both efficacy and safety outcomes of interest, suggesting that the advantage for NOACs over warfarin may persist in the elderly patients.

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care are well documented, although often underappreciated. In the setting of atrial fibrillation, stroke risk and severity may be higher in underrepresented ethnic populations. Additionally, the risk of bleeding is not uniform, and pharmacogenetics play an important role in anticoagulant therapy. In this narrative review, we discuss the complex issues surrounding stroke prevention in underrepresented ethnic groups with atrial fibrillation.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to stroke risk assessment, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to take into consideration factors that might modify the risk of stroke to help inform the decision in patients with AF at intermediate annual risk of thromboembolic events (based on risk scores, such as equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in males or 2 in females) remaining uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation.

### Stroke prevention strategies in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation [^111kyM7E]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Effective stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. The use of OAC reduces the risk of stroke and death. For most patients with atrial fibrillation without moderate or severe mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic mechanical heart valves, treatment options include vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Although most guidelines generally recommend NOACs as the first-line OAC, caution is required in some groups of patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding who have been under-represented or not studied in the randomized clinical trials on NOACs for stroke prevention. In addition to OAC, non-pharmacological, percutaneous therapies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, for stroke prevention have emerged, sometimes used in combination with catheter ablation for the treatment of the atrial fibrillation. High-risk groups of patients with atrial fibrillation include patients with end-stage renal failure (including those receiving dialysis), extremely old patients (such as those aged > 80 years with multiple risk factors for bleeding), patients with dementia or those living in a long-term care home, patients with previous intracranial bleeding or recent acute bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding), patients with acute ischaemic stroke and patients with an intracardiac thrombus. This Review provides an overview of stroke prevention strategies, including left atrial appendage occlusion, in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke and bleeding.

### Periprocedural outcomes associated with use of a left atrial appendage occlusion device in China [^114YVHvX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulant (OAC) medication is the standard of care in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at risk of stroke; however, there are multiple groups of patients in whom an alternative strategy is required. This need arises for several reasons, including contraindications to OAC, adverse effects from OAC, adherence, and quality-of-life issues.

Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a nonpharmacological strategy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, and data from randomized trials and meta-analyses have suggested that LAAO has comparable efficacy to warfarin, and novel OACs (NOACs). Data from several registries have also confirmed the safety of LAAO, with low rates of complications. Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC)and American College of Cardiology (ACC)guidelines recommend LAAO for patients with nonvalvular AF who have contraindications or are unsuitable for long-term OAC (class IIb recommendations).

East Asian individuals are one of the largest ethnic groups, with a population in excess of 1.5 billion. Compared with other ethnic groups, East Asian individuals have a unique risk-benefit trade-off in the management of stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF, with reduced anti-ischemic benefits and increased bleeding risk with antithrombotic therapies, particularly intracranial bleeding, known as the "East Asian paradox"; the adherence with OAC is also commonly suboptimal. Consequently, East Asian patients with nonvalvular AF may have a greater benefit from nonpharmacological strategies for stroke prevention, such as implantation of an LAAO device. However, clinical outcomes from LAAO implants in East Asian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or other ethnic groups have been less well-documented in large cohorts. How applicable the results from prior randomized clinical trials, and registries, are to East Asian patients is questionable, given that these studies primarily enrolled White populations (between 92% to 94%).

### Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^117Awxd8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age ≥ 75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1157zA9R]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116SiTKb]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — cardiopathy and cardiomyopathy: Atrial cardiopathy without clinical atrial fibrillation (AF) is a risk factor for stroke, and studies of anticoagulation in atrial high-rate events and cryptogenic stroke have not been effective in preventing stroke, suggesting subclinical AF and other tachyarrhythmias with subsequent thromboembolism may not be the only mechanism responsible for increased stroke risk. Among patients with cardiomyopathy and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, trials show a signal for reduced ischemic strokes with anticoagulation but negative primary outcomes, low stroke event rates, and significantly higher bleeding risk; therefore, the net benefit for any one patient remains unknown, and future trials should target those at highest stroke risk and consider individualized risk/benefit thresholds. There are no data assessing antiplatelet therapy versus placebo for primary stroke prevention in patients with cardiomyopathy, which may be an area for future research.

### Identification of markers associated with development of stroke in "Clinically low-risk" atrial fibrillation patients [^112qJB1D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 5‐fold increased risk of stroke compared with matched individuals without AF, and strokes associated with AF are more likely to be fatal and disabling. 1 Effective stroke prevention requires oral anticoagulation (OAC), 2 but this should be counterbalanced by the potential risk of OAC‐related bleeding events. 1 As a consequence, decision‐making on whether OAC therapy should be prescribed requires careful risk stratification. 3

The CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score is now used in many guidelines for risk stratification and has a good performance in identifying nonvalvular AF patients at low stroke risk. 4 Nevertheless, stroke and thromboembolic events still occur in such "low‐risk" AF patients as categorized by the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. 3, 5 Recently, the introduction of the non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) has changed the landscape for stroke prevention in AF, although regional differences are apparent. 6 The availability of NOAC has shifted the stroke treatment threshold down to ≈0.9 event per 100‐person years; indeed, NOACs can be considered even for AF patients with a nongender CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 1. 7, 8

The incidence of stroke among AF patients, especially in a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 0 or 1, varies among different cohort populations. 5 Previous studies have suggested that the application of a modified CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score might be more appropriate for stroke prevention in Asian populations. 9, 10 In addition, the influence of female sex (the Sc criterion in CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc) on stroke risk in "low‐risk" AF patients is debatable because female sex may be a risk modifier rather than a risk factor. 11, 12 In such low‐risk patients, use of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VA score (ie, female sex is excluded, or nongender CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score) would suffice for risk stratification of such AF patients. 12

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in Asians with atrial fibrillation: meta-analysis of randomized trials and real-world studies [^114G973q]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common arrhythmias, affects millions of people worldwide; and AF-related thromboembolic events are the leading cause of neurological disability and mortality. Appropriate thromboprophylaxis is an urgent need for stroke prevention in AF. Although vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, have proven effective for stroke prevention, their shortcomings (eg, marked inter and intraindividual variations in medication dosage, narrow therapeutic window, frequent monitoring of anticoagulant activity, and interactions with other drugs) would limit their use in clinical practice. More recently, 4 phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists and even have a better safety profile in the worldwide AF patients. –

Wang et alhave demonstrated that standard-dose NOACs are more effective and safer in Asians than that in non-Asians, whereas low-dose NOACs versus warfarin have similar efficacy and safety outcomes between Asian and non-Asian race. For this study, 5 subanalyses of NOAC-related trials – were analyzed for rivaroxaban (ROCKET AF [Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation]), apixaban (ARISTOTLE [Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation]), dabigatran (RE-LY [Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy]), edoxaban (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 [Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48]), and rivaroxaban (J-ROCKET AF [Japanese-Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation]). Another meta-analysis found that standard-dose versus low-dose NOACs show a reduced rate of ischemic stroke without an excess of bleeding risks. And subsequently, 2017 consensus of the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society on stroke prevention in AF recommends that standard-dose NOACs should be considered as the first choice in Asians. Nevertheless, in the study of Wang et al, the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trialcompared the safety and efficacy of edoxaban versus warfarin in East Asians with non-East Asians. However, the East Asian group did not include the Japanese population, whereas patients from all other countries, including South Asia, were regarded as the non-East Asian group. Given the fact that the effect of edoxaban versus warfarin for patients with Asian race is still unclear, Chao et alreperformed the subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial. Therefore, the first section of this meta-analysis was aimed to update the available information of NOACs versus warfarin in Asians with AF.

### Efficacy, safety, and bleeding risk factor analysis of oral anticoagulants in AF patients ≥ 65 years of age: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^111BB57S]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia, with a worldwide prevalence of 2–4%, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. A study by Singer et al. suggested that age is a continuous risk factor for increased risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF, with an increased risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF between the ages of 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84, and ages ≥ 85 years by a factor of 2.38, 4.46, and 8.14, respectively. Therefore, oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in elderly patients with AF who have risk factors for stroke. In AF patients, stroke prevention can be performed in high risk patients based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score, and anticoagulation prophylaxis with warfarin has traditionally been recommended. However, overcoming some of the limitations of warfarin, and with the advantages of a predictable pharmacological effect and no need for routine coagulation monitoring, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have become the most commonly prescribed medication for the prevention of ischaemic stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and these advantages may improve the convenience of medication for elderly patients. However, the comparison between NOACs and warfarin in clinical practice in elderly Asian patients has not been well studied.

Four large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are noninferior to warfarin in preventing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism as well as major bleeding. However, in elderly patients with AF, there are some discrepancies in populations of different ages and countries. In addition, older patients in RCT are usually a selected group who are relatively healthy and have fewer comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and coronary atherosclerosis. However, in real-world trials, elderly patients with AF are often accompanied by cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hepatic and renal insufficiency, and extreme body weight, all of which can affect the pharmacokinetics of NOACs, and increase the risk of adverse events (e.g. hemorrhage). Real-world populations differ from those in RCT, and these differences may have a significant impact on the benefit-risk ratio of NOACs, compared with warfarin. Therefore, it is important to analyze the effectiveness and safety of NOACs use in real-world elder adults.

### Analysis of the 2024 ESC / EACTS guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^116jYxMT]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) emphasize a patient-centered approach to management, structured around the AF-CARE pathway: Comorbidity and risk factor management (C), Avoiding stroke and thromboembolism (A), Reducing symptoms through rate and rhythm control (R), and Evaluation and dynamic reassessment (E). This framework ensures that comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, and obesity are effectively managed to prevent disease progression and improve outcomes. A key principle of the guidelines is shared decision making involving patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare teams to ensure individualized care that reflects patient preferences. The guidelines also stress healthcare equity, advocating for the elimination of disparities related to sex, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status. For diagnosis, electrocardiographic confirmation of clinical AF is essential, followed by risk stratification using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score to guide anticoagulation therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants are preferred for most patients because of their good safety profile. Stroke prevention is prioritized, with rhythm control as first-line treatment for suitable patients. For those with persistent symptoms despite medications, catheter ablation is recommended. Rate control strategies, including beta-blockers, digoxin, and calcium channel blockers, are used to manage heart rate and symptoms. Ongoing education for patients, families, and providers supports informed decision making and dynamic reassessment, optimizing patient outcomes and quality of life.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of death and disability and is associated with a 4‐ to 5‐fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. 1, 2 With appropriate patient selection, antithrombotic prophylaxis with oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy reduces the risks of stroke and all‐cause mortality by approximately 64% and 26%, respectively. 3

For decades, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and antiplatelet drugs were the only treatment choices for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Although VKAs are superior to antiplatelet drugs for stroke prevention, 3, 4 they have many food and drug interactions 5 and require frequent laboratory monitoring. 6 The non‐VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed to address some of these shortcomings. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are currently approved for use in the United States and Canada. 7, 8, 9, 10 Compared with warfarin, the NOACs display similar efficacy for stroke prevention and have a generally superior safety profile for bleeding risks, especially for intracranial bleeds. 7, 8, 9, 10

As stroke‐prevention therapies have advanced, criteria used to select patients for OAC have also evolved. Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) recommend OAC for patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2. 11 These guidelines also state that in patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score of 1, any OAC, aspirin, or no antithrombotic are reasonable. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) currently recommends OAC for patients with 1 CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc risk factor other than female sex or vascular disease, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends OAC therapy for all males with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 1 and females with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2. 12, 13 As the global burden of AF has increased, patients are increasing in age, number, and complexity, and there is variability in OAC prescription practice that may, in part, reflect regional practice differences and guidelines. 14, 15 Maximizing the guideline‐based use of OAC is an important goal. The recent IMProve treatment with AntiCoagulanTs in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (IMPACT‐AF) study demonstrated that educational interventions were able to increase the appropriate use of OAC in patients with AF, and that this was associated with a corresponding reduction in the rate of stroke. 16

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — stroke prevention conclusions state that stroke is a serious complication of AF with risk varying across patient groups and that antithrombotic prophylaxis is associated with increased bleeding risk; recommendations are based on net clinical benefit across varying stroke-risk levels. Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, decisions require an individualized approach considering patient values and preferences, bleeding risk, and non-CHADS2 stroke risk factors. The role of oral anticoagulation for prevention of stroke in AF will evolve with results of large, ongoing, phase 3 RCTs of new oral anticoagulants and as experience with these new agents in clinical practice continues to grow.

Atrial fibrillation — stroke prevention risk stratification prioritizes CHA2DS2-VASc; according to CHA2DS2-VASc, patients with score of ≥ 1 in a male or ≥ 2 in a female should be considered for stroke prevention strategies, and although several scores (ABC-stroke, ATRIA, GARFIELD, QStroke) exist, the one currently most widely applied and recommended by international guidelines is CHA2DS2-VASc, noting that no stroke risk scheme has perfect predictive accuracy.

Introduction

Approximately 15 million people worldwide have a stroke each year. Atrial fibrillation is an important risk factor, accounting for approximately 15% of all strokes, and the highest incidence is in older patients. Clinical studies in selected trial populations have shown the efficacy of warfarin for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. On the basis of available data, both European and US guidelines recommend adjusted dose warfarin treatment for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Despite the existing evidence, the translation of clinical trial evidence into routine clinical practice is often challenging. Most clinical trials of warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation did not specifically enroll patients admitted to hospital for acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, clinical trials often have very strict protocols with regard to selection of patients, follow-up, monitoring, and dose adjustment to maximize a patient's time in the therapeutic range. Furthermore, most population based studies are from European countries, and the rate of anticoagulation after stroke in atrial fibrillation patients has improved dramatically in the past decade. Whether the efficacy seen in clinical trials translates into effectiveness in contemporary practice is unclear, especially for secondary prevention among older patients who have already had an ischemic stroke and in clinically relevant subgroups that have higher risks of bleeding and more challenging warfarin management.

From a patient's perspective, an important measure of the benefit of anticoagulant treatment beyond survival is the prevention of recurrent events or prolonged hospital admissions. Focus groups identify "being alive, without recurrent stroke, and without being hospitalized for complications" as the most desirable outcome. This patient centered outcomes measure, which we have called "home time", has not been well studied as an endpoint in clinical trials. Using data from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) program linked with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) claims data, we evaluated the association between warfarin treatment and longitudinal outcomes after ischemic stroke in the general atrial fibrillation population, as well as among clinically relevant subgroups of patients.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk scoring — appropriate use, reassessment, and misuse cautions: As with all clinical scores based on clinical factors, the CHA2DS2-VASc score only performs modestly for predicting high-risk patients who sustain events, and use of simplified scores to artificially categorize patients into low-, moderate-, and high-risk strata can be problematic. There is the move to focus in the clinical decision-making on identifying low-risk patients who do not need antithrombotic therapy first, following which stroke prevention can be offered to AF patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors. Stroke risk is also highly dynamic, and a clinical reassessment may be needed every 4–6 months to optimize risk re-assessment. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to predict new onset AF, again something it was not designed for, and another misuse of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is the prediction of bleeding risk; formal comparisons show that the CHA2DS2-VASc (and older CHA2DS2) score are inferior to a formal bleeding risk score such as the HAS-BLED score, for the prediction of major bleeding in AF patients. For bleeding risk management, appropriate use of bleeding risk scores such as HAS-BLED is to address modifiable bleeding risk factors and to schedule the 'high-risk' patients for early and more frequent follow-up visits (e.g. 4 weeks rather than 4 months).

### How would you manage this patient with recent-onset atrial fibrillation? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115AEHEC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Risk factors for AF include obstructive sleep apnea, physical inactivity, obesity, cigarette use, and alcohol misuse. Atrial fibrillation substantially increases the risk for stroke and is associated with higher rates of mortality than for individuals without AF. Strategies to prevent these risk factors and to optimize those that already exist reduce the risk for subsequent AF. Physicians play an important role in proposing strategies to reduce the risk for AF among patients. Decision making regarding management of AF is often complex and requires consideration of symptoms, burden of AF (the percentage of time in AF), comorbid conditions that increase stroke risk, and the risk for bleeding. In particular, novel risk scoring systems to predict stroke risk, and consideration of factors beyond those in these tools, refine the ability to identify patients with AF who are most likely to benefit from anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk. Early use of catheter ablation of AF in selected patients improves symptoms and reduces the potential for progression from intermittent to persistent AF. A 2023 collaborative guideline from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American College of Chest Physicians, and the Heart Rhythm Society addressed multiple aspects of care of patients with AF. Here, a general cardiologist and a cardiac electrophysiologist discuss recommendations derived from this guideline and how to apply them to the care of a particular patient.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — risk thresholds and number needed to treat — shows that patients with a stroke risk of 2% per year or less do not benefit substantially from oral anticoagulation because it would require treating 100 or more patients for 1 y to prevent a single stroke, whereas for high‑risk patients with stroke rates of 6% per year or greater the number needed‑to‑treat is 25 or fewer, strongly favoring anticoagulation; opinion remains divided about routine anticoagulation for patients at intermediate stroke risk (annual rate 3% to 5%).

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) stroke prevention — The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used in many guidelines and is best at initially identifying low risk patients (i.e. CHA2DS2-VASc 0 in males, 1 in females) who do not need any antithrombotic therapy, following which the next step is to offer stroke prevention to those with ≥ 1 additional stroke risk factors. Oral anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonists (VKA, e.g. warfarin) significantly reduces stroke/systemic thromboembolism and all-cause mortality, compared with control or placebo, and the non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer additional advantages in overall efficacy (with a significant reduction in stroke and mortality), safety (especially with the reduction in intracranial bleeding) and relative convenience compared to the VKAs.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) consensus recommendations — female sex and stroke prevention: In AF patients, female sex is associated with an age-dependent moderate risk of stroke and should be regarded as a stroke risk modifier relevant in the presence of other CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors, rather than an independent stroke risk factor. AF patients aged < 65 years, with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 due to female sex have low annual stroke rates (generally < 1%) and do not need any antithrombotic therapy. Females with AF and ≥ 1 additional stroke risk factors (i.e. with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2) should be considered for OAC. NOACs are recommended in preference to VKAs females and males with AF. Aspirin should not be used for stroke prevention in females and males with AF, since aspirin is essentially ineffective and associated to similar risk of bleeding compared with NOACs or VKAs.

Thrombo-embolic risk and anticoagulation therapy for female patients — Atrial fibrillation (AF) currently affects at least 12.6 million females and 20.9 million males worldwide, and observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) consistently report higher crude stroke rates in females compared with male AF patients. A recent meta-analysis of 30 studies (including five RCTs) revealed an overall stroke risk ratio of 1.31 (1.18–1.46) for female sex, and a recent large observational AF study reported an unadjusted 19.0% (17.0–20.1%) population-attributable stroke risk for female sex with a significant association that remained on extensive multivariable analysis. AF-related strokes are more severe than strokes from other causes, with high 30-day mortality (24–33%) or severe permanent disability (35%), and female sex was associated with greater initial stroke severity and worse long-term outcomes (ie, dependency and stroke recurrence, but not mortality); female sex is included in the CHA2DS2-VASc score recommended by international AF management guidelines for thrombo-embolic risk assessment.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb low-risk and treatment intensification: In patients with AF younger than 60 y without heart disease or risk factors for thromboembolism (lone AF), the risk of thromboembolism is low without treatment and the effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of stroke relative to the risk of bleeding has not been established (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

### The burden of atrial fibrillation and unmet needs of its management in southeast Asia and south Asia [^111ThppP]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cardiac rhythm disorder with an increasing global prevalence and significant consequences on outcomes such as ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SSE), major bleeding, and death. Racial differences in SSE and bleeding are reported between Asians and non-Asians, thus this Comment aims to highlight the challenges of AF care in Southeast Asia (SEA) and South Asia (SA). We discuss the guideline recommendations for management of patients with AF in Asian countries, as well as the unmet needs in Thailand, India, and Sri Lanka. These countries are low-middle-income countries, with major differences in the healthcare system, access to health technology, and number of medical personnel.

The prevalence of AF in SEA is increasing at a faster rate than the global trends (Supplementary Fig. S1). Globally, it is estimated that the number of people living with AF has increased from 33.5 million in 2010 to 59 million in 2019. The prevalence of AF in predominantly Caucasian populations is 1%–2%. Studies in Asia consistently report lower prevalence (1%). Despite having a relatively lower prevalence of AF, Asia has a much higher number of patients with AF due to its larger population size. In a cross-sectional survey of the population aged over 65 years in the northern region of Thailand, the prevalence of AF was 1.9%. Challenges in AF screening, access to medications, rate and rhythm control, and guideline implementation are elaborated in the Supplementary materials.

There are differences in the recommendations of AF screening among Asian countries. Opportunistic screening can be applied to all Asian countries, especially for those older than 65 years. However, systematic screening for those with high risk for stroke or age more than 75 years may only be feasible in some Asian countries, particularly high-income countries with adequate healthcare resources.

Many AF registries have enrolled AF patients from multiple countries, including SEA/SA. Table 1 demonstrates the profiles of study population, including oral anticoagulant (OAC) patterns and outcomes of several AF registries. Notably, the profiles of study populations vary significantly different across the registries. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are used much less in SEA/SA and Asians had more major bleeding compared to non-Asians. The mortality rate remains high, and major bleeding rates remain a significant concern among Asian AF patients.
