## Question

## Task B-2.7.

Mirko is swimming from the northern to the southern, and Slavko from the eastern to the western shore of the lake. At the initial moment of observation, Mirko is 600 meters north, and Slavko 400 meters east of a buoy located somewhere in the middle of the lake. Both swimmers move uniformly in a straight line, Mirko at a speed of $1.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, and Slavko at a speed of $1.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. After how much time from the start of the observation will the distance between Mirko and Slavko be the smallest possible? Will both swimmers cross the level of the buoy at the moment when this distance is the smallest? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the distance between two swimmers moving at constant velocities will be minimized, and whether both swimmers will be at the buoy's level at that exact moment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about setting up a coordinate system and writing parametric equations for each swimmer's position as a function of time. Then, I should derive the distance between them as a function of time and find its minimum using calculus. Next, I will verify whether each swimmer's y-coordinate (north-south for Mirko) or x-coordinate (east-west for Slavko) is zero at that time, which corresponds to crossing the buoy's level. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and interpret the results clearly.

> Let me first confirm the coordinate system and initial conditions. I will place the buoy at the origin (0, 0), with north as the positive y-direction and east as the positive x-direction. Initially, Mirko is 600 meters north, so his starting position is (0, 600), and he swims south at 1.6 m/s, so his velocity vector is (0, −1.6). Slavko starts 400 meters east, so his initial position is (400, 0), and he swims west at 1.2 m/s, so his velocity vector is (−1.2, 0). Wait, let me verify the directions: south decreases y and west decreases x, which matches the problem statement.

> Next, I should write the position functions. Mirko's position at time t is (0, 600 − 1.6t), and Slavko's position at time t is (400 − 1.2t, 0). Hold on, I should verify the signs: Mirko's y-coordinate decreases with time because he is moving south, and Slavko's x-coordinate decreases with time because he is moving west, so these expressions are correct.

> Now I will compute the squared distance between them, because minimizing the squared distance is equivalent to minimizing the distance and avoids square roots. The squared distance D²(t) is (400 − 1.2t − 0)² + (0 − (600 − 1.6t))², which simplifies to (400 − 1.2t)² + (1.6t − 600)². Let me expand this carefully: (400 − 1.2t)² = 160,000 − 960t + 1.44t², and (1.6t − 600)² = 2.56t² − 1,920t + 360,000, so D²(t) = 4.00t² − 2,880t + 520,000. I should double-check the coefficients: 1.44 + 2.56 = 4.00, −960 − 1,920 = −2,880, and 160,000 + 360,000 = 520,000, which is correct.

> To find the minimum, I will take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero. d(D²)/dt = 8.00t − 2,880 = 0, so t = 2,880 / 8.00 = 360 seconds. Wait, let me verify the division: 2,880 ÷ 8 = 360, yes, that's 6 minutes. I should confirm this is a minimum by checking the second derivative: 8.00 > 0, so it is indeed a minimum.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about whether they cross the buoy's level at that time. I need to check each swimmer's coordinate at t = 360 seconds. For Mirko, y(360) = 600 − 1.6 × 360 = 600 − 576 = 24 meters north of the buoy, so he has not yet reached the buoy's latitude. For Slavko, x(360) = 400 − 1.2 × 360 = 400 − 432 = −32 meters, which means he is 32 meters west of the buoy, so he has already passed the buoy's longitude. Therefore, neither swimmer is at the buoy's level at the time of closest approach, and they cross the buoy's level at different times. I should double-check the arithmetic: 1.6 × 360 = 576 and 1.2 × 360 = 432, so the conclusions hold.

> Let me reconsider the exact times when each swimmer crosses the buoy's level, even though the question only asks whether they do so at the time of minimum distance. Mirko reaches y = 0 when 600 − 1.6t = 0, so t = 600 / 1.6 = 375 seconds, which is 15 seconds after the minimum-distance time. Slavko reaches x = 0 when 400 − 1.2t = 0, so t = 400 / 1.2 ≈ 333.33 seconds, which is about 26.67 seconds before the minimum-distance time. This confirms that the minimum distance occurs between the two crossing events, not at either crossing.

> Final answer: The distance between Mirko and Slavko is minimized at t = 360 seconds, which is 6 minutes after the start. At that moment, Mirko is 24 meters north of the buoy and Slavko is 32 meters west of the buoy, so neither swimmer is at the buoy's level when the distance is smallest. I should confirm the units and phrasing: 360 seconds equals 6 minutes, and the positional offsets are correct based on the calculations above.

The minimum distance between Mirko and Slavko occurs at **t = 360 seconds** (6 minutes) [^9cd3834e], when the distance is 40 meters. At this time, Mirko is 24 meters north and Slavko is 32 meters west of the buoy, so **neither swimmer is at the buoy's level**. The minimum distance is found by minimizing the squared distance function, which yields a unique critical point at t = 360 seconds, confirmed by the second derivative test.

---

## Position functions of the swimmers

Let the buoy be at the origin (0, 0). Mirko starts at (0, 600) and swims south at 1.6 m/s, so his position at time t is:

[
M(t) = (0, 600–1.6t)
]

Slavko starts at (400, 0) and swims west at 1.2 m/s, so his position at time t is:

[
S(t) = (400–1.2t, 0)
]

---

## Distance between the swimmers

The distance between Mirko and Slavko at time t is:

[
D(t) = \\sqrt{(400–1.2t)^2 + (600–1.6t)^2}
]

To minimize D(t), we minimize the squared distance:

[
D^2(t) = (400–1.2t)^2 + (600–1.6t)^2
]

---

## Minimizing the squared distance

Expanding D²(t):

[
D^2(t) = 160000–960t + 1.44t^2 + 360000–1920t + 2.56t^2
]

[
D^2(t) = 4t^2–2880t + 520000
]

Taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

[
\\frac{d(D^2)}{dt} = 8t - 2880 = 0
]

[
t = 360 \\text{ seconds}
]

The second derivative is 8 > 0, confirming a **minimum** at t = 360 seconds.

---

## Positions at the time of minimum distance

At t = 360 seconds:

- **Mirko's position**: (M(360) = (0, 600–1.6 \\times 360) = (0, 24))
- **Slavko's position**: (S(360) = (400–1.2 \\times 360, 0) = (-32, 0))

The minimum distance is:

[
D(360) = \\sqrt{(-32)^2 + 24^2} = \\sqrt{1024 + 576} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40 \\text{ meters}
]

---

## Do both swimmers cross the buoy level at the minimum distance?

Mirko crosses the buoy level (y = 0) when (600–1.6t = 0), i.e. at t = 375 seconds, which is **after the minimum distance time**. Slavko crosses the buoy level (x = 0) when (400–1.2t = 0), i.e. at t ≈ 333.33 seconds, which is **before the minimum distance time**. Therefore, **neither swimmer is at the buoy level** when the distance is minimized.

---

## Conclusion

The minimum distance between Mirko and Slavko is **40 meters** and occurs at **t = 360 seconds** (6 minutes). At this time, Mirko is 24 meters north and Slavko is 32 meters west of the buoy, so **neither swimmer is at the buoy's level**.

Swooping minimizes stall distance

Minimizing either time or energy under the model requires high lift coefficients C L = 2 L /(ρV 2 S) to be sustained in the glide phase, where L is lift, ρ is air density, V is airspeed and S is wing area. This is necessary to induce the high drag needed to brake with high force in the short glide phase minimizing flight time (Fig. 3e–h) and to support body weight at the low airspeeds sustained in the long glide phase minimizing energetic cost (Fig. 3a–d). High lift coefficients may be achieved transiently during unsteady perching manoeuvres,, but stall cannot be delayed indefinitely and will compromise control authority when it occurs,,,. We therefore propose that birds aim to minimize the distance from the perch at which high lift coefficients become necessary to complete the glide phase. We tested this hypothesis by identifying the transition point that minimized the distance flown at C L > 4. We set this threshold lift coefficient high to avoid penalizing the comparably high lift coefficients achieved transiently in a rapid pitch-up manoeuvre, but found the resulting solutions to be robust to the selection of lower threshold lift coefficients (Extended Data Fig. 4). Exceeding the threshold lift coefficient on the glide need not mean that a trajectory will fail, but rather that flapping may become necessary to maintain control authority after the stall, at a cost that will presumably scale with the distance remaining to the perch. This cost could manifest itself in several ways, including through (1) the control effort needed to steer a trajectory under high aerodynamic load; (2) the energy needed to flap the wings to achieve such high loads; and (3) the requirement to stabilize gaze against wingbeat oscillations on final approach.

Conclusions

Radiation oncologists learn early in training about the importance of time, distance, and shielding to minimize exposure to radioisotopes. We can apply those same principles to exposure to this virus. vOTVs allow us to dramatically increase our distance from the source and significantly decrease our time exposed to the source when in-person assessments are necessary. PPE provides shielding when we do need to interact with patients. However, PPE is not perfect protection. Time and distance are our best defenses. We should all be doing everything possible to keep our exposure as low as reasonably allowable. Given that experts anticipate a second wave of infections coinciding with influenza in the fall, using vOTVs in addition to virtual consults and follow-ups to minimize our exposure risks to both of these vectors seems prudent and should be strongly considered.

Time of closest approach

Time of closest approach (TCA) in two agents’ interaction is the time it takes for the agents to minimize their relative distance assuming constant velocities. Schwarz’sTCA formulation, in our terms, is

Figure 3 b is a shared space similar to Fig. 3 a. The agents move toward each other with constant velocities. After TCA seconds, the agents reach a point where the e-scooter–pedestrian distance is minimal. Fig. 3 c is the evolution of PTTC and TCA for the two cases in Fig. 3 b up to the passing point; T p is also shown. Note that the change in W does not affect TCA in the depicted scenario, and pedestrian j has the same TCA as pedestrian k while T p is sensitive to W. Figure 3 d is the evolution of TCA and PTTC for an actual trial. PTTC has a vertical asymptote when cos(θ) approaches zero at the passing point. However, it does not matter in safety assessments because the agents have practically passed each other, and large T p s are safe.

Model-free deep reinforcement learning

For navigating across an unsteady wake, we trained the artificial agent using Deep RL to maximize a cumulative reward through repeated experiences with the surrounding environment. The reward was composed of two parts: a sparse reward of 200 D given as a completion bonus once the swimmer reached within 0.15 D from the target, and a dense reward offered at every timestep equal to the change in distance between the swimmer and the target. Swimmers that exited the simulation domain, collided with the cylinder, or exceeded a maximum completion time were treated as unsuccessful. The RL algorithm maximized the return, which is the cumulative discounted reward with discount factor γ = 0.995.Here, time is implicitly minimized during training because of the structure of the return R t, or objective function as the discounted reward at the initial state. Given γ < 1, later rewards are discounted more. The sparse component of the reward—the success bonus—is significantly larger than the dense reward, but it is given to the agent at the last timestep only if the target is reached, thus the overall value of R t highly depends on the weight before the sparse reward component. Given that the incremental reward is the increase or decrease in relative distance at each time step, and because rewards received at later time steps contribute less to R t, the RL training implicitly converges to a time-optimal strategy, as opposed to the optimal control approach where time is explicitly minimized (6). In cases when the trained RL policy does not reach the minimal time derived from optimal control, it occurs primarily because of the limitations in available sensory information, which hinders the RL agent’s ability to make perfectly informed decisions at every step (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

Study operations—screening, mitigation, and personal protective equipment for in-person procedures state that virtual informed consent and remote assessments should be considered when possible; COVID-19 screening should be implemented before procedures, occur as close as possible to the visit, and include a comprehensive symptom screen with contactless temperature checks; best practice would reschedule any subject reporting symptoms; point-of-care antigen testing could be considered and should be strongly considered for high-risk studies; distance should be maximized and contact time minimized; appropriate personal protective equipment should be used including medical or surgical masks and eye protection with meticulous hand hygiene; N95 masks should be used in the event of aerosol-generating procedures; adequate supplies of PPE and cleaning materials should be in place, and if shortages occur for clinical care, supplies should be diverted and research operations temporarily suspended; the number of researchers should be minimized and Plexiglass shielding can also be considered; all nondisposable equipment must be cleaned and disinfected between subjects with staff wearing masks and gloves and following manufacturer recommendations for application and dwell time; rough or porous “high-touch” surfaces need frequent cleaning and disposable plastic wrapping could be considered; and adequate time should be allowed for air exchange between studies.

### A model of temporal scaling correctly predicts that motor timing improves with speed [^d7c6e771]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Because the network is trained to reproduce the same trajectory at two different speeds, the most straightforward way scaling to novel speeds could emerge is via parallel neural trajectories. But such a mechanism could take two forms: nearby trajectories that are traversed at different speeds, or distant trajectories that are traversed at the same speed. As a first step toward examining the underlying mechanisms we first visualized the trajectories in principal components analysis (PCA) space. This revealed that trajectories at different speeds follow offset paths of similar length through neural phase space that are traversed over different durations (Fig. 7a). In other words, the trajectories are arranged according to speed in an apparently parallel manner. To quantify this observation, we calculated the Euclidean distance in neural space (n = 1800) between the trajectory at each speed and the 0.5× speed (Fig. 7b). Finding the minimum distance between the comparison speed and the 0.5× speed revealed that the trajectories maintained a fairly constant distance from each other (Fig. 7c). Examining the times that the trajectories were closest also provided an unbiased estimate of the relative speed. For example, if the test trajectory is moving four times faster as the reference, they should be closest when the fast trajectory has been active for ¼ the elapsed time. In other words, plottingvs.should form a line with slope 0.25, which is indeed what we observed. Moreover, this relationship generalized to novel interpolated speeds (Fig. 7d).

### Psychophysics: how fielders arrive in time to catch the ball [^6a6ac239]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Tracking an object moving in three dimensions, whether as an insect pursuing a mate on the wing or as a batsman aiming to hit an approaching ball, provides the spatial and temporal information needed to intercept it. Here we show how fielders use such tracking signals to arrive at the right place in time to catch a ball - they run so that their angle of gaze elevation to the ball increases at a decreasing rate while their horizontal gaze angle to the ball increases at a constant rate (unless the distance to be run is small). Allowing the horizontal angle to increase minimizes the acceleration that the fielder must achieve to reach the interception point at the same time as the ball.

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^e8e9513b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Minimum-jerk modelling

We used a minimum-jerk trajectory framework to formally test the hypothesis that movements are optimized within chunks. Squared jerk is a measure of optimality in the context of movement efficiency, and optimal control trajectories between two points are defined as those that minimize the jerk. It can be shown using the calculus of variations that the integral of squared jerk over the duration of a movement can be minimized by a polynomial function of duration whose sixth derivative is zero. Thus, in the simplest case of a straight reach between two points, minimum-jerk optimization is a simple constrained-optimization problem in which the movement trajectory is modelled as a fifth-order polynomial of the duration. We used a more advanced variant of this methodthat maximizes the smoothness of a trajectory given a set of initial conditions—the start and end positions and velocities, as well as the set of all points that must be traversed at specified times.

Given our hypothesis that the desire for efficiency influences chunk structure in movement sequences, we operationally defined each chunk as an optimal-control trajectory that minimized squared jerk. We applied this framework to compute a model trajectory for each possible chunk structure. We allowed the transition between each element (in our case, from a centre–out to an out–centre reach, or vice versa) to be either a VIA point or a HALT point. For our 10-element sequence, this resulted in 9 binary parameters and 2 9 =512 possible chunk structures.

For initial conditions, we assumed zero velocities at the beginning and at the end of each sequence. We also assumed that the hand started and finished at a centre target at (0, 0), and traversed through outer targets at a radial distance of 7 cm from the centre. We further assumed that each centre–out or out–centre reach was executed in exactly 0.5 s; thus, the entire reach sequence would last 5 s. With these assumptions, we precomputed the locally optimal hand trajectory for all 512 possible chunk structures. Each of these trajectories is associated with a computational cost and efficiency. By plotting these against each other and computing the convex hull, we computed the Pareto frontier representing the trade-off between computational cost and efficiency.

### Preventing injuries in alpine skiing giant slalom by shortening the vertical distance between the gates rather than increasing the horizontal gate offset to control speed [^c56fac2c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

To set a safe giant slalom course, speed needs to be controlled in certain sections. Speed may be reduced by adjusting how the gates are set on a course. We studied the effect of elements of course-setting, entrance speed and terrain incline on the mechanics of turning (ie, turn speed, turn radius, and ground reaction force and impulse).

Methods

During seven World Cup alpine giant slalom competitions, the course and terrain characteristics of the official racetracks and the mechanics of a professional-level athlete skiing the course immediately prior to competition were analysed with differential global navigation satellite system technology. Data were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model.

Results

Course-setting geometry (vertical gate distance and horizontal gate offset), entrance speed and terrain incline modulated the injury-relevant factor turn speed. Depending on the terrain, the speed throughout a turn can be reduced by 0.5 m/s either by shortening the vertical gate distance by 4.9-6.9m (from -20% to -29%) or by increasing the horizontal gate offset by 2.8-3.2m (from +33%to +55%). However, increasing the horizontal gate offset causes the skier to turn with a smaller minimal turn radius, increase maximal ground reaction force and also increase impulse.

Discussion

To reduce speed, we recommend decreasing the vertical gate distance rather than increasing the horizontal gate offset. Increasing horizontal gate offset would require the skiers to sharpen and prolong their turns (reducing turn radius), and this increases the acting ground reaction force and impulse and thus the athlete's fatigue.

### Optimization of avian perching manoeuvres [^c1fd608c]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Perching at speed is among the most demanding flight behaviours that birds perform 1,2 and is beyond the capability of most autonomous vehicles. Smaller birds may touch down by hovering 3-8 , but larger birds typically swoop up to perch 1,2 -presumably because the adverse scaling of their power margin prohibits hovering 9 and because swooping upwards transfers kinetic to potential energy before collision 1,2,10 . Perching demands precise control of velocity and pose 11-14 , particularly in larger birds for which scale effects make collisions especially hazardous 6,15 . However, whereas cruising behaviours such as migration and commuting typically minimize the cost of transport or time of flight 16 , the optimization of such unsteady flight manoeuvres remains largely unexplored 7,17 . Here we show that the swooping trajectories of perching Harris' hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) minimize neither time nor energy alone, but rather minimize the distance flown after stalling. By combining motion capture data from 1,576 flights with flight dynamics modelling, we find that the birds' choice of where to transition from powered dive to unpowered climb minimizes the distance over which high lift coefficients are required. Time and energy are therefore invested to provide the control authority needed to glide safely to the perch, rather than being minimized directly as in technical implementations of autonomous perching under nonlinear feedback control 12 and deep reinforcement learning 18,19 . Naive birds learn this behaviour on the fly, so our findings suggest a heuristic principle that could guide reinforcement learning of autonomous perching.

a, Two-dimensional histograms of estimated power (P) over all observed flight trajectories, estimated under the drag model given the observed variation in flight velocity. Red lines plot the fixed power settings assumed in the main optimization analysis, with P = P dive in the powered dive phase and P = 0 in the unpowered glide phase. b, Histograms showing the birds’ observed or estimated performance against each of the three objectives of energetic cost, time of flight and distance flown after the stall over the trajectories observed at each combination of bird identity and perch spacing. Vertical lines indicate the corresponding model optima subject to the constraints of constant lift and power (red, energy optimal; blue, time optimal; black, stall optimal). Energetic cost was evaluated by integrating the positive power required to offset the modelled drag between the defined take-off and landing points of the observed flight trajectories and is expressed as specific energy relative to body mass; time of flight was assessed as the time difference between the defined take-off and landing points; and stall distance was defined as the greatest distance from the landing point for which C L > 4 in the glide phase (dashed lines indicate transitions where the glide phase initiated at C L > 4).

Fit of observed transition points to optima minimizing distance flown after the stall.

At each combination of bird and perch spacing, the n observed transition points (opaque dots) are compared with the optimal transition point predicted to minimize stall distance under the model (black cross). The black dot denotes the sample mean for each test condition, coloured contours denote the 50th to 95th percentiles of a bivariate normal distribution fitted using the sample mean and covariance matrix within each group at 15% intervals and the grey line denotes the line of feasible transition points predicted under the model.

### Spatiotemporal dynamics of multidrug resistant bacteria on intensive care unit surfaces [^d073314f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Spatiotemporal distance identifies relevant epidemiologic groups

To identify epidemiologically meaningful groupings, we leveraged space and time information from our collections. For A. baumannii and for E. faecium, we iterated through every unique variant distance cutoff from the lowest distance between any two isolates until the lowest distance between any two isolates not in the same lineage (Figs. 5 a–e, 6a–e). We used these cutoffs to filter the isolate pairwise links edge list. For each cutoff, we found perfectly reciprocal groups with maximal graph coverage and recorded the number of cliques and the number of isolates per clique (Supplementary Fig. 8, Figs. 5 a, b, 6 a, b, Supplementary Data 6). Here we define cliques as complete subgraphs within the network where each node in the clique is connected to each other node in the clique. Both A. baumannii and E. faecium showed a similar pattern where number of cliques rises sharply initially and then peaks. During this peak, there is a gradual increase in the number of isolates per clique, with cliques staying relatively balanced. After peaking, the number of cliques rapidly declines as formerly independent cliques merge. This merging interestingly results in one major clique with several other minor cliques. We then determined how much each clique grouping’s spatial and temporal distances deviated from a null model generated with 10,000 permutations for that clique grouping (Figs. 5c, d, 6c, d, Supplementary Data 6). If isolates spread randomly on surfaces, we would expect z -scores close to 0 for the spatial and temporal data. We projected the lowest z -score cutoffs onto the pairwise variant distances histogram (Figs. 5 e, 6e). The greatest deviation from the null model for significant temporal (Figs. 5 f, 6f) and spatial linkage (Figs. 5 g, 6g) coincided with cutoffs that yielded the highest number of cliques. In this case, we found nine cliques for A. baumannii with both the time-minimizing distance (Fig. 5h) and space-minimizing distance (Fig. 5i) cutoff. For E. faecium, we found ten cliques for the time-minimizing cutoff (Fig. 6h) and eight cliques for the space-minimizing cutoff (Fig. 6i). The cutoff values in that range best fit the radiation of isolates on these surfaces. After cutoff values increase beyond the clique-maximizing value, within-clique spatial and temporal distance observations rapidly increase to match and even exceed null estimations, indicating that the epidemiologically relevant variant cutoff was likely passed.

### Quantitative comparison of the anterior-posterior patterning system in the embryos of fiveSpecies [^8814346a]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 5 
Developmental time as defined by morphology and expression differ between Drosophilids. To test whether the dynamics of gene expression patterns match the morphological landmarks used to define the atlas time points, we calculated the Euclidian distance between the proportion of nuclei expressing each combination of genes between each species time point. Smaller distances indicate a greater similarity between the proportions (white). To match time points by cell type profiles, we matched D. melanogaster time point 1 to each other species time point 1, and then found the time points that minimized the distance between cell type profiles. The matching trajectory is shown by the blue line. The concordance between D. melanogaster and D. simulans morphological and expression profiles is high, while D. yakuba and D. pseudoobscura show a similar warping of time. The matching between D. melanogaster and D. virilis is even more divergent, reflective of the larger phylogenetic distance between these species. (B) By plotting the average all species-against-all species Euclidian distance between the cell type profiles, we show that the cell type profiles increase in similarity over developmental time, with a strong drop from timepoints 1-5. The thick line indicates the average distance between species, and the shaded area corresponds to the mean +/− the standard error of the mean. This result is consistent with the hourglass hypothesis of development, since the phylotypic period of Drosophila development is ∼6 hr after time point 6.

Goal-directed movements are executed by translating parameters such as target distance into neural commands of certain amplitude, which are transferred to peripheral muscles performing a movement. The signals’ amplitudes might be chosen to minimize movement endpoint variance, which leads to smooth behavior (i.e. bell-shaped velocity trajectories). These velocity trajectories can be modeled using a superposition of submovements and minimize the magnitude of the jerk trajectory. In neurological subjects, more submovements with increased temporal shift and higher jerk magnitudes have been observed,, potentially due to disrupted feedforward control mechanisms. The temporal shift between subcomponents and the jerk magnitude was shown to reduce after receiving rehabilitation therapy, thereby highlighting their relevance to track recovery. We used the integrated jerk (referred to as jerk) normalized with respect to movement duration and length leading to a dimensionless metric to represent the intrinsic minimization of jerk. The same metric was used with an additionally applied transformation (log jerk). Additionally, the spectral arc length (i.e. metric describing spectral energy content) of the velocity trajectory should reflect the energy induced by jerky movements,. Further, the number of peaks in the velocity profile (number of velocity peaks; MATLAB function findpeaks) was established as an indicator for the number of submovements. Lastly, we calculated the time (time to max. velocity) and distance (distance to max. velocity) covered at peak velocity normalized with respect to the totally covered distance and time, respectively, to capture deviation from the typically observed bell-shaped velocity profile. We calculated these metrics separately for transport and return as the transport requires precise grip force control, which could further affect feedforward control mechanisms.

### An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs [^3493f5a4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.

MD simulations

Input files for the MD simulation were prepared with CHARMM-GUI,, with AF2 structure as the initial structure. A rectangular water box of edge length 10 Å was placed around the protein. The water box contained potassium and chlorine ions of concentration 0.15 M that neutralized the protein’s net charge. The ions were placed in the water box using the Monte Carlo method. To model the system, the CHARMM36m force fieldwas used. After the explicit solvent system was made, the system was minimized and equilibrated before the production MD run. All three steps were performed with the GROMACS 2020.2 MD engine,.

The steepest descent method was used for energy minimization, for 5,000 steps with an energy tolerance of 1000 kJ mol −1 nm −1. The neighbour list was updated every ten steps with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. Cut-off was used to calculate Van der Waals interactions with a switch distance of 1.0 nm and a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The force was smoothly switched off between the switch distance and the cut-off distance. The fast smooth particle-mesh Ewald method was used to calculate electrostatics with a cut-off distance of 1.0 nm. All bonds with hydrogen atoms were treated as rigid using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm.

The equilibration step was performed with a leap-frog algorithm using a time step of 1 fs and a total simulation time of 125 ps. The system was propagated in the NVT ensemble. The temperature was maintained at 303.15 K using the velocity rescaling method. The solute and solvent were coupled with a time constant for coupling of 1 ps. The centre-of-mass translational velocity was removed every 100 steps to prevent the system from drifting. The cut-off schemes for Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were the same as those used in the minimization step, except that the neighbour list was updated every 20 steps. The velocities were generated from a Maxwell distribution with a temperature of 303.15 K. The same LINCS method was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms during the equilibration step.

### Geometrical congruence, greedy navigability and myopic transfer in complex networks and brain connectomes [^a8b7cc2e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In order to address these two questions, we have to discuss the time complexity. The general time complexity of this class of algorithms (both brute-force and our optimized algorithm) is analyzed in details in a dedicated section in Supplementary Note 3 and, with some approximations, can be formulated aswhereis the average node degree,is the network diameter, M L is a coefficient that expresses the proportion of nodes with recursion depth equal to L. The analysis of this formulation is not trivial, since it depends on the distribution of the recursion depths, which in turn are affected by different topological features of the network. One of such features is certainly the average node degree (or similarly the edge density). The higher the average node degree, the shorter will be the topological shortest paths, the lower will be the recursion depths. In the case of networks with a power-law degree distribution, such as the nPSO networks analyzed, the power-law exponent γ also affects the recursion depths distribution. Indeed, the lower the γ, the higher the presence of hubs connecting most of the network, making the topological shortest paths (and in turn the recursion depths) shorter. Indeed, networks with γ < 3 are defined as ultra-small world.

To address the first question on the reason behind the large running time improvement of our optimized algorithm we note that the distribution of(Fig. 5c, e, g), which is the proportion of nodes with recursion depth equal to L, is significantly shifted towards small L values for our optimized algorithm (red bars Fig. 5c, e, g) in comparison to the brute-force (black bars Fig. 5c, e, g). The fact that this attenuation happens similarly for any value of power-law exponent γ can explain why in Fig. 5b our optimized algorithm displays a similar reduction of −90% in running time regardless of γ. From the theoretical point of view, recovering the time complexity formula provided above, this implies that our optimized algorithm attenuates the cost of large L values and this seems the main reason for its significant running time reduction. This is confirmed by the fact that the dramatic running time (without parallel computation, Fig. 5d, f, h) of the brute-force algorithm (black bars Fig. 5d, f, h) for large L values is significantly attenuated by our optimized algorithm (red bars Fig. 5d, f, h), and this happens likewise for any value of power-law exponent γ.

### Low-latency time-of-flight non-line-of-sight imaging at 5 frames per second [^b9df0492]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

SNR considerations

Real-time NLOS videos necessarily constrain the light acquisition period for each frame, which means that the SNR of the data and subsequently the reconstructions have a certain value. Allowing for a longer acquisition period for stationary scenes inevitably increases the SNR, see the Methods section for a theoretical discussion and also Supplementary Fig. 8. The challenge of real-time NLOS imaging, therefore, is to capture as much light as possible during a given short time frame, and SPAD arrays with many pixels solve this problem.

Let us examine the behavior of the NLOS signal as a function of object distance in the scene. Past work states that the signal from a small, fixed-size patch in the hidden scene collected from an individual pair of co-located laser and detector positions x p, x c near the center of the relay surface falls off as 1/ r 4 for the shortest distance r between relay surface and object. However, for the cumulative signal from a complete NLOS measurement comprising a set of x p and x c this is only true for very large r and does not hold at close distances that apply for most reconstructions. At such close distances, the falloff is smaller than 1/ r 4. An intuitive explanation is this: imagine an infinitely large planar light source (in our case the relay wall illuminated by the laser) that emits a fixed light intensity into one direction. Everywhere in the corresponding half space, we can measure the same intensity, which does not decrease with distance. Otherwise, the total energy would change. A point object very close to a finite relay wall approximately fits this scenario, so the intensity loss from the relay wall to the object is almost negligible. Only the falloff from the object back to the wall has to be taken into account, which follows 1/ r 2. A detailed mathematical analysis of the falloff is provided in Supplementary Note 2. Furthermore, the reduction in resolution at large distances makes considering a patch of fixed size misleading as the patch simply drops below the resolution limit. Finally, existing investigations consider only the drop in collected signal and ignore the change of noise as a function of r. In most conventional optical imaging systems, noise is considered for a fixed angular resolution where the scene area corresponding to an image pixel increases with distance along with the imaging system resolution. For example, in a conventional camera, noise is added to the image by the camera sensor, after image formation has been performed using a lens. By contrast, in an NLOS imaging system, Poisson and sensor noise occur in the measurement before the application of the image formation (i.e. reconstruction) operator. This noise is then propagated through the reconstruction operator which essentially mimics the operation of the imaging lens. As a consequence, the noise in a NLOS reconstruction is different from the noise in a line-of-sight image. In particular, it depends on distance r. A detailed derivation of the SNR is also provided in Supplementary Note 3.

### Multi-omic data integration enables discovery of hidden biological regularities [^ffe72a91]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Part A iterative simulation procedure

These ME simulations had the overall goal of minimizing the difference between the simulated proteome and the measured proteome for each experimental condition. The growth rate μ was set to the experimentally determined values (Supplementary Data 1). To improve solution times with the SoPlex linear programming solverwith our formulation, we collapsed linear pathways into single reactions using cobrapy, which were detected by identifying metabolites present in exactly two reactions.

To reconcile experimentally measured protein concentrations with the simulations, we want to solve a linear program, which will minimize the Manhattan distance between the expressed and measured protein production at the fixed growth rate. The Manhattan distance was used instead of the Euclidian distance, because it can be computed in the context of a linear program, whereas a Euclidian distance minimization requires a quadratic objective, which the SoPlex solver can not handle. To construct this problem, we added the following additional constraints to the ME linear program in terms of the corresponding measured protein amounts y i for each predicted gene translation flux variable x i (unmeasured proteins had no applied constraints).

This allowed us to minimize the error term, which is equivalent to minimizingand gives the closest flux state to the experimental data, while satisfying the ME constraints when solving the linear program. If these parameters resulted in an infeasible model, which could not simulate growth at μ, the simulation was halted. Otherwise, using the predicted fluxes predicted by this simulation and the experimentally measured proteomics data, we calculated the k eff for each reaction enzyme, which we used in the next iteration of this workflow. This simulation loop was run a total of three times, to allow the loops to converge to a set of k eff values.

Part B sampling and simulation

The iterative simulation procedure described above might give a flux state, which is dependent on the original set of k eff parameters used in the first round. Therefore, the k eff were randomly initialized within two orders of magnitude of the value computed from SASA. The iterative sampling procedure was repeated repeated 300 times for each experimental condition and each time a new random k eff parameter set was generated in the manner described.

### The secM arrest peptide traps a pre-peptide bond formation state of the ribosome [^0c73c72b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Firstly, the system was energy minimized with harmonic position restraints (k = 1000 kJ mol −1 nm −1) applied to the solute heavy atoms. After that, 8 replicas of the system were simulated for 70 ns to allow for solvent equilibration. During the first 50 ns, position restraints (k =  1000 kJ mol −1 nm −1) were applied on all the heavy atoms of the solute. During the following 20 ns, the position restraints were linearly decreased to zero for all the heavy atoms of the solute placed within 25 Å from the NC. Simultaneously, the force constant of the restraints applied to the heavy atoms positioned further than 25 Å from the NC was decreased to the one obtained from the fluctuations previously observed in full-ribosome simulations as described earlier. Production runs (70-270 ns) were then carried out for 5 replica keeping the position restraints only on the outer-shell heavy atoms. During both equilibration steps and production run, the pressure was coupled to a stochastic cell rescaling barostatwith a time constant of 5 ps and scaling the box every 10 steps.

To investigate how stalling is relieved by pulling on the peptide, we carried out pulling MD simulations. To that aim, we added a harmonic potential, representing a spring, which depends on the distance d and has a spring constant of 5000 kJ mol −1 nm −1. Here, d is the z-component of the difference vector between the centre of mass (COM) of the N-terminal Pro132 backbone atoms and the spring position. The initial spring position was set to the Pro132 COM position in the starting structure. In the pulling simulations, the spring position was moved with constant velocity in the z-direction (along the tunnel axis) by 5.6 nm during the length of the simulation τ. To probe the effect of the velocity, we used different pulling times τ = 32 ns, 64 ns, 128 ns, 256 ns, 512, and 1024 ns, resulting in velocities ranging from 0.175 m/s to ~0.005 m/s. For each τ, we carried out 8 simulations started from the 8 structures obtained from the solvent equilibration.

### Understanding personalized dynamics to inform precision medicine: a dynamic time warp analysis of 255 depressed inpatients [^347db324]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

DTW is an approximate pattern detection algorithm that can measure the similarity between two time-series. It uses a dynamic (i.e. stretching and compressing) programming approach to minimize a predefined distance measure (e.g. Euclidean distance), in order for the two time-series to become optimally aligned through a warping path. The “optimal” alignment minimizes the sum of distances between the aligned elements. The “dtw” (version 1.20.1), “pheatmap” (version 1.0.12), “parallelDist” (version 0.2.4), and “qgraph” (version 1.6.2) packages for the R statistical software were used (R version 3.6.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2016. URL:).

The idiographic approach per patient was followed by a nomothetic approach to study the depression symptom patterns both within individual patients and in the whole sample of 255 patients. The subsequent methodological steps and statistical methods are described below.

X-ray fluoroscopy dose minimization strategies emphasize using alternative nonradiation-based imaging when appropriate, employing current state-of-the-art equipment calibrated for minimal dose exposures, maintaining optimal system positioning with minimal imaging field size and minimal exposure time, choosing x-ray system operating modes with the slowest frame rate and the smallest dose per frame consistent with diagnostic quality imaging and appropriate procedure guidance, and applying optimal use of protective garments and shields while maximizing distance from the x-ray source and minimizing patient exposure.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^e498caa4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Best practices of operator conduct for radiation dose optimization during cardiac catheterization emphasize conservative imaging parameters and dose-sparing techniques. Pulsed fluoroscopy should not exceed 15 pulses/second, and acquisition frame rates should not exceed 30 frames/second, and using a lower dose mode can potentially reduce radiation exposure by as much as 50% or even more, and, as such, it is recommended to start in the low dose mode and only increase if needed for image quality. Fifteen centimeters of air gap approximates a 1-step increase in electronic magnification. Distance management includes: unless an air gap is being used to mitigate scatter, decrease the distance between the patient and the image receptor, while increasing the distance between the x-ray tube and the patient decreases the dose to the patient's skin by the inverse square law. For electronic magnification, when the FOV is halved, the patient dose is doubled. Field and beam control measures include collimation to reduce exposed tissue volume and scatter, avoidance of excessively oblique angles that increase dose and degrade image quality, and ensuring arms are kept out of the beam because arms in the beam lengthen the x-ray path and increase patient dose rate. For small patients, remove the antiscatter grids during procedures on small patients (<20 kg). Time and recording choices also reduce exposure: radiation dose increases with longer fluoroscopy times, and, therefore, the beam should only be on when the operator is looking at the image, and stored fluoroscopy significantly decreases dose, as the dose rate during acquisition is 6 to 10 times greater than during fluoroscopy.

### A collective intelligence model for swarm robotics applications [^fed0dab1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The most favorable comparison occurs on the Griewank landscape, where many nearly optimal stationary points surround the global optimum (the reader is referred to Fig. 3 in the SI for a visual interpretation), whereas the worst scenario occurs on the Schwefel function, featuring a diverging envelope (the global maximum is surrounded by the smallest local minima). On the latter, the SCM requires the agent to receive significant fluctuations to counteract the gradient-related force and jump over the local minima towards the target. On similar landscapes, the PSO, which does not exploit landscape gradients, is inherently advantaged in the convergence process. A 100 % SR is guaranteed in any dimension on the Ackley function, where the global maximum dominates over 35 local maxima. On this landscape, as soon as an agent passes by the global optimum, the fitness-weighted centroid will be highly displaced, stimulating the migration of other agents. The replications on the fractal landscape foster the SCM in terms of SR, proving that the numerical approximation of the landscape gradient by finite differences does not undermine the method advantage with few agents. The fractal landscape is numerically generated as a randomly rough surface with fractal dimension 1.8, tile wavelength 0.1 m and null roll-off wavelength over 512 pixels per side.

X-ray system operational issues—Imaging modality, imaging time, and image field size are 3 important dose-affecting parameters under the operator’s direct control. Operators should select the lowest-dose imaging modality that is appropriate, including using an image field size that confines exposure to the structures of interest, using the lowest-dose fluoroscopy program, and using the slowest fluoroscopy pulse rates that yield appropriate quality images. Operators should use the x-ray system collimator to minimize the exposed field size, optimize system positioning with the procedure table at the optimal distance from the x-ray tube and the image detector as close to the patient as possible, and pay particular attention to minimizing exposure time by limiting fluoroscopy to actual catheter manipulations and minimizing cine run durations; maneuvers such as pullbacks can be conducted without fluoroscopy. Current x-ray systems provide features to reduce exposure, including “Last image hold,” virtual collimator position indicators that allow positioning without an x-ray exposure, and a virtual image of the effect of repositioning a patient to reduce the need for additional fluoroscopy for setup.

### C-NHEJ without indels is robust and requires synergistic function of distinct XLF domains [^92cb5fae]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Computational modeling and MD simulation

All-atom MD simulations of the XLF dimer was performed starting from the 2.3 Å crystal structure (PDB ID: 2QM4)of the truncated (amino acids 1–230) WT dimer. Seleno-methionine residues were mutated to methionine using Maestro Protein Preparation Wizardand missing residues in monomer B (residues 170–173 and 228–230) were added using homology modeling method, MODELLERusing the corresponding regions in monomer A as template. Mutant XLF dimers were generated by mutating residue positions in Maestro. The dimers were then subjected to energy minimization using Maestro MacroModel (Schrödinger Release 2017-4: MacroModel, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2017). XLF dimers were placed at the center of a simulation box, with a minimum distance between protein-edge and box-edge of 10 Å and solvated with bulk explicit TIP3P water(average of 25 800 water molecules per system) and 22–26 sodium ions to neutralize the system charge, using tleap. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms, and default parameters for PME were used to calculate long-range Coulomb interactions. System minimization, equilibration, and production dynamics were performed using the GPU version of PMEMD module of Amber14 with the ff14sb force field. Each system was minimized for 15 000 steps using a non-bond cutoff of 12 Å. The first 5000 steps were performed with 5 kcal mol −1 Å −2 positional restraints on all protein atoms (water molecules unrestrained), followed by 5000 steps with 5 kcal mol −1 Å −2 positional restraints on protein backbone atoms, and finally 5000 steps with no positional restraints. The system was equilibrated for 100 ps at 1 fs time step with 5 kcal mol −1 Å −2 positional restraints on protein backbone atoms, to a temperature of 310 K under NVT ensemble using Langevin thermostat. The system was heated from 0 to 300 K in steps of 60 K with 20 ps of simulation at each step. Further equilibration was performed with an NPT ensemble at 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat while applying protein backbone restraints. The backbone restraints were started with a force constant of 5 kcal mol −1 Å −2 and reduced to 1 kcal mol −1 Å −2 in steps of 1 kcal mol −1 Å −2 for every 10 ns. This was followed by 10 ns NPT ensemble simulation with no position restraints. Production MD was initiated as four individual trajectories for each system beginning from the last frame of the unrestrained 10 ns NPT ensemble, each initiated with a new, random velocity. Each replicate was carried out to 250 ns for a total of 1 μs of simulation time. We performed 1 μs of MD simulations each on the WT XLF dimer, single mutants K160D, R178Q, and L115A, and the double mutants K160D/L115A and L115A/R178Q.

### Accessibility of HIV services in Philadelphia: location-allocation analysis [^f45d483d]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the first step in the HIV care continuum, timely diagnosis is central to reducing transmission of the virus and ending the HIV epidemic. Studies have shown that distance from a testing site is essential for ease of access to services and educational material. This study shows how location-allocation analysis can be used to improve allocation of HIV testing services utilizing existing publicly available data from 2015 to 2019 on HIV prevalence, testing site location, and factors related to HIV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Methods

The ArcGIS Location-Allocation analytic tool was used to calculate locations for HIV testing sites using a method that minimizes the distance between demand-point locations and service facilities. ZIP code level demand was initially specified on the basis of the percentage of late HIV diagnoses and in a sensitivity analysis on the basis of a composite of multiple factors. Travel time and distance from demand to facilities determined the facility location allocation. This analysis was conducted from 2021 to 2022.

Results

Compared with the 37 facilities located in 20 (43%) Philadelphia ZIP codes, the model proposed reallocating testing facilities to 37 (79%) ZIP codes using percent late diagnoses to define demand. On average, this would reduce distance to the facilities by 65% and travel time to the facilities by 56%. Results using the sensitivity analysis were similar.

Conclusions

A wider distribution of HIV testing services across the city of Philadelphia may reduce distance and travel time to facilities, improve accessibility of testing, and in turn increase the percentage of people with knowledge of their status.

### Radium ra 223 dichloride (Xofigo) [^08cf189a]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Radiation protection

The administration of Xofigo is associated with potential risks to other persons (e.g., medical staff, caregivers and patient’s household members) from radiation or contamination from spills of bodily fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations.1

For drug handling

Follow the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use universal precautions for handling and administration such as gloves and barrier gowns when handling blood and bodily fluids to avoid contamination. In case of contact with skin or eyes, the affected area should be flushed immediately with water. In the event of spillage of Xofigo, the local radiation safety officer should be contacted immediately to initiate the necessary measurements and required procedures to decontaminate the area. A complexing agent such as 0.01 M ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution is recommended to remove contamination.

For patient care

Whenever possible, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed several times after each use. When handling bodily fluids, simply wearing gloves and hand washing will protect caregivers. Clothing soiled with Xofigo or patient fecal matter or urine should be washed promptly and separately from other clothing.

Radium-223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha-particles. The fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure associated with handling of patient doses is expected to be low, because the typical treatment activity will be below 8,000 kBq (216 microcurie). In keeping with the A s L ow A s R easonably A chievable (ALARA) principle for minimization of radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation areas, to maximize the distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. Any unused product or materials used in connection with the preparation or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

The gamma radiation associated with the decay of radium-223 and its daughters allows for the radioactivity measurement of Xofigo and the detection of contamination with standard instruments.

Results

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK in early March 2020, our retinal team felt strongly that to prevent sight loss in our patients with wAMD, not only should we continue to see and treat them, but we should try to maintain each patient’s individualized treatment regime if we could do so safely. The wAMD clinic had already previously been relocated to a nonacute hospital (cold) site.

The multidisciplinary workshop produced a number of proposed changes. The initial changes were implemented and then continuously discussed and improved after daily multidisciplinary safety meetings, and are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 
Changes Introduced to our Wet AMD Clinic to Allow Social Distancing (SDOC)

All changes were introduced with the aim of minimizing the number of interactions with staff, allowing patients to maintain adequate distance from staff and other patients ideally at all times (SDOCs), and minimizing the time patients spent in the unit.

### Performance characteristics of para swimmers: how effective is the swimming classification system? [^bf2751b7]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Swimming is one of the inaugural sports within the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the key difference between the Olympic and Paralympic games being the classification system. The aim of this study was to investigate how effective the current classification system creates clearly differentiated Paralympic competition classes, based on performance time for all swimming strokes and events. Based on the performance characteristics of swimmers within the current classification system, the relationship between impairment and swimming performance is inconsistent, potentially disadvantaging some athletes. Appropriate sports medicine tests are required for the development of an evidence-based swimming classification system.

### Low-latency time-of-flight non-line-of-sight imaging at 5 frames per second [^7329f397]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Due to Helmholtz reciprocity, we can scan a single-pixel SPAD throughout the wall and have a fixed laser position, or equivalently scan the laser and look at a stationary point with the SPAD, under the assumption that the laser beam area and the wall area covered by the single-pixel SPAD are of the same size. For this discussion, we proceed with a fixed laser and a scanning SPAD. The laser is pulsed, and for simplicity assume that the laser photon rate λ is constant during each pulse. Let the expected value of photons emitted during pulse time Δ t be Λ = λ Δ t. L is the number of repeated laser pulses, and depending on the fixed laser repetition rate (not to be mistaken with the pulse duration), it obviously takes a certain fixed time to generate these L pulses. Let us assume that the recorded temporal histograms have a bin width of Δ t. For a stationary SPAD pixel always looking at the same point on the wall, depending on the geometrical distances and scene reflectance all lumped into the attenuation factor γ (t), we expectphotons in one specific time bin t.can be zero if there are no objects at the scene voxels that had a round trip time t. A stationary SPAD pixel does not provide the required spatial information needed to provide 3D reconstructions, so we need to scan it across the wall. The rest of the argument is therefore straightforward: if we scan Q points on the wall with one individual SPAD, the exposure time for one point will be reduced by the factor Q, meaning that the expected number of photons in one-time bin reduces toHowever, if we use a SPAD array that simultaneously captures the histograms at all Q relay wall positions, we are back at the original expected photon number (1), because each pixel now is illuminated for the total time needed to send the L pulses. We are now capturing the light more efficiently by looking at all points simultaneously instead of just one point. Taking a closer look at (1), we see that reducing the laser photon rate in the array scenario by Q makes us arrive at exactly the same number of photons as in the point scanning scenario (2):As a consequence, there’s an inverse proportionality between the photon rate Λ and therefore the laser power, and the number of SPAD pixels. Using Q SPAD pixels allows for reducing the laser power by Q while still maintaining the same Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the measured histograms. If the SPAD array chip fill factor is not 100%, but say only 10%, the light efficiency is reduced by a factor of 10. But let’s assume that in the future SPAD arrays with 10,000 pixels will be available, so we still can reduce the laser power by a factor of 1000. We have seen that more pixels allow for proportionally reducing the laser power. Alternatively, one can use more pixels with the same laser power to increase the SNR of the captured data and subsequently the quality of the reconstructed video. The number of photons acquired in each histogram time bin follows a Poisson distribution (see Section 3.3 in the Supplementary Materials); for such a distribution, increasing the photon rate by Q improves the SNR by a factor of.

### Revealing the mechanism and function underlying pairwise temporal coupling in collective motion [^89b19fbc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Functional consequences of temporal coupling

While much has been revealed regarding spatial coupling among individuals in groups, such as that directional information tends to flow unidirectionally, from front to back, but that speed changes flow bidirectionally, we know comparatively little about the role of temporal coordination in mobile animal groups. It is apparent, from our above analysis, that individuals are incapable of responding, in terms of timing, to bursts exhibited by a partner if they occur very shortly (<0.1 s) after their own burst. Whether the rules of thumb exhibited for temporal coordination impact the responsiveness of individuals to changing social conditions, such as turning by their partner, over longer timescales is unknown.

To test the possible functional consequence of temporal relationships between a leader and a follower swimming in close proximity, we investigated how a followers’ responsiveness to a sudden change of direction (a turn of 60 degrees) of a (virtual) partner (exhibiting multiple fixed inter-burst intervals, Fig. 2 C) is impacted by the temporal relationship between them, controlling for spatial factors like proximity, or degree of alignment, prior to the turning event (Fig. 4 A, Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15, and see Methods for details).

### Great hammerhead sharks swim on their side to reduce transport costs [^91965e1d]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Animals exhibit various physiological and behavioural strategies for minimizing travel costs. Fins of aquatic animals play key roles in efficient travel and, for sharks, the functions of dorsal and pectoral fins are considered well divided: the former assists propulsion and generates lateral hydrodynamic forces during turns and the latter generates vertical forces that offset sharks' negative buoyancy. Here we show that great hammerhead sharks drastically reconfigure the function of these structures, using an exaggerated dorsal fin to generate lift by swimming rolled on their side. Tagged wild sharks spend up to 90% of time swimming at roll angles between 50° and 75°, and hydrodynamic modelling shows that doing so reduces drag—and in turn, the cost of transport—by around 10% compared with traditional upright swimming. Employment of such a strongly selected feature for such a unique purpose raises interesting questions about evolutionary pathways to hydrodynamic adaptations, and our perception of form and function.

### Laboratory considerations on the use of F-18 myocardial perfusion imaging radiotracers: an information statement from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology [^8f900f5c]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Radiation considerations—principles of radiation protection for F-18 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers in nuclear cardiology laboratories emphasize ALARA and the core strategies of time, distance, and shielding. The physical characteristics of F-18 PET radiotracers can lead to increased radiation exposure, and “laboratory staff must have a strong foundation in radiation safety principles to effectively minimize radiation exposure and maintain doses that are ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA),” with “the time, distance, and shielding” serving as key strategies for exposure reduction. “Minimize radiation exposure time”; exposure to staff “is directly proportional to the time spent in close proximity to an injected patient,” with best practices including “Inject patients while on the scanner bed for pharmacologic stress” and “Discharge patients immediately after study completion to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure within the department.” “Maximize distance from radiation source”; “radiation exposure decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source,” and “Doubling the distance from a radiation source reduces exposure by a factor of four,” with strategies such as “Maximize distance from the patient who is the radiation source,” “Position the scanner at the furthest practical distance from the control room and other staff-occupied areas,” and “Locate the scanner adjacent to areas of low occupancy such as external walls, hallways, storage rooms, or basement areas to limit radiation exposure to staff and the public.” “Utilize physical shielding to maintain ALARA exposure”; “Proper shielding significantly reduces exposure, with dose attenuation increasing exponentially with shielding thickness,” and “Physical shielding should then be added to achieve specific exposure targets according to the principles of ALARA,” with U.S. regulatory context that “10 Code of Federal Regulations 20 establishes dose limits for staff working in radiation-controlled areas of 50 mSv/year [1].”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

X-ray fluoroscopic operator and personnel conduct assigns that physician operators are responsible to operate equipment to optimize the safety of patients, occupationally exposed laboratory personnel, and themselves; operators should be acculturated to minimize beam on time, optimize system positioning, use collimators to minimize image field size, and use protective shielding, and they should be cognizant of protecting laboratory personnel by maximizing distance from the radiation source, interrupting fluoroscopy when personnel need to approach a patient, providing portable shielding within the laboratory, and providing an out of laboratory control room for personnel monitoring but not directly attending to the patient.

### Testing the speed of' spooky action at a distance' [^01e7fd14]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Correlations are generally described by one of two mechanisms: either a first event influences a second one by sending information encoded in bosons or other physical carriers, or the correlated events have some common causes in their shared history. Quantum physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations, named entanglement. This reveals itself in correlations that violate Bell inequalities (implying that they cannot be described by common causes) between space-like separated events (implying that they cannot be described by classical communication). Many Bell tests have been performed, and loopholes related to locality and detection have been closed in several independent experiments. It is still possible that a first event could influence a second, but the speed of this hypothetical influence (Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance') would need to be defined in some universal privileged reference frame and be greater than the speed of light. Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical influences. We performed a Bell test over more than 24 hours between two villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed two-photon interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the Earth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine, for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of the influence. For example, if such a privileged reference frame exists and is such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10(-3) times that of the speed of light, then the speed of the influence would have to exceed that of light by at least four orders of magnitude.

Pediatric imaging and radiation in mechanical thrombectomy emphasize minimizing ionizing radiation exposure, stating that unnecessary exposure of neonates and children under the age of 10 should be avoided when there is a viable alternative; rapid MRI/MRA protocols permit acquisition times of less than 15 min on most scanners and non-contrast MRA based on time of flight vessel imaging is the preferred mode of imaging for the evaluation of ELVO; MT employs fluoroscopy and should adhere to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle with strategies such as routine collimation, low pulse rates, minimizing the patient to detector distance, shielding radiosensitive organs, and eliminating unnecessary digital subtraction angiograms to reduce exposure.

### Geometrical congruence, greedy navigability and myopic transfer in complex networks and brain connectomes [^f41ff61e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Furthermore, we clarify that the prioritization and memoization are performed in advance before to start any recursion. This keeps the recursions of different source nodes independent allowing them to process in parallel. For a careful understanding and discussion of the technical details behind the algorithm design we refer to: Method section (Computation of thebetween all node pairs: algorithm design), Supplementary Note 2 section (Pseudocode to compute thebetween all node pairs), Supplementary Note 3 “Space and time complexity”, Supplementary Note 4 “Running time estimation”.

After introducing the basic concepts behind the two types of algorithms (brute-force and our optimized algorithm), we will move forward discussing their running time and time complexity. In Fig. 5a we report the running time (average time on 10 networks realizations by nPSO model) of the two different network congruence algorithms using parallel computation (128 cores). Each of the five curves indicates networks with five different values of γ (2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3) and are obtained for increasing network node size values (N = 100, 1 K, 10 K, 100 K). Average degree, temperature and number of communities in the nPSO are respectively fixed to= 12, T = 0.1 and C = 4, because from the previous section we noticed that these are parameters of second relevance for our investigation and that we should concentrate our attention on understanding the impact of N and γ. The running time of our optimized algorithm (Fig. 5a, red curve) is negligible (one second) till N ∼ 1000, it is small for N ∼10 K (few minutes), whereas it becomes impactful for N ∼ 100 K (in the order of days), although still feasible as a large-scale computation. In comparison, for N ∼ 100 K the running time of brute-force (Fig. 5a, black curve) significantly increases to more than 2 months of computation (see Supplementary Note 4 for details on the running time estimation) for the highest values of γ (2.75 and 3). Hence, the second step of our investigation is to deepen our understanding of the computational processes behind the algorithmic running time differences observed in Fig. 5a for N = 100 K and the highest γ values. To this aim in Fig. 5b we repeat the same analysis of Fig. 5a but specifying the difference between results obtained with and without parallel computation, on networks of size N = 100 K and for γ = [2, 2.5, 3]. The first evidence is that both on single core (Fig. 5b right panel) and 128 cores parallelization (Fig. 5b, left panel), regardless of the γ value, our algorithm design leads to a reduction of around 90% with respect to the computational load needed by brute-force. In addition, it is evident the impact of the power-law exponent γ on the running time. In case of γ = 3, we notice the reduction from a worst-case scenario of 26 years for brute-force on single core to the actual scenario of 7 days for our algorithm on 128 cores, representing a great computational achievement, which remains relevant even when the brute-force algorithm is parallelized on 128 cores (2.4 months running time). Therefore, the third step of our investigation aims to address two questions: to understand the reason behind this remarkable running time reduction gained by our optimized algorithm; to identify the reason behind the impactful running time increase occurred for γ = 2.75, 3 regardless of the algorithm design.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^ce6ca59d]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Swimming ability—there is considerable debate regarding the definition of “swimming” or “survival-swimming” and what constitutes the most protective approach to swim instruction, and the most recent review by the American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges a lack of evidence surrounding pediatric swimming lessons and so does not formally recommend for or against lessons for children under age 4 y. In addition, unique aquatic environments, such as whitewater, should be approached only after focused instruction on swimming techniques specific to that environment. For the purpose of drowning prevention, the distance of 25 m (82 ft) has been adopted by international lifesaving agencies and a large population-based study in Bangladesh, and All persons who participate in activities conducted in or around water should have, at a minimum, enough experience and physical capability to maintain their head above water, tread water, and make forward progress for a distance of 25 m (82 ft). Recommendation Grade: 2C.

X-ray system operational parameters under operator control—dose reduction practices are specified: “Imaging modality, imaging time, and image field size are 3 important dose-affecting parameters that are under the operator’s direct control.” Operators “should select the lowest-dose imaging modality that is appropriate for a particular application,” including “using an image field size that confines exposure to the structures of interest, using the lowest-dose fluoroscopy program, and using the slowest fluoroscopy pulse rates that yield appropriate quality images.” Operators “should use the x-ray system collimator to minimize the exposed field size” and “should optimize system positioning with the procedure table at the optimal distance from the x-ray tube and the image detector as close to the patient as possible.” The operator “should pay particular attention to minimizing exposure time,” by “limiting fluoroscopy to actual catheter manipulations that require fluoroscopic visualization and minimizing cine run durations,” noting that maneuvers such as “pullbacks can be conducted without fluoroscopy.”

### Motor planning flexibly optimizes performance under uncertainty about task goals [^0d4c97e6]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Velocity was computed by smoothing hand position using a second-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a frame size of 19 samples, then taking the numerical derivative of the smoothed position curves. Movement time was estimated to be the duration of time required for the participant to move 20 cm away from the starting position. Reaction time was computed as the time between the go cue and movement initiation (reported values were corrected for inherent delays in our equipment that have been measured to be ∼105 ms). The initial reach direction was determined as the direction of the velocity vector 100 ms after movement initiation. The initial reach-direction error was computed as the angular difference between the initial reach direction and the direction of a straight line drawn between the start position and the correct target. The adjusted aiming direction was computed by first normalizing the absolute value of the initial reach error by the target-separation angle (such that a value of 0.5 is a reach directly aimed to either target and a value of zero is a reach directly between the two targets). A correlation was then assessed between reaction time and the adjusted aiming direction across all participants to determine if reaction times were longer for intermediate movements compared to reaches aimed directly at either of the potential targets.

All SNR curves have been normalized to a value of 1 at 1 m to only show the falloff with distance; the absolute values are parameter dependent. d Central depth slice of RSD PSF at different depths. The target size is shown as white squares. e Pixel size in conventional photography.

It is beneficial to express the PSF in spherical coordinates: PSF(ϕ, θ, r) with widths Δ ϕ, Δ θ, Δ r which are largely independent of location in the scene. To incorporate moving objects, we assume that motion blur will only be noticeable when the object in question moves by about the size of the PSF in a given frame. If the motion is smaller the motion blur kernel will be negligible to the PSF and will not significantly affect the reconstruction. This means that for a given maximum object velocity v, the required exposure time is proportional to Δ ϕ / v ϕ, Δ θ / v θ, Δ r / v r and increases linearly with distance r. Consequently, we can safely average scene voxels at distances far from the relay wall over longer times without expecting visible motion blur. Objects far away from the camera appear to be moving slower. This is not unique to NLOS reconstructions but is the feature of any video. In NLOS reconstructions; however, the depth is known and we therefore have the option to choose a depth-dependent frame averaging in the reconstruction to take advantage of this effect. We create a reconstruction in which the frame rate is depth dependent. The details of our depth-dependent frame averaging method are described in the Methods section.

### SNMMI / EANM / ASNC / ACNM procedure standard / practice guideline forF-flurpiridaz PET myocardial perfusion imaging and blood flow quantitation [^3fb692f1]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). High credibility.

18F-flurpiridaz PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantitation—individuals in close contact with the patient during and after radiotracer injection should be considered a potential exposure risk. For the administration of 18F-flurpiridaz, the use of an infusion pump with a saline flush is recommended over manual (hand) injection, and this approach minimizes radiation exposure to staff, ensures a consistent injection technique, and supports accurate MBF measurements and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) derivations from rest and pharmacologic stress studies. During exercise stress testing, enhanced safety protocols must be implemented to further reduce the risk of contamination and inadvertent exposure; this includes securing IV lines and injection ports to prevent dislodgement due to patient movement on the treadmill. Whether using an infusion pump or manual injection, the entire injection apparatus (including extension tubing, bifurcated tubing, 3-way stopcock, and saline flush) should be assembled and tested prior to 18F-flurpiridaz administration, and staff should be trained and proficient in the use of thick PET syringe shields and all ancillary equipment, with practice sessions conducted before actual patient 18F-flurpiridaz injection sessions. To further minimize staff radiation exposure, the following best practices are recommended: strictly apply the principles of time, distance, and shielding; reduce the time spent near radioactive sources whenever possible; increase the distance from the patient or radiopharmaceutical source, as exposure decreases rapidly with distance; and use appropriate shielding, such as lead barriers, leaded glass, and syringe shields. Additionally, employ modified lead pots or shielded workstations to minimize hand exposure during dose preparation and withdrawal, and ensure high-energy radioactive waste containers are conveniently located for immediate disposal of contaminated materials. Optimize workflow and scheduling and rotate staff to limit cumulative exposure, especially in high-volume settings and with exercise stress testing, and schedule high-risk procedures during periods of lower occupancy to reduce overall risk; as with all nuclear medicine procedures, regularly monitor and audit radiation exposure and provide ongoing formal training in radiation protection, emergency procedures, and safe handling of radioactive materials. Note that since 18F (and all PET radiotracers) emits high-energy 511 keV photons, these are not effectively attenuated by personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lead aprons, thyroid shields, or leaded eyewear.

Afterward, the models were automatically compared to the planned trajectories using a Python script (v3.6.1) with VTK packages.

Entry points for both planned and conducted trajectories were where the mesh of the trajectories penetrated the block's upper surface.was identified as the furthest point along the central axis plus an additional 1.5 mm offset to account for the flat ends of the rods (Fig. 2d).

The maximum projected translational deviation (Fig. 2a) was the larger value of projected translational deviation at two ends (Fig. 2b, c), denoted as the minimum radius of the inclusion cylinder from the planned trajectory that covers the conducted trajectory. The projected translational deviation was the shortest distance from the conducted trajectory to the planned trajectory, which was the length of shortest distance fromandto the central axis of the planned trajectory respectively (Fig. 2b, c). In addition, the translational deviation at the entry point was evaluated by 3D Euclidean distance betweenand(Fig. 2d). The angular deviation in degrees was calculated by the angle between the planned and conducted trajectories, using the following function:, whereandwere the vectors along the central axis of the planned and the conducted trajectory respectively (Fig. 2e).

The translational deviation between the planned and conducted entry and endpoints, angular deviation, and depth, were evaluated with an LMM as described above in the sample size calculation. The perceived workload in NASA-TLX was evaluated by unpaired t -test. Time and SUS between systems were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests. Normal distribution was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Dynamical constraints on neural population activity [^3d882287]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

In the IT and instructed path tasks, we measured the signed ‘initial angle’ between the heading direction of the trajectory and the vector pointing from the start target to the IT (that is, the direct path). We defined the heading direction of each trajectory as the vector from the first to the fourth time point of the cursor trajectory, where the first time point corresponds to when the cued target first appears on the screen. The fourth time point (180 ms) was chosen because it was late enough to ensure that the animal was responding to the visual display of the target but early enough to minimize the effect of any error corrections that occurred later in the trial. The initial angle was computed for each trial and then averaged across successful trials and failed trials that reached at least the fourth time point. Including failed trials helped to characterize dynamical constraints for the instructed path task, in which reducing the size of the boundary led to lower success rates, without over-representing successful trajectories that might have been more direct to the IT.

To understand to what extent the cursor trajectories during the IT and instructed path tasks were consistent with the flow field defined by the two-target trajectories, we also computed the initial angle of the two-target trials as a reference, using the same method as described above. We defined the initial angle of the two-target trials as the average initial angle of the first 20 trials from the same start target as was tested in the IT and instructed path tasks (that is, the early two-target trials). Using the early two-target trials allowed us to construct control comparisons (described in detail below) with the same reference.

To compare the change in the initial angle across experiments, we normalized the change in the initial angle:whereis the trial-averaged initial angle for early two-target trials andis the trial-averaged initial angle for the IT trials (Fig. 6) or instructed path trials (Fig. 7) defined relative to the direct path to the IT. All angles lie between −180° and 180°. A value ofmeans that there is no change in initial angle relative to the two-target trials (plotted as 0% difference in initial angle). A value ofmeans the animal is able to move the cursor straight from the start target to the IT along the direct path, that is,(plotted as 100% difference in initial angle). It is possible forto be less than 0, which indicates that.

Data analysis

All data were analyzed off-line with a custom Matlab code (R2015b; MathWorks, Natick, MA). Vertical ground reaction forces were filtered with a 15-Hz second-order low-pass Butterworth filter and missing data were interpolated. Gait events were determined at the moment when the vertical ground reaction forces crossed the threshold of 50 N on either force plate. To determine balance parameters, the CoM velocity and CoM position were obtained from the ground reaction forces which were divided by body mass to obtain the CoM acceleration (m·s −2). The CoM acceleration was double-integrated to obtain CoM position (m) and was high-pass filtered (0.2 Hz cutoff) to prevent integration drift. For the absolute CoM position, the previously obtained CoM position was supplemented with the 0.2-Hz low-pass Butterworth filtered CoP signal.

The XCoM position was determined with Equation 1 for both the AP as the ML directions. With l as leg length (m) and g as gravitational acceleration (9.81 m·s −1).

The MoS was defined as the distance between the CoP position and the XCoM position at contralateral toe-off for each step. The AP MoS is calculated along the x axis and the ML MoS along the z axis.

Step length was defined as the AP distance between the CoP x position of the left and right leg at heel-strike. Step length was normalized for leg length by dividing step length through leg length. Single support time was defined as the time from contralateral toe-off to contralateral heel-strike. Double support time was defined as the time from unilateral heel-strike to contralateral toe-off. Step width was specified as the difference between minimum/maximum ML CoP position of the ipsilateral single support, and minimum/maximum ML CoP of the consecutive contralateral single support for each step. Cadence was defined as the number of steps per minute.

Balance parameters were averaged over a number of steps for each of the four phases, fast baseline (last five steps), slow baseline (last five steps), initial perturbation (first five steps of adaptation), and early change (steps 6–30 of the adaptation). During the baselines (fast, slow), all variables (except step width) were calculated for the left and right legs, and during split-belt walking (initial perturbation, early change), variables were calculated for the leg on the fast belt (fast leg) and the leg on the slow belt (slow leg).

(D) All trip-wire crossings, with and without laser stimulation, ordered by time of arrival to the left obstacle edge. Note that mice must be moving toward the shelter area (i.e. southward) to trigger the trip wire.

(F) Distance explored on the threat half: p = 0.5, one-tailed permutation test; n = 8 mice in each group.

We divided injected and implanted animals into a laser-on and a control, laser-off group. Both groups explored a circular platform with a shelter and an obstacle for 20 min (n = 8 mice/sessions; Figures S2 A and S2B). During this time, all mice located the shelter and visited the entire platform, including the obstacle (Figures S3 F and S3H). In agreement with previous results,all mice in the laser-off group executed continuous running movements from the threat area toward the shelter area (“homing runs”; No. per session: 6 [5, 8.25], median [IQR]; Figures 1 A, S3 G, and S3I). These included at least one homing run that directly targeted an obstacle edge (“edge-vector runs”; No. per session: 1.5 [1, 2.25], median [IQR]); Figures 1 A and S3 J; Video S1). Mice in the laser-on group triggered 3.5 [2.75, 6] (median [IQR]) laser stimulation trials, lasting 20 [16, 26] s in total and interrupting all potential edge-vector runs (Figures 1 D, S3 G, and S3J). While mice in the laser-off group executed nearly direct paths between the threat area and the left obstacle edge, the paths taken by mice in the stimulation group were twice as long, reflecting the inaccessibility of edge-vector runs (Figure 1 E). Exploratory behavior, however, was not reduced. Mice in the stimulation condition explored the obstacle, the edge, the threat area, and the entire arena as much as the control group (Figures 1 F, S3 F, and S3H).

ICU location relative to key destinations emphasizes transport risk and proximity. Transport out of the ICU is a high-risk event for patients with risk related to both time and distance, and specific locations associated with increased risk of death include radiology, the operating room, and procedures such as angiography and endoscopy. Ensuring proximity to key destinations helps enable safe, quality care for all ICU patients, and based on indirect evidence, a GPS was made to prioritize locating ICUs near key resources to reduce patient transport time.

### Elite sprinting: are athletes individually step-frequency or step-length reliant? [^a421d4da]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to investigate the step characteristics among the very best 100-m sprinters in the world to understand whether the elite athletes are individually more reliant on step frequency (SF) or step length (SL).

Methods

A total of 52 male elite-level 100-m races were recorded from publicly available television broadcasts, with 11 analyzed athletes performing in 10 or more races. For each run of each athlete, the average SF and SL over the whole 100-m distance was analyzed. To determine any SF or SL reliance for an individual athlete, the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the SF-time versus SL-time relationships was derived using a criterion nonparametric bootstrapping technique.

Results

Athletes performed these races with various combinations of SF and SL reliance. Athlete A10 yielded the highest positive CI difference (SL reliance), with a value of 1.05 (CI = 0.50-1.53). The largest negative difference (SF reliance) occurred for athlete A11 as -0.60, with the CI range of -1.20 to 0.03.

Conclusions

Previous studies have generally identified only one of these variables to be the main reason for faster running velocities. However, this study showed that there is a large variation of performance patterns among the elite athletes and, overall, SF or SL reliance is a highly individual occurrence. It is proposed that athletes should take this reliance into account in their training, with SF-reliant athletes needing to keep their neural system ready for fast leg turnover and SL-reliant athletes requiring more concentration on maintaining strength levels.

### Determination of geolocations for anesthesia specialty coverage and standby call allowing return to the hospital within a specified amount of time [^bb8e8cc0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For emergent procedures, in-house teams are required for immediate patient care. However, for many procedures, there is time to bring in a call team from home without increasing patient morbidity. Anesthesia providers taking subspecialty or backup call from home are required to return to the hospital within a designated number of minutes. Driving times to the hospital during the hours of call need to be considered when deciding where to live or to visit during such calls. Distance alone is an insufficient criterion because of variable traffic congestion and differences in highway access. We desired to develop a simple, inexpensive method to determine postal codes surrounding hospitals allowing a timely return during the hours of standby call.

Methods

Pessimistic travel times and driving distances were calculated using the Google distance matrix application programming interface for all N = 136 postal codes within 60 great circle ("straight line") miles of the University of Miami Hospital (Miami, FL) during all 108 weekly standby call hours. A postal code was acceptable if the estimated longest driving time to return to the hospital was ≤60 minutes (the anesthesia department's service commitment to start an urgent case during standby call). Linear regression (with intercept = 0) minimizing the mean absolute percentage difference between the distances (great circle and driving) and the pessimistic driving times to return to the hospital was performed among all 136 postal codes. Implementation software written in Python is provided.

Results

Postal codes allowing return to the studied hospital within the specified interval were identified. The linear regression showed that driving distances correlated poorly with the longest driving time to return to the hospital among the 108 weekly call hours (mean absolute percentage error = 25.1% ± 1.7% standard error [SE]; N = 136 postal codes). Great circle distances also correlated poorly (mean absolute percentage error = 28.3% ± 1.9% SE; N = 136). Generalizability of the method was determined by successful application to a different hospital in a rural state (University of Iowa Hospital).

Conclusions

The described method allows identification of postal codes surrounding a hospital in which personnel taking standby call could be located and be able to return to the hospital during call hours on every day of the week within any specified amount of time. For areas at the perimeter of the acceptability, online distance mapping applications can be used to check driving times during the hours of standby call.

### Endoscopic removal of colorectal lesions: recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^fa9caf2c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer—perforation risk, recognition, and management: Iatrogenic perforation due to polypectomy is rare at 0.08% (95% CI, 0.06%–0.1%), and among ≥ 20 mm colorectal lesions the perforation rate with endoscopic resection was 1.5% (95% CI, 1.2%–1.7%). In a Japanese nationwide database, perforation was associated with renal disease (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.38–4.94), tumor size ≥ 20 mm (adjOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.61–4.44), and use of warfarin (adjOR 2.02; 95% CI, 1.10–3.70), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (adjOR 2.15, 95% CI, 1.44–3.20), and steroids (adjOR 2.12, 95% CI, 1.14–4.03). Steps to minimize tissue injury include full closure of a monofilament wire snare with a distance of <1 cm between the thumb and the fingers and a fast transection speed. Careful and frequent inspection of the post-resection defect for signs of deep mural injury is recommended, and examination of the mucosal defect may show 2 concentric white rings of cautery. Deep mural injury has been observed in 10.2% of the EMR defect of large (≥ 20 mm) non-pedunculated lesions, with defect target signs and perforation observed in 3% of cases and associated with transverse colon location, en bloc resection of >25 mm, and advanced pathology. Early identification and management of perforation have correlated with reductions in surgery and mortality and successes in endoscopic closure, and endoscopic clipping techniques have been shown to be useful in cases of small perforation and prophylactically when the resection appears deep into the muscularis propria. After defect closure, patients without clinical signs or symptoms of peritonitis can be discharged on a conservative diet with a course of oral antibiotics, although this has not been studied formally, whereas most patients with diffuse peritonitis from colonic perforation require surgery.

### Multiprocessor scheduling implementation of the simultaneous multiple volume (SMV) navigator method [^057e6562]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The simultaneous multiple volume (SMV) approach in navigator-gated MRI allows the use of the whole motion range or the entire scan time for the reconstruction of final images by simultaneously acquiring different image volumes at different motion states. The motion tolerance range for each volume is kept small, thus SMV substantially increases the scan efficiency of navigator methods while maintaining the effectiveness of motion suppression. This article reports a general implementation of the SMV approach using a multiprocessor scheduling algorithm. Each motion state is regarded as a processor and each volume is regarded as a job. An efficient scheduling that completes all jobs in minimal time is maintained even when the motion pattern changes. Initial experiments demonstrated that SMV significantly increased the scan efficiency of navigator-gated MRI.

Triathlon is an increasingly popular sport that includes swimming, cycling, followed by running. The triathlete should not be seen merely as a cyclist who also swims and runs. Notable differences are seen in the type of bike used, training patterns, lower extremity demands, and cumulative nature of the sport. Injury prevention and treatment strategies need to take into account the triathlon distance, the type of bike used, athletic experience, prior injuries, risk factors, and a thorough understanding of the demands placed on the body through all 3 disciplines (swim, bike, and run).

### A stochastic model of randomly accelerated walkers for human mobility [^8cd8ff99]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Random acceleration kicks

In contrast with the assumption underlying equation (2), accelerations are not uncorrelated: in Fig. 3a, we indeed observe that an average trip can be separated into a first half where one uses progressively faster roads and a second half with deceleration until the velocity reaches back the base speed at time t. We use this simple representation in a stochastic model (see the schematic in Fig. 3b) and make the following assumptions. The transportation network is modelled by n layers L n, corresponding to different travel speeds v n (we neglect saturation effects, see Methods section and Supplementary methods). The speed differences between layers are taken constant and equal to δv, and the speed on layer L k is then v k = v 0 + kδv. An individual starts then her trip of duration t in the layer L 0 with base speed v 0, and we assume that there are two phases in a trip, acceleration and deceleration, of roughly the same duration. In both the ascending and descending phases, we define a Poissonian process where all individuals have the same probability per unit time p to jump to the successive layer and to change their speed.

Within this model, we can estimate the maximal speed v m = v 0 + k (t m) δv, where k (t m) is the number of jumps at mid trajectory t m = t /2, and get approximatively the average speed≈(v 0 + v m)/2. Since the process is Poissonian, we have 〈 k (t m)〉= pt m and the average speed is given by

where the brackets denote the average over the Poisson variable k. The average speed thus grows linearly with t, in agreement with empirical observations. Remarkably enough, this model allows us to predict also the shape of the conditional probability distribution. Indeed, the number of jumps k is distributed following the Poisson distributionwith λ = pt /2. Using the Gamma function as the natural analytic continuation of the factorial k !=Γ(1+ k), we obtain the distribution

For simulations with resetting, we plot the meanstandard deviation of ten independent repetitions with 10 4 trajectories each (errors are smaller than the marker size in almost all cases).

We emphasize that all the results of Fig. 3 a were obtained using a single set of trajectories with no resetting and simply re-evaluating Equations (4 – 7) for every value of r 0 and b, leading to a different MFPT through Equation (3). Previously, obtaining the above results would have required performing an ensemble of brute-force simulations at every value of the parameters r 0 and b, to map out the MFPT phase space. This approach would be computationally prohibitive in many cases. Moreover, the strength of our approach becomes even clearer when considering other forms of r (x) apart from Equation (8). Tackling these using brute-force simulations, analytical methods, or experiments, would require a complete reanalysis of the problem. On the other hand, using our method, we can use the same initial ensemble of trajectories to generate the MFPT phase space for any resetting protocol, with minimal added cost. In section 4 of the Supplementary Information, we demonstrate this for several other sigmoidal-shaped resetting protocols (Supplementary Fig. S2).

### Rapid ground transport of trauma patients: a Moderate distance from trauma center improves survival [^5114575c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is debate within the emergency medical services (EMS) community over the value of calling a helicopter for trauma patients within a moderate distance/<45 min, of a trauma center. Helicopter EMS (HEMS) generally have a wider scope and more advanced training than the ground EMS (GEMS). GEMS, on the other hand, have the benefit of being able to immediately initiate rapid transport to the trauma center without the delay involved with HEMS flying to the scene, landing, and assuming patient care.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients brought to a level I trauma center who were admitted with blunt traumatic injuries between 2010 and 2015 in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. Two analyses were performed, one in which the patient's reported initial scene vitals met criteria for step one of the Centers for Disease Control's 2011 National Field Triage Guidelines (NFTG) and the other in which the patient's initial scene vitals met those same guidelines and/or had a pulse greater than 110 beats per minute. Patients were categorized on scene to emergency department (ED) transport mode, either HEMS or GEMS. Inclusion criteria were a HEMS response time to the scene that was between 15 and 45 min with a transport time from the scene to the ED that was between 10 and 35 min or a GEMS transport time from the scene to the ED that was between 15 and 45 min. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was established through logit regression. Mortality rates were then calculated within each transport mode-based population.

Results

Four hundred subjects were included in the analysis of patients meeting the first step of the NFTG, with 212 HEMS patients and 188 in the GEMS group. HEMS had a higher mortality rate at 0.184 and GEMS at 0.101, which was statistically significant (P = 0.019). When 606 subjects meeting the first step of the NFTG or with a pulse greater than 110 beats per minute were analyzed, the results were statistically significant (P < 0.001), with the HEMS category having a higher mortality rate at 0.154 and the GEMS category having a lower mortality at 0.056.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that scene-to-ED time is paramount, and rapid ground transport should be used in blunt trauma patients when the scene is up to a moderate ground distance away from the trauma center and there would be a moderate-to-prolonged HEMS response time. In both analyses, hemodynamically unstable trauma patients had lower rates of mortality following ground transport. We recognize that there may be a subset of patients at these distances who could benefit from HEMS response, particularly if the flight crew can offer more advanced and specialized techniques; however, every effort should be made to minimize the scene-to-ED time, and HEMS response, scene, and transport time must be considered. This study only analyzed the patients within a moderate distance of the trauma center and at longer distances or in different environments; HEMS transport may indeed minimize the scene to ED time.

Look at the liquid medicine to make sure it is mixed well. If you see any small pieces at the bottom of the bottle, invert the bottle and shake it up and down for another 30 seconds or until you can no longer see the pieces at the bottom of the bottle (see Figure B). If the liquid medicine all looks the same, you can proceed to Step 2.

### CD163 + macrophages in mantle cell lymphoma induce activation of prosurvival pathways and immune suppression [^51d9dd15]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Deregulation of cell survival–related proteins was also identified when the 2 types of MCL TIMEs were compared. CD95/FAS (Fas cell surface death receptor) was higher in CD3 + cell segments collected from CD163-sparse TIMEs (Figure 5 C; supplemental Table 6). A higher expression of GZMB and cleaved caspase-9 in CD20 + cell segments indicates more active cytolytic activity in the CD163-rich TIMEs than in the CD163-sparse TIMEs (Figure 5 B). In contrast, CD3 + cell segments showed lower levels of GMZA in the CD163-rich vs CD163-sparse TIMEs.

To assess whether there was a correlation between the abundance of CD163 + cells and the distance between CD20 + and CD3 + cells, the minimal distance between each CD20 + cell and the closest CD163 + and CD3 + cell, respectively, was determined in tumor regions. The presence of 1 or more CD163 + cells (within a 30-μm radius) was associated with a shorter CD20 + and CD3 + minimal cell distance (median value, 10.5 and 12.4 μm, respectively; P < 0.001) (supplemental Figure 2 C), indicating that the presence of CD163 + cells is associated with a closer interaction between tumor cells and T cells. This is in line with the previously reported correlation between CD163 + and CD3 + cell numbers that was independent of the spatial compartment.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Sensing flow gradients is necessary for learning autonomous underwater navigation [^b382d1f0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We systematically challenged the swimmer to reach a fixed target located at the center of the training domain starting from any initial position in the flow field, including at locations unexplored during training (Fig. 6). To standardize these tests, we initialized the agent’s position on a regular grid over the entire fluid domain and, at each grid point, we initialized the agent orientation using 36 distinct initial orientations evenly distributed from 0 to 360 ∘. We fixed the initial phase t o of the flow. In total, we performed 34,020 test cases per policy. As expected, both geocentric and egocentric policies almost surely succeeded when starting within the training domain (Fig. 6 C, D). The egocentric policy generalized better upstream of the training domain (90% success of egocentric policy versus 55% success of geocentric policy). The geocentric policy performed better at downstream locations (63% success of geocentric policy versus 47% success of egocentric policy), but both policies reached a limit beyond which they failed (straight gray lines in Fig. 6 C, D). Failure downstream of the training domain occurred before physical limitations due to viscous decay of the vortex structures were reached, reflecting the limitations of the policies themselves. We return to this point later.

In addition to the success rate, we systematically evaluated the average time that successful trajectories spent to reach the target (Fig. 6 E, F). On average, the geocentric navigator spent slightly less time than the egocentric navigator; namely, the geocentric agent was on average 8% faster than the egocentric agent when starting inside the training domain, but the difference was negligible, less than 1.5%, outside the training domain; the average total time to reach the target being nearly 23 (geocentric) and 25 (egocentric) in units of D / U inside the training domain versus 35 (geocentric) and 35.4 (egocentric) outside the training domain.

Day of testing—arrival/registration, distancing, and telehealth—specific precautions are recommended at arrival, during imaging, and during stress testing to minimize COVID‑19 exposure risk, and an important principle is to minimize the time patients spend in the laboratory; appropriate physical distancing should be maintained at all stages with waiting areas arranged accordingly, accompanying visitors and family members should not be allowed or should be limited to one person only if essential, and if space is constrained consideration should be to having patients wait in their vehicles until contacted by cellphone and then be escorted to the laboratory; the use of telehealth to assess symptoms, register, provide test details, and obtain verbal consent is generally recommended, processes should be automated as much as possible with some onsite steps via the patient’s smartphone, and the healthcare screening questionnaire should be thorough.

Leishmaniasis—epidemiology and cutaneous leishmaniasis distribution—In 2021, leishmaniasis was reported to be endemic in 99 countries, and an estimated 600,000 to 1,000,000 new cases of CL and 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of VL occur annually. In the Eastern Hemisphere, CL is found in Africa, particularly the tropical region and North Africa; Asia, particularly Central and Southwest Asia; southern Europe, including southern France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the Mediterranean islands; and some countries of the Middle East, and leishmaniasis from these areas is often referred to as “Old World” leishmaniasis. In the Western Hemisphere, CL is found in parts of Mexico, all countries of Central America, and most of South America except Chile and Uruguay; Endemic transmission in the United States has been identified in Texas, especially among people living in areas bordering northeastern Mexico, and possibly in Arizona and Oklahoma, while Endemic transmission of CL is not found in Canada; leishmaniasis from these areas is often referred to as “New World” leishmaniasis. GeoSentinel Surveillance from 1997–2017 indicated that among patients with laboratory confirmed CL at specialized travel or tropical medicine clinics on 6 continents, common source countries for travel-associated CL included the Amazon Basin (Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Israel; among immigrants, Afghanistan and Syria were common sources, and cases in US service personnel reflected military activities in Afghanistan and Iraq.

### New model for skills assessment and training progress in minimally invasive surgery [^7c30e4e3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

With the spread of minimally invasive surgery and training in this field, development of metrics for skills assessment and training progress has become increasingly important. Our approach was to use the tracking of motion for the definition of objectives metrics.

Methods

We have developed an inanimate model and tracked the 3D coordinates of the instrument tips with an ultrasound system. Besides already validated parameters (time, error time, and distance efficiency ratio) we examined the transit and the speed profile for their evidentiary power. Performances of experts (who have already performed >100 laparoscopic operations) and novices (<20 laparoscopic operations) were evaluated.

Result

The standardized time, the error time as a precision indicator, and the transit profile parameter for spatial perception could significantly ( p < 0.05) distinguish between experts and novices. Furthermore, these parameters and the distance efficiency ratio improved significantly during a training course in laparoscopic surgery.

Conclusion

Our model showed changes of the mentioned parameters with experience. According to our results, it can be used for skills assessment and as a training progress measurement system. We propose transit profile as an additional important parameter for assessment.

### Separate luminous structures leading positive leader steps [^9736a117]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

During the bi-directional development of the separate luminous structure, the upper end of the separate luminous structure propagated backward (toward the descending leader tip), and the lower end of the separate luminous structure developed forward. The initiation point of the separate luminous structure emitted light for a longer period of time compared to the other positions of the separate luminous structure during its growth, so it is reasonable to assume that the pixel point with the largest grayscale value on the separate luminous structure shown in frame #3 is its initiation point. Considering the framerate of the high-speed camera, it is could be estimated that the average forward development velocity of the separate luminous structure is less than 6.53 × 10 5 m/s and greater than 3.27 × 10 5 m/s, and the average backward development velocity of the separate luminous structure is less than 2.47 × 10 5 m/s and greater than 1.24 × 10 5 m/s. The average forward development velocity of the separate luminous structure was obviously greater than the average backward development velocity. The average bi-directional development velocity of the separate luminous structure is estimated to be less than 9 × 10 5 m/s and greater than 4.5 × 10 5 m/s, which is close to the leader-step formation speed of negative lightning leaders reported in recent literature.

### A high-performance brain-computer interface for finger decoding and quadcopter game control in an individual with paralysis [^377741e2]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Closed-loop decoding software

The SBP was imported to a script that calculatedfrom the input data (three time bins, 192 channels). The signalwas normalized using the values calculated during training, and the empirically tuned gain was also applied. No smoothing was applied. The positions of the fingers were updated at each time step using the velocities.

When the positions of the virtual fingers were used to control the quadcopter, ‘gravity’ was applied to the fingers when the fingers were near the neutral position so that the fingers did not appear to jitter when the intention was to hold them steady. Specifically, when the fingers were within 10% of the range of motion of the neutral position, a position-independent, constant, low-amplitude value was added to the decoded velocity of the finger to bias the velocity toward the neutral position. Decoded velocities were scaled to a maximum of ±10 m s −1 and ±90 deg s −1 for linear and rotational velocities, and each DOF was tuned empirically with gain values equal to 0.6 for thumb flexion/extension, 0.8 for thumb abduction/adduction, 0.4 for index–middle flexion/extension and 0.6 for ring–little flexion/extension.

Algorithm training

The algorithm was trained on a combination of open- and closed-loop trials, and the details are included in the Supplementary Methods. Briefly, the algorithm (Extended Data Fig. 2) was initialized using the Kaiming initialization method. The neural network minimized the mean-squared error (torch.nn.MSELoss) between the actual finger velocities during open-loop training and the algorithm output using the Adam optimization algorithm(torch.optim.Adam). After the offline algorithm training, the online, closed-loop sessions were performed. After a closed-loop session, the adapted recalibrated feedback intention-trained (ReFIT) algorithm, was used to update the parameters of the neural network. The corresponding finger velocities used for training were assigned a value equal to the decoded velocity when the velocity is pointed toward the target, and the sign is inverted when the velocity is directed away from the target. Starting with the same parameters for the neural network algorithm used during the online session, the Adam optimization algorithm (lr = 1 × 10 −4, weight_decay = 1 × 10 −2) was applied and trained over 500 additional iterations.

### Dynamic protein conformations preferentially drive energy transfer along the active chain of the photosystem II reaction centre [^7a5a5a66]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

MD simulations

We first performed a 10,000-step energy minimization with the steepest descent algorithmby freezing the PSII complex. The whole system was further energy minimized in another 5,000 steps. Next, the system was simulated with position restrained on all the heavy atoms of the PSII complex with a force constant of 10 kJ mol −1 Å −2 under NVT ensemble (T =300 K), followed by another 10 ns simulation under NPT ensemble (T =300 K and P =1 bar). The final configuration from the position-restrained simulation was used to initiate five independent 20 ns production of NPT (T =300 K and P =1 bar) simulations with temperature annealing from 50 to 300 K in the first 1 ns and different initial velocities (see Supplementary Methods for the simulating parameters). To study the properties at low temperatures, similar procedures and parameters were used to perform another round of MD simulations at 77 K. Following a similar procedure, we also simulated the Thr179Glu mutant (Supplementary Methods). All the MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 4.5 (ref.).

### Chunking as the result of an efficiency computation trade-off [^8a2f6fe9]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Detecting chunk boundaries

We detected chunk boundaries (that is, HALT points) for each trial based on local minima of speed trajectories that dropped below an adaptive threshold (5% of the peak speed of that trial). If more than one local minimum was detected in between two local maxima that exceeded a threshold (25% of the peak speed of that trial), we only retained the lowest minimum among these local minima.

To compute the speed trajectory itself, we smoothed x and y positions using a finite-impulse response low-pass filter having a 100-ms support, and then took the finite-difference derivate to calculate x and y velocities. The speed was computed as the square root of the sum of squares of x and y velocities.

Quantifying efficiency and computational complexity

To quantify movement efficiency, we calculated sum of the squared jerk for each trial. Monkeys completed the sequences in shorter durations with learning, and the expected increase in sum squared jerk from faster movements scales as a fifth power of increase in duration. Since we were interested in decreasing trends in jerk that could not be predicted by duration changes alone, we stretched the duration of every trial to be exactly 5 s. We then computed jerk as the sum of squares of the third derivatives of x and y positions. Before taking each derivative, we smoothed the kinematic estimates (position, velocity and acceleration) using a finite-impulse response low-pass filter having a 100-ms support.

To quantify computational complexity, we exploited the idea that the complexity of the search space grows exponentially with the planning horizon. We defined the computational complexity of optimizing an n -element chunk to be proportional to exp(n). Thus, for a sequence comprising K chunks (as inferred by our chunk boundary detection method), each of length n 1, n 2, …, n k, we defined the complexity as. To improve the interpretability of this metric, we scaled complexity to units of chunk length and used log(C) as a measure of complexity.

### Reduced-field of view three-dimensional MR acoustic radiation force imaging with a low-rank reconstruction for targeting transcranial focused ultrasound [^1738ab9b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To rapidly image and localize the focus in MR-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) while maintaining a low ultrasound duty cycle to minimize tissue effects.

Methods

MR-acoustic radiation force imaging (ARFI) is key to targeting FUS procedures such as neuromodulation, and works by encoding ultrasound-induced displacements into the phase of MR images. However, it can require long scan times to cover a volume of tissue, especially when minimizing the FUS dose during targeting is paramount. To simultaneously minimize scan time and the FUS duty cycle, a 2-min three-dimensional (3D) reduced-FOV spin echo ARFI scan with two-dimensional undersampling was implemented at 3T with a FUS duty cycle of 0.85%. The 3D k-space sampling scheme incorporated uniform undersampling in one phase-encoded axis and partial Fourier (PF) sampling in the other. The scan interleaved FUS-on and FUS-off data collection to improve displacement map quality via a joint low-rank image reconstruction. Experiments in agarose and graphite phantoms and living macaque brains for neuromodulation and blood-brain barrier opening studied the effects of the sampling and reconstruction strategy on the acquisition, and evaluated its repeatability and accuracy.

Results

In the phantom, the distances between displacement centroids of 10 prospective reconstructions and a fully sampled reference were below 1mm. In in vivo brain, the distances between centroids ranged from 1.3 to 2.1mm. Results in phantom and in vivo brain both showed that the proposed method can recover the FUS focus compared to slower fully sampled scans.

Conclusion

The proposed 3D MR-ARFI reduced-FOV method enables rapid imaging of the FUS focus while maintaining a low FUS duty cycle.

### Decreased navigated drilling time using an external guide stabilising device [^6074282e]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Computer navigation in orthopaedic procedures can improve accuracy and decrease radiation time compared to traditional fluoroscopy. Many different applications are now available, and drilling is commonly used amongst them. Aside from additional set up time required, the drilling procedure itself may take a significant amount of time. We hypothesised that using an external stabilising guide which can be set anywhere in space can decrease then time necessary for navigated drilling.

Methods

Foam blocks, 80 mm in length and a density similar to cancellous bone, were obtained. Small discs were placed on one end as drilling targets. Using an Iso-C 3D navigation system, 20 navigated drilling trials were performed under each of two conditions: freehand, and with the use of a drill stabilising guide attached to an operating table. The time and accuracy of the two methods were compared.

Results

The time required for the entire navigation procedure was significantly less using the stabilising arm compared to drilling freehand with navigation (4.5 min versus 5.8 min, p=0.009). There was no significant difference in accuracy between the two methods.

Conclusion

Using a guide which attaches to the table and allows the surgeon to fix the drill sleeve when the desired vector is chosen allows for faster navigated drilling. This was easy to set up and attach to the table, and did not diminish accuracy of drilling an intended target.

### Compressed sensing acceleration of radial 3-D alternating look-lockermapping [^7a8519eb]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

Subspace‐constrained model utilizing spatial total variation and locally low‐rank regularization, S‐STV+LLR, was the best reconstruction model. The S‐STV‐LLR model was also the most sophisticated model and required tuning of two regularization parameters and choosing the appropriate subspace. While the subspace parameters can be determined from, e.g. previous scans or literature, tuning of the regularization parameters without a fully sampled reference remains an open problem. Some methods have been proposed for automatic regularization tuning,,,,but they have limited use cases. The S‐STV model had nearly the same performance but with one less regularization parameter. Careful consideration should thus be given when choosing the appropriate reconstruction model.

The subspace constraint significantly improved spatial total variation, while locally low‐rank regularization performed similarly with or without the constraint. Since the subspace is derived from principal component analysis, the first coefficient image contains most of the relevant information and has the highest SNR, with the SNR and information content of subsequent coefficient images rapidly decreasing. Thus, while locally low‐rank regularization yields higher‐quality, low‐information‐content coefficient images, their contributions to the original image series are minimal. Similarly, spatial total variation benefits from the subspace because small image details can be better distinguished from noise in the first coefficient image, which has high SNR and information content. This trend likely generalizes to other spatial and temporal regularizations as well.

For the generation of the subspace, the quantitative parameter ranges were chosen to be as small as possible. This allows for the subspace to be compressed as efficiently as possible, but might be an unreasonable approach in practice since the exact ranges of the parameters may not be known in advance. Larger dictionaries might necessitate the use of a larger subspace to maintain appropriate modeling error. Increasing the subspace size lowers the modeling error but also amplifies the reconstruction noise.Modifying the subspace size possibly affects the results.

Usually, some form of phase correction is utilized with total variation since image phase can cause the real and imaginary components to not be piecewise constant even if the magnitude image itself is.MB‐SWIFT images have relatively constant minimal phase, since essentially no phase evolution happens during imaging,which does not significantly affect the total variation regularization. If parallel imaging is utilized, the phase of the radiofrequency coil elements will affect the image phase and possibly deteriorate the performance of the spatial total variation if no phase correction is utilized.

### Traveling to receive treatment for extremity soft tissue sarcomas: is it worth the drive? [^93b85d85]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Regionalization of sarcoma care may improve outcomes. Concerns exist regarding the burdens of travel and its effects on care. We evaluate the presence of a "distance bias".

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (stage I-III) within the NCDB. Travel distance (TD) and hospital volume (VOL) were categorized into quartiles. Alternating statistical models were used for analysis.

Results

1,035 hospitals contributed 11,979 cases. Median and maximum VOL were 5 and 45 cases/year. VOL quartiles were "low-volume" (LV) (892 hospitals,<3 cases/yr.), "intermediate low-volume" (ILV) (89, 3-5 cases/yr.), "intermediate high-volume" (IHV) (39, 6-12 cases/yr.), and "high-volume" (HV) (15,>12 cases/yr.). TD quartiles: "short-travel" (ST) (<8 mi), "intermediate-short travel" (IST) (8-17), "intermediate long-travel" (ILT) (18-49), and "long-travel" (LT) (>50). VOL but not TD is associated with improved survival [HR 0.65 (CI 0.52-0.83)] and rate of R0 resection [1.87 (CI 1.4-2.5)] but has no effect on amputation rates. Matched analyses demonstrate similar results.

Conclusions

Hospital volume but not distance traveled to treatment facility is associated with improved survival and R0 resections for extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Despite the inconveniences of travel, patients may benefit from treatment at high volume centers.

### Sensing flow gradients is necessary for learning autonomous underwater navigation [^fb17d2f7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

At the beginning of each training episode, we chose the target location (x ⋆, y ⋆) randomly inside a circular area of radius 2 D on one side of the wake and the swimmer’s initial position (x o, y o) randomly inside a circular area of the same size on the other side of the wake. We choose the swimmer’s initial orientation θ o randomly between 0 and 2 π ; we set a random initial time t o for the start of the training relative to the wake evolution, which we denote from hereon as the initial phase.

We used V-RACER, a model-free deep RL algorithm, implemented in Smarties to train the agent. The V-RACER algorithm has proven suitable for control problems in complex flow fields,. The policy and value function together are approximated by a 128 × 128 feedforward deep neural network with an additional residual layer that bypasses the second regular layer and additional weight as the standard deviation for action sampling. We set the decision time interval to 0.1 unit time in units of D / V, and we constrained the angular velocity to lie in the intervalin units of V / D.

To consistently evaluate the performance of the RL policies obtained from distinct training and observations, we prepared 1000 test cases by randomly sampling the swimmer’s initial position (x o, y o) and orientation θ o, initial phase t o, and target position (x ⋆, y ⋆), all taken within the same ranges used during training (Supplementary Fig. 4). We tested each of the 105 policies on these 1000 cases (a total of 105,000 tests). Success rates are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

### Swimming by reciprocal motion at low reynolds number [^6cc0c19a]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Multiplying V s in equation (4) by the stroke periodwe obtain a simple expression for the scaled displacement-per-stroke, D / l,

where the sign and magnitude of the dimensionless prefactor β depends on the nature of the stroke and fluid properties. The analytical theory therefore clearly confirms that in a shear thickening fluid, the scallop can indeed swim forward using fast closing and slow opening strokes. Alternatively, it can propel in the opposite direction using fast-opening and slow-closing strokes. This is a general result that permits propulsion from symmetric actuation in any of the abundant non-Newtonain fluids, notably those found in biological systems. In order to allow for quantitative comparisons between the predictions of this analytical theory and experiment, we now consider a millimetre-scale low Re scallop-like swimmer actuated by on-board motors. The device, which we call the ‘macro-scallop’ (shown in Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), differs from the micro-scallop in the use of rotating hinges, and use of motors, which permit rapid and precisely controlled opening and closing of the swimmer’s shells. It has a characteristic length ~15 mm, an average linear velocity ~25 mm s −1 during the fast closing stroke and 6.25 mm s −1 during the slow opening stroke, so that the Re=0.017 for closing and Re=0.094 for opening, which are still low enough to neglect the inertia of the swimmer.

### Fast, simple gradient delay estimation for spiral MRI [^14019115]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Timing delays between data acquisition and gradient transmission result in image degradation. This is especially true in spiral MRI, where delays can alter data in a nonuniform manner, generating significant artifact in the reconstructed data. The many methods that exist to mitigate these delays or measure the k-space coordinates require long measurement times, complicated analysis, specialized phantoms or hardware, or significant changes to the sequence of interest. A fast and simple method is proposed to measure delays on each gradient channel. It requires only minimal modification to an existing spiral sequence and can be used to measure independent delays on three gradient channels and any scan subject within six sequence repetition times. The effectiveness and accuracy of this method are analyzed.

### Model-free tracking control of complex dynamical trajectories with machine learning [^1cd90a83]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The training phase is divided into a series of uncorrelated episodes, ensuring that the velocity or acceleration of the robot arms will not become unreasonably large during the random-walk motion of the reference trajectory. The episodes are initialized at time T ep = 80/ d t. The angular positions q 1 and q 2 of the two arms is set to a random value uniformly distributed in the ranges [0, 2 π] and [− π, π], respectively. The angular velocities and accelerationsof the two arms as well as the reservoir state r are set to zero initially. From the values of q 1 and q 2, the coordinates C x and C y of the end effector can be obtained from Eq. (7). At the beginning of each episode, since q 1 and q 2 are random, the end-effector will be a random point inside a circle of radius l 1 + l 2 = 1 centered at the origin. Figure 5 a shows the random-walk reference trajectory used in training and examples of the evolution of the dynamical states of the two arms (in two different colors):, and τ 1,2 (t). To maintain the continuity of the control signal during the training phase, we invoke a Gaussian filter to smooth the noisy signals. Given the control signal u (t) = [τ 1 (t), τ 2 (t)] and the state variablesat each time step, the angular accelerationscan be obtained from Eq. (4). At the next time step, the angular positions and velocities are calculated usingThe purpose of the training is for the reservoir controller to learn the intrinsic mapping from y (t) to y (t + d t) and to produce an output control signal u (t) = [τ 1 (t), τ 2 (t)].

### Stepping through fear: analysing postural control in elderly women during transitional locomotor tasks [^379805c6]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

When placing individuals in a state of postural threat, it was observed that prolonged APA during step initiation often correlates with a shorter first step. A shorter stride reduces balance safety and increases the risk of falling. According to Ellmers et al. larger APAs negatively impacted the mechanism but were required to produce step initiation. The authors introduced an actual condition that could provoke a FoF. The task of the participants was to cover a distance of about 3 m and four centimeters, as well as 1.1 m above the floor, without a harness. Based on the fear declarations and the Movement Specific Reinvestment Scale, participants were divided into a fearful and a non-fearful group. Fearful participants sought to ensure that the APA was sufficient to position their COM above the support leg prior to initiating the first step, though it resulted in a smaller step. On one hand, a concerning sign in older adults is the prolonged phase of APA, while on the other, its absence is equally worrisome. In the elderly, APAs play a key role in preserving lateral stability. The authors suggested, that elderly without APAs were more prone to falling toward the swing leg side and showed greater lateral velocities compared to those with APAs.

A key finding of this study is that FoF did not affect the time required to regain balance after stepping (S2). There were no significant differences in S2 among the LOW, MODERATE, and HIGH concern groups across all conditions. Similarly, Marone et al. reported no impact of FoF on recovery step length between fear and no fear groups. Their research procedure was different from ours. Participants did not overcome the obstacle, as in our study, but rather, they tripped over it. Trips were induced by using a hidden pneumatically driven obstacle when manually triggered. This suggests that while FoF may delay movement initiation, it does not impair the mechanisms for regaining balance post-step in healthy elderly individuals. However, in populations with neurodegenerative diseases, FoF has been shown to affect compensatory postural adjustments and reaction times.

This study has several limitations. The sample was homogeneous, consisting exclusively of healthy older females, which restricts the generalizability of the findings to broader populations, including males and individuals with varying health statuses. Future research should include diverse populations, including those with a history of falls, to better understand the interplay between FoF and balance across different groups.

### New approach to 3D time-resolved angiography [^b211b263]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

TRICKS is an acquisition and reconstruction method capable of generating 3D time-resolved angiograms. Arguably, the main problem with TRICKS is the way it handles the outer regions of the k-space matrix, leading to artifacts at the edges of blood vessels. An alternative to the data- processing stage of TRICKS, designed to better represent edges and small vessels, is presented here. A weakness of the new approach is an increased sensitivity to motion compared to TRICKS. Since this method can use the same data as TRICKS, a hybrid reconstruction method could conceivably be developed where the advantages of both approaches are combined.

Rescue of the drowning patient—reaching the patient emphasizes rescuer safety and evidence gaps: “Rescuer safety is paramount during rescue operations; in the aquatic environment, specific skills, training, and physical capabilities are required,” and environments vary widely, each “requiring different sets of equipment and training for technical rescue.” Evidence for specific in-water techniques is limited as “Few studies objectively measure the effectiveness of in-water rescue techniques,” and “Much of the literature on this topic is based on the experiences and policies of the writers or organizational authorities.” Untrained rescuer risk is substantial, with “1 study reporting 114 rescuer deaths during a 3-y period in Turkey alone.”
