## Question

23 yo F with intermittent fatigue and abdominal pain diagnosed with acute cholecystitis; normal LFTs, Hb 12.6, MCV 101.4, slight scleral icterus noted on exam. No known allergies. Scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy; anesthesia plans to use standard induction dosing of thiopental. Proceed with thiopental for induction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thiopental is safe for induction of anesthesia in a 23-year-old woman with acute cholecystitis, macrocytosis, and mild scleral icterus, and what the best induction strategy should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable for general anesthesia. Then, I should verify whether the macrocytosis and icterus change the anesthetic risk or suggest an underlying porphyria. Next, I will review thiopental-specific risks, including porphyria, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and drug interactions. After that, I should compare thiopental with alternatives like propofol and consider guideline-based recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated plan and state a clear recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and stability. Acute cholecystitis is best managed with early laparoscopic cholecystectomy when the patient is stable, and contemporary guidelines endorse early surgery within 7–10 days of symptom onset when feasible, which supports proceeding with anesthesia if the patient is hemodynamically stable and without septic shock or absolute contraindications to anesthesia [^c9511f69] [^dd48748b] [^f3bdbe55]. I should double-check that her vitals are stable and there is no concern for sepsis before committing to induction, because septic shock is a contraindication to elective cholecystectomy and would shift management toward resuscitation and source control rather than immediate surgery [^f3bdbe55].

> Now, I need to check whether the macrocytosis and mild icterus signal a hepatobiliary or hematologic issue that would alter anesthetic risk. Normal LFTs argue against significant hepatocellular injury, and macrocytosis with a hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL in a young woman is not classic for acute porphyria, which typically presents with neurovisceral symptoms, dark urine, and biochemical evidence of porphyrin overproduction rather than isolated macrocytosis or subtle icterus [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify the porphyria angle: macrocytosis is not a recognized feature of acute porphyria, and the icterus here is mild and likely related to cholestasis from gallstone disease rather than hepatic synthetic failure, so I should not jump to conclusions about porphyria solely on these labs and exam findings [^notfound].

> Next, I should review thiopental-specific risks. Thiopental is a barbiturate and is contraindicated in patients with manifest or latent porphyria because barbiturates can precipitate acute porphyric attacks, which can be life-threatening; this is a labeled contraindication and a critical safety point I must not overlook [^006baa82] [^1a18d7e1]. Hold on, I should verify whether any of the provided references directly link thiopental to porphyria exacerbation; the FDA labeling for thiopental and methohexital explicitly lists porphyria as a contraindication, and pediatric case literature documents safe alternatives like sevoflurane in porphyria, reinforcing the risk signal even if the patient's phenotype is not classic here [^006baa82] [^1a18d7e1] [^d5839895]. I also need to consider that thiopental is associated with higher postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with propofol, which matters for recovery and discharge planning [^26fc8579] [^1ce5eed7].

> Let me consider alternatives and comparative safety. Propofol is generally preferred in ambulatory and laparoscopic procedures for its antiemetic properties and smoother emergence profile, and in patients with suspected or confirmed porphyria, propofol-based TIVA has been used safely without triggering attacks, though vigilance remains prudent [^56fe0281]. I should confirm whether any head-to-head data exist for thiopental versus propofol in this setting; a randomized trial in ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy found no difference in postoperative fatigue but significantly less rescue antiemesis with propofol compared with thiopental plus desflurane, supporting propofol's advantage for PONV mitigation [^a06c2efe]. But wait, what if propofol is unavailable or contraindicated? In that rare scenario, sevoflurane-based maintenance with careful attention to triggers can be a reasonable alternative in porphyria-suspect patients, though that is not the issue here since propofol is available [^d5839895].

> I should now examine drug–drug interactions that could amplify risk. Remifentanil is commonly used for induction and maintenance and is synergistic with hypnotics; its label advises that doses of thiopental, propofol, and other agents may need to be reduced by up to 75% when coadministered, which increases the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression if I do not adjust the induction dose thoughtfully [^bf3f050c] [^26b9ad40]. Hold on, I should verify the practical implication: if I proceed with thiopental, I would plan to reduce the induction dose in the presence of remifentanil and be prepared to treat apnea and hypotension promptly, but this interaction risk further tilts the balance toward propofol, which is less prone to cumulative respiratory depression in this context [^bf3f050c].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure alignment. While anesthesia guidelines do not dictate a single induction agent for cholecystitis, best practice emphasizes choosing agents with favorable recovery profiles and minimizing PONV, and in patients with any concern for porphyria, avoiding barbiturates is standard; given the uncertainty introduced by macrocytosis and icterus, even if low probability, avoiding thiopental is the safer default [^notfound]. I need to ensure that my plan also incorporates PONV prophylaxis because laparoscopic cholecystectomy carries a meaningful PONV risk, and thiopental increases that risk compared with propofol, so multimodal antiemetics are warranted if thiopental were used despite concerns [^26fc8579] [^1ce5eed7].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the recommendation and the rationale. Given the absence of a clear porphyria diagnosis but the presence of macrocytosis and icterus that, however unlikely, could reflect an occult hepatic porphyria, and given thiopental's labeled contraindication in porphyria and its association with higher PONV, I would not proceed with thiopental induction; instead, I would use propofol for induction with appropriate opioid sparing and PONV prophylaxis, while continuing to evaluate for alternative explanations for macrocytosis postoperatively [^006baa82] [^a06c2efe]. If propofol is absolutely contraindicated, I would consider sevoflurane-based induction with extreme caution and only after discussing the porphyria risk with the surgical team, but that is a contingency and not the preferred path here [^d5839895].

> Finally, I should double-check the practical plan and monitoring. I will induce with propofol, coadminister remifentanil at a reduced dose given synergy, and provide multimodal PONV prophylaxis; I will monitor closely for hemodynamic stability given acute cholecystitis and be prepared to manage a difficult gallbladder with a low threshold for conversion or subtotal cholecystectomy if anatomy is obscured, consistent with safe cholecystectomy principles [^c9511f69] [^0376c82d]. Postoperatively, I will reassess the macrocytosis and icterus with targeted labs, including a peripheral smear, B12/folate, and if symptoms or history raise suspicion, porphyrin studies, while ensuring adequate analgesia and nausea control to support early recovery and discharge planning [^notfound].

Do not use thiopental for induction in this patient. The combination of **macrocytosis and scleral icterus** raises concern for hepatic dysfunction or porphyria, even with normal LFTs, and thiopental is **contraindicated in porphyria** due to risk of acute attacks [^006baa82] [^1a18d7e1]. Use propofol or ketamine for induction instead, and **confirm porphyria risk** with urine porphyrins preoperatively if feasible.

---

## Clinical significance of macrocytosis and scleral icterus

Macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL) reflects enlarged RBCs and is associated with liver disease, alcohol use, B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, and myelodysplasia. Scleral icterus indicates **clinically detectable jaundice** and suggests elevated conjugated or unconjugated bilirubin. Even with normal LFTs, these findings can signal early or subclinical hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis.

---

## Thiopental and hepatic metabolism

Thiopental is metabolized primarily by the liver via oxidative pathways; hepatic dysfunction can prolong its half-life and increase sensitivity. In acute cholecystitis, **biliary stasis and inflammation** may impair hepatic metabolism, raising thiopental toxicity risk.

---

## Porphyria risk and thiopental contraindication

Porphyrias are inherited defects in heme synthesis; acute attacks are triggered by drugs, stress, infection, fasting, and hormones. Thiopental is **absolutely contraindicated** in porphyria because it induces delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, precipitating life-threatening attacks with neurovisceral and autonomic features [^006baa82] [^1a18d7e1]. Although the patient lacks classic porphyria symptoms, the combination of macrocytosis and icterus warrants caution and further evaluation.

---

## Alternative induction agents

Given these concerns, **propofol or ketamine** are preferred alternatives:

- **Propofol**: Rapid onset, short duration, minimal hepatic metabolism, and antiemetic properties; suitable for patients with hepatic dysfunction or porphyria risk.
- **Ketamine**: Minimal hepatic metabolism, hemodynamic stability, and analgesia; useful in hemodynamically unstable patients or when propofol is contraindicated.

---

## Preoperative evaluation and recommendations

Before proceeding, the following steps are **recommended**:

- **Confirm porphyria risk**: Obtain a urine porphyrin screen if feasible, especially if there is a family history or suggestive symptoms.
- **Assess hepatic function**: Consider additional hepatic tests (e.g. direct bilirubin, albumin, INR) to exclude subtle hepatic dysfunction.
- **Document allergies**: Confirm no barbiturate hypersensitivity.
- **Plan alternative induction**: Use propofol or ketamine, with careful hemodynamic monitoring.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not use thiopental for induction in this patient. The combination of macrocytosis and scleral icterus, even with normal LFTs, raises concern for hepatic dysfunction or porphyria, and thiopental is **contraindicated in porphyria**. Use propofol or ketamine for induction and, if time permits, screen for porphyria preoperatively.

Porphyria is caused by disorders of enzymes that synthetize porphyrins. Both elective and emergency surgical procedures on patient suffering from porphyria may provoke acute symptoms. These patients require special anesthetic management since some of commonly used anesthetic agents may also induce acute manifestation of porphyria. We present the case of 53-year-old woman previously diagnosed with porphyria who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion was used. Such conduct proved to be safe regarding clinical symptoms, although biochemical markers were slightly elevated after procedure. Propofol seems to be the safest hypnotic drug to use in porphyria; however, special care should be taken is such cases.

### Factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the national referral hospital, Bhutan: a cross-sectional study [^1ce5eed7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

One-third of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia reported postoperative nausea and vomiting. Previous history of motion sickness and the use of sodium thiopental for the induction of anesthesia were significantly associated with PONV. This study re-emphasizes the importance of identifying high-risk patients and administration of appropriate antiemetic prophylaxis before induction of anesthesia to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is also imperative to have a standard national guideline on the prevention and management of postoperative nausea and vomiting, so the anesthesia personnel can maintain uniformity while prescribing antiemetics and reduce the untoward postoperative complications.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a secondary level hospital, engaging both experienced staff and staff under education, aspiring results of clinical significance. Participants, postoperative personnel and the investigator registering data were blinded to group affiliation. All study procedures were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Linköping, Sweden (2014/120–31). The trial was registered at; registration number: NCT03026543.

Inclusion criteria: adults (> 18 years); American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification I-II (not including body mass index as a health variable); patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Written consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria: acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or cholangitis; conversion to open surgery; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) during or after surgery; extra surgical procedure; complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade (CD) ≥ II.

Patients were consecutively enrolled and randomized to one of two equally sized groups; intervention with PRM or control. Block randomization was computer-generated by an independent statistician, and the allocation decision was placed in sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. The envelope in turn followed the participant to theater, where it was opened by the anesthetic staff. Preoperatively, participants filled in a health declaration. Six weeks of non-smoking was a prerequisite for surgery.

Four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy in anti-Trendelenburg position was performed. Gas pressure was maximum 12 mm Hg. General anesthesia was monitored by an anesthesiologist and nurse. Induction was achieved with either remifentanil and propofol or alfentanil and thiopental, the latter for patients with gastroesophageal reflux. Maintenance anesthesia was with remifentanil as analgesic, and propofol or sevoflurane in oxygen-enriched air as hypnotic. Pressure regulated volume control was standard ventilator mode. The surgeon was either an attending or a resident assisted by a senior colleague. Peroperative cholangiography was performed, according to Swedish routine. If a stone were obstructing the bile duct, an ERCP was performed during surgery or scheduled the following day, and the patient would then be excluded from the study.

Patients and methods

A retrospective review of the charts of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for AC from January 2009 to December 2013 in the department of surgery of a primary care hospital in Germany was performed. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and medical comorbidities as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) were retrieved for each patient.

Acute cholecystitis was diagnosed as outlined in the Tokyo guidelines. The diagnosis was confirmed during surgery and following histopathology. Only patients managed within 72 hours of symptom begin were included for analysis. All patients were placed on intravenous antibiotics upon admission which was continued after surgery. Perioperative data including the duration of anesthesia, the duration of surgery, conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications and the length of postoperative hospital stay were retrieved from surgical documentation sheets, surgeon's notes and discharge records.

All surgeries in this study were performed by experienced attending surgeons. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out using four incisions with pneumoperitoneum installed via a sub-umbilical mini-laparotomy with the maximum intraabdominal pressure kept at 12 mmHg.

The data collected was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS®), IBM, version 22. The study population was statistically described using absolute case numbers, percentages, medians and interquartile ranges. Significances were calculated using the Fisher' s exact test with levels of significance set at p < 0.05.

Patients operated upon 25 to 72 h after symptom begin (study group) were matched with regard to baseline and clinical features (same gender, similar ages, disease severity, BMI, ASA and APACHE II Scores) as well as disease severity grade (as outlined in the Tokyo guidelines) with patients operated upon within 24 h following symptom begin (control group). Both groups were comparable with regard to demographic and clinical characteristics.

Primary endpoints included the duration of anesthesia, the duration of surgery and postoperative complications. Secondary endpoints included the length postoperative of hospital stay and hospital mortality.

### Patient information: acute cholecystitis… [^3c147180]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The gallbladder is an organ located below the liver that stores bile, a fluid that helps digest fats in the small intestine. Typical symptoms of acute cholecystitis include pain in the right upper area of the abdomen, fever, and nausea. Most commonly, acute cholecystitis occurs when the duct from the gallbladder to the small intestine is blocked by gallstones, resulting in swelling of the gallbladder due to accumulation of bile. Approximately 5% to 10% of people develop acute cholecystitis without gallstones. Acute complicated cholecystitis occurs when patients develop serious consequences from cholecystitis, such as rupture of the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis affects more than 200 000 individuals per year in the US. Although about 20 million people in the US have gallstones, most do not experience symptoms related to them. However, about 10% to 15% of individuals with gallstones develop acute cholecystitis over their lifetime.

Right upper abdominal ultrasound is the first recommended imaging study to diagnose acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder ultrasound is accurate, low cost, and easily accessible; can be performed rapidly; and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. Computed tomography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging are other imaging studies that are less commonly used to diagnose acute cholecystitis. The recommended treatment of acute cholecystitis is surgical removal of the gallbladder. In the US, standard care is laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is minimally invasive surgery performed via 3 small incisions in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 1 to 3 days after diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is associated with fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization, and lower costs compared with surgery done more than 3 days after diagnosis.

Between 2% and 15% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy require a transition from a laparoscopic approach to an "open" approach, which involves a longer incision in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder safely. In uncomplicated acute cholecystitis, intravenous antibiotics are recommended prior to surgery but not after the operation. Patients with acute complicated cholecystitis and those with signs of infection should receive antibiotics for a longer duration.

### Anaesthetic regimens for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^cc7f6828]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Day surgery involves admission of selected patients to hospital for a planned surgical procedure with the patients returning home on the same day. An anaesthetic regimen usually involves a combination of an anxiolytic, an induction agent, a maintenance agent, a method of maintaining the airway (laryngeal mask versus endotracheal intubation), and a muscle relaxant. The effect of anaesthesia may continue after the completion of surgery and can delay discharge. Various regimens of anaesthesia have been suggested for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different anaesthetic regimens (risks of mortality and morbidity, measures of recovery after surgery) in patients undergoing day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 10, 2013), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1987 to November 2013), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1987 to November 2013), Science Citation Index Expanded (ISI Web of Knowledge) (1987 to November 2013), LILACS (Virtual Health Library) (1987 to November 2013), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/) (November 2013), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal (November 2013), and ClinicalTrials.gov (November 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials comparing different anaesthetic regimens during elective day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (irrespective of language or publication status).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data. We calculated the risk ratio, rate ratio or mean difference with 95% confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat or available data analysis.

Main Results

We included 11 trials involving 1069 participants at low anaesthetic risk. The sample size varied from 40 to 300 participants. We included 23 comparisons. All trials were at a high risk of bias. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis because there were no two trials involving the same comparison. Primary outcomes included perioperative mortality, serious morbidity and proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day. There were no perioperative deaths or serious adverse events in either group in the only trial that reported this information (0/60). There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day between any of the comparisons. Overall, 472/554 patients (85%) included in this review were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients. Secondary outcomes included hospital readmissions, health-related quality of life, pain, return to activity and return to work. There was no clear evidence of a difference in hospital readmissions within 30 days in the only comparison in which this outcome was reported. One readmission was reported in the 60 patients (2%) in whom this outcome was assessed. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the pain intensity, measured by a visual analogue scale, between comparators in the only trial which reported the pain intensity at between four and eight hours after surgery. Times to return to activity and return to work were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that one anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be preferred over another. However, the data are sparse (that is, there were few trials under each comparison and the trials had few participants) and further well designed randomized trials at low risk of bias and which are powered to measure differences in clinically important outcomes are necessary to determine the optimal anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of the commonest procedures performed in the western world.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^bee1b3ca]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in chronic liver disease (CLD) — diagnosis, prescribing, and monitoring: As the diagnosis of DILI in patients with CLD requires a high index of suspicion, we recommend exclusion of other more common causes of acute liver injury including a flare-up of the underlying liver disease (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). The decision to use potentially hepatotoxic drugs in CLD patients should be based on the risk vs benefit of the proposed therapy on a case-by-case basis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). There are no data to recommend a specific liver biochemistry monitoring plan when a potential hepatotoxic agent is prescribed in individuals with known CLD; Patients should be advised to promptly report any new onset symptoms such as scleral icterus, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea/vomiting, itching, or dark urine, and it is reasonable to monitor serum liver biochemistries at 4–6 weekly intervals, especially during the initial 6 months of treatment with a potentially hepatotoxic agent (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Safe cholecystectomy — acute cholecystitis: In patients with acute cholecystitis or a history of acute cholecystitis, we suggest the liberal use of intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy to mitigate the risk of bile duct injury (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Surgeons with appropriate experience and training may use laparoscopic ultrasound imaging as an alternative to IOC during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### The effect of different isoflurane-fentanyl dose combinations on early recovery from anesthesia and postoperative adverse effects [^cb9fcc3c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We evaluated the effect of different combinations of fentanyl-isoflurane on early recovery from anesthesia in 80 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 microg/kg and thiopental 5 mg/kg. Nitrous oxide was not used and patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Group 1 (n = 20) received 0.6% end-tidal isoflurane plus fentanyl, Group 2 (n = 20) received 1.2% end-tidal isoflurane plus fentanyl, Group 3 (n = 20) received 1.8% end-tidal isoflurane plus fentanyl, and Group 4 (n = 20) received only isoflurane. In Groups 1, 2 and 3 isoflurane concentration was kept constant and fentanyl was given as necessary to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure within ± 10% of the minimum mean arterial blood pressure measured in the ward. In Group 4, isoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain mean arterial blood pressure as above. At the end of skin closure isoflurane was discontinued and the time to spontaneous breathing (TSB), time to extubation (TE) and time to eye opening (TEO) were recorded. In the postanesthesia care unit, the degree of sedation, respiratory rate, Spo(2), emesis, pain, and morphine consumption were evaluated every 15 min for 1 h, and thereafter every 30 min until discharge. Fentanyl requirements were 8.3 ± 4.5 microg/kg (mean ± sd) in Group 1, 3.8 ± 1.3 microg/kg in Group 2, and 3.0 ± 0.7 microg/kg in Group 3 (P < 0.001), whereas in Group 4 the mean end-tidal concentration of isoflurane was 2.0% ± 0.4%. Although the mean TSB was < 5.5 min in all groups, TE increased from 7.3 ± 5.1 min in Group 1 to 20.6 ± 10.7 min in Group 4 (P < 0.001), and TEO increased from 7.4 ± 5.1 min in Group 1 to 25.8 ± 9.4 min in Group 4 (P < 0.001). There were no differences among the groups in any of the variables measured in the postanesthesia care unit. This study shows that the combination of a small concentration of isoflurane and a relatively larger dose of fentanyl results in a faster recovery from anesthesia than the inverse combination of doses.

Implications

A fast recovery from anesthesia increases patient safety. This study shows that the combination of a small concentration of isoflurane and a relatively larger dose of fentanyl results in a faster recovery from anesthesia than the inverse combination of doses.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) patients — diagnosis, prescribing, and monitoring recommendations for drug-induced liver injury (DILI): As the diagnosis of DILI in patients with CLD requires a high index of suspicion, we recommend exclusion of other more common causes of acute liver injury including a flare-up of the underlying liver disease (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). The decision to use potentially hepatotoxic drugs in CLD patients should be based on the risk vs benefit of the proposed therapy on a case-by-case basis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). For individuals with known CLD, there are no data to recommend a specific liver biochemistry monitoring plan; patients should be advised to promptly report any new onset symptoms such as scleral icterus, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea/vomiting, itching, or dark urine, and it is reasonable to monitor serum liver biochemistries at 4–6 weekly intervals, especially during the initial 6 mo of treatment with a potentially hepatotoxic agent (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Acute liver function decompensation in a patient with sickle cell disease managed with exchange transfusion and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography [^6beae533]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a relatively uncommon complication of homozygous sickle cell anemia, which may lead to acute hepatic failure and death. Treatment is mainly supportive, but exchange transfusion is used as salvage therapy in life threatening situations. We describe a case of a 16-year-old female with homozygous sickle cell anemia who presented to the emergency room with fatigue, malaise, dark urine, lower back pain, scleral icterus and jaundice. She was found to have marked hyperbilirubinemia, which persisted after exchange transfusion. Because of the concomitant presence of gallstones and choledocholithiasis, the patient underwent endoscopic ultrasound and laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and sphincterotomy.

### A randomised controlled trial of propofol vs. thiopentone and desflurane for fatigue after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^a06c2efe]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Fatigue may delay functional recovery after day surgery and may be more common after propofol anaesthesia. We randomly allocated 123 participants scheduled for ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy to induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone and desflurane. Postoperative fatigue was unaffected by the allocated anaesthetic. The combined mean (SD) Identity-Consequences Fatigue Scale of 34.3 (15.1) before surgery increased in the first postoperative week: to 60.4 (21.1) on day 1, p < 0.001; to 51.1 (17.2) on day 2, p < 0.001; and to 37.5 (16.3) on day 6, p = 0.028. The mean (SD) fatigue reduced at one postoperative month to 22.4 (12.6), 35% less than the combined pre-operative level, p < 0.001. Rates of nausea, vomiting and rescue antie-mesis during the first week after propofol, compared with thiopentone and desflurane, were: 23/63 vs. 32/60, p = 0.27; 8/63 vs. 9/60, p = 0.71; and 12/63 vs. 28/60, p = 0.001, respectively. There were no differences in postoperative pain. In conclusion, fatigue after scheduled laparoscopic cholecystectomy was unaffected by anaesthesia with propofol vs. thiopentone and desflurane.

### The effect of intraoperative lidocaine versus esmolol infusion on postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized clinical trial [^e14c1696]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial was conducted at BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences between January 2015 and April 2016. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board (Ref: IERB 284/014) and the trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at(NCT02327923). The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and it adheres to the guidelines of the CONSORT statement.

Female patients aged 18 to 60 years, American society of Anesthesiologist physical status I and II, scheduled for general anesthesia for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included those with inability to comprehend VAS or severe mental impairment, difficult intubation, pregnancy, morbid obesity, history of epilepsy or allergy to any drugs used in the study, current use of opioids or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, baseline heart rate < 50 beats/min, acute cholecystitis, and chronic pain other than cholelithiasis.

Eligible participants were identified during the pre-anesthetic clinic visit. Informed written consent from the recruited patients was taken in the evening before surgery at the in-patient unit. Patients were also instructed about the use of the 10 cm VAS for pain where 0 was "no pain" and 10 was "worst pain". Oral diazepam (5 mg for ≤ 50 kg and 10 mg for > 50 kg) was given the night before and 2 h before surgery as premedication.

On the day of surgery at the preoperative holding area, patients were randomly assigned (allocation 1:1) into one of the two groups according to a computer generated random number table. Details of group assignment and case number were kept in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. The anesthesia staff opened the envelope and prepared drugs accordingly. Both the patient and the investigator observing the outcome were blinded to the patient group assignment. The attending anesthesiologist not involved in the study managed the case intraoperatively.

Conclusion

This study confirms the feasibility and safety of spinal anaesthesia as the sole anaesthesia technique for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was not enough data to support SA as the standard of care as it has small number of the cases. A large prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing SA and GA in LC is needed to identify the best procedure.

### Cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis… [^dceb8d1a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

FOR OVER 30 years, surgeons have more and more frequently recommended early surgery in the treatment of acute cholecystitis and have preferred to remove the inflamed gallbladder at the time of surgery rather than drain it. Some surgeons and many physicians, however, continue to treat such patients medically or in a so-called conservative manner and undertake surgery only if signs of advancing inflammation develop. This conservative therapy may continue for many days before a decision is reached to remove or drain the gallbladder. Most surgeons also continue to advocate cholecystostomy in certain poor risk individuals or in those patients in whom cholecystectomy would be technically difficult. Our own preference has been to undertake immediate cholecystectomy in all patients with acute cholecystitis no matter what the patient's age or condition; we have almost never used cholecystostomy. A trial at medical or conservative therapy has its proponents, even among surgeons.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^0c41456d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Indications for laparoscopic biliary tract surgery — The indications for laparoscopic operations on the gallbladder and biliary tree have not changed since the 1992 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Statement and remain similar to open surgery, with relative and absolute contraindications noted. As stated in the NIH report, "most patients with symptomatic gallstones are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, if they are able to tolerate general anesthesia and have no serious cardiopulmonary diseases or other co-morbid conditions that preclude operation". Indications include but are not limited to symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, acute cholecystitis, and complications related to common bile duct stones including pancreatitis, and asymptomatic gallstones are generally not an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The guideline assigns these indications an evidence rating of "Level II, Grade A".

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^78e5d639]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2018, another Japanese nationwide retrospective cohort study reported similar results.

With the limitations of the quality of the studies, laparoscopy should be suggested for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones including ACC. The vast majority of studies suggests the second trimester until the initial part of the third trimester as the best time to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as there is a higher risk of miscarriage and toxic effect of anaesthesia in the first trimester, while concerns are related to the size of the uterus in the third trimester.

A systematic review and set of guidelines from the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy, endorsed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, have been published in 2019 and they summarize the discussion, confirming the benefits of ELC over non-operative treatment, especially in the second trimester.

Which surgical strategies should be adopted in case of difficult anatomic identification of structures during cholecystectomy for ACC?

3.4 We recommend laparoscopic or open subtotal cholecystectomy in situations in which anatomic identification is difficult and in which the risk of iatrogenic injuries is high. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Reasons for a 'difficult gallbladder' vary, and can be related to obesity, adhesions, acute or chronic inflammation, distended gallbladder and liver cirrhosis. Due to the diversity of reasons and the variability of approaches among surgeons, a review conducted in 2011 showed no consensus on the ideal way to deal with a difficult gallbladder. The options include subtotal cholecystectomy, fundus first cholecystectomy, perioperative cholangiogram, open conversion or a combination of these options.

In this section, we focus on subtotal cholecystectomy, which is an option when the critical view of safety cannot be obtained. In 2015, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Elshaer et al. reported that subtotal cholecystectomy was performed using laparoscopic (72.9%) open (19.0%) and laparoscopic converted to open (8.0%) techniques. In this study including over 1200 patients, the most common indications were severe cholecystitis (72.1%), followed by gallstones in liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (18.2%) and empyema or a perforated gallbladder (6.1%). They concluded that subtotal cholecystectomy might be helpful during the surgical management of difficult cholecystectomy; also considering that it achieves morbidity rates comparable to those reported for total cholecystectomy in straightforward cases. The quality of evidence is limited, due to the absence of prospective randomized studies, which are not expected to be easily performed in the future.

### Simultaneous assessment of the synthesis rate and transcapillary escape rate of albumin in inflammation and surgery [^afb343b9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This observational study illustrates the limited information contained in the albumin plasma concentration, when albumin kinetics is considered. The three groups of subjects studied differ in terms of plasma concentration, synthesis rate, and TER. A "snapshot" measurement of the albumin synthesis rate and/or TER obviously cannot explain the plasma level of albumin or the changes seen in plasma albumin concentration.

The albumin synthesis rates for the three groups of subjects compare well with earlier studies. Both volunteers and cholecystitis patients have been investigated previously. The temporal pattern of plasma albumin concentration in patients undergoing pancreatic resection fully reproduced a previous report. The impact on the de-novo synthesis rate during anesthesia and surgery is less well studied, however. Immediately after induction of general anesthesia, a slight decrease in FSR by 1.1%/24 h is reported in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The combined effect of general anesthesia and epidural anesthesia has so far not been characterized. In particular, the immediate effect of a major surgical procedure, dramatically increasing the TER, on albumin synthesis is not yet elucidated. It must be noted that the start of the decrease in plasma albumin concentration may initially at least partly be attributable to a transiently expanded PV during the synthesis measurement period, related to the relatively high rate of fluid administration in accordance with the fluid protocol applied. This suggestion is purely hypothetical, however, because we did not measure PV until later, during the reconstructive part of the surgical procedure, when it was no different from the PV in healthy subjects or patients with acute inflammation — although the interindividual scatter was larger, possibly related to the differences in fluid administration (Fig. 4).

Inflammation phases — timing windows and expected favorability for cholecystectomy are outlined as follows: Phase 2 spans 72 hours to 10 days and is expected to be less favorable for cholecystectomy due to tissue swelling and increased vascularity; Phase 3 spans 10 days to 6 weeks and is expected to be much less favorable for cholecystectomy with acute and chronic inflammation; Phase 4 is 6 weeks or later and is expected to be more favorable again for cholecystectomy with predominately chronic inflammation. There is also some justification for a period greater than 12 weeks but there is very little information in the literature that this time period had been the subject of study.

Acute cholecystitis during pregnancy — subgroup recommendation: Nonoperative management consisted of antibiotic therapy, the panel found a large magnitude of desirable effects and a small magnitude of undesirable effects for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and ultimately the evidence remained low quality with an overall low certainty; this led to a conditional recommendation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis during pregnancy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

SAGES laparoscopic biliary tract surgery — conversion to laparotomy: Conversion should not be considered a complication and surgeons should have a low threshold for conversion; the decision to convert to an open procedure must be based on intraoperative assessment weighing the clarity of the anatomy and the surgeon's skill/comfort in proceeding (Level II, Grade A). Factors which are associated with conversion to open cholecystectomy include acute cholecystitis with a thickened gallbladder wall, previous upper abdominal surgery, male gender, advanced age, obesity, bleeding, bile duct injury, and choledocholithiasis, and overall conversion rates have been reported to be between 2–15%, and in cases of acute cholecystitis from 6–35%.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy under spinal anaesthesia vs. general anaesthesia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5d3652a6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Test of heterogeneity

The results of heterogeneity testing are summarized in Tables 3 and 5. Significant heterogeneity existed in primary outcomes. We evaluated study quality and general characteristics of the included studies as potential sources of methodological and clinical heterogeneity. Meta-regressions were performed for postoperative pain scores to assess the potential reasons.

A standard four-trocar technique of LC was followed in all articles, and all selected studies met the following exclusion criteria: (a) patients with acute cholecystitis, and (b) previous upper abdominal surgeries. So subgroup analyses were conducted by stratifying study quality (high-quality vs. low-quality) to verify the accuracy of the meta-regression and assess the possible sources of heterogeneity. There were no significance sources of methodological and clinical heterogeneity identified by the meta-regression and subgroup analyses (Data not shown).

Sensitivity analysis and publication bias

Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of study quality. Only VAS from postoperative 6 to 8 h were affected by low quality of study (Data not shown). After low-quality studies were excluded, there was no statistically difference in VAS from postoperative 6 to 8 h. Statistical publication bias was detected for VAS in three time points, according to Egger's test (P < 0.05) (Tables 3 and 5).

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^7c85f5bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone-related complications.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta-analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD -4.12 days; 95% CI -5.22 to -3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD -1.22 minutes; 95% CI -3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD -11.00 days; 95% CI -19.61 to -2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^cc0e694e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

SAGES laparoscopic biliary surgery guidelines — acute cholecystitis: About 10–15% of all cholecystectomies performed are for acute cholecystitis, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the preferred approach in these patients (Level II, Grade B) with rates of conversion to an open procedure of 6–35%. For patients who can tolerate the procedure, early cholecystectomy (within 24–72 hours of diagnosis) is increasingly advocated and, when compared to planned open and/or delayed cholecystectomy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces the rate of symptom relapse, may be performed without increased rates of conversion to an open procedure, without an increased risk of complications, and may decrease cost and total length of stay (Level I, Grade A). In critically ill patients with acute cholecystitis, radiographically guided percutaneous cholecystostomy is an effective temporizing measure until recovery allows cholecystectomy (Level II, Grade B). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the elderly (age > 65 years) may be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.

### Factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the national referral hospital, Bhutan: a cross-sectional study [^4d4d6d0c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

There were 202 patients with cholelithiasis admitted in the Surgery Ward during the study period among which, 12 were excluded (converted to open cholecystectomy in 5, pregnancy in 4, and ASA > II in 3). Among 190 patients included in the study, 59 patients developed PONV, and the rate of PONV was 31.1% (59/190).

More than half (53.7%, 102/190) of the study population were within the 21–40 years of age range, over 80% (157/190) were female, and 2/3rd were overweight and or obese.

The most frequently prescribed premedication was ranitidine (39%, 34/87) and metoclopramide (31%, 27/87). Morphine was the most frequently used opioid analgesic before induction (57.4%, 109/190), and paracetamol was the most used adjuvant analgesic (83.6%, 51/61). Sodium thiopentone was a commonly used induction agent (65.8%, 125/190). Among the muscle relaxant agents, succinylcholine (45.1%) and atracurium (42.8%) were mostly preferred by the anesthesia personnel. Isoflurane (48.4%) and air (34.2%) were used in most of the patients as inhalation anesthetic agents for the maintenance of anesthesia. The most preferred antiemetic during the intraoperative period was ondansetron (65.9%). Neostigmine and atropine were used as reversal agents in all the patients. In more than half of the patients (52,6%, 100/190), the laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery took more than 60 min. The IV fluid used intraoperative period was significantly less in patients with PONV as compared to those without PONV (666.9 mL vs. 763.5 ml, p < 0.05). The demographic variables were comparable between the patients without PONV and those with PONV (Table 1).

### Factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the national referral hospital, Bhutan: a cross-sectional study [^26fc8579]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are common distressing symptoms experienced after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We report the rate, and the factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting, the patterns of prophylactic antiemetic prescription, and the anesthetic techniques used among patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (JDW) National Referral Hospital, Bhutan.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the JDW National Referral Hospital, from January to December 2018. All the patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were included in the study. The demographic variables, premedication, induction agents, muscle relaxants, inhalational agents for maintenance, opioid and adjuvant analgesics, the reversal agents used, and the occurrence of PONV within 24 h were recorded. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 23). Continuous variables were compared using a t-test or Mann-Whitney test, categorical variables were tested using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting.

Results

190 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The rate of PONV after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 31.1% (59/190). Over half (53.7%, 102/190) of the study population were within 21–40 years of age, over 80% (157/190) were female, and 2/3rd were overweight and obese. The most frequently used premedication was ranitidine (39%, 34/87) and metoclopramide (31%, 27/87). More than half (57.4%, 109/190) of the patients received morphine as an opioid analgesic before induction. Sodium thiopentone was a commonly used induction agent (65.8%, 125/190). Succinylcholine and atracurium were mostly preferred muscle relaxants. Isoflurane and air were the most used inhalational anesthetic agents for the maintenance of anesthesia. Ondansetron was the most preferred anti-emetics during the intraoperative period. Previous history of motion sickness (OR 5.8, 95%CI 2.9–11.2, p < 0.001), and use of sodium thiopental (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9–9.1, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for PONV. The use of antiemetics (OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.0–0.4, p = 0.002), propofol (OR 0.2, 95%CI 0.1–0.5, p < 0.001), adjuvant analgesic paracetamol (OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.2–0.8, p = 0.026), and adequate hydration with IV fluids (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.9–1.0, p = 0.042) were preventive factors for PONV.

Conclusion

The rate of PONV after laparoscopic cholecystectomy was high. History of motion sickness and use of sodium thiopental for induction were independent risk factors of PONV. The use of multimodal prophylactic antiemetics was robust and superior to monotherapy in preventing PONV. This finding re-emphasizes the need for risk stratification and appropriate use of antiemetics and anesthetic agents to prevent PONV.

### Acute cholecystitis – A review… [^33dea71f]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy is the gold standard diagnostic test.

Following diagnosis, early vs late laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications, a shorter length of hospital stay, and lower hospital costs. A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.

### Midazolam [^74012a57]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When midazolam is given IV as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when narcotic premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premedication or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied. A dose response study of pediatric patients premedicated with 1.0 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) meperidine found that only 4 out of 6 pediatric patients who received 600 mcg/kg IV midazolam lost consciousness, with eye closing at 108 ± 140 seconds. This group was compared with pediatric patients who were given thiopental 5 mg/kg IV; 6 out of 6 closed their eyes at 20 ± 3.2 seconds. Midazolam did not dependably induce anesthesia at this dose despite concomitant opioid administration in pediatric patients.

Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases. When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate. Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing CNS depression and duration of the procedure.

### Remifentanil hydrochloride [^bf3f050c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression when initiating therapy and following dosage increases with remifentanil HCl and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Remifentanil HCl is for intravenous use only. Continuous infusions of remifentanil HCl should be administered only by an infusion device. The injection site should be close to the venous cannula and all IV tubing should be cleared at the time of discontinuation of infusion.

Remifentanil HCl should not be administered without dilution.

Consider an alternative to remifentanil HCl for patients taking mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics due to reduced analgesic effect or potential withdrawal symptoms. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue remifentanil HCl if patient is not responding appropriately to treatment.

Discard unused portion.

2.2 General Anesthesia

Remifentanil HCl is not recommended as the sole agent in general anesthesia because loss of consciousness cannot be assured and because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia. Remifentanil HCl is synergistic with other anesthetics; therefore, clinicians may need to reduce doses of thiopental, propofol, isoflurane, and midazolam by up to 75% with the coadministration of remifentanil HCl. The administration of remifentanil HCl must be individualized based on the patient's response.

Induction of Anesthesia

Remifentanil HCl should be administered at an infusion rate of 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/min with a hypnotic or volatile agent for the induction of anesthesia. If endotracheal intubation is to occur less than 8 minutes after the start of the infusion of remifentanil HCl, then an initial dose of 1 mcg/kg may be administered over 30 to 60 seconds.

Remifentanil HCl should not be used as a sole agent for induction of anesthesia because loss of consciousness cannot be assured and because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia.

A host of factors have been associated with bile duct injury including surgeon experience, the patient's age, male sex, and acute cholecystitis, though the effect acute cholecystitis has on injury rates remains controversial. Bile duct injuries which occur with laparoscopic cholecystectomy frequently involve complete disruption and excision of ducts, and may be associated with hepatic vascular injuries.

Acute cholecystitis

A laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute cholecystitis. (Recommendation 1A).

The laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy debate has been extensively investigated. Beginning in the early 1990s, techniques for laparoscopic treatment of the acutely inflamed gallbladder were streamlined and today the laparoscopic cholecystectomy is employed worldwide to treat acute cholecystitis.

Many prospective trials have demonstrated that the laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute cholecystitis.

An early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe treatment for acute cholecystitis and generally results in shorter recovery time and hospitalization compared to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomies. (Recommendation 1A).

Timing is perhaps the most important factor in the surgical treatment of acute gallstone cholecystitis (AGC).

Evidence from published literature demonstrates that, compared to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomies, early laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed to treat acute cholecystitis reduce both recurrence rates and the overall length of hospital stay. A promptly performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy is therefore the most cost-effective means of treating acute cholecystitis.

In recent years, the medical community has debated the possible risk factors predictive of perioperative conversion to an open cholecystectomy from a laparoscopic approach in cases of acute cholecystitis.

Systematic evaluation of risk factors for laparoscopic to open conversion during cholecystectomies in patients with acute cholecystitis may help predict procedural difficulties and optimize surgical strategies of high-risk cases.

A delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy is perhaps the most significant risk factor predictive of eventual laparoscopic to open conversion during a cholecystectomy in cases of acute cholecystitis.

In 2011, researchers published an analysis of patients undergoing urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs) for acute cholecystitis based on the prospective database of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. The patients were grouped according to the time lapsed between hospital admission and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (admission day: d0, subsequent days of hospitalization: d1, d2, d3, d4/5, d ≥ 6). Delaying LC resulted in the following shifts in patient outcome: significantly higher conversion rates (increasing from 11.9% at d0 to 27.9% at d ≥ 6, P < 0.001), increased postoperative complications (increasing from 5.7% to 13%, P < 0.001), elevated repeat operation rates (increasing from 0.9% to 3%, P = 0.007), and significantly longer postoperative hospitalization (P < 0.001).

### Acute cholecystitis: a review [^d5448b8e]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gallbladder disease affects approximately 20 million people in the US. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200 000 people in the US each year.

Observations

Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test. Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1–3 days) vs late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications (1.6% for early vs 18.4% for delayed) and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up (15.2%) compared with nonoperative management (29.3%). A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube, in which a drainage catheter is placed in the gallbladder lumen under image guidance, is an effective therapy for patients with an exceptionally high perioperative risk. However, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement in a randomized trial was associated with higher rates of postprocedural complications (65%) compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (12%). For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.

Method

Study setting

This randomized parallel-group controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wonju Severance Christian Hospital (CR321039; approval date: 10/06/2021) and registered with the Clinical Research Information Service of Korea (KCT0006288; registration date: 23/06/2021). The study was performed at a tertiary care university medical center in Wonju, South Korea. This study complied with the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Participants

All consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy or robotic gynecologic surgery were considered for enrollment using the following inclusion criteria: patients aged 19 to 65 years old; patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status classification (ASA PS classification) of I to III; and patients with an estimated length of anesthesia of 2 hours or less. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients undergoing ambulatory surgery; patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher; patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding; patients with a hypersensitivity to benzodiazepine; patients planned in advance to be transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively; patients with a history of acute narrow-angle glaucoma; patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C hepatic dysfunction; patients who were unable to communicate; patients with cognitive disorders; and patients who were unable to understand the written information about the trial or the informed consent form.

Randomization

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the remimazolam group (Group R) or the desflurane group (Group D). A random allocation sequence was created by one of the authors (SWS) using R statistical software 4.1.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Cards indicating the group allocation were contained in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. One of the authors (YGJ) kept the opaque envelopes containing the group allocation until the day of the surgery on which the envelopes were opened by one of the authors (YNJ), who informed an attending anesthesiologist of the group allocation just before the induction of anesthesia.

### Transcylindrical cholecystectomy under local anesthesia plus sedation. A pilot study [^8f351cf4]. Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aim

The practice of laparoscopic cholecystectomy under local anesthesia is almost anecdotal. For 15 years we have been using a "transcylindrical cholecystectomy" technique for the treatment of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and choledocholithiasis. The present study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of transcylindrical cholecystectomy under local anesthesia through a prospective and longitudinal efficacy study.

Patients and Methods

Transcylindrical cholecystectomy is performed gas-free through a single cylinder 3.8 cm in diameter and 10.0 cm in length. In 60 patients suffering from cholelithiasis (mean age 52.6 years, range 31–83 years; men/women 13/47; body mass index 29.6 kg/m(2), range 24–44 kg/m(2)), transcylindrical cholecystectomy was planned and started under local anesthesia. Patients were reviewed 5 days after surgery; pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and procedure satisfaction was assessed following completion of a patient questionnaire.

Results

Surgery was satisfactorily completed through the cylinder in all patients. In 13 patients (21.7%) local anesthesia was converted to general anesthesia due to technical difficulties in 11 patients (two related to patient body volume), respiratory depression in one patient, and poor patient tolerance in one patient. Postoperative complications were: wound infection (n = 1, 1.7%), wound seromas (n = 2, 3.3%), and nausea (n = 3, 5%). After surgery, only three patients experienced pain at rest with VAS values of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.9, respectively. All but two patients were discharged from hospital on the day of surgery, and all patients were satisfied with the procedure.

Conclusions

Transcylindrical cholecystectomy under local anesthesia is a feasible technique that builds on the benefits of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and confers an economic advantage and improved safety for patients.

### Midazoalm (Midazolam) [^38b78c88]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

When midazolam hydrochloride is given IV as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when narcotic premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic premedication or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied. A dose response study of pediatric patients premedicated with 1 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) meperidine found that only 4 out of 6 pediatric patients who received 600 mcg/kg IV midazolam lost consciousness, with eye closing at 108 to 140 seconds. This group was compared with pediatric patients who were given thiopental 5 mg/kg IV; 6 out of 6 closed their eyes at 20 ± 3.2 seconds. Midazolam did not dependably induce anesthesia at this dose despite concomitant opioid administration in pediatric patients.

Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases. When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate. Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing CNS depression and duration of the procedure.

Results

Baseline features

A total of 357 records were identified by the search of PubMed (n = 260) and EMBASE (n = 92). Figure 1 shows the article selection. After manual removal of duplicates, 293 records were screened. Of these, 259 records were discarded based on title and abstract because these papers investigated other study outcomes (n = 89), were non-randomized studies (n = 137), included children (n = 8) or were reviews (n = 25). For the remaining 34 records, full-text articles were retrieved and examined in detail for eligibility. Twenty-five additional studies were discarded, because one study could not be feasibly translated into English or Dutch, one study did not include our primary outcome measures, and twenty-three studies used an incorrect control group.

Fig. 1
Study flow diagram

A total of nine RCTs published in English met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The follow-up period of these studies ranged from 1 to 16 months, and the number of included patients ranged from 34 to 250. A total of 860 participants were randomized to SILC (n = 430) or conventional LC (n = 430). Main inclusion criteria comprised adults (18 years or older) with an ASA grade between I and III, scheduled for elective cholecystectomy. Main exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation, coagulopathic patients, acute cholecystitis or previous upper abdominal surgery. Countries of origin were Switzerland, Turkey, Denmark, Egypt, Brazil, Germany and Italy. There were six unicentre and three multicentre studies. All studies compared SILC with conventional LC. Successful completion of SILC ranged between 72 and 100%. Detailed information on the characteristics of included studies is presented in Table 1.

### Anesthesia in a child with homozygous porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency: a severe form of acute intermittent porphyria [^d5839895]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case history of the anesthetic management of a child with a severe form of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance, caused by deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase, an enzyme found in the synthetic pathway for heme. Anesthesia and surgery may present many precipitants for a potentially fatal acute porphyric attack. These include fasting, dehydration, stress, infection and drugs. Here, we describe the safe use of sevoflurane in the maintenance of anesthesia. Its relative insolubility and low metabolism suggest that sevoflurane may be a reasonable agent for anesthesia in the porphyric patient.

Question 9 — subtotal cholecystectomy (STC) versus total cholecystectomy for mitigating bile duct injury in marked acute inflammation or chronic biliary inflammatory fusion (BIF): When marked acute local inflammation or chronic cholecystitis with biliary inflammatory fusion (BIF) of tissues/tissue contraction is encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy that prevent the safe identification of the cystic duct and artery, we suggest that surgeons perform subtotal cholecystectomy either laparoscopically or open depending on their skill set and comfort with the procedure (expert opinion). No direct head-to-head comparative evidence was found addressing this question. One retrospective study using administrative data compared LC to STC and reported that patients undergoing laparoscopic STC were older (56 vs 48 years), more likely male (54.2% vs 32.3%), and had higher severity of illness scores on admission (9.2% vs 3.5%) [p < 0.001] compared to standard LC; on univariate analysis STC was associated with longer lengths of stay (4 vs 3 days), higher readmission rates (11.9 vs 7.0%) and higher mortality (0.82 vs 0.28%) [p < 0.05]. Following a 1:1 propensity score match, no differences in outcomes were demonstrated between patient groups, and the authors concluded that STC is a safe and feasible alternative to LC in well selected patients, while noting that the strength of this conclusion is dampened by the retrospective nature of the study and unaccounted confounding variables.

### No 72-hour pathological boundary for safe early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis: a clinicopathological study [^836c0f45]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

This study comprised 61 patients with AC who underwent LC. Of the 61 patients 21 (34.43%) received ELC and 40 (65.57%) LLC. In the ELC group the median time from symptom onset to operation was 48 h with a range of 24–72 h and in the LLC group median time from symptom onset to surgery was 11 days with a range of 4–20 days. In the ELC group the distribution of males and females were 14.3% and 85.7% respectively and in the LLC group the distribution of males and females were 40% and 60% respectively. Co-morbidities in the patients included 16 patients with presence of comorbidities of which 10 patients had diabetes mellitus, 10 had hypertension, 2 had hypothyroidism, 1 had chronic renal failure and 1 had asthma. There were 54 patients of ASA grade 1, 7 patients with ASA grade 2 and none were of ASA grade 3 or 4.

The mean of age of patients undergoing ELC was 48.67 ± 12.07 years and LLC was 54.30 ± 15.73 years and was comparable on analysis with no statistically significant difference. There was also no statistically significant difference in leukocytosis (ELC 9,450.00 ± 3,155.64 vs. LLC 9,337.25 ± 4,132.01) between both groups. On analysis of the clinical severity in the ELC group 17 (81%) were mild, 4 (19%) moderate and none were severe and in the LLC group 4 (10%) were mild, 29 (72.5%) moderate and 7 (17.5%) severe by severity grading as per the Tokyo guidelines and this difference in distribution between both groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Surgical findings and histopathology confirmed acute simple cholecystitis in 13 (61.9%), phlegmonous cholecystitis in 6 (28.6%) and gangrenous cholecystitis in 2 (9.5%) of the ELC group and acute simple cholecystitis in 23 (57.5%), phlegmonous cholecystitis in 13 (32.5%) and gangrenous cholecystitis in 4 (10%) of the ELC group. This distribution between both groups was comparable with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.94), (Table 1).

### Risk factors for perioperative complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy: analysis of 22, 953 consecutive cases from the Swiss association of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery database [^14cffa18]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Reliable risk factors for perioperative complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy would be extremely useful to optimize the clinical management. This study aimed to determine risk factors that can be used for predicting perioperative complications.

Study Design

Possible risk factors for perioperative complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute and chronic cholecystitis were analyzed by a stepwise logistic regression model using data from the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery (SALTS) database.

Results

A total of 22,953 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 54.5 ± 16.1 years (range 17 to 89 years) and a male-to-female ratio of 1:2, underwent elective (85%) and emergency (15%) laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Multivariable analysis showed that male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16; p < 0.0001), duration of intervention (OR = 1.68 per 30 minutes; p < 0.0001), body weight (> 90 kg versus < 60 kg; OR = 1.34; p < 0.0001), and the surgeon's own experience (> 100 versus 11 to 100 interventions; OR = 1.36; p < 0.0002) were independently associated with an increased intraoperative local complication rate. In addition, male gender (OR = 1.21; p < 0.02), age (OR = 1.12 per 10 years; p < 0.0001), intraoperative complications (OR = 2.1; p < 0.0001), conversion to open surgery (OR = 1.25; p < 0.01), American Society of Anesthesiologists risk score (ASA score III/IV versus I/II: OR = 1.28; p < 0.0005), body weight (< 60 kg versus > 90 kg; OR = 1.53; p < 0.007), emergency surgery (OR = 1.36; p < 0.003), and duration of surgery (OR = 1.28 per 30 minutes; p < 0.0001) were found to be associated with a higher incidence of postoperative local complications. Higher postoperative systemic complications were encountered with conversion (OR = 1.5; p < 0.0002), ASA score (III/IV versus I/II: OR = 1.54; p < 0.0001), emergency surgery (OR = 1.41; p < 0.001), and a prolonged intervention time (OR = 1.16 per 30 minutes; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

For patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), the risk of possible perioperative complications can be estimated based on patient characteristics (gender, age, ASA score, body weight), clinical findings (acute versus chronic cholecystitis), and the surgeon's own clinical practice with LC. So in the likelihood of a case being a "difficult cholecystectomy", an experienced surgeon should be involved both in the decision-making process and during the operation. If LC lasts longer than 2 hours, the cumulative risk for perioperative complications is four times higher compared with an intervention that lasts between 30 and 60 minutes, independent of the surgeon's personal skills with LC.

Port strategy for cholecystectomy — recommendation and evidence: For patients requiring cholecystectomy, we suggest using a multi-port laparoscopic technique instead of single port/single incision technique (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). No direct comparative evidence addressed this outcome; indirect evidence from two systematic reviews (including total > 507,918 patients) of single arm cohorts reported pooled BDI estimates of 0.72% versus 0.32 to 0.52%, with outcomes favoring single port limited to analgesic use, cosmesis and quality of life and described as imprecise and clinically small to trivial; undesirable effects for single port included BDI, total severe complication, operative time, port site hernia and conversion to open procedure, which the panel conservatively judged moderate.

### Day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy: treatment of choice for selected patients? [^5c870f30]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The authors report their 7-year experience with day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to determine its applicability, safety, and cost effectiveness.

Methods

Of 920 consecutive patients who underwent elective LC over a 7-year period, 567 (62%) were scheduled for day-case surgery. The median age of the patients was 48 years (range, 16–74 years), and the male/female ratio was 148/419. The selection criteria required an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade of 1 or 2, absence of morbid obesity, low risk of common bile duct stones, adult company at home, and residence within 100 km of the hospital. The LC procedure was performed using a standard four-cannula technique. Propofol-opiate-rocuron-sevoflurane anesthesia, prophylactic antiemetics, and preemptive analgesia were administered in all cases.

Results

The mean length of the operation was 56 ± 18 min. There was no hospital mortality, and 7 (1.2%) of 567 patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy. Approximately 356 (63%) of the 567 patients were discharged home on the same day as the operation, whereas 211 patients (37%) were admitted overnight after the operation because of social reasons (13.7%), surgeon preference (15.2%), nausea and/or pain (15.2%), operation late in the afternoon (14.2%), or patient preference (41.7%). There were no serious complications. A total of 22 patients visited the emergency unit, and 7 patients required readmission, giving a readmission rate of 2%. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 6% (n = 22), with morbidities including retained stones (n = 2), bile leakage (n = 1), and pneumonia (n = 1). The mean procedural cost to the hospital was 1,836 euros for day-case LC, as compared with 2,712 euros for an inpatient operation.

Conclusions

For selected patients, day-case LC is feasible and safe, providing a substantial reduction in hospital costs.

### Remifentanil hydrochloride (Ultiva) [^26b9ad40]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 General Anesthesia

ULTIVA is not recommended as the sole agent in general anesthesia because loss of consciousness cannot be assured and because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia. ULTIVA is synergistic with other anesthetics; therefore, clinicians may need to reduce doses of thiopental, propofol, isoflurane, and midazolam by up to 75% with the coadministration of ULTIVA. The administration of ULTIVA must be individualized based on the patient's response.

Induction of Anesthesia

ULTIVA should be administered at an infusion rate of 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/min with a hypnotic or volatile agent for the induction of anesthesia. If endotracheal intubation is to occur less than 8 minutes after the start of the infusion of ULTIVA, then an initial dose of 1 mcg/kg may be administered over 30 to 60 seconds.

ULTIVA should not be used as a sole agent for induction of anesthesia because loss of consciousness cannot be assured and because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia.

Maintenance of Anesthesia

After endotracheal intubation, the infusion rate of ULTIVA should be decreased in accordance with the dosing guidelines in Tables 1 (adults, predominately ASA physical status I, II, or III) and 2 (pediatric patients).

Due to the fast onset and short duration of action of ULTIVA, the rate of administration during anesthesia can be titrated upward in 25% to 100% increments in adult patients or up to 50% increments in pediatric patients, or downward in 25% to 50% decrements every 2 to 5 minutes to attain the desired level of µ-opioid effect.
In response to light anesthesia or transient episodes of intense surgical stress, supplemental bolus doses of 1 mcg/kg may be administered every 2 to 5 minutes.
At infusion rates > 1 mcg/kg/min, increases in the concomitant anesthetic agents should be considered to increase the depth of anesthesia. [See Clinical Pharmacology: Specific Populations: Pediatric Population (12.3) and Dosage and Administration, Table 2 (2.2) .]

Table 2 summarizes the recommended doses in pediatric patients, predominantly ASA physical status I, II, or III. In pediatric patients, remifentanil was administered with nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide in combination with halothane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane. The use of atropine may blunt the potential for bradycardia that can occur upon administration of ULTIVA.

### A case report of multiple anesthesia for pediatric surgery: 80 anesthesia applications in a period of 6 years [^cf0d8393]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

In a previous study, the effect of repeated isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia on rat hepatocytes was investigated. The results suggested that the anesthetics do not present considerable hepatotoxicity.

In our case, we preferred rocuronium as a muscle relaxant. We think that the antagonism assured by sugammadex represents an additional safety factor for the use of rocuronium, especially in cases of difficult intubation. The use of sugammadex was not required in our case.

Among the drugs used in anesthesia, antibiotics and, rarely, muscle relaxants elicit an allergic reaction. In our case, the clinical manifestation of allergic reaction was a skin rash observed at the induction of anesthesia (in 8 anesthesia applications), most likely caused by rocuronium.

Thiopental, the most commonly used barbiturate in pediatric anesthesia, depresses respiration and induces apnea. Thiopental is not preferred in short cases because it has no analgesic effect and has a late recovery compared with propofol. We were required to use thiopental when propofol was not available in our hospital pharmacy.

Recently, preclinical data along with retrospective clinical studies have suggested that anesthesia could damage brain functions in children by affecting multiple ion channels, receptors and cell signaling processes in the central nervous system. The stage of brain development at the time of exposure to anesthesia and the frequency and cumulative anesthetic doses are some important factors causing neurotoxicity. Brambrink et al. reported that a 5-h exposure of infant rhesus macaque brains to isoflurane was sufficient to cause widespread apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes throughout the developing brain. Zou et al. demonstrated that ketamine administration results in a dose-related and exposure-time-dependent increase in neuronal cell death in the developing rat brain. However, the relevance of these laboratory findings to clinical practice remains unclear because it is quite difficult to find or prove the neurological harm that might be caused by anesthesia in clinical studies conducted on children.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy under spinal anaesthesia vs. general anaesthesia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^87c924f4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A meta-analysis protocol was drafted before the initial search was started. The meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement issued in 2009.

Literature search

We searched PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register to identify relevant articles published from January 1, 2000 to December 1, 2014 using the search phrases (((((regional anaesthesia) OR regional anesthesia) OR spinal) OR general anesthesia)) AND (((((laparoscop* or celioscop* or coelioscop* or abdominoscop* or peritoneoscop*) AND cholecystecto* or colecystecto*)) OR "Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic)). Appropriate adjustments were required according to the database. Filters were used in PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge to exclude animal and non-English studies. A manual search of published meta-analyses and relevant articles was performed to identify additional articles.

Article selection

The process of article selection was based on the PRISMA flow diagram. Selected studies met the following criteria: (a) RCT design; (b) compared SA and GA; (c) revealed at least one of the primary or secondary outcomes mentioned below; and (d) were published in English. Articles were excluded if: (a) the surgery was not cholecystectomy; (b) spinal anesthesia was not mentioned; (c) it was a retrospective study, prospective nonrandomized study, animal study, review, letter, meeting, or comment. When multiple published articles from the same study were available, the report with the most detailed information was selected.

Data extraction

Primary outcomes evaluated included postoperative pain score. Pain scores from RCTs using a visual analogue scale/score (VAS) were pooled to assess postoperative abdominal pain. Three postoperative time points were used to evaluate pain, 2 to 4 h, 6 to 8 h, and 24 h.

Secondary measures evaluated included intraoperative outcomes (Operating time, Intraoperative Events), postoperative complications (Nausea and Vomiting, Urinary retention and Overall Morbidity). Intraoperative Events (events occurring during spinal anaesthesia included hypotension, right shoulder pain, Nausea and Vomiting).

Overall Morbidity is that the morbidity which each included studies reported were pooled by meta analyze.

Patient characteristics (number of patients, gender, age and body mass index) were also recorded. If the above data was not available in the published study, the authors were contacted and asked to supply the information.

Risk of Bias Assessment

The synthesis of the risk of bias assessment is presented herein. As shown in Figure 2, among the 23 studies scrutinized, all were identified to warrant "concerns" regarding the integrity of the randomization process, which is a critical component of study design. In terms of the risk of bias pertaining to the measurement of outcomes, two studies were flagged for raising "some concerns", suggesting potential discrepancies in the accuracy or consistency of outcome assessments. With respect to the risk of bias associated with the selection of reported results, four studies were deemed to evoke "some concerns", implying that there may be a selective reporting of findings which could skew the overall conclusions drawn from these studies. Upon evaluating the collective risk of bias across all studies, it was observed that "some concerns" were present in all studies, highlighting methodological limitations or issues that might compromise the reliability and validity of the results.

### Methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^f1e0871d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation may decrease pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the optimal method to administer the local anaesthetic is unknown.

Objectives

To determine the optimal local anaesthetic agent, the optimal timing, and the optimal delivery method of the local anaesthetic agent used for intraperitoneal instillation in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal (WHO ICTRP) to March 2013 to identify randomised clinical trials for assessment of benefit and comparative non-randomised studies for the assessment of treatment-related harms.

Selection Criteria

We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing different methods of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 12 trials with 798 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy randomised to different methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Most trials included only people with low anaesthetic risk. The comparisons included in the trials that met the eligibility criteria were the following; comparison of one local anaesthetic agent with another local anaesthetic agent (three trials); comparison of timing of delivery (six trials); comparison of different methods of delivery of the anaesthetic agent (two trials); comparison of location of the instillation of the anaesthetic agent (one trial); three trials reported mortality and morbidity. There were no mortalities or serious adverse events in either group in the following comparisons: bupivacaine (0/100 (0%)) versus lignocaine (0/106 (0%)) (one trial; 206 participants); just after creation of pneumoperitoneum (0/55 (0%)) versus end of surgery (0/55 (0%)) (two trials; 110 participants); just after creation of pneumoperitoneum (0/15 (0%)) versus after the end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) (one trial; 30 participants); end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) versus after the end of surgery (0/15 (0%)) (one trial; 30 participants). None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work. The differences in the proportion of people who were discharged as day-surgery and the length of hospital stay were imprecise in all the comparisons included that reported these outcomes (very low quality evidence). There were some differences in the pain scores on the visual analogue scale (1 to 10 cm) but these were neither consistent nor robust to fixed-effect versus random-effects meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence is inadequate to determine the effects of one method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation compared with any other method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation in low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.

### Computed tomography-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy: a single institution's 6-year experience [^cda64a63]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PC is a minimally invasive procedure that allows gallbladder decompression without the need for general anesthesia. The present study illustrates the experience of a tertiary center from CTPC during a 6-year period, for patients with a high perioperative risk for cholecystectomy.

AC is a common condition that occurs in up to 20% of all patients with symptomatic gallstone disease and is best treated with early cholecystectomy (24–48 h from the onset of symptoms). The incidence of gallstone disease, which is the primary risk factor for AC, increases with age. The standard reference treatment for patients with AC is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One recent prospective randomized trial showed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24 h of hospital admission was superior to a conservative approach with regard to morbidity and cost, although there was no significant difference in mortality. Generally, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered to be acceptable and safe, and is associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality. However, in patients operated for acute calculous cholecystitis, conversion is required in up to 25% of subjects. Furthermore, conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy substantially increases both morbidity and mortality. The risk for conversion increases with the duration of symptoms. Thus, surgical intervention can carry significant morbidity and mortality in patients with a prolonged duration of symptoms and those who are critically ill and unfit for surgery.

### Adequacy of maternal anesthesia depth with two sodium thiopental doses in elective caesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^92f3e10a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Determining the optimal dosage of anesthetic agents is challenging. This fact is particularly a matter of concern in Caesarean section. The susceptible fetus can be affected by the administered agents passing through the placenta, resulting in the delivery of anesthetized "sleepy baby". Robust study on appropriate drug regimens to guarantee adequate depth of anesthesia during Caesarean section is surprisingly rare. This may be due to paucity of use of general anesthesia for Caesarean section and its application only in emergency situations when conducting randomized trials is extremely difficult.

Sodium thiopental (STP), a short-acting well known barbiturate, is currently a routine choices for induction of general anesthesia in Cesarean section in some countries. The usual recommended dose of thiopental for induction of general anesthesia for Caesarean section is 4–5 mg/kg, but several studies showed that parturient are at risk of inadequate anesthesia. The incidence of unexpected awareness during Caesarean has been decreased to 0.26–0.4% by using modification of induction technique and larger dose of thiopental, but it is still more prevalent than in general surgical population (0.1–0.2%). Obstetric general anesthesia includes many risk factors for accidental awareness during general Anesthesia (AAGA) including use of STP for anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, deep neuromuscular block, obesity, difficult airway management, and emergency surgery. Thiopental in combination with rapid sequence induction is an important risk factor for awareness, possibly because of inappropriate low dose.

### Adequacy of maternal anesthesia depth with two sodium thiopental doses in elective caesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^eefa4dc7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although 1-min Apgar score indicates the requirements for neonate cares at the time of birth, this is the 5-min Apgar score that shows the morbidity and the effect on the neurobehavioral response. In our study we found that the neonates had lower Apgar score at minute 1 in high-dose group and subsequently improved at 5 and 20 min. Thus for better evaluation of the neonatal developmental disability we used neonatal neurobehavioral examination. Low-dose STP group neonates performed better in all the three aspects of tone and motor patterns, primitive reflexes, and behavioral responses for neurobehavioral test. This is in line with the results of minute 1 Apgar score and indicates that the 5 mg/kg dosage is relatively safer for infants. If an adequate anesthesia depth was accomplished with 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium, administration of higher dosage would not be advisable. However, it was demonstrated in the study that 5 mg/kg dose may be associated by lower BIS scores and more positive IFT tests, although these undesirable observations were not translated to apparent awareness of the patients during post-operative interview.

Other alternative intravenous anesthetics are advised for induction of anesthesia in Caesarean section such as propofol. Some studies stated that propofol and thiopental do not have a significantly different influence on the Apgar score, while propofol makes deeper anesthesia, shorter recovery time, better hemodynamics and prepares appropriate uterine relaxation during fetal delivery. Induction with propofol also results in a significantly lower umbilical arterial oxygen saturation than induction with thiopental, but multiple trials indicates that propofol and thiopental are equally suited for Caesarean section. However, some side effects such as propofol induced pain on injection and sever bradychardia when combined with succinylcholine for rapid-sequence induction makes some anesthesiologists reluctant in its use. This reluctance is especially realizable where other rapid acting muscle relaxants like rocuronium is not readily available.

In conclusion, 7 mg/kg STP is superior to 5 mg/kg in creating appropriate hypnosis for induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section. However, it negatively impacts Apgar score and neurobehavioral test of newborn during early phase of birth. An acceptable intravenous anesthesia should be safe for the neonates while providing acceptable depth of anesthesia for the parturient. Therefore, STP couldn't be recommended as an ideal medication for induction of general anesthesia in Cesarean section anymore.

### Acute cholecystitis… [^b2c55864]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

In many cases of acute cholecystitis gallstones block the bile ducts. Bile builds up and can push on the walls of the gallbladder, causing inflammation. Other causes of acute cholecystitis include infection, trauma, diabetes, or blockage of the bile ducts due to a tumor. The January 1, 2003, issue of JAMA includes an article about diagnosing acute cholecystitis. SYMPTOMS Symptoms of acute cholecystitis include Intense, sudden pain in the upper right part of the abdomen Recurrent, painful attacks for several hours after meals Pain that can worsen with deep breaths and that extends to thelower part of the right shoulder blade.

Shortness of breath due to pain when inhaling Nausea Vomiting Stiff abdominal muscles, especially on the right side Slight fever Chills Jaundice Abdominal bloating DIAGNOSIS Because the symptoms of acute cholecystitis can resemble symptoms of other illnesses, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose. If a doctor suspects acute cholecystitis after a careful physical examination, he or she may perform some of the following tests: Abdominal ultrasound — use of high-frequency sound waves to create an image of internal organs Hepatobiliary scintigraphy — an imaging technique used to see the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, and upper part of the small intestine Cholangiography — injection of dye into the bile ducts so the gallbladder and ducts can be seen on x-rays. Computed tomography scan — an imaging procedure that uses a combination of x-rays and computer technology to produce images of the internal organs TREATMENT.

Treatment for acute cholecystitis usually involves hospitalization. The patient is not allowed to eat or drink, and liquids are given through an intravenous line. If an infection is suspected, antibiotics may be given. Most patients who have acute cholecystitis have their gallbladder removed, either immediately after diagnosis or after the patient has improved. This procedure, called a cholecystectomy, can be performed using a laparoscope or by conventional surgery.
