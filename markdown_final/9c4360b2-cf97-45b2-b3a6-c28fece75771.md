## Question

low dose CT in lung cancer screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about low-dose CT lung cancer screening, including evidence, eligibility, benefits, harms, implementation, and controversies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why screening matters. Then, I should verify the core randomized trial evidence and mortality effects. Next, I will review guideline eligibility criteria and how they evolved. After that, I need to quantify benefits and harms with numbers and time-to-benefit. Then, I should examine implementation requirements and quality assurance. I will also consider controversies and uncertainties, including overdiagnosis and risk modeling. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and close with a concise conclusion anchored in the highest-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with most cases diagnosed at advanced stages when 5-year survival is poor, whereas early-stage disease has markedly better outcomes, which is the biological premise for screening asymptomatic high-risk individuals to shift stage distribution and reduce mortality [^114Tmeyw].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence. The National Lung Screening Trial randomized 53,454 high-risk adults to three annual LDCT screens versus chest radiography and demonstrated a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% relative reduction in all-cause mortality, with high adherence and a substantial increase in early-stage detection, establishing the foundational efficacy signal for LDCT screening [^113V7bR6] [^115p8uNH]. Wait, let me verify the comparator and absolute risk reduction details; yes, the control was chest radiography and the absolute lung cancer mortality reduction was about 3 per 1000 screened over roughly 6.5 years, which aligns with subsequent summaries and decision aids [^113V7bR6] [^1111ZSch].

> Next, I should review corroborating trials. The NELSON trial, the largest European RCT, showed a 24% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality in men at 10 years, reinforcing the mortality benefit seen in NLST and extending follow-up duration, while a Cochrane meta-analysis pooling multiple RCTs found a 21% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality with moderate-certainty evidence, strengthening external validity across populations and protocols [^1136DxcL] [^115A6aV5]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude and certainty; the pooled estimate of RR 0.79 is consistent across sensitivity analyses, supporting robustness despite heterogeneity in screening intervals and entry criteria [^115A6aV5].

> Let me consider guideline evolution and eligibility. Initially, the USPSTF recommended annual screening for adults aged 55–80 years with at least a 30 pack-year history who currently smoke or quit within 15 years, but in 2021, based on updated evidence and modeling, the USPSTF lowered the starting age to 50 and the pack-year threshold to 20, expanding eligibility and projected benefits while maintaining a moderate net benefit rating [^114vckdV] [^114Tmeyw]. I should double-check the discontinuation criteria; yes, screening should stop after 15 years of abstinence or when life expectancy or willingness to undergo curative surgery is limited, which operationalizes harm–benefit balance in older or comorbid patients [^114Tmeyw].

> I need to quantify benefits in practical terms. The number needed to screen to prevent one lung cancer death is approximately 320 over 6.5 years in NLST, about 130 over 10 years in NELSON, and pooled estimates hover near 226–265 across meta-analyses, with a consistent stage shift toward stage I disease in about half of screen-detected cancers, which is clinically meaningful given the survival differential by stage [^1111ZSch] [^11688ezp] [^114zcnW3]. But wait, what about timing of benefit; time-to-benefit analyses suggest that meaningful mortality reduction accrues after roughly 2–3 years, which is important when selecting patients with adequate life expectancy to realize benefit [^112d5K6M].

> Now, I should review harms carefully and verify the magnitude. False positives are common, with cumulative false-positive rates around 21% after one round and 33% after two rounds in early feasibility work, though most are resolved noninvasively; nonetheless, about 17 per 1000 screened undergo invasive procedures for benign nodules in NLST, with major complications uncommon but not negligible, underscoring the need for disciplined nodule management pathways [^111w5aUm] [^1111ZSch]. Overdiagnosis estimates vary and are method-dependent; contemporary syntheses suggest roughly 9–18% of screen-detected cancers may be overdiagnosed, with particular concern for indolent adenocarcinomas, so programs must minimize overtreatment through surveillance and shared decision-making [^114zcnW3] [^115A6aV5]. Radiation exposure is low per scan, but cumulative; typical 3-year programs total about 3–7 mSv depending on protocol and sex, with modeled lifetime excess cancer risk on the order of 0.05–0.1% over a decade, which is small but reinforces the principle of screening only those with sufficient risk and life expectancy [^115WntCK].

> Next, I should review implementation requirements because benefits depend on program quality. High-performing programs use standardized low-dose protocols, structured reporting such as Lung-RADS, multidisciplinary nodule management, smoking cessation integration, and robust data tracking; the ACR Lung Cancer Screening Center designation operationalizes many of these elements, and ATS/ACCP policy statements emphasize governance, primary care engagement, and shared decision-making as non-negotiables for safe rollout [^112DNcUF] [^114op1eW] [^113bA19r]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is indeed required; CMS mandates an in-person counseling visit with a tool to document benefits, harms, and preferences before the initial LDCT, which helps align screening with patient values and risk tolerance [^116e3uTy].

> I will now examine controversies and uncertainties to avoid overstatement. Overdiagnosis remains the most debated harm, with estimates sensitive to modeling assumptions and lead-time adjustments; indolent adenocarcinomas, particularly pure ground-glass lesions, are the prototypical substrate, arguing for conservative management and longitudinal growth assessment before intervention [^112qr6VC] [^1168YqCQ]. Risk model–based selection may improve efficiency compared with simple age and pack-year thresholds, but trade-offs include more overdiagnosis and implementation complexity; modeling suggests starting at 50–55 with 20 pack-years can avert more deaths than the 2013 USPSTF criteria, albeit with more false positives, which must be weighed carefully in policy design [^1173kkrQ]. Interval extension for lower-risk subgroups after a negative baseline screen is plausible and supported by NLST subgroup analyses, but I should confirm that this remains investigational for population policy; yes, it is not yet standard in USPSTF recommendations, though it may be reasonable in research or selective programs [^115dmHuP] [^114Tmeyw].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach. Screening should be offered to adults aged 50–80 with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or quit within 15 years, provided they have adequate life expectancy and no contraindications to curative lung surgery, with discontinuation after 15 years of abstinence or when comorbidity limits benefit; shared decision-making should quantify trade-offs, and all current smokers should receive concurrent cessation support because it amplifies mortality gains and reduces future risk [^114Tmeyw] [^116e3uTy]. I should confirm that programs use Lung-RADS and multidisciplinary pathways to manage nodules, prioritize noninvasive follow-up for small lesions, and track outcomes for quality assurance and continuous improvement [^112DNcUF] [^114op1eW].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise and evidence-aligned. LDCT screening in appropriately selected high-risk adults reduces lung cancer mortality by about 20–24% in randomized trials, with an absolute benefit of roughly 3–5 fewer lung cancer deaths per 1000 screened over 6–10 years, balanced against meaningful but manageable harms including false positives, overdiagnosis, and low cumulative radiation; realizing this net benefit requires strict adherence to eligibility, high-quality imaging and reporting, multidisciplinary nodule management, smoking cessation integration, and shared decision-making embedded in a structured program [^113V7bR6] [^1136DxcL] [^114Tmeyw] [^1111ZSch].

---

Low-dose CT (LDCT) for lung cancer screening is recommended for **high-risk adults aged 50–80 years** [^114Tmeyw] with a **≥ 20 pack-year smoking history** [^114vckdV] who currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years. LDCT reduces **lung cancer mortality by about 20%** [^113V7bR6] and all-cause mortality by about 6% [^1111ZSch] versus chest radiography or no screening, with a number needed to screen of ~320 to prevent one lung cancer death over ~6.5 years [^1111ZSch]. Harms include false positives (~23% per round) [^113V7bR6], overdiagnosis (~18%) [^115A6aV5], and cumulative radiation exposure (~4–5 mSv over 3 years) [^115WntCK]; these are mitigated by structured programs using Lung-RADS [^112DNcUF] and shared decision-making [^116e3uTy]. Screening should stop after 15 years of abstinence or if life expectancy or curative intent is limited [^114Tmeyw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting LDCT screening

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate that LDCT screening **reduces lung cancer mortality** in high-risk populations:

- **National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)**: 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality versus chest radiography [^113V7bR6] [^1138xHKT].
- **NELSON trial**: 24% reduction in lung cancer mortality versus no screening [^1136DxcL].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent ~20% reduction in lung cancer mortality across trials [^115A6aV5] [^114zcnW3].

---

## Eligibility criteria and screening guidelines

Current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other organizations recommend LDCT screening for the following **high-risk populations**:

| **Organization** | **Age range** | **Smoking history** | **Years since quitting** |
|-|-|-|-|
| USPSTF | 50–80 years | ≥ 20 pack-years | ≤ 15 years |
| American Cancer Society (ACS) | 50–80 years | ≥ 20 pack-years | ≤ 15 years |
| American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) | 50–80 years | ≥ 20 pack-years | ≤ 15 years |
| National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) | 50–80 years | ≥ 20 pack-years | ≤ 15 years |

---

Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years, develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy, or is unwilling to undergo curative lung surgery [^114Tmeyw].

---

## Benefits of LDCT screening

The primary benefit of LDCT screening is a **significant reduction in lung cancer mortality** [^113V7bR6], supported by multiple RCTs and meta-analyses [^115A6aV5]. LDCT also detects more early-stage cancers than chest radiography, enabling curative treatment and improved survival [^115p8uNH]. Additionally, screening programs provide opportunities for smoking cessation counseling, further reducing lung cancer risk [^1136DxcL].

---

## Potential harms and risks associated with LDCT screening

While LDCT screening offers substantial benefits, it also carries potential harms:

- **False-positive results**: Occur in approximately 23% of screened individuals per round, leading to unnecessary diagnostic procedures, anxiety, and increased healthcare costs [^113V7bR6] [^111w5aUm].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Estimated at approximately 18%, referring to the detection of indolent cancers that may not cause symptoms or affect survival [^115A6aV5].
- **Radiation exposure**: Cumulative effective dose over three years is approximately 4–5 mSv, with a small theoretical risk of radiation-induced cancers [^notfound].
- **Incidental findings**: Common (4.4%–40.7%), potentially requiring further evaluation and causing patient anxiety [^1111ZSch] [^112mcsV7].

---

## Balancing benefits and harms

The net benefit of LDCT screening depends on careful patient selection, adherence to screening protocols, and effective management of screen-detected findings. Shared decision-making is essential to ensure patients understand the potential benefits and harms before undergoing screening [^116e3uTy]. Structured programs using standardized protocols (e.g. Lung-RADS) [^112DNcUF] and multidisciplinary care teams help **minimize harms and maximize benefits** [^117Dd2Bz].

---

## Current limitations and challenges

Despite strong evidence supporting LDCT screening, several challenges remain:

- **Low uptake**: Only about 20% of eligible individuals undergo screening, partly due to lack of awareness, access, and provider engagement [^113K3J83] [^113bA19r].
- **False positives and overdiagnosis**: Persistent concerns requiring ongoing efforts to improve risk stratification and nodule management protocols [^1111ZSch] [^115A6aV5].
- **Radiation exposure**: Continued efforts to minimize cumulative dose through optimized protocols and selective screening strategies [^115WntCK].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Current research focuses on refining risk prediction models to better identify individuals who will benefit most from screening [^1173kkrQ], evaluating extended or personalized screening intervals to reduce false positives and radiation exposure [^115dmHuP], and integrating biomarkers and artificial intelligence to improve nodule characterization and reduce unnecessary procedures [^116nF68z] [^115CBYpc].

---

Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer is **effective in reducing mortality** among high-risk smokers, but it requires careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and structured programs to balance benefits and harms. Ongoing research aims to optimize screening strategies and expand implementation.

### Impact of low-dose computed tomography screening on lung cancer incidence and outcomes [^113K3J83]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review findings from clinical trials of lung cancer screening (LCS), assess contemporary issues with implementation in clinical practice, and review emerging strategies to increase the uptake and efficiency of LCS.

Recent Findings

In 2013, the USPSTF recommended annual screening for individuals aged 55–80years and currently smoke or quit within the past 15years based on reduced mortality from lung cancer with annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening in the National Lung Screening Trial. Subsequent trials have demonstrated similar mortality outcomes in individuals with lower pack-year smoking histories. These findings, coupled with evidence for disparities in screening eligibility by race, resulted in updated guidelines by USPSTF to broaden eligibility criteria for screening. Despite this body of evidence, implementation in the United States has been suboptimal with fewer than 20% of eligible individuals receiving a screen. Barriers to efficient implementation are multifactorial and include patient, clinician, and system-level factors.

Summary

Multiple randomized trials have established that annual LCS reduces mortality from lung cancer; however, several areas of uncertainty exist on the effectiveness of annual LDCT. Ongoing research is examining approaches to improve the uptake and efficiency of LCS, such as the use of risk-prediction models and biomarkers for identification of high-risk individuals.

### Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1111ZSch]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US.

Objective

To review the evidence on screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2019; references; experts; and literature surveillance through November 20, 2020.

Study Selection

English-language studies of screening with LDCT, accuracy of LDCT, risk prediction models, or treatment for early-stage lung cancer.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings. Data were not pooled because of heterogeneity of populations and screening protocols.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality, all-cause mortality, test accuracy, and harms.

Results

This review included 223 publications. Seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 86 486) evaluated lung cancer screening with LDCT; the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST, N = 53 454) and Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON, N = 15 792) were the largest RCTs. Participants were more likely to benefit than the US screening-eligible population (eg, based on life expectancy). The NLST found a reduction in lung cancer mortality (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]; number needed to screen [NNS] to prevent 1 lung cancer death, 323 over 6.5 years of follow-up) with 3 rounds of annual LDCT screening compared with chest radiograph for high-risk current and former smokers aged 55 to 74 years. NELSON found a reduction in lung cancer mortality (IRR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61–0.90]; NNS to prevent 1 lung cancer death of 130 over 10 years of follow-up) with 4 rounds of LDCT screening with increasing intervals compared with no screening for high-risk current and former smokers aged 50 to 74 years. Harms of screening included radiation-induced cancer, false-positive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, incidental findings, and increases in distress. For every 1000 persons screened in the NLST, false-positive results led to 17 invasive procedures (number needed to harm, 59) and fewer than 1 person having a major complication. Overdiagnosis estimates varied greatly (0%-67% chance that a lung cancer was overdiagnosed). Incidental findings were common, and estimates varied widely (4.4%-40.7% of persons screened).

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening high-risk persons with LDCT can reduce lung cancer mortality but also causes false-positive results leading to unnecessary tests and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis, incidental findings, increases in distress, and, rarely, radiation-induced cancers. Most studies reviewed did not use current nodule evaluation protocols, which might reduce false-positive results and invasive procedures for false-positive results.

### Benefits and harms of CT screening for lung cancer: a systematic review [^116rx9za]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, resulting in a very low 5-year survival. Screening may reduce the risk of death from lung cancer.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A multisociety collaborative initiative (involving the American Cancer Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was undertaken to create the foundation for development of an evidence-based clinical guideline.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), EMBASE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), and the Cochrane Library (April 2012).

Study Selection

Of 591 citations identified and reviewed, 8 randomized trials and 13 cohort studies of LDCT screening met criteria for inclusion. Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included nodule detection, invasive procedures, follow-up tests, and smoking cessation.

Data Extraction

Critical appraisal using predefined criteria was conducted on individual studies and the overall body of evidence. Differences in data extracted by reviewers were adjudicated by consensus.

Results

Three randomized studies provided evidence on the effect of LDCT screening on lung cancer mortality, of which the National Lung Screening Trial was the most informative, demonstrating that among 53,454 participants enrolled, screening resulted in significantly fewer lung cancer deaths (356 vs 443 deaths; lung cancer−specific mortality, 274 vs 309 events per 100,000 person-years for LDCT and control groups, respectively; relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; absolute risk reduction, 0.33%; p = 0.004). The other 2 smaller studies showed no such benefit. In terms of potential harms of LDCT screening, across all trials and cohorts, approximately 20% of individuals in each round of screening had positive results requiring some degree of follow-up, while approximately 1% had lung cancer. There was marked heterogeneity in this finding and in the frequency of follow-up investigations, biopsies, and percentage of surgical procedures performed in patients with benign lesions. Major complications in those with benign conditions were rare.

Conclusion

Low-dose computed tomography screening may benefit individuals at an increased risk for lung cancer, but uncertainty exists about the potential harms of screening and the generalizability of results.

### Computed tomography screening for lung cancer [^115pNkFj]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Screening with low-dose computed tomography reduces mortality from lung cancer in high-risk patients. Lung cancer screening with chest radiography alone or in combination with sputum analysis is currently not recommended. The feasibility and impact of screening in patients with a low or moderate risk for primary lung cancer are currently not known. A standardized framework for testing and management in a multidisciplinary fashion is necessary to provide lung cancer screening. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Lung Association have recently issued guidelines for lung cancer screening with computed tomography in high-risk patients.

### Executive summary: screening for lung cancer: chest guideline and expert panel report [^114xehsa]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer has become a standard of care in the United States, in large part because of the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Additional evidence supporting the net benefit of low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer, and increased experience in minimizing the potential harms, has accumulated since the prior iteration of these guidelines. Here, we update the evidence base for the benefit, harms, and implementation of low-dose chest CT screening. We use the updated evidence base to provide recommendations where the evidence allows, and statements based on experience and expert consensus where it does not.

Methods

Approved panelists reviewed previously developed key questions using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format to address the benefit and harms of low-dose CT screening, and key areas of program implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library on a quarterly basis since the time of the previous guideline publication. Reference lists from relevant retrievals were searched, and additional papers were added. Retrieved references were reviewed for relevance by two panel members. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate. Important clinical questions were addressed based on the evidence developed from the systematic literature review. Graded recommendations and ungraded statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

The systematic literature review identified 75 additional studies that informed the response to the 12 key questions that were developed. Additional clinical questions were addressed resulting in seven graded recommendations and nine ungraded consensus statements.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that low-dose CT screening for lung cancer can result in a favorable balance of benefit and harms. The selection of screen-eligible individuals, the quality of imaging and image interpretation, the management of screen-detected findings, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions can impact this balance.

### Perspective on management of low-dose computed tomography findings on low-dose computed tomography examinations for lung cancer screening. from the international association for the study of lung cancer early detection and screening committee [^113k5HUm]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) carefully implemented has been found to reduce deaths from lung cancer. Optimal management starts with selection of eligibility criteria, counseling of screenees, smoking cessation, selection of the regimen of screening which specifies the imaging protocol, and workup of LDCT findings. Coordination of clinical, radiologic, and interventional teams and ultimately treatment of diagnosed lung cancers under screening determine the benefit of LDCT screening. Ethical considerations of who should be eligible for LDCT screening programs are important to provide the benefit to as many people at risk of lung cancer as possible. Unanticipated diseases identified on LDCT may offer important benefits through early detection of leading global causes of death, such as cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as the latter may result from conditions such as emphysema and bronchiectasis, which can be identified early on LDCT. This report identifies the key components of the regimen of LDCT screening for lung cancer which include the need for a management system to provide data for continuous updating of the regimen and provides quality assurance assessment of actual screenings. Multidisciplinary clinical management is needed to maximize the benefit of early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. Different regimens have been evolving throughout the world as the resources and needs may be different, for countries with limited resources. Sharing of results, further knowledge, and incorporation of technologic advances will continue to accelerate worldwide improvements in the diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### Impact of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening on lung cancer-related mortality [^115A6aV5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, however lung cancer screening has not been implemented in most countries at a population level. A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer-related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). OBJECTIVES: To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer-related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening.

Search Methods

We performed the search in collaboration with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group and included the Cochrane Lung Cancer Group Trial Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, current issue), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase in our search. We also searched the clinical trial registries to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. We did not impose any restriction on language of publication. The search was performed up to 31 July 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality or harm outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors were involved in independently assessing trials for eligibility, extraction of trial data and characteristics, and assessing risk of bias of the included trials using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were lung cancer-related mortality and harms of screening. We performed a meta-analysis, where appropriate, for all outcomes using a random-effects model. We only included trials in the analysis of mortality outcomes if they had at least 5 years of follow-up. We reported risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I 2 statistic to investigate heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 trials in this review with a total of 94,445 participants. Trials were conducted in Europe and the United States in people aged 40 years or older, with most trials having an entry requirement of ≥ 20 pack-year smoking history (e.g. 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 20 years or 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.). One trial included male participants only. Eight trials were phase three RCTs, with two feasibility RCTs and one pilot RCT. Seven of the included trials had no screening as a comparison, and four trials had CXR screening as a comparator. Screening frequency included annual, biennial and incrementing intervals. The duration of screening ranged from 1 year to 10 years. Mortality follow-up was from 5 years to approximately 12 years. None of the included trials were at low risk of bias across all domains. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low across different outcomes, as assessed by GRADE. In the meta-analysis of trials assessing lung cancer-related mortality, we included eight trials (91,122 participants), and there was a reduction in mortality of 21% with LDCT screening compared to control groups of no screening or CXR screening (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87; 8 trials, 91,122 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were probably no differences in subgroups for analyses by control type, sex, geographical region, and nodule management algorithm. Females appeared to have a larger lung cancer-related mortality benefit compared to males with LDCT screening. There was also a reduction in all-cause mortality (including lung cancer-related) of 5% (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 8 trials, 91,107 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Invasive tests occurred more frequently in the LDCT group (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.41 to 2.80; 3 trials, 60,003 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, analysis of 60-day postoperative mortality was not significant between groups (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.94; 2 trials, 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). False-positive results and recall rates were higher with LDCT screening compared to screening with CXR, however there was low-certainty evidence in the meta-analyses due to heterogeneity and risk of bias concerns. Estimated overdiagnosis with LDCT screening was 18%, however the 95% CI was 0 to 36% (risk difference (RD) 0.18, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.36; 5 trials, 28,656 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four trials compared different aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using various measures. Anxiety was pooled from three trials, with participants in LDCT screening reporting lower anxiety scores than in the control group (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.27; 3 trials, 8153 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were insufficient data to comment on the impact of LDCT screening on smoking behaviour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence supports a reduction in lung cancer-related mortality with the use of LDCT for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations (those over the age of 40 with a significant smoking exposure). However, there are limited data on harms and further trials are required to determine participant selection and optimal frequency and duration of screening, with potential for significant overdiagnosis of lung cancer. Trials are ongoing for lung cancer screening in non-smokers.

### Timing of screening benefit for lung cancer with low-dose CT imaging [^112d5K6M]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence supports lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). However, the benefits of LDCT screening for lung cancer may not be immediate, making it unlikely to benefit patients with limited life expectancy.

Research Question

What is the time to benefit (TTB) from LDCT screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer?

Study Design and Methods

Population-based, randomized controlled trials of lung cancer screening using LDCT and reporting mortality outcomes were systematically searched in PubMed. TTB was estimated for the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the pooled data from four trials using our established analysis framework.

Results

Our analysis included four trials encompassing 64,105 individuals. In the NLST trial(N = 53,452), to prevent one death from lung cancer, 2,000 individuals would need to be screened over 1.78(95% confidence interval, 0.60–5.27) years. On average, it took 2.87 (1.31–6.32), 4.66 (2.64–8.21) and 8.87 (5.12–15.37) years before one death from lung cancer was prevented for every 1000, 500 and 200 individuals screened, respectively. These findings didn't vary when added to other trials.

Interpretation

The clinical benefits of LDCT screening may not be appropriate for individuals with limited life expectancy. Integrating TTB estimates into patient selection criteria could help maximise the benefits of LDCT screening.

### Lung cancer screening [^115C7omL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults of age 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.

### Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography: a systematic review to update the US preventive services task force recommendation [^113rANf3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Because early-stage lung cancer is associated with lower mortality than late-stage disease, early detection and treatment may be beneficial.

Purpose

To update the 2004 review of screening for lung cancer for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, focusing on screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2000 to 31 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter of 2012), Scopus, and reference lists.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials or cohort studies that evaluated LDCT screening for lung cancer.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted study data about participants, design, analysis, follow-up, and results, and a second reviewer checked extractions. Two reviewers rated study quality using established criteria.

Data Synthesis

Four trials reported results of LDCT screening among patients with smoking exposure. One large good-quality trial reported that screening was associated with significant reductions in lung cancer (20%) and all-cause (6.7%) mortality. Three small European trials showed no benefit of screening. Harms included radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, and a high rate of false-positive findings that typically were resolved with further imaging. Smoking cessation was not affected. Incidental findings were common.

Limitations

Three trials were underpowered and of insufficient duration to evaluate screening effectiveness. Overdiagnosis, an important harm of screening, is of uncertain magnitude. No studies reported results in women or minority populations.

Conclusion

Strong evidence shows that LDCT screening can reduce lung cancer and all-cause mortality. The harms associated with screening must be balanced with the benefits.

### Effective use of low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening [^111n5Rj3]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Lung cancer screening programs for high-risk populations using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) have been shown by a class I clinical trial to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20%. We present an overview of randomized and nonrandomized lung cancer screening trials and review some of the arguments advocating for or against the widespread implementation of such a screening program. Concerns regarding the use of LDCT screening for lung cancer include increased risk from radiation exposure, overdiagnosis of indolent tumors, and high numbers of false-positive results, which may increase patient anxiety and result in unnecessary procedures with potential complications. Current recommendations regarding diagnostic criteria and workup of positive screens as well as the risks and benefits of using LDCT for lung cancer screening are provided.

### Hesitancy around low-dose CT screening for lung cancer [^114QNUzV]. Annals of Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The absence of symptoms in early-stage (I/II) disease, when curative treatment is possible, results in > 70% of cases being diagnosed at late stage (III/IV), when treatment is rarely curative. This contributes greatly to the poor prognosis of lung cancer, which sees only 16.2% of individuals diagnosed with the disease alive at 5 years. Early detection is key to improving lung cancer survival outcomes. As a result, there has been longstanding interest in finding a reliable screening test. After little success with chest radiography and sputum cytology, in 2011 the United States National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated that annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduced lung cancer-specific mortality by 20%, when compared with annual chest radiography. In 2020, the NELSON study demonstrated an even greater reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality for LDCT screening at 0, 1, 3 and 5.5 years of 24% in men, when compared to no screening. Despite these impressive results, a call to arms in the 2017 European position statement on lung cancer screening (LCS) and the widespread introduction across the United States, there was, until recently, no population-based European national screening programme in place. We address the potential barriers and outstanding concerns including common screening foes, such as false-positive tests, overdiagnosis and the negative psychological impact of screening, as well as others more unique to LDCT LCS, including appropriate risk stratification of potential participants, radiation exposure and incidental findings. In doing this, we conclude that whilst the evidence generated from ongoing work can be used to refine the screening process, for those risks which remain, appropriate and acceptable mitigations are available, and none should serve as barriers to the implementation of national unified LCS programmes across Europe and beyond.

### Lung cancer screening [^111yoW9n]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of US cancer-related deaths. Lung cancer screening with a low radiation dose chest computed tomography scan is now standard of care for a high-risk eligible population. It is imperative for clinicians and surgeons to evaluate the trade-offs of benefits and harms, including the identification of many benign lung nodules, overdiagnosis, and complications. Integration of smoking cessation interventions augments the clinical benefits of screening. Screening programs must develop strategies to manage screening-detected findings to minimize potential harms. Further research should focus on how to improve patient selection, minimize harms, and facilitate access to screening.

### Screening for lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111FPE4F]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer has become a standard of care in the United States in the past few years, in large part due to the results of the National Lung Screening Trial. The benefit and harms of low-dose chest CT screening differ in both frequency and magnitude. The translation of a favorable balance of benefit and harms into practice can be difficult. Here, we update the evidence base for the benefit, harms, and implementation of low radiation dose chest CT screening. We use the updated evidence base to provide recommendations where the evidence allows, and statements based on experience and expert consensus where it does not.

Methods

Approved panelists developed key questions using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format to address the benefit and harms of low-dose CT screening, as well as key areas of program implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted by using MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists from relevant retrievals were searched, and additional papers were added. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Important clinical questions were addressed based on the evidence developed from the systematic literature review. Graded recommendations and ungraded statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

The systematic literature review identified 59 studies that informed the response to the 12 PICO questions that were developed. Key clinical questions were addressed resulting in six graded recommendations and nine ungraded consensus based statements.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that low-dose CT screening for lung cancer results in a favorable but tenuous balance of benefit and harms. The selection of screen-eligible patients, the quality of imaging and image interpretation, the management of screen-detected findings, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions can affect this balance. Additional research is needed to optimize the approach to low-dose CT screening.

### The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines for lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography scans for lung cancer survivors and other high-risk groups [^1118vkS5]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in North America. Low-dose computed tomography screening can reduce lung cancer-specific mortality by 20%.

Method

The American Association for Thoracic Surgery created a multispecialty task force to create screening guidelines for groups at high risk of developing lung cancer and survivors of previous lung cancer.

Results

The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines call for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography screening for North Americans from age 55 to 79 years with a 30 pack-year history of smoking. Long-term lung cancer survivors should have annual low-dose computed tomography to detect second primary lung cancer until the age of 79 years. Annual low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening should be offered starting at age 50 years with a 20 pack-year history if there is an additional cumulative risk of developing lung cancer of 5% or greater over the following 5 years. Lung cancer screening requires participation by a subspecialty-qualified team. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery will continue engagement with other specialty societies to refine future screening guidelines.

Conclusions

The American Association for Thoracic Surgery provides specific guidelines for lung cancer screening in North America.

### Screening for lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115F1VuT]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer has become a standard of care in the United States, in large part because of the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Additional evidence supporting the net benefit of low-dose chest CT screening for lung cancer, and increased experience in minimizing the potential harms, has accumulated since the prior iteration of these guidelines. Here, we update the evidence base for the benefit, harms, and implementation of low-dose chest CT screening. We use the updated evidence base to provide recommendations where the evidence allows, and statements based on experience and expert consensus where it does not.

Methods

Approved panelists reviewed previously developed key questions using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format to address the benefit and harms of low-dose CT screening, and key areas of program implementation. A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library on a quarterly basis since the time of the previous guideline publication. Reference lists from relevant retrievals were searched, and additional papers were added. Retrieved references were reviewed for relevance by two panel members. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Meta-analyses were performed when enough evidence was available. Important clinical questions were addressed based on the evidence developed from the systematic literature review. Graded recommendations and ungraded statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

The systematic literature review identified 75 additional studies that informed the response to the 12 key questions that were developed. Additional clinical questions were addressed resulting in seven graded recommendations and nine ungraded consensus statements.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that low-dose CT screening for lung cancer can result in a favorable balance of benefit and harms. The selection of screen-eligible individuals, the quality of imaging and image interpretation, the management of screen-detected findings, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions can impact this balance.

### The evidence for low-dose CT screening of lung cancer [^112WJBvh]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. An effective screening tool for early lung cancer detection has long been sought. Early chest radiograph and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening trials were promising and demonstrated increased cancer detection. However, these studies were not able to improve lung cancer mortality. The National Lung Screening Trial resulted in decreased lung cancer mortality with LDCT screening in a high-risk population. Similar trials are currently underway in Europe. With LDCT now being widely implemented, it is paramount for radiologists to understand the evidence for lung cancer screening.

### Lung cancer screening by low-dose spiral computed tomography [^112rYvxG]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The poor prognosis of lung cancer has barely changed in the last decades, but the prognosis is better when the disease is detected earlier. Lung cancer screening by chest radiography did not lead to a decrease in lung cancer mortality, presumably because the chest radiograph is a poor screening tool with low sensitivity. With the advent of the low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) scan it has become feasible to detect early invasive stage I lung cancer in 8–90% of cases. This technique could possibly decrease lung cancer mortality, but the extent of this effect is as yet unknown, and whether lung cancer screening will be cost-effective is yet to be determined. These questions can only be resolved in a randomized controlled trial with lung cancer mortality as an unbiased end-point. In this review, the initiatives to evaluate low dose spiral CT screening for lung cancer in Japan, USA and Europe are presented. In the United States and Japan, evaluation is in one-armed studies, whereas in many European countries randomized trials are now being planned and several one-armed studies have been initiated. A formal collaboration among these countries has now been set up. It is strongly recommended that lung cancer screening be evaluated in randomized trials in order to allow evidence-based health policy decisions to be made on this subject.

### Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT [^1138phAE]. European Journal of Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Screening for lung cancer is hoped to reduce mortality from this common tumour, which is characterised by a dismal overall survival, relatively well defined risk groups (mainly heavy cigarette smokers and workers exposed to asbestos) and a lack of early symptoms. In the past studies using sputum cytology and chest radiography have failed to demonstrate any reduction in lung cancer mortality through screening. One of the reasons is probably the relatively poor sensitivity of both these tests in early tumours. Low radiation dose computed tomography (CT) has been shown to have a much higher sensitivity for small pulmonary nodules, which are believed to be the most common presentation of early lung cancer. As, however, small pulmonary nodules are common and most are not malignant, non-invasive diagnostic algorithms are required to correctly classify the detected lesions and avoid invasive procedures in benign nodules. Nodule density, size and the demonstration of growth at follow-up have been shown to be useful in this respect and may in the future be supplemented by contrast-enhanced CT and positron emission tomography. Based on these diagnostic algorithms preliminary studies of low-dose CT in heavy smokers have demonstrated a high proportion of asymptomatic, early, resectable cancers with good survival. As, however, several biases could explain these findings in the absence of the ultimate goal of cancer screening, i.e. mortality reduction, most researchers believe that randomised controlled trials including several 10000 subjects are required to demonstrate a possible mortality reduction. Only then general recommendations to screen individuals at risk of lung cancer with low-dose CT should be made. It can be hoped that international cooperation will succeed in providing results as early as possible.

### Screening for lung cancer using low dose computed tomography [^115CBYpc]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Screening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography can reduce mortality from the disease by 20% in high risk smokers. This review covers the state of the art knowledge on several aspects of implementing a screening program. The most important are to identify people who are at high enough risk to warrant screening and the appropriate management of lung nodules found at screening. An accurate risk prediction model is more efficient than age and pack years of smoking alone at identifying those who will develop lung cancer and die from the disease. Algorithms are available for assessing people who screen positive to determine who needs additional imaging or invasive investigations. Concerns about low dose computed tomography screening include false positive results, overdiagnosis, radiation exposure, and costs. Further work is needed to define the frequency and duration of screening and to refine risk prediction models so that they can be used to assess the risk of lung cancer in special populations. Another important area is the use of computer vision software tools to facilitate high throughput interpretation of low dose computed tomography images so that costs can be reduced and the consistency of scan interpretation can be improved. Sufficient data are available to support the implementation of screening programs at the population level in stages that can be expanded when found to perform well to improve the outcome of patients with lung cancer.

### Low-dose CT: new tool for screening lung cancer? [^115PqpJ9]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from malignant tumours as it is very common and has a poor prognosis at advanced tumour stages. Prognosis could be improved by treatment at early stages. As these stages are usually asymptomatic, a diagnostic test that would allow detection of early tumour stages in a population at risk could potentially reduce mortality from lung cancer. Previous approaches using chest radiography and sputum cytology in smokers have been disappointing. Fluorescent bronchoscopy and molecular markers are not yet applicable in clinical routine. Because of its high sensitivity for small pulmonary nodules, which are the most common manifestation of early lung cancer, CT appears suitable as a screening test. Low-dose examination parameters can and should be used for this purpose. From clinical practice it is well known that chest CT often demonstrates small pulmonary nodules, which do not represent lung cancer. Therefore, non-invasive diagnostic algorithms are required to avoid unnecessary biopsies in benign lesions. In preliminary studies of low-dose CT using algorithms based on size and density of detected nodules a large proportion of asymptomatic lung cancers and a large proportion of early, resectable tumour stages were found with a small proportion of invasive procedures for benign nodules. Before this technology can be recommended for broad application, however, further information is required regarding appropriate inclusion criteria (smoking habits, age groups) and screening intervals. Most importantly, further data are required to clarify whether lung cancer screening using low-dose CT can actually reduce mortality from lung cancer.

### The challenges of implementing low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening in low-and middle-income countries [^1117zzXN]. Nature Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Lung cancer accounts for an alarming human and economic burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recent landmark trials from high-income countries (HICs) by demonstrating that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening effectively reduces lung cancer mortality have engendered enthusiasm for this approach. Here we examine the effectiveness and affordability of LDCT screening from the viewpoint of LMICs. We consider resource-restricted perspectives and discuss implementation challenges and strategies to enhance the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening in LMICs.

### Computed tomography screening for lung cancer [^112SNhzS]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening was shown to reduce lung cancer-specific mortality in a large randomized trial of a high-risk population. The decision to pursue CT screening for lung cancer is a timely question raised by individuals at risk of lung cancer and by their health care practitioners.

Objectives

To discuss the evidence for use of chest x-rays and low-dose CT in screening for lung cancer; to describe potential benefits, harms, and uncertainties of CT screening; and to review current guidelines for CT screening.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1984 to 2012. Additional citations were obtained from lists of references from select research and review articles on this topic. Evidence was graded using the American Hospital Association level of evidence guidelines.

Findings

Low-dose CT screening has been associated with a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in a large randomized controlled trial (National Lung Screening Trial [NLST]) of a high-risk population. Mortality data have not yet been reported for 5 other randomized controlled trials, and the sample sizes were too small to detect a meaningful difference in 2 other completed trials. A major risk of CT screening is a high false-positive rate, with associated risks and costs associated with follow-up CT scans and the potential for more invasive diagnostic procedures. Published guidelines for screening indicate a consensus that screening may be indicated for individuals who meet entry criteria for the NLST, but some guidelines expand their recommendations for screening beyond these criteria.

Conclusions and Relevance

Individuals at high risk of lung cancer who meet the criteria for CT screening in published guidelines should participate in an informed and shared decision-making process by discussing the potential benefits, harms, and uncertainties of screening with their physicians.

### Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the baseline findings of randomized controlled trials [^115H7eVr]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among all cancers. An estimated 29% of the global population older than 15 years currently smokes tobacco. The presence of a high risk population, relatively asymptomatic nature of the disease in the early phase, and relatively good prognosis when discovered early makes screening for lung cancer an attractive proposition. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the baseline results of randomized controlled trials so far published, which included more than 14,000 patients. Analysis was used to determine whether data was for or against the screening of lung cancers using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).

Design

Random effect meta regression model of meta-analysis and systematic review.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the current literature to determine whether screening for lung cancer in a high-risk population with computed tomography improves outcomes. A search strategy using Medline was employed, studies selected based on preset criteria and application of exclusion criteria, and data collected and analyzed for statistical significance.

Results

Screening for lung cancer using LDCT resulted in a significantly higher number of stage I lung cancers (odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–7.4), higher number of total non-small cell lung cancers (odds ratio 5.5, 95% CI 3.1–9.6), and higher total lung cancers (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 2.4–7.1). Screening using LDCT also resulted in increased detection of false-positive nodules (odds ratio 3.1, 95% CI 2.6–3.7) and more unnecessary thoracotomies for benign lesions (event rate 3.7 per 1000, 95% CI 3.5–3.8). For every 1000 individuals screened with LDCT for lung cancer, 9 stage I non-small cell lung cancer and 235 false-positive nodules were detected, and 4 thoracotomies for benign lesions were performed.

Conclusions

The baseline data from six randomized controlled trials offer no compelling data in favor or against the use of LDCT screening for lung cancer. We await the final results of these randomized controlled trials to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of LDCT in the screening for lung cancer and its effect on mortality.

### Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography [^114XfhNn]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Current guidelines endorse low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for smokers and former smokers aged 55 to 74, with at least a 30-pack-year smoking history. Adherence to published algorithms for nodule follow-up is strongly encouraged. Future directions for screening research include risk stratification for selection of the screening population and improvements in the diagnostic follow-up for indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Screening for lung cancer with LDCT has revealed that there are indolent lung cancers that may not be fatal. More research is necessary if the risk-benefit ratio in lung cancer screening is to be maximized.

### Results of initial low-dose computed tomographic screening for lung cancer [^115p8uNH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the largest contributor to mortality from cancer. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that screening with low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) rather than with chest radiography reduced mortality from lung cancer. We describe the screening, diagnosis, and limited treatment results from the initial round of screening in the NLST to inform and improve lung-cancer-screening programs.

Methods

At 33 U.S. centers, from August 2002 through April 2004, we enrolled asymptomatic participants, 55 to 74 years of age, with a history of at least 30 pack-years of smoking. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo annual screening, with the use of either low-dose CT or chest radiography, for 3 years. Nodules or other suspicious findings were classified as positive results. This article reports findings from the initial screening examination.

Results

A total of 53,439 eligible participants were randomly assigned to a study group (26,715 to low-dose CT and 26,724 to chest radiography); 26,309 participants (98.5%) and 26,035 (97.4%), respectively, underwent screening. A total of 7191 participants (27.3%) in the low-dose CT group and 2387 (9.2%) in the radiography group had a positive screening result; in the respective groups, 6369 participants (90.4%) and 2176 (92.7%) had at least one follow-up diagnostic procedure, including imaging in 5717 (81.1%) and 2010 (85.6%) and surgery in 297 (4.2%) and 121 (5.2%). Lung cancer was diagnosed in 292 participants (1.1%) in the low-dose CT group versus 190 (0.7%) in the radiography group (stage 1 in 158 vs. 70 participants and stage IIB to IV in 120 vs. 112). Sensitivity and specificity were 93.8% and 73.4% for low-dose CT and 73.5% and 91.3% for chest radiography, respectively.

Conclusions

The NLST initial screening results are consistent with the existing literature on screening by means of low-dose CT and chest radiography, suggesting that a reduction in mortality from lung cancer is achievable at U.S. screening centers that have staff experienced in chest CT.

### Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: clinical evidence and implementation research [^115JJsUL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer led to 1.8 million deaths in 2020, and remains the leading cause of cancer‐related deaths globally. Notable therapeutic improvements, such as the introduction of immunotherapy, have led to improved outcomes in a limited number of patients with late‐stage (stage IV) lung cancer; however, prognosis remains poor for the majority of lung cancer patients. Low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening (LCS) offers a promising solution to the early detection of lung cancer, and subsequently could significantly reduce lung cancer mortality. Multiple LCS studies have provided indisputable evidence for the benefits of LDCT LCS. However, LDCT LCS programs are yet to be implemented on a large scale globally. This review will highlight both the benefits and future challenges associated with the large‐scale implementation of LCS programs. We will examine the existing supporting evidence for LDCT LCS, gathered during extensive national LCS trials. Additionally, we will outline important obstacles that still need to be overcome, such as optimal selection of screening population, screening interval, the most appropriate nodule management protocol, cost effectiveness, infrastructure, participant compliance, and incorporation of smoking cessation programs. All of the aforementioned are crucial factors in the successful global implementation of LDCT LCS.

Low-dose CT lung cancer screening — patients with life-limiting comorbidities: For individuals with comorbidities that substantially limit their life expectancy and adversely influence their ability to tolerate the evaluation of screen detected findings, or tolerate treatment of an early stage screen detected lung cancer, we recommend that low-dose CT screening should not be performed (Strong Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence).

### Lung cancer screening [^116nF68z]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lung cancer screening with low-dose chest computed tomography is now recommended for high-risk individuals by the US Preventive Services Task Force. This recommendation was informed by several randomized controlled trials, the largest of which, the National Lung Screening Trial, demonstrated a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality with annual low-dose chest computed tomography compared with chest radiography.

Recent Findings

The benefit of lung cancer screening must be balanced against potential harms, including a high false-positive rate with consequent further evaluative studies and invasive testing. It is critical that harms be minimized as screening generalizes to the broad community. Informed decision making between providers and patients should include individualized risk assessment, a discussion of both potential benefit and harm, and tobacco treatment. Given the multiple components required for high quality, screening should ideally occur in the context of a multidisciplinary program.

Summary

We are in the early days of lung cancer screening, still with much to learn. Ongoing studies are necessary to refine the definition of a positive screen and develop better methods of distinguishing between true positive and false-positive results. Novel approaches, including the development of multicomponent lung cancer biomarkers, will likely inform and improve our future screening practice.

### Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening [^113V7bR6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. The advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose CT detects many tumors at early stages. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose CT could reduce mortality from lung cancer.

Methods

From August 2002 through April 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 U.S. medical centers. Participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose CT (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). Data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through December 31, 2009.

Results

The rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. The rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose CT and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. A total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose CT group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. The incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose CT group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.23). There were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT screening of 20.0% (95% CI, 6.8 to 26.7; P = 0.004). The rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose CT group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Screening with the use of low-dose CT reduces mortality from lung cancer. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; National Lung Screening Trial ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00047385.).

### European position statement on lung cancer screening [^11512yi1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT can save lives. This European Union (EU) position statement presents the available evidence and the major issues that need to be addressed to ensure the successful implementation of low-dose CT lung cancer screening in Europe. This statement identified specific actions required by the European lung cancer screening community to adopt before the implementation of low-dose CT lung cancer screening. This position statement recommends the following actions: a risk stratification approach should be used for future lung cancer low-dose CT programmes; that individuals who enter screening programmes should be provided with information on the benefits and harms of screening, and smoking cessation should be offered to all current smokers; that management of detected solid nodules should use semi-automatically measured volume and volume-doubling time; that national quality assurance boards should be set up to oversee technical standards; that a lung nodule management pathway should be established and incorporated into clinical practice with a tailored screening approach; that non-calcified baseline lung nodules greater than 300 mm 3, and new lung nodules greater than 200 mm 3, should be managed in multidisciplinary teams according to this EU position statement recommendations to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment; and planning for implementation of low-dose CT screening should start throughout Europe as soon as possible. European countries need to set a timeline for implementing lung cancer screening.

### The importance of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography for Medicare beneficiaries [^117Dd2Bz]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

The National Lung Screening Trial has provided convincing evidence of a substantial mortality benefit of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) for current and former smokers at high risk. The United States Preventive Services Task Force has recommended screening, triggering coverage of low-dose CT by private health insurers under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) are currently evaluating coverage of lung cancer screening for Medicare beneficiaries. Since 70% of lung cancer occurs in patients 65 years or older, CMS should cover low-dose CT, thus avoiding the situation of at-risk patients being screened up to age 64 through private insurers and then abruptly ceasing screening at exactly the ages when their risk for developing lung cancer is increasing. Legitimate concerns include false-positive findings that lead to further testing and invasive procedures, overdiagnosis (detection of clinically unimportant cancers), the morbidity and mortality of surgery, and the overall costs of follow-up tests and procedures. These concerns can be mitigated by clear criteria for screening high-risk patients, disciplined management of abnormalities based on algorithms, and high-quality multidisciplinary care. Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT can lead to early diagnosis and cure for thousands of patients each year. Professional societies can help CMS responsibly implement a program that is patient-centered and minimizes unintended harms and costs.

### Evaluation of the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography: modeling study for the US preventive services task force [^1173kkrQ]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is updating its 2013 lung cancer screening guidelines, which recommend annual screening for adults aged 55 through 80 years who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

Objective

To inform the USPSTF guidelines by estimating the benefits and harms associated with various low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening strategies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Comparative simulation modeling with 4 lung cancer natural history models for individuals from the 1950 and 1960 US birth cohorts who were followed up from aged 45 through 90 years.

Exposures

Screening with varying starting ages, stopping ages, and screening frequency. Eligibility criteria based on age, cumulative pack-years, and years since quitting smoking (risk factor-based) or on age and individual lung cancer risk estimation using risk prediction models with varying eligibility thresholds (risk model-based). A total of 1092 LDCT screening strategies were modeled. Full uptake and adherence were assumed for all scenarios.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained (benefits) compared with no screening. Estimated lifetime number of LDCT screenings, false-positive results, biopsies, overdiagnosed cases, and radiation-related lung cancer deaths (harms).

Results

Efficient screening programs estimated to yield the most benefits for a given number of screenings were identified. Most of the efficient risk factor-based strategies started screening at aged 50 or 55 years and stopped at aged 80 years. The 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria were not among the efficient strategies for the 1960 US birth cohort. Annual strategies with a minimum criterion of 20 pack-years of smoking were efficient and, compared with the 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria, were estimated to increase screening eligibility (20.6%-23.6% vs 14.1% of the population ever eligible), lung cancer deaths averted (469–558 per 100 000 vs 381 per 100 000), and life-years gained (6018–7596 per 100 000 vs 4882 per 100 000). However, these strategies were estimated to result in more false-positive test results (1.9–2.5 per person screened vs 1.9 per person screened with the USPSTF strategy), overdiagnosed lung cancer cases (83–94 per 100 000 vs 69 per 100 000), and radiation-related lung cancer deaths (29.0–42.5 per 100 000 vs 20.6 per 100 000). Risk model-based vs risk factor-based strategies were estimated to be associated with more benefits and fewer radiation-related deaths but more overdiagnosed cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

Microsimulation modeling studies suggested that LDCT screening for lung cancer compared with no screening may increase lung cancer deaths averted and life-years gained when optimally targeted and implemented. Screening individuals at aged 50 or 55 years through aged 80 years with 20 pack-years or more of smoking exposure was estimated to result in more benefits than the 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria and less disparity in screening eligibility by sex and race/ethnicity.

### An official American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians policy statement: implementation of low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening programs in clinical practice [^114op1eW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale

Annual low-radiation-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality among high-risk individuals and is now recommended by multiple organizations. However, LDCT screening is complex, and implementation requires careful planning to ensure benefits outweigh harms. Little guidance has been provided for sites wishing to develop and implement lung cancer screening programs.

Objectives

To promote successful implementation of comprehensive LDCT screening programs that are safe, effective, and sustainable.

Methods

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) convened a committee with expertise in lung cancer screening, pulmonary nodule evaluation, and implementation science. The committee reviewed the evidence from systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, surveys, and the experience of early-adopting LDCT screening programs and summarized potential strategies to implement LDCT screening programs successfully.

Measurements and Main Results

We address steps that sites should consider during the main three phases of developing an LDCT screening program: planning, implementation, and maintenance. We present multiple strategies to implement the nine core elements of comprehensive lung cancer screening programs enumerated in a recent ACCP/ATS statement, which will allow sites to select the strategy that best fits with their local context and workflow patterns. Although we do not comment on cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening, we outline the necessary costs associated with starting and sustaining a high-quality LDCT screening program.

Conclusions

Following the strategies delineated in this policy statement may help sites to develop comprehensive LDCT screening programs that are safe and effective.

### Lung cancer incidence and mortality in national lung screening trial participants who underwent low-dose CT prevalence screening: a retrospective cohort analysis of a randomised, multicentre, diagnostic screening trial [^115dmHuP]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Annual low-dose CT screening for lung cancer has been recommended for high-risk individuals, but the necessity of yearly low-dose CT in all eligible individuals is uncertain. This study examined rates of lung cancer in National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants who had a negative prevalence (initial) low-dose CT screen to explore whether less frequent screening could be justified in some lower-risk subpopulations.

Methods

We did a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the NLST, a randomised, multicentre screening trial comparing three annual low-dose CT assessments with three annual chest radiographs for the early detection of lung cancer in high-risk, eligible individuals (aged 55–74 years with at least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking, and, if a former smoker, had quit within the past 15 years), recruited from US medical centres between Aug 5, 2002, and April 26, 2004. Participants were followed up for up to 5 years after their last annual screen. For the purposes of this analysis, our cohort consisted of all NLST participants who had received a low-dose CT prevalence (T0) screen. We determined the frequency, stage, histology, study year of diagnosis, and incidence of lung cancer, as well as overall and lung cancer-specific mortality, and whether lung cancers were detected as a result of screening or within 1 year of a negative screen. We also estimated the effect on mortality if the first annual (T1) screen in participants with a negative T0 screen had not been done. The NLST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00047385.

Findings

Our cohort consisted of 26231 participants assigned to the low-dose CT screening group who had undergone their T0 screen. The 19066 participants with a negative T0 screen had a lower incidence of lung cancer than did all 26231 T0-screened participants (371·88 [95% CI 337·97–408·26] per 100000 person-years vs 661·23 [622·07–702·21]) and had lower lung cancer-related mortality (185·82 [95% CI 162·17–211·93] per 100000 person-years vs 277·20 [252·28–303·90]). The yield of lung cancer at the T1 screen among participants with a negative T0 screen was 0·34% (62 screen-detected cancers out of 18121 screened participants), compared with a yield at the T0 screen among all T0-screened participants of 1·0% (267 of 26231). We estimated that if the T1 screen had not been done in the T0 negative group, at most, an additional 28 participants in the T0 negative group would have died from lung cancer (a rise in mortality from 185·82 [95% CI 162·17–211·93] per 100000 person-years to 212·14 [186·80–239·96]) over the course of the trial.

Interpretation

Participants with a negative low-dose CT prevalence screen had a lower incidence of lung cancer and lung cancer-specific mortality than did all participants who underwent a prevalence screen. Because overly frequent screening has associated harms, increasing the interval between screens in participants with a negative low-dose CT prevalence screen might be warranted.

Funding

None.

### Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT: a meta-analysis [^114zcnW3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening on lung cancer (LC) outcomes.

Objective

Meta-analyze LDCT lung cancer screening trials.

Methods

We identified studies by searching PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists from retrieved publications. We abstracted data on study design features, stage I LC diagnoses, LC and overall mortality, false positive results, harm from invasive diagnostic procedures, overdiagnosis, and significant incidental findings. We assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We used random-effects models to calculate relative risks and assessed effect modulators with subgroup analyses and meta-regression.

Results

We identified 9 studies that enrolled 96,559 subjects. The risk of bias across studies was judged to be low. Overall, LDCT screening significantly increased the detection of stage I LC, RR = 2.93 (95% CI, 2.16–3.98), I² = 19%, and reduced LC mortality, RR = 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.93), I² = 0%. The number needed to screen to prevent an LC death was 265. Women had a lower risk of LC death (RR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.40–1.21) than men (RR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.66–1.13), p value for interaction = 0.11. LDCT screening did not reduce overall mortality, RR = 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91–1.01), I² = 0%. The pooled false positive rate was 8% (95% CI, 4–18); subjects with false positive results had < 1 in 1000 risk of major complications following invasive diagnostic procedures. The most valid estimates for overdiagnosis and significant incidental findings were 8.9% and 7.5%, respectively.

Discussion

LDCT screening significantly reduced LC mortality, though not overall mortality, with women appearing to benefit more than men. The estimated risks for false positive results, screening complications, overdiagnosis, and incidental findings were low. Long-term survival data were available only for North American and European studies limiting generalizability.

### Controversies in lung cancer screening [^113k2yEY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

There remains an extensive debate over lung cancer screening, with lobbying for and against screening for very compelling reasons. The National Lung Screening Trial, International Early Lung Cancer Program, and other major screening studies favor screening with low-dose CT scans and have shown a reduction in lung cancer — specific mortality. The increasing incidence of lung cancer and the dismal survival rate for advanced disease despite improved multimodality therapy have sparked an interest in the implementation of national lung cancer screening. Concerns over imaging workflow, radiation dose, management of small nodules, overdiagnosis bias, lead-time and length-time bias, emerging new technologies, and cost-effectiveness continue to be debated. The authors address each of these issues as they relate to radiologic practice.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^112ivjKb]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer typically exhibits symptoms only after the disease has spread, making cure unlikely. Because early-stage disease can be successfully treated, a screening technique that can detect lung cancer before it has spread might be useful in decreasing lung cancer mortality.

Objectives

In this article, we review the evidence for and against screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT and offer recommendations regarding its usefulness for asymptomatic patients with no history of cancer.

Results

Studies of lung cancer screening with chest radiograph and sputum cytology have failed to demonstrate that screening lowers lung cancer mortality rates. Published studies of newer screening technologies such as low-dose CT and "biomarker" screening report primarily on lung cancer detection rates and do not present sufficient data to determine whether the newer technologies will benefit or harm. Although researchers are conducting randomized trials of low-dose CT, results will not be available for several years. In the meantime, cost-effectiveness analyses and studies of nodule growth are considering practical questions but producing inconsistent findings.

Conclusions

For high-risk populations, no screening modality has been shown to alter mortality outcomes. We recommend that individuals undergo screening only when it is administered as a component of a well-designed clinical trial with appropriate human subjects' protections.

### Limitations of screening for lung cancer with low-dose spiral computed tomography [^114zrA2F]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Past lung cancer screening trials in the United States with chest X-ray and sputum cytology were not able to show any decrease in lung cancer mortality; however, these trials are over 20 years old. Recent follow-up of the Mayo Lung Project showed a better survival from lung cancer in the screened arm, but no difference in overall mortality, suggesting an overdiagnosis of nonfatal cancers. Recent reports of low radiation dose spiral computed tomography (CT) chest screening for lung cancer have shown that CT screening detects cancers at a smaller size than chest X-rays. To date, there have been no randomized trials of CT versus observation or chest radiographs for screening purposes. All data available thus far on CT screening are from phase II proof-of-principle trials. The major limitations of CT screening, discussed here, include (a) a high rate of nodule detection: over 50% of participants will have at least one noncalcified nodule; (b) resulting follow-up CT scans, associated with increased costs; (c) cost and morbidity of biopsy or resection of benign noncalcified nodule (20–25% of such procedures in several trials); and (d) a small, but difficult to quantify, risk of cancer associated with multiple follow-up CT scans.

### Spectrum of early lung cancer presentation in low-dose screening CT: a pictorial review [^115B8Cgn]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and was the leading cause of cancer death globally in males in 2008; among females, it was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death.

The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) has recently demonstrated that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality by 20% in high-risk subjects compared to chest X-ray screening. Based on this result, LDCT screening of heavy smokers has recently been recommended by the major American and European scientific societies.

LDCT of the lung would seem to be a simple radiological interpretation but the absence of contrast material injection and low signal-to-noise ratio due to the low radiation exposure can lead to misinterpretation and missed significant findings.

Moreover, the distinction between different types of pulmonary nodules, awareness of the behaviours of early stage lung cancer and the interpretation of serial LDCT scans are fundamental in the management of the findings.

In this pictorial review, we discuss the wide spectrum of early LDCT findings in lung cancer screening, highlighting typical as well as unusual radiological features and the varied growth rates of early stage lung cancer.

Low-dose CT protocol

LDCT for screening purposes is an unenhanced, single breath-hold scan, conducted from the lung apices through the lung bases.

Low-dose protocols of the chest can be achievable due to a high contrast resolution between the air and lung nodules, gaining a low radiation dose while maintaining good diagnostic quality.

There is no consensus on which level of dose is considered a 'low-dose' CT, however, the major screening trials used tube voltages between 90 kVp and 140 kVp and tube current in the range of 30–80 mAs. Both parameters should be combined to obtain an acceptable radiation dose, taking into account the patient's body habitus and age. The American College of Radiology (ACR), suggest a CTDIvol ≤ 3 mGy for standard size patients while an NLST study concluded that acceptable CT screening can be accomplished at an overall average effective dose of approximately 2 mSv. The National Comprehensive Cancer Care Network guidelines have suggested an effective dose of ≤ 3 mSv for patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m2 and ≤ 5 mSv for patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening — benefits and harms include mortality reduction and potential overdiagnosis. In the National Lung Screening Trial, participants had a 1.66% risk of lung cancer death in the next 6.5 years; after three rounds of annual LDCT screening, that risk was reduced to 1.33% (a 20% relative risk reduction). Table 1 notes a 20% relative decrease in lung cancer death (from 1.66% to 1.33%, or 3 fewer deaths per 1,000 screened) and a 7% relative reduction in all-cause mortality, alongside harms such as overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers (15–20% of tumors detected) and false positives and other incidental findings.

### Outcomes from more than 1 million people screened for lung cancer with low-dose CT imaging [^114WykSv]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging was recommended in 2013, making approximately 8 million Americans eligible for LCS. The demographic characteristics and outcomes of individuals screened in the United States have not been reported at the population level.

Research Question

What are the outcomes among people screened and entered in the American College of Radiology's Lung Cancer Screening Registry compared with those of trial participants?

Study Design and Methods

This was a cohort study of individuals undergoing baseline LDCT imaging for LCS between 2015 and 2019. Predictors of adherence to annual screening were computed. LDCT scan interpretations by Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) score, cancer detection rates (CDRs), and stage at diagnosis were compared with National Lung Cancer Screening Trial data.

Results

Adherence was 22.3%, and predictors of poor adherence included current smoking status and Hispanic or Black race. On baseline screening, 83% of patients showed negative results and 17% showed positive screening results. The overall CDR was 0.56%. The percentage of people with cancer detected at baseline was higher in the positive Lung-RADS categories at 0.4% for Lung-RADS category 3, 2.6% for Lung-RADS category 4A, 11.1% for Lung-RADS category 4B, and 19.9% for Lung-RADS category 4X. The cancer stage distribution was similar to that observed in the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, with 53.5% of patients receiving a diagnosis of stage I cancer and 14.3% with stage IV cancer. Underreporting into the registry may have occurred.

Interpretation

This study revealed both the positive aspects of CT scan screening for lung cancer and the challenges that remain. Findings on CT imaging were correlated accurately with lung cancer detection using the Lung-RADS system. A significant stage shift toward early-stage lung cancer was present. Adherence to LCS was poor and likely contributes to the lower than expected cancer detection rate, all of which will impact the outcomes of patients undergoing screening for lung cancer.

### Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: clinical evidence and implementation research [^115L4987]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer causes more deaths than breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer combined. Nevertheless, population-based lung cancer screening is still not considered standard practice in most countries worldwide. Early lung cancer detection leads to better survival outcomes: patients diagnosed with stage 1A lung cancer have a > 75% 5-year survival rate, compared to < 5% at stage 4. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) thorax imaging for the secondary prevention of lung cancer has been studied at length, and has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality in high-risk populations. The US National Lung Screening Trial reported a 20% overall reduction in lung cancer mortality when comparing LDCT to chest X-ray, and the Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) trial more recently reported a 24% reduction when comparing LDCT to no screening. Hence, the focus has now shifted to implementation research. Consequently, the 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN consortium based in five European countries, has set up a large-scale multicenter implementation trial. Successful implementation of and accessibility to LDCT lung cancer screening are dependent on many factors, not limited to population selection, recruitment strategy, computed tomography screening frequency, lung-nodule management, participant compliance, and cost effectiveness. This review provides an overview of current evidence for LDCT lung cancer screening, and draws attention to major factors that need to be addressed to successfully implement standardized, effective, and accessible screening throughout Europe. Evidence shows that through the appropriate use of risk-prediction models and a more personalized approach to screening, efficacy could be improved. Furthermore, extending the screening interval for low-risk individuals to reduce costs and associated harms is a possibility, and through the use of volumetric-based measurement and follow-up, false positive results can be greatly reduced. Finally, smoking cessation programs could be a valuable addition to screening programs and artificial intelligence could offer a solution to the added workload pressures radiologists are facing.

### Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography: grand rounds discussion from the beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1138xHKT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In December 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for selected current and former smokers. The Task Force based the recommendation primarily on the results of the NLST (National Lung Screening Trial). In this trial, patients randomly assigned to LDCT screening for 3 years had lower rates of both lung cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality (relative risk reduction, 6.7% [95% CI, 1.2% to 13.6%]; absolute risk reduction, 0.46% [CI, 0% to 0.9%]). Clinicians and health systems confront questions and challenges as they begin to implement lung cancer screening. This paper summarizes a conference during which an internist and a radiologist discuss the application of the Task Force recommendation to an individual patient.

### Lung cancer screening update [^111WVP4b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lung cancer is a health problem of global proportions. Despite intensive research over many years, the prognosis is still very poor. For the surgery to be effective, tumours need to be recognized early. Computed tomography (CT) is significantly more sensitive than chest radiograph for identifying small, asymptomatic lung cancers. Although low-dose CT screening observational trials have demonstrated that survival for all tumour types and sizes detected were extremely high, there is no clear evidence that low-dose CT screening reduces deaths from lung cancer. Only the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials can reveal a real benefit of screening in terms of mortality reduction.

Recent Findings

We summarize the protocols and the preliminary results of the lung cancer screening randomized controlled trial and the problems linked to the detection of suspected early cancer.

Summary

Today, we cannot already prove the ultimate mortality benefit of lung cancer screening with low-dose CT nor we can confirm that this approach is not harmful. We are waiting the final analysis of randomized controlled trials for lung cancer mortality. Even if is widely accepted that pooling data of randomized controlled trials could be of help to get powerful results in terms of mortality reduction in shorter follow-up time, this opportunity is still under evaluation.

Background

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Lung cancer is the commonest form of cancer (2.09 million cases) as well as the main cause of cancer related mortality (1.76 million deaths). Due to the asymptomatic nature of lung cancer, they are often diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor or futile. In more recent years low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been demonstrated to be a sensitive tool for the detection of early stage lung cancer. However, researches also indicated that LDCT is associated with high false-positive rates in the diagnosis of lung cancer, resulting in unnecessary invasive procedures and patient anxiety. In 2011, a high quality trial, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), compared LDCT to chest radiology (CXR) in a large sample of high risk adults showed a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality for LDCT over 6.5 years. Since then, lung cancer screening using LDCT for high risk groups is recommended by lots of organizations. But the most recent meta-analysis did not demonstrate superiority of LDCT screening over usual care in lung cancer mortality.

Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are well recognized as the most reliable and appropriate reference standard to address questions of various types of medical intervention. In September 2018, new data from the largest European trial (NELSON) showed an even bigger reduction in deaths from lung cancer than was seen in NLST. There were also four other RCTs reported the mortality results in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, trial sequential analyses (TSA) of LDCT for lung cancer screening have not been reported previously. We aim to assess the updated evidence regarding the ability of LDCT to reduce lung cancer mortality and to evaluate the possible harms associated with LDCT screening.

### Exposure to low dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening and risk of cancer: secondary analysis of trial data and risk-benefit analysis [^115WntCK]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The cumulative effective dose for the National Lung Screening Trial over three years was 4.8 mSv for men and 7.2 mSv for women. In the same period, we found a cumulative effective dose of 3.0 mSv for men and 4.2 mSv for women (table 2). In our study, the cumulative effective dose, and the consequent risk of cancer, was the sum of radiation exposure both from low dose CT scans and PET CT scans. The contribution of one PET CT scan was 4.0 mSv, compared with the 10 year low dose CT cumulative exposure of 9.2 mSv and 12.9 mSv for men and women, respectively (table S2). Therefore, screening studies that do not include PET CT scans in their protocols could lead to a lower radiation exposure. The ITALUNG screening trial, after four rounds of screening, reported that 77.4% of the delivered dose was from annual low dose CT scans and 22.6% from further investigations (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and CT guided biopsy). Further investigations assessing the role of study design in measuring radiation exposure are therefore needed.

Accurate risk prediction models can now quantify an individual's risk of developing or dying from lung cancer, and help identify people at high enough risk to undergo screening. Little is known, however, about the additional risk of cancer caused by exposure to radiation from screening itself. In a risk evaluation based on an assumed dose to the lung of 5.2 mGy, Brennerestimated an additional lung cancer risk of 1.8% caused by annual lung CT screening. Our results, conversely, show a theoretical additional risk of 0.05% (2.4 cases of major cancers induced in 5203 people).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^111V1rP1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening evidence and panel perspective — NLST, a large randomized trial, assessed lung screening with low-dose CT screening versus chest radiography in individuals at high risk for lung cancer, and low-dose CT screening decreased mortality from lung cancer (mainly adenocarcinoma) compared with chest radiography (247 vs. 309 deaths, respectively; 20% relative reduction in mortality; 95% CI, 6.8–26.7; p = 0.004). Low-dose CT is recommended for screening individuals at high risk for lung cancer. The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that low-dose CT is beneficial for identifying recurrences in patients previously treated for NSCLC, and it is important to note that the surveillance recommendations for patients who have been treated for NSCLC are different from the screening recommendations for individuals at high risk for lung cancer.

### Screening for lung cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1133DuKC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for lung cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the efficacy of low-dose computed tomography, chest radiography, and sputum cytologic evaluation for lung cancer screening in asymptomatic persons who are at average or high risk for lung cancer (current or former smokers) and the benefits and harms of these screening tests and of surgical resection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned modeling studies to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimum screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation).

### Screening for lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113dP6bT]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is by far the major cause of cancer deaths largely because in the majority of patients it is at an advanced stage at the time it is discovered, when curative treatment is no longer feasible. This article examines the data regarding the ability of screening to decrease the number of lung cancer deaths.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted of controlled studies that address the effectiveness of methods of screening for lung cancer.

Results

Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including a recent one, have demonstrated that screening for lung cancer using a chest radiograph does not reduce the number of deaths from lung cancer. One large RCT involving low-dose CT (LDCT) screening demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer deaths, with few harms to individuals at elevated risk when done in the context of a structured program of selection, screening, evaluation, and management of the relatively high number of benign abnormalities. Whether other RCTs involving LDCT screening are consistent is unclear because data are limited or not yet mature.

Conclusions

Screening is a complex interplay of selection (a population with sufficient risk and few serious comorbidities), the value of the screening test, the interval between screening tests, the availability of effective treatment, the risk of complications or harms as a result of screening, and the degree with which the screened individuals comply with screening and treatment recommendations. Screening with LDCT of appropriate individuals in the context of a structured process is associated with a significant reduction in the number of lung cancer deaths in the screened population. Given the complex interplay of factors inherent in screening, many questions remain on how to effectively implement screening on a broader scale.

### Computed tomography screening for lung cancer: has it finally arrived? Implications of the national lung screening trial [^113svzN6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has provided compelling evidence of the efficacy of lung cancer screening using low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) to reduce lung cancer mortality. The NLST randomized 53,454 older current or former heavy smokers to receive LDCT or chest radiography (CXR) for three annual screens. Participants were observed for a median of 6.5 years for outcomes. Vital status was available in more than 95% of participants. LDCT was positive in 24.2% of screens, compared with 6.9% of CXRs; more than 95% of all positive LDCT screens were not associated with lung cancer. LDCT detected more than twice the number of early-stage lung cancers and resulted in a stage shift from advanced to early-stage disease. Complications of LDCT screening were minimal. Lung cancer-specific mortality was reduced by 20% relative to CXR; all-cause mortality was reduced by 6.7%. The major harms of LDCT are radiation exposure, high false-positive rates, and the potential for overdiagnosis. This review discusses the risks and benefits of LDCT screening as well as an approach to LDCT implementation that incorporates systematic screening practice with smoking cessation programs and offers opportunities for better determination of appropriate risk cohorts for screening and for better diagnostic prediction of lung cancer in the setting of screen-detected nodules. The challenges of implementation are considered for screening programs, for primary care clinicians, and across socioeconomic strata. Considerations for future research to complement imaging-based screening to reduce the burden of lung cancer are discussed.

### Cumulative incidence of false-positive test results in lung cancer screening: a randomized trial [^111w5aUm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Direct-to-consumer promotion of lung cancer screening has increased, especially low-dose computed tomography (CT). However, screening exposes healthy persons to potential harms, and cumulative false-positive rates for low-dose CT have never been formally reported.

Objective

To quantify the cumulative risk that a person who participated in a 1- or 2-year lung cancer screening examination would receive at least 1 false-positive result, as well as rates of unnecessary diagnostic procedures.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial of low-dose CT versus chest radiography. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00006382)

Setting

Feasibility study for the ongoing National Lung Screening Trial.

Patients

Current or former smokers, aged 55 to 74 years, with a smoking history of 30 pack-years or more and no history of lung cancer (n = 3190).

Intervention

Random assignment to low-dose CT or chest radiography with baseline and 1 repeated annual screening; 1-year follow-up after the final screening. Randomization was centralized and stratified by age, sex, and study center.

Measurements

False-positive screenings, defined as a positive screening with a completed negative work-up or 12 months or more of follow-up with no lung cancer diagnosis.

Results

By using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, a person's cumulative probability of 1 or more false-positive low-dose CT examinations was 21% (95% CI, 19% to 23%) after 1 screening and 33% (CI, 31% to 35%) after 2. The rates for chest radiography were 9% (CI, 8% to 11%) and 15% (CI, 13% to 16%), respectively. A total of 7% of participants with a false-positive low-dose CT examination and 4% with a false-positive chest radiography had a resulting invasive procedure.

Limitations

Screening was limited to 2 rounds. Follow-up after the second screening was limited to 12 months. The false-negative rate is probably an underestimate.

Conclusion

Risks for false-positive results on lung cancer screening tests are substantial after only 2 annual examinations, particularly for low-dose CT. Further study of resulting economic, psychosocial, and physical burdens of these methods is warranted.

### Author response to "lack of benefit from low dose computed tomography in screening for lung cancer" [^115n7FmU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, harms of future invasive procedures for diagnosis purpose, overdiagnosis and overtreatment cannot be fully accounted by using lung cancer mortality as outcome. All-cause mortality reductions may be offset by harms due to the LDCT screening. Although LDCT shows an increase in detection of early stage cancers, overdiagnosis and false positive test results may increase as well. These results in unnecessary diagnostic procedures and lead to unnecessary treatment. When the possible benefits and harms of each option affect patients differently, shared decision making is recommended. Besides, targeting high risk population and image analysis methods refinement may further improve the efficiency of LDCT screening.

Since lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women, if it is found at an earlier stage, it is more likely to be successfully treated. Prevention (e.g. smoking cessation) is likely to have far greater impact on lung cancer mortality than is screening. Nonetheless, LDCT screening has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of lung cancer. From a public health perspective, 14% reduction in lung cancer mortality and 2% reduction in all-cause mortality (even though the effect is not statistically significant) may be relevant. More studies are warranted to optimize risk-stratified recruitment strategies and radiologic criteria.

### Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: clinical evidence and implementation research [^1162N8Na]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

LCS through the use of LDCT can reduce lung cancer mortality. This has now been undeniably proven in multiple RCTs. Therefore, LDCT LCS in high‐risk populations is on the brink of implementation. However, to achieve optimal outcomes, research into factors associated with LDCT‐screening implementation is still necessary. Shifting the focus to this type of research will help to achieve the fundamental goal of implementing accessible, affordable, and applicable CT screening programs in Europe for high‐risk individuals. Once implemented, continuous monitoring of participant eligibility, lung cancer detection rate, false‐positive/negative rates, LCS interval, adherence and referral rate, and CT radiation exposure will be required to ensure efficacy.

### Screening for lung cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114GWaSX]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Net benefit and evidence — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has a moderate net benefit in persons at high risk, with benefit depending on limiting screening to persons at high risk, accuracy of image interpretation similar to or better than clinical trials, and resolving most false positives with serial imaging rather than invasive procedures. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that LDCT has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect early-stage lung cancer, that annual screening in a defined population of high-risk persons can prevent a substantial number of lung cancer–related deaths, and that harms of LDCT screening are moderate in magnitude.

The debate about the impact of overdiagnosis is in part related to how it is defined, with a traditional definition as the discovery of a cancer that is so indolent that it is clinically insignificant (ie, it would not have caused symptoms or presented clinically had screening not been undertaken), and an alternative definition that extends to include any lung cancer diagnosed, whether indolent or aggressive, in a patient with a comorbid condition that leads to their death.

Barriers can arise if PCPs are not included or educated, as "Failure to include PCPs… may create barriers", including "slow uptake of screening or overzealous uptake with referral of inappropriate patients". Successful programs "performed early outreach to PCPs, including educational sessions that emphasized LDCT screening as a tool to improve quality of care and outcomes for individuals at high risk for lung cancer".

### Initial experience with a free, high-volume, low-dose CT lung cancer screening program [^1113NREi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated a significant mortality benefit for patients at high risk for lung cancer undergoing serial low-dose CT. Currently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and several United States-based professional associations recommend CT Lung screening for high-risk patients. In the absence of established reimbursement, the authors modeled and implemented a free low-dose CT lung cancer screening program to provide equitable access to all eligible patients. Elements of the program reported in this article include a decentralized referral network, centralized program coordination, structured reporting, and a patient data management system. The experience and initial results observed in this clinical setting closely match the performance metrics of the National Lung Screening Trial with regard to cancer detection and incidental findings rates. To eliminate health care disparities a vigorous lobbying effort will be needed to expedite reimbursement and make CT lung screening equally available to all patients at high-risk.

### Exposure to low dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening and risk of cancer: secondary analysis of trial data and risk-benefit analysis [^113Ed4jB]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer for both men and women in the United States. In 2015, the American Cancer Society expected more than 200 000 new cases of lung cancer, about 14% of the total new cancers, with a five year survival rate of 18%.

The US National Lung Screening Trial has shown that screening of high risk populations with low dose computed tomography (CT) reduces lung cancer mortality by more than 20% when compared with chest radiography. As a consequence, several medical societies currently recommend CT lung screening, and in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have granted a positive insurance coverage decision on screening. Millions of healthy high risk individuals are therefore theoretically eligible for CT lung cancer screening.

There is concern, however, that exposure to the ionising radiation of low dose CT in lung cancer screening might increase the risk of developing solid cancers and leukaemia. The concrete existence of this increased risk as related to low dose radiation (doses < 50 mSv) is controversial, although this topic deserves additional consideration because ionising radiation from CT screening is delivered to healthy people.

So far, there is limited knowledge of the levels of radiation exposure in lung cancer screening regarding both cumulative radiation exposure and the associated cancer risk, particularly in long term studies. Brennerestimated that if 50% of all current and former smokers in the US population aged 50–75 received annual CT screening, the number of lung cancers associated with radiation from screening would be about 36 000, a 1.8% (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 5.5) increase over the otherwise expected number. McCunney and Lireported that lung screening participants could experience a cumulative exposure to ionising radiation over 20–30 years, which exceeds the lifetime dose experienced by nuclear power workers and atomic bomb survivors. The results of these studies cannot be considered conclusive, however, because they are based on the assumption of an arbitrary, pre-established radiation dose for all individuals, regardless of sex, age, or body size.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the cumulative radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence associated with low dose CT from a 10 year lung cancer screening programme.

### Sensitivity and specificity of lung cancer screening using chest low-dose computed tomography [^114nRE9j]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Japan, with 45 927 men and 17 307 women dying from lung cancer in 2006. Since 1987, lung cancer screening programme using chest X-ray and sputum cytology for all residents aged 40 years of age and older regardless of smoking status has been conducted by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Unfortunately, the efficacy of lung cancer screening using chest X-ray and sputum cytology is insufficient. Therefore, a more effective approach is required to decrease lung cancer deaths.

Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been performed as an opportunistic screening method since the early 1990s in Japan. Several study groups introduced low-dose CT for population-based screening in clinical trials. These previous studies reported a high detection rate, an ability to detect small tumours and a high survival rate in detected cases. Some studies referred to interval cancer cases of lung cancer screening using low-dose CT, and one study referred to the sensitivity of screening. However, screening databases are yet to be linked to a cancer registry, which is essential for accurate evaluation of screening, including the confirmation of all interval cancer cases. To date, no study has been conducted on sensitivity and specificity of annual lung cancer screening using low-dose CT and cancer registry data. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of annual lung cancer screening using low-dose CT and data from screening and local cancer registry databases.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^1136DxcL]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Lung cancer screening — low-dose CT evidence and recommendations: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that screening individuals with high-risk factors using low-dose CT decreased the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20%. High-risk criteria in NLST were individuals who currently or previously smoked cigarettes with a 30 or more pack-year smoking history, who had quit smoking up to 15 years before enrollment, were 55 to 74 years of age, and had no evidence of lung cancer. In NELSON, low-dose CT screening enrolled 15,789 individuals at high risk; 85% were men, individuals were aged 50 to 74 years and currently smoked or had quit within the last 10 years, and at 10 years of follow-up there was a reduction in lung cancer mortality in men of 24% (cumulative rate ratio for death from lung cancer: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94; p = 0.01). The NCCN, ACS, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), American College of Chest Physicians, European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and other organizations recommend lung cancer screening using low-dose CT for select high-risk individuals who either currently or previously smoked cigarettes based on clinical trial data, and low-dose CT screening and follow-up are not a substitute for smoking cessation; patients should be offered smoking cessation counseling.

### Screening for lung cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114NSeew]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Other organizations' lung cancer screening recommendations — low-dose computed tomography (LDCT): The American Cancer Society recommends annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for persons aged 55 to 74 years who are in fairly good health, have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history, and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years, and it also recommends smoking cessation counseling, shared decision-making, and screening in a high-volume, high-quality lung cancer screening and treatment center. The American College of Chest Physicians suggests that annual screening with LDCT should be offered to asymptomatic current and former smokers aged 55 to 77 years who have smoked 30 pack-years or more and either continue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years, and it also recommends that screening not be performed for individuals with comorbidities that adversely influence their ability to tolerate the evaluation of screen-detected findings or tolerate treatment of an early-stage screen-detected lung cancer or that substantially limit their life expectancy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons aged 55 to 77 years who have at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years or in persons 50 years or older who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and have at least 1 additional risk factor for lung cancer. The American Academy of Family Physicians has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer with LDCT in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on age and smoking history.

Low-dose CT screening program operations — minimizing overtreatment: We suggest that low-dose CT screening programs develop strategies to minimize overtreatment of potentially indolent lung cancers (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). It is important to educate patients about the potential to detect an indolent lung cancer to help mitigate the psychological distress that could result from living with an indolent untreated lung cancer, and for malignant nodules, pure ground glass is the nodule morphology on imaging that is most likely to represent an indolent cancer.

### Screening for lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112xNZ8H]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Screening for lung cancer — evidence overview: Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including a recent one, have demonstrated that screening for lung cancer using a chest radiograph does not reduce the number of deaths from lung cancer. One large RCT involving low-dose CT (LDCT) screening demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer deaths, with few harms to individuals at elevated risk when done in the context of a structured program of selection, screening, evaluation, and management of the relatively high number of benign abnormalities. Screening with LDCT of appropriate individuals in the context of a structured process is associated with a significant reduction in the number of lung cancer deaths in the screened population.

### Screening for lung cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114Tmeyw]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the US. In 2020, an estimated 228 820 persons were diagnosed with lung cancer, and 135 720 persons died of the disease. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is smoking. Increasing age is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancer has a generally poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 20.5%. However, early-stage lung cancer has a better prognosis and is more amenable to treatment.

Objective

To update its 2013 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the accuracy of screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and on the benefits and harms of screening for lung cancer and commissioned a collaborative modeling study to provide information about the optimum age at which to begin and end screening, the optimal screening interval, and the relative benefits and harms of different screening strategies compared with modified versions of multivariate risk prediction models.

Population

This recommendation statement applies to adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT has a moderate net benefit in persons at high risk of lung cancer based on age, total cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke, and years since quitting smoking.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery. (B recommendation) This recommendation replaces the 2013 USPSTF statement that recommended annual screening for lung cancer with LDCT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

### Screening for lung cancer: the guidelines [^115LRwh9]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Although virtually all individuals with advanced lung cancer succumb to the disease, a substantial portion of individuals diagnosed at an earlier stage can be cured. This dichotomy has provoked interest in lung cancer screening. To date, randomized controlled trials of chest x-ray and sputum cytology have failed to demonstrate that screening with either modality decreases lung cancer mortality; neither of these technologies can be recommended. Early studies of lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) appear promising; however, only data from observational studies are available. We recommend that individuals should only be screened with LDCT in the context of well-designed clinical trials.

### ACR CT accreditation program and the lung cancer screening program designation [^112DNcUF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The ACR recognizes that low-dose CT for lung cancer screening has the potential to significantly reduce mortality from lung cancer in the appropriate high-risk population. The ACR supports the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for screening patients. To be effective, lung cancer screening should be performed at sites providing high-quality low-dose CT examinations overseen and interpreted by qualified physicians using a structured reporting and management system. The ACR has developed a set of tools necessary for radiologists to take the lead on the front lines of lung cancer screening. The ACR Lung Cancer Screening Center designation is built upon the ACR CT accreditation program and requires use of Lung-RADS or a similar structured reporting and management system. This designation provides patients and referring providers with the assurance that they will receive high-quality screening with appropriate follow-up care.

To take lung cancer screening into national programmes, we first have to answer the question whether low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening and treatment of early lesions will decrease lung cancer mortality compared with a control group, to accurately estimate the balance of benefits and harms, and to determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Lung cancer-related mortality and the impact of low-dose… [^11688ezp]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer reduce lung cancer–related mortality and what are the harms. Evidence-Based Answer Low-dose CT screening decreases deaths from lung cancer in people 40 years and older with an absolute risk reduction of approximately 0. 4% and a number needed to screen of approximately 226 people over an average of
8. 8 years of follow-up to prevent one death. Low-dose CT screening is associated with harms, including overdiagnosis and false-positive results, with a number needed to screen to produce one harmful outcome of approximately 44.
1. 1 The mortality follow-up duration ranged from five to 12 years. The studies included adults 40 years and older from the United States and Europe who were asymptomatic and had not been diagnosed with lung cancer.

All trials used low-dose chest CT as the primary test, and the frequency and duration of low-dose CT varied between trials; annual low-dose CT screening occurred in nine trials. Patients included in the trials generally had a strong tobacco smoking history, although the specific amounts varied, and most trials had an entry requirement of a 20-pack-year smoking history or more. Compared with those who received no screening or were screened with chest radiography, patients who had annual or biennial low-dose CT screening for lung cancer had a relative risk reduction of 21% in lung cancer–related mortality. The review sought to identify harms from low-dose CT screening, including overdiagnosis, false-positive results, and health-related quality of life, such as anxiety and fear, arising from testing.

After baseline screening, more invasive testing was performed in the low-dose CT screening group, including surgical diagnostic procedures. For every 10, 000 people screened with low-dose CT, 363 unnecessary invasive tests were performed, yielding an approximate number needed to harm of 44 over an average 8. 8 years of follow-up. In 2021, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force updated their lung cancer screening recommendation to include annual low-dose CT screening for adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit in the past 15 years.

Key Points for Practice
- Low-dose CT is recommended annually for asymptomatic adults 55 to 77 years of age who have smoked at least 30 pack years, and who continue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.
- Low-dose CT screening is not recommended in patients who do not meet the age and smoking criteria, even if they are considered high risk by clinical risk prediction calculators.
- Evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments should be provided to current smokers undergoing low-dose CT screening for lung cancer. From the AFP Editors. Low-dose chest computed tomography -based screening for lung cancer has become the standard of care in the United States since the results of the National Lung Screening Trial were published. However, the benefits and harms of CT-based screening differ among patient populations, and it can be difficult to determine who should undergo screening.

The American College of Chest Physicians recently published recommendations for lung cancer screening based on the following key questions developed using the PICO format: Evidence-Based Recommendations Annual screening with low-dose CT is recommended for adults 55 to 77 years of age with no symptoms of lung cancer who have smoked at least 30 pack years, and who continue to smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. CT-based screening is not recommended for persons who do not meet these criteria, even if clinical risk prediction calculators classify them at high risk. The ACCP does not recommend low-dose CT screening for lung cancer in patients with comorbidities that make them unable to tolerate evaluation of screen-detected findings or treatment of early-stage lung cancer, or that substantially limit their life expectancy.

Patients with conditions such as advanced liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoventilation and hypoxia, or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure have limited potential benefit and substantial potential harm from screening. Lung cancer screening programs should define what constitutes a positive screen based on the size of CT-detected solid or part-solid lung nodules; the threshold for a positive result should be 4 to 6 mm in diameter. For current smokers undergoing low-dose CT screening, the ACCP recommends that evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments be provided as recommended by the U. S. Public Health Service.
