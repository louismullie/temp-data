## Question

How does management differ between gout and pseudogout?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how management differs between gout and pseudogout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and how that drives divergent management. Then, I should confirm diagnostic standards, especially synovial fluid analysis and imaging features. Next, I will review acute flare therapy with guideline strength for gout and check what, if anything, is evidenced for pseudogout in the supplied sources. After that, I need to examine prophylaxis strategies and long-term disease-modifying therapy, contrasting gout's treat-to-target urate lowering with the absence of a CPPD-lowering analog. Finally, I will consider imaging follow-up, comorbidity management, and highlight gaps where clinicians commonly extrapolate despite limited direct evidence for pseudogout in these materials [^1172bSbo] [^113MrCC1] [^113VckzR].

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiologic difference, because management flows from mechanism. Gout results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition driven by hyperuricemia, so treatment targets both crystal-triggered inflammation acutely and serum urate reduction chronically via urate-lowering therapy with treat-to-target goals, whereas pseudogout is due to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals and, in these sources, there is no disease-modifying "CPPD-lowering" therapy presented, implying care is largely anti-inflammatory for flares without a long-term crystal-reducing drug strategy [^1161UGP6] [^116Rkf8r] [^113sCKrm].

> I should confirm the diagnostic gold standard next. Hold on, let me verify the guidance on synovial fluid analysis: EULAR recommends crystal assessment in synovial fluid or tophus aspirates for suspected gout, with MSU crystals being definitive when identified, and CPPD crystals identified as rhomboid, positively birefringent on microscopy, which differentiates pseudogout from gout's needle-shaped, negatively birefringent MSU crystals, so aspiration remains pivotal when feasible in undiagnosed inflammatory arthritis [^113MrCC1] [^115sfjFm] [^113sCKrm].

> Next, I should review imaging contributions, but I need to be careful not to overstate their specificity. Ultrasound double-contour sign and dual-energy CT (DECT) patterns are highly specific for urate deposition and can support diagnosis or monitoring when aspiration is not possible, yet in these materials such characteristic imaging signs and follow-up recommendations are articulated for gout and not specifically for pseudogout, reinforcing that imaging surrogates here are gout-focused while CPPD-specific imaging guidance is not detailed in the supplied sources [^11563DPg] [^1135oGx4] [^113VckzR].

> I will now examine acute flare therapy for gout using high-credibility guidance. Guidelines consistently endorse NSAIDs with gastroprotection, low-dose colchicine, and systemic or intra-articular corticosteroids as first-line choices, with IL-1 inhibitors reserved for refractory or contraindicated situations; selection should be individualized by comorbidity such as renal function and cardiovascular or gastrointestinal risk, and renal impairment constrains colchicine and NSAID use, which I should double-check when applying to a given patient [^1139UKZq] [^116eZv8m] [^111zAZ1i] [^114WSd67] [^112ZXcoP].

> But wait, what about pseudogout flares in these references? Initially, I thought I would find guideline-grade recommendations for NSAIDs, colchicine, or steroids specifically for pseudogout, but on review, the provided sources largely mention pseudogout only as a differential diagnosis, with explicit therapeutic evidence limited to a retrospective study showing anakinra effectiveness for both gout and pseudogout in hospitalized patients, suggesting IL-1 pathway relevance across crystal arthritides while acknowledging the low-credibility nature of that study and the lack of pseudogout-specific guideline directives here [^112FzH6P] [^112iYRcF].

> Let me think about prophylaxis next. For gout, anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when initiating or uptitrating urate-lowering therapy is strongly recommended, typically with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID where not contraindicated, for at least 3–6 months and often up to 6 months, whereas these materials do not provide a parallel prophylaxis framework for pseudogout, reinforcing that recurrent flare prevention guidance here is tethered to the context of gout and ULT initiation [^114EdBSE] [^112D3qBA] [^117QyWfG].

> Now I need to ensure I contrast long-term management. Gout care centers on treat-to-target ULT with serum urate maintenance below 6 mg/dL and to below 5 mg/dL in severe disease, using xanthine oxidase inhibitors first-line with dose titration, preferentially a xanthine oxidase inhibitor in CKD stage ≥ 3, with uricosurics or combination strategies if targets are unmet, and pegloticase reserved for refractory tophaceous disease; importantly, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication to start ULT in these guidelines, whereas no CPPD-lowering or disease-modifying therapy is presented for pseudogout in these sources, underscoring the management divergence [^114Ny1jR] [^114N8dyy] [^116Rkf8r] [^111rpjV8] [^117MAsf7] [^115ytto4].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging follow-up and surveillance recommendations. EULAR imaging guidance supports considering ultrasound or DECT to monitor crystal burden and, with ultrasound, ongoing inflammation in gout, which can aid treat-to-target adherence and patient education; again, analogous longitudinal imaging surveillance is not delineated for pseudogout in these materials, which limits evidence-based imaging follow-up for CPPD here [^113VckzR] [^115QJTHi].

> I need to check diagnostic nuances that can alter management. Synovial fluid analysis remains critical when the diagnosis is uncertain, though characteristic urate deposition on ultrasound or DECT may obviate aspiration in some gout cases; moreover, coexistence of gout and pseudogout within the same joint has been reported, so when clinical features are atypical or responses are incomplete, reconsidering mixed-crystal disease with careful microscopy is prudent before finalizing a single-pathway treatment plan [^115sXLbA] [^111NWXYW] [^114XRhJ1].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications and gaps. From the supplied evidence, gout management is robustly guideline-based across acute and chronic phases, while pseudogout guidance here is sparse and primarily inferential, with the clearest overlap being IL-1 pathway utility in refractory flares; in practice, clinicians often extrapolate NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids for pseudogout flares, but I should emphasize that such extrapolation is not explicitly endorsed by these sources and should be applied cautiously with individualized risk assessment and, where possible, crystal-confirmed diagnosis guiding therapy [^1139UKZq] [^116eZv8m] [^113gR76y] [^112FzH6P].

---

Gout and pseudogout require distinct long-term strategies: **gout needs urate-lowering therapy (ULT) to prevent flares and joint damage** [^1172bSbo], while **pseudogout does not require ULT** and focuses on flare control and comorbidity management. Both use NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids [^1139UKZq] for acute flares [^111ZX6nR], but **colchicine is less effective in pseudogout**. Gout care includes treat-to-target urate goals [^114Ny1jR], prophylaxis when starting ULT [^114EdBSE], and lifestyle changes [^114wQZpP]; pseudogout management emphasizes comorbidity control and patient education.

---

## Acute flare management

### Gout

- **First-line therapies**: NSAIDs, colchicine [^111zAZ1i], or corticosteroids [^1139UKZq]; start within 24 hours of flare onset [^114JoBPf].
- **Colchicine dosing**: 1 mg loading dose [^1139UKZq], then 0.5 mg one hour later on day 1 [^111zAZ1i]; lower doses in renal impairment [^114WSd67].
- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Consider for frequent flares with contraindications to standard therapy [^113gR76y] [^112ZXcoP].

---

### Pseudogout

For acute pseudogout flares, **NSAIDs or corticosteroids are first-line**, as colchicine is less effective than in gout. Colchicine can be used for prophylaxis in recurrent flares, but its **efficacy is limited**.

---

## Long-term management

### Gout

- **Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)**: Indicated [^1172bSbo] for recurrent flares, tophi, chronic arthropathy, or renal stones [^114eRei8].
- **First-line ULT**: Allopurinol or febuxostat; titrate [^116Rkf8r] to serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^114Ny1jR], or < 5 mg/dL in severe disease [^112yeJDc].
- **Prophylaxis**: Low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation [^112D3qBA] to prevent flares [^114EdBSE].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, reduced alcohol, low-purine diet [^116oGup9], and comorbidity management [^114wQZpP].

---

### Pseudogout

- **No ULT**: ULT is not indicated, as pseudogout is not driven by hyperuricemia.
- **Comorbidity management**: Address metabolic or endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis).
- **Patient education**: Emphasize recognition and prompt treatment of flares.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

| **Parameter** | **Gout** | **Pseudogout** |
|-|-|-|
| Serum urate | Regular monitoring; target < 6 mg/dL [^116FEjYb] | Not applicable |
| Imaging | Ultrasound or DECT to monitor crystal burden [^113VckzR] | Limited role |
| Comorbidities | Regular assessment and management [^115fa43Z] | Focus on metabolic/endocrine disorders |

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

For gout, emphasize **ULT adherence** [^114wQZpP] and **lifestyle changes** [^116oGup9]; for pseudogout, emphasize **flare recognition** and **comorbidity management**.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Gout** | **Pseudogout** |
|-|-|-|
| Crystal type | Monosodium urate [^113MrCC1] | Calcium pyrophosphate [^111Yq8km] |
| Chronic therapy | ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat) [^116Rkf8r] | No ULT |
| Acute therapy | NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids [^1139UKZq] | NSAIDs, corticosteroids |
| Prophylaxis | Colchicine or NSAIDs during ULT initiation [^114EdBSE] | Limited role |
| Monitoring | Serum urate, imaging [^114Ny1jR] | Comorbidity management |

---

Gout management centers on **ULT** with treat-to-target urate goals [^114Ny1jR] and prophylaxis [^114EdBSE], whereas pseudogout focuses on acute flare control and comorbidity management **without ULT**.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^114VAGCC]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in patients with chronically elevated blood levels of uric acid. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in the United States and is often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. Initial presentation is usually an acutely warm, swollen joint, most commonly the first metatarsophalangeal joint, but a variety of locations may be affected.

The main treatment for gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels; however, surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. Based on the literature at the time of writing, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities affecting outcomes in these patients should be considered.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: A scoping review [^11583uUt]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

This study identified determinants for self‐management behavior in gout and provides targets for researchers and policymakers to select and develop evidence‐ and theory‐based interventions targeting patients with gout and their context. Implementing these interventions is expected to increase self‐management behavior and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

This study also reveals the complexity and quantity of determinants that could be targeted to improve and support self‐management. Although a complex intervention targeting the specific barriers for self‐management of individuals may be most effective, a general intervention could target the COM‐B domains by using the education, persuasion, and enablement intervention functions according to the BCW. More information on determinants of self‐management behavior other than adherence to receiving ULT, such as lifestyle modifications, care‐seeking behavior, and self‐monitoring of disease status in gout, is needed to get a complete picture of determinants associated with self‐management behavior.

In conclusion, we identified various modifiable determinants of self‐management behavior in patients with gout, which can function as targets for interventions aiming to improve gout care through increased self‐management.

### Gout and coexisting pseudogout in the knee joint [^114XRhJ1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

We report the unusual case of a 63-year-old man with gout and coexisting pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease) affecting the same joint. In this report, we describe the clinical features of the patient in addition to the characteristics of the crystals extracted from his affected joint, which were examined using compensated polarized microscopy.

- **Methods**: Synovial fluid and specimens of the lateral meniscus of the patient's knee joint, taken during arthroscopy, were analyzed using compensated polarized microscopy to evaluate the presence and type of crystals.

- **Results**: Compensated polarized microscopy revealed both monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals extracted from the knee joint.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the coexistence of gout and pseudogout should be considered in the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthritis. Careful crystal evaluation using compensated polarized microscopy may reveal similar cases with MSU and CPPD crystals in the same joint.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^115qVvr2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality, and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

- **Recent findings**: Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate. Despite this, dietary factors can still contribute to the population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for managing hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare, and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and the well-tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Although significant advances have been made in understanding risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is a substantial need to improve gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1119KM5h]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Gout, characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) in synovial fluid and other tissues, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence of 3.9% in the US,0.9% in France,1.4–2.5% in the UK,1.4% in Germany, and 3.2% (European ancestry) to 6.1% (Maori ancestry) in New Zealand. Over the last decade, several new therapies for gout have been approved by regulatory agencies or are being tested. The conduct of trials that lead to drug approval and observational studies providing insights into risk factors, genetic associations, and the general epidemiology of gout, depends critically on the appropriate identification of individuals with gout for inclusion in such studies. Classification criteria serve the purpose of enabling the standardized assembly of a relatively homogeneous group of individuals with the disease of interest for enrollment into such studies.

- **Existing classification criteria**: There are several existing sets of classification criteria or diagnostic rules for gout. The most widely used are the 1977 American Rheumatism Association (now the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) preliminary criteria for the classification of the acute arthritis of primary gout. These preliminary criteria were intended for identifying acute arthritis of gout and not necessarily for intercritical gout. The spectrum of comparator diseases was limited, and physician diagnosis was considered the gold standard. In a recent study, the gold standard was MSU crystal status in synovial fluid or nodule aspiration.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients. Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society, the European League Against Rheumatism, the Multinational Evidence Expertise Exchange Initiative, the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism, and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout.

However, despite the existing guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow. Initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate are infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116e2Wc6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in patients with chronically elevated uric acid levels. The term gout comes from the Latin gutta (drop), which is thought to relate to the concept of an imbalance of humors flowing into a joint. This condition affects approximately 4% of the adult population in the United States and has a variety of associated risk factors including certain medications, dietary factors, and medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and lead exposure.

Acute manifestations of gout include a painful, swollen joint that can either be mistaken for septic arthritis or concurrently infected, whereas chronic tophaceous deposits can cause periarticular bony erosions and damage to surrounding nerves and tendons. Orthopaedic surgeons are likely to encounter both acute and chronic gout over the course of their careers. This article will review the pathophysiology, medical treatment, and surgical treatment of gout in the upper and lower extremities and spine.

### New classification criteria for gout: A framework for progress [^114vWb5j]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The definitive classification or diagnosis of gout typically relies upon the identification of MSU crystals in synovial fluid (SF) or from tophi. When microscopic examination of SF is unavailable or impractical, the best approach may vary depending on the context. For many types of research, clinical classification criteria are necessary. The increasing prevalence of gout, advances in therapeutics, and the development of international research collaborations to understand the impact, mechanisms, and optimal treatment of this condition emphasize the need for accurate and uniform classification criteria for gout.

Currently, five clinical classification criteria for gout exist. However, none of the available criteria have been adequately validated. An international project is underway to develop new validated gout classification criteria. These criteria will be an essential step forward to advance the research agenda in the modern era of gout management.

### 2018 updated European League Against Rheumatism evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of gout [^116XCZDk]. Annals of the rheumatic diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gout, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, the EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend establishing a clinical diagnosis of gout, if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible, by the following highly suggestive (but not specific) features:

- **Male gender**: More common in males.
- **Monoarticular involvement of a foot**: Especially the first metatarsophalangeal or ankle joint.
- **Previous similar acute arthritis episodes**: Recurrent episodes increase suspicion.
- **Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling**: At its worst in less than 24 hours.
- **Erythema**: Redness of the affected area.
- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated levels of uric acid in the blood.
- **Associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**: Presence of CVDs can be indicative.

### Management of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

- **Purpose**: To review evidence about the treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

- **Data sources**: Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Study selection**: Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

- **Data synthesis**: High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only three of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces the long-term risk for acute gout attacks after one year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of gout [^114KMSzy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is an ancient disease that has caused pain and suffering over many centuries. The tragedy is that today we have excellent medication for the prevention of chronic gout, yet many people continue to be plagued by gout attacks and develop chronic arthritis. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide, which is related to aging and lifestyle changes. Gout is more common in people with metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of diuretics, and the intake of beer and sugared drinks.

This video and associated PowerPoint presentations should help anyone who manages patients with gout to understand how to elicit a good history, examine them, and generate a differential diagnosis [see online supplementary video and file]. The emphasis is on understanding the causes of gout and taking a proactive role. The good news is that gout can improve with lifestyle changes, and medication is relatively inexpensive.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^116eZv8m]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, specifically in managing acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering joint aspiration and administering an intra-articular corticosteroid for patients with acute monoarticular gout. As an alternative for patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, and if an intra-articular injection is not feasible, consider administering a short course of oral corticosteroids or a single injection of an intramuscular corticosteroid. Such systemic therapy should also be considered for patients experiencing oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116UWjgu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with gout flares in the wrist usually present with pain, erythema, and edema. Wrist aspiration is important to differentiate from pseudogout, cellulitis, hematoma, arthritic flare, or septic arthritis. Chronic gout in the wrist may lead to peritendinous tophi, lytic lesions in the carpal bones, and crystal deposition causing intercarpal ligament pathology, including scapholunate dissociation. Arthroscopic intervention in patients with gout and scapholunate ligament issues has shown diffuse radiocarpal and midcarpal synovitis with crystalline deposits, cartilage wear, and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligament disruption.

Surgical intervention for gout in the wrist is reserved for cases with persistent symptoms after medical management. Wrist arthroscopy can be used for synovectomy and evaluation of intercarpal ligamentous integrity and articular surfaces. Ligamentous reconstruction can proceed if the articular surfaces are preserved. If arthritis is present, standard management with salvage procedures such as proximal row carpectomy, intercarpal fusion, or wrist arthrodesis may be indicated. Although reports of concomitant gout and septic arthritis of the wrist are rare, arthroscopic treatment could be considered as an alternative to open synovectomy. A study of 40 septic wrists found that arthroscopic irrigation and débridement had a similarly effective rate of infection treatment with decreased length of stay compared with open treatment. It is imperative that uric acid control continue beyond surgical intervention.

Peritendinous gouty tophi can present in the flexor…

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications, such as colchicine, may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^112iYRcF]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

An acute gout flare presents as a painful, swollen joint. Patients may complain of severe throbbing pain at night, waking them from sleep, and pain with ambulation if the foot and ankle are affected. They may note having had similar symptoms during previous gout flares if the condition is long-standing. There may be a recent trigger, such as dehydration, alcohol/purine ingestion, illness, or a surgical procedure.

On examination, patients may have fever, pain with active and passive range of motion of the affected joint, tenderness to palpation, warmth, and erythema. Chronic tophaceous gout appears as subcutaneous nodules that are normally painless but become painful during a flare. The skin overlying the nodules may erode, revealing chalky tophaceous material. Ulceration over a gouty tophus is a risk factor for superinfection. Gout flares can occur in any joint but occur most commonly in the foot and ankle, specifically the first metatarsophalangeal joint.

If a patient with a painful, swollen joint has a history of gout and similar symptoms from previous flares, a gout flare is likely. In the case of no known previous gout history, atypical symptoms, or other risk factors for infection such as immunocompromise or overlying skin ulceration, gout diagnosis must be confirmed with aspiration to rule out septic arthritis, superinfected gout, or a different crystalline arthropathy such as pseudogout/calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition.

Approach to identifying domains and categories

In Phase 2, an international panel of expert rheumatologists and primary care physicians used a multicriterion decision analytic consensus methodology, informed by data generated in Phase 1, to determine the factors that best discriminated gout from other rheumatic diseases that could conceivably be considered in the differential diagnosis. Such an approach would lead to expert-derived, data-informed weighting of discriminating factors.

Rheumatologists and general internists with an interest in gout submitted patient cases using standardized data collection forms. A subset of 30 patient cases was selected to represent a broad spectrum of the probability of gout. Prior to the in-person expert panel meeting, panel members were given the data from Phase 1 to review, and they were asked to rank-order the 30 patient cases from lowest to highest probability of having gout.

At the in-person expert panel meeting, held over two days (June 9–10, 2014, in Paris, France, in advance of the EULAR Congress), three concepts were agreed upon a priori:

- **Standardized assembly**: The task was to develop criteria that would enable standardized assembly of a well-defined, relatively homogeneous group of subjects representative of persons with gout for entry into observational studies or clinical trials. Such criteria are not intended to capture all possible patients, but rather to capture the great majority of patients with shared key features of gout.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: Consensus statement of the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) [^115UbSaQ]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), and the 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines.

- **Discordance among guidelines**: The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, along with evidence from clinical experience and trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based, promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits and is supported by the ACR, EULAR, and 3e Initiative recommendations.

In contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent recurrences or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary endpoint are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near future.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^1174vhHc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is an increasingly common condition in the United States and is often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. The benchmark for diagnosis is joint aspiration revealing uric acid crystals. Gout flares must be differentiated from septic arthritis and may be concurrently infected. The main treatment for both acute and chronic gout is the medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels. However, surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits.

In addition, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities should be considered. It is crucial for surgeons to collaborate with rheumatologists for perioperative management.

### EULAR evidence-based recommendations for gout. Part II: Management. Report of a task force of the EULAR Standing Committee for International Clinical Studies Including Therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^111yGxST]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for managing gout.

The methods involved a multidisciplinary guideline development group consisting of 19 rheumatologists and one evidence-based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was systematically searched for each proposition. Where possible, the effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorized according to the level of evidence, and the strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results showed that 12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. These propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (such as weight loss if obese, reduced alcohol consumption, and a low animal purine diet), and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasized. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long-term ULT (ES = 1.39; 0.78 to…).

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114XQYwy]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The existing criteria for the classification of gout have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity, having been developed at a time when advanced imaging was not available. The effort was undertaken to develop new classification criteria for gout.

An international group of investigators, supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, conducted a systematic review of the literature on advanced imaging of gout. They undertook a diagnostic study in which the presence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophus was the gold standard, a ranking exercise of paper patient cases, and a multicriterion decision analysis exercise. These data formed the basis for developing the classification criteria, which were tested in an independent data set.

The entry criterion for the new classification criteria requires the occurrence of at least one episode of peripheral joint or bursal swelling, pain, or tenderness. The presence of MSU crystals in a symptomatic joint/bursa (i.e. synovial fluid) or in a tophus is a sufficient criterion for classifying the subject as having gout and does not require further scoring. The domains of the new classification criteria include:

- **Clinical**: Pattern of joint/bursa involvement, characteristics, and time course of symptomatic episodes.
- **Laboratory**: Serum urate, MSU-negative synovial fluid aspirate.
- **Imaging**: Double-contour sign on ultrasound or urate on dual-energy computed tomography, radiographic gout-related erosion.

### Casebook consults: Improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^112j9Uc5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made based on the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome. Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL. Measurements of SUA should be obtained after the resolution of an acute attack and then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT.

Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure adherence to recommended therapies. Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for disease control. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development (Fig. 1). The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease with episodic, highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurring gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis, and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occur frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life, and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when treating acute gout with colchicine (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^111uCu5B]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In general, the diagnosis of gout is achieved by clinical findings and laboratory analysis. There are no specific radiographic findings present in an acute gout flare, whereas chronically affected joints may show periarticular erosions with sclerotic margins. MRI will also show bony erosions (if present), bone marrow and/or soft-tissue edema, synovial pannus, and gouty tophi in chronic cases. Figure 1, A and B shows corresponding radiographic and MRI of periarticular erosions and gouty tophi in the thumb. Tophi may appear hypointense or isointense on T1, with variable signal on T2, and enhance homogeneously with contrast.

Ultrasonography of gouty arthropathy will show effusions, synovitis, and even MSU crystals themselves. The ultrasonographic double-contour sign refers to irregular hyperechoic enhancement of the articular surface, representing MSU crystal deposition. This has been described in patients with chronic gout and subcutaneous nodules on physical examination. More recently, dual-energy CT (DECT), an imaging method that differentiates materials based on their relative absorption of X-rays at different photon energy levels, has been used to identify patterns of MSU crystal deposition via color coding. It can be useful in atypical presentations of gout or monitoring chronic gout over time.

### Education and non-pharmacological approaches for gout [^1164mKu3]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The objectives of this review are to highlight the gaps in patient and physician knowledge of gout and how this might impede optimal disease management, to provide recommended core knowledge points that should be conveyed to people with gout, and to review non-pharmacological interventions that can be used in gout management. MeSH terms were used to identify eligible studies examining patients' and health-care professionals' knowledge about gout and its management. A narrative review of non-pharmacological management of gout is provided. Many health-care professionals have significant gaps in their knowledge about gout, which have the potential to impede optimal management. Likewise, people with gout and the general population lack knowledge about the causes, consequences, and treatment of this condition.

Full explanation about gout, including the potential benefits of urate-lowering treatment (ULT), motivates people with gout to start such treatment. There is evidence, albeit limited, that educational interventions can improve uptake and adherence to ULT. Additionally, several non-pharmacological approaches, such as rest and topical ice application for acute attacks, avoidance of risk factors that can trigger acute attacks, and dietary interventions — such as cherry or cherry juice extract, skimmed milk powder, or omega-3 fatty acid intake — that may reduce gout attack frequency or lower serum uric acid (e.g. vitamin C), can be used as adjuncts to ULT.

There is a pressing need to educate health-care professionals, people with gout, and society at large to remove existing knowledge gaps.

### Utility of anakinra in acute crystalline diseases: A retrospective study comparing a university hospital with a Veterans Affairs Medical Center [^112FzH6P]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in the inpatient management of acute gout and pseudogout. Hospitalized patients with acute gout (n = 77), pseudogout (n = 11), or both conditions (n = 3) were analyzed for response to anakinra and adverse effects.

Half of all patients had comorbidities that limited the treatment choice. Anakinra was well tolerated, with 92% of gout flares and 79% of pseudogout flares responding to treatment. The conclusion drawn from this research is that anakinra is an effective and safe treatment for acute gout and pseudogout in hospitalized patients, particularly in those with comorbidities.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Evolution of management of gout: A comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

- **Recent findings**: For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using a low dose. Intra-articular, oral, or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For the management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring a lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favor, with most guidelines favoring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about the timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to a target of serum urate (sUA) less than 6 mg/dl and less than 5 mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

- **Summary**: Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for the management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The challenge of correctly diagnosing gout is significant. Gout typically presents as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis during its early phases, progressing to chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in later stages. Arthritis may be accompanied by tophi and renal stones. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis are low. The presence of great toe involvement, common in both osteoarthritis and pseudogout, complicates a presumptive diagnosis based solely on a history of big toe pain and elevated serum urate levels. Documentation of other clinical features such as acute synovitis, radiographic signs typical of gout, and an assessment for features of differential diagnoses, including osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and rheumatoid arthritis, aids in accurate diagnosis.

The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for classifying acute gouty arthritis are often employed; however, they prove inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. It is crucial to aspire joint, bursa, or tophus fluid to confirm the diagnosis, as documenting urate crystals in synovial fluid definitively confirms gout and guides the often lifelong treatment regimen.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^116TDyzM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

As with most diseases, there is a gradient of probability of truly having the disease based on signs and symptoms. The threshold chosen for this classification criteria set yielded the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. While for certain purposes a higher sensitivity (lower score) may be preferable (e.g. general population survey to determine the public health burden of gout for resource planning), a higher specificity (higher score) may be desirable for others (e.g. genetic association studies in which accurate phenotyping is critical). Furthermore, classification criteria are not intended to characterize the severity of disease, but only its presence. Additionally, classification criteria should be applied only to the intended population — those who meet the entry criteria. The performance characteristics of any classification criteria set will necessarily be altered if the criteria are applied to those other than the intended population.

A limitation of our effort is that there is still a relative paucity of data and of clinical experience to fully test advanced imaging data empirically. As more studies are published, there may be additional imaging signs and/or modalities found to have sufficient specificity for gout that could be incorporated into future criteria. We also realized that some investigators may not have access to imaging and therefore aimed to develop criteria that would still perform well in the absence of imaging data. In the discrete‐choice experiments, the lack of imaging data was weighted the same as for studies performed with negative results.

The benchmark for the diagnosis of gout is the appearance of negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals in synovial fluid or tophaceous material under polarized light microscopy. This is in contrast to CPPD crystals, which will appear rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent. In addition to crystal analysis, synovial fluid samples should always be sent for cell count with differential, Gram stain, and culture.

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) counts under 50,000 cells/μL (or mm³) in the presence of MSU crystals are generally not suspicious for septic arthritis. Special attention must be paid even in cases of synovial WBC below this level if patients are immunocompromised and unable to mount the immune response of a high synovial fluid WBC count. In addition, ruptured tophi with overlying skin ulceration should increase suspicion for possible coinfection. Synovial fluid cultures should be followed over time, even in patients with low suspicion of infection. Gram stains have a high positive predictive value but cannot exclude septic arthritis if negative.

In addition to aspiration, other laboratory tests can help confirm a diagnosis of suspected gout. C-reactive protein (CRP) is usually increased during a gout flare and can be quite high, although a high CRP alone is nonspecific. In other words, a high CRP alone does not necessarily indicate that septic arthritis is present, whereas a CRP under 100 mg/dL in the setting of a lower synovial fluid WBC count and the presence of MSU crystals is generally consistent with gout.

Based on the key features identified initially, Phase 1 data, and available published literature, and with a defined population to whom the criteria would apply, the expert panel further developed the pertinent domains and their respective categories in an iterative process. The expert panel aimed to define relevant clinical and imaging parameters to be as specific as possible for gout.

- **Domains and categories**: The domains included clinical parameters (numbers 1–4), laboratory parameters (numbers 5 and 6), and imaging parameters (numbers 7 and 8). The specific domains and their respective definitions are summarized in Table 1. The domains were designed to be scored based on the totality of the subjects' symptomatic disease experience. All of the categories within domains are hierarchical and mutually exclusive, such that if both a higher and a lower category have been fulfilled at different points in time, the higher one should be scored; the highest categories are listed last within each domain.

Symptomatic episodes were defined as those in which there was swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa. For the pattern of joint involvement, it was agreed that first metatarsophalangeal joint, ankle, or midfoot involvement as part of a polyarticular presentation, though possible in gout, was not specific enough for gout since that pattern could be seen commonly in other disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. The time course of symptomatic episodes was to be considered irrespective of anti-inflammatory treatment.

### Evolution of gout: "malignant" change over time [^112UdR1J]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Gout is a common condition; yet, it is known for its ability to mimic other conditions in its imaging features, which can confuse clinicians and radiologists, sometimes leading to unnecessary investigations and treatments. We present a case involving a 52-year-old male renal transplant patient who developed a slow-growing mass in his left shin. The initial radiograph indicated a non-aggressive appearing calcified lesion. A fine needle aspiration identified this lesion as gout deposition. The lesion remained unchanged for eight years until a sudden increase in size was reported by the patient. Subsequent imaging showed characteristics of an aggressive lesion, including disruption of the previous calcification and notable enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Due to the concerning imaging features, a surgical excision biopsy was performed, which revealed tophaceous gout. Following the description of our case, we reviewed the clinical and imaging features of gout and discussed its differential diagnoses.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities for improving management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Numerous publications document deficits in the management and clinical outcomes of gout, despite a detailed understanding of its pathogenesis and pathophysiology. There is the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and there are likely effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for most patients. Impediments to successful gout management include diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout, alongside the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents, suggests that this is an opportune time to initiate both professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114m1nrX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The expert panel, consisting of 20 members, included 19 physicians with clinical and/or research interests in gout — 17 clinical rheumatologists and 2 primary care physicians — and an epidemiologist/biostatistician. Among the panel, 9 members were from the US, 8 from Europe, 2 from New Zealand, and 1 from Mexico. A total of 133 paper cases were submitted by the expert panel and 79 clinical rheumatologists and general internists.

Upon reviewing the Phase 1 data and conducting a ranking exercise with 30 cases representing low to high probability of gout, several key factors were identified as important for classifying gout. These factors include the presence of MSU crystals, the pattern of joint involvement, the intensity of symptomatic episodes, the time to maximal pain and resolution, the episodic nature of symptoms, the presence of clinical tophus, the level of serum urate, imaging features, response to treatment, family history, and risk factors or associated comorbidities. The last three factors were not considered further, as they are not features of gout itself despite their association with gout. Inclusion of risk factors or comorbidities in the definition of gout would preclude future studies evaluating their association with gout.

Entry, sufficient, and exclusion criteria were defined before embarking upon defining domains and domain categories (the classification criteria). The entry criteria were designed to identify the relevant patient population to whom the classification criteria would be applied. Sufficient criteria were intended to define features necessary for the classification of gout.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^115CEZZ1]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout progresses through several classic disease stages and corresponding clinical manifestations. In some cases, advanced disease stages and complications can appear prematurely, without earlier disease stages or clinical manifestations being apparent, such as tophaceous gout without prior gout flares, although this pattern is uncommon. MSU refers to monosodium urate. This information is adapted from ref. Springer Nature Limited.

Care for people with gout and CKD presents important challenges. For instance, the clinical presentation of gout in this high-risk comorbid population is variable, with a higher frequency of atypical presentations than in those without CKD. However, quality evidence to guide the management of gout in people with CKD is lacking, owing, at least in part, to the exclusion of people with CKD from trials of gout therapies, failure to report results stratified by renal function, and inconsistencies in the outcome measures used and reported. The resultant knowledge gaps have contributed to concerns regarding gout treatment efficacy and safety, some of which are legitimate and others questionable. The use of ULT in the context of advanced CKD varies greatly among rheumatologists, nephrologists, and generalists, and professional bodies have issued conflicting recommendations regarding the treatment of gout in people with concomitant CKD. These inconsistencies frequently result in confusion and, consequently, suboptimal gout management with failure to achieve recommended target urate levels. Moreover, pharmacological options for treating gout flares and other symptoms remain limited.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1111X7CV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

The new ACR/EULAR gout classification criteria represent an international collaborative effort that incorporates the latest published evidence on imaging modalities. This approach is data-driven, using monosodium urate (MSU) crystal identification as a gold standard to reference key features and a decision analytic approach to inform the weighting of the scoring system. These classification criteria enable a standardized approach to identifying a relatively homogeneous group of individuals who have the clinical entity of gout for enrollment into studies.

The criteria permit characterization of an individual as having gout regardless of whether they are currently experiencing an acute symptomatic episode and regardless of any comorbidities. The new classification criteria have superior performance characteristics, with high sensitivity and improved specificity compared with previously published criteria. Arguably, specificity, which leads to a high positive predictive value, is of critical importance in most clinical studies since investigators need to have confidence that individuals enrolled in a study truly have the condition of interest.

Gout is unlike other rheumatic diseases in that a gold standard assessment is available, namely MSU crystal positivity. While this gold standard has high specificity, its feasibility and sensitivity may be inadequate due to difficulties with aspiration of joints (particularly small ones) and/or examination of the sample under polarizing microscopy. Thus, although MSU crystal results are extremely helpful when positive, they are not always a feasible option.

### Computational lexical analysis of the language commonly used to describe gout [^114z4Las]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Using these methods, we analyzed our reference corpus with an emphasis on three elements of health care language: disease language (e.g. symptoms, disease names), treatment language (e.g. mechanism of action), and success language (e.g. goals, treatment targets).

- **Disease language**: Terms suspected to have the greatest relevance to practicing clinicians were identified, including gout, gouty arthritis, hyperuricemia, intercritical gout, gouty arthropathy, and podagra. Various analyses were conducted on these terms, with particular focus on the term gout. Statistically derived collocation analysis of the term gout is presented in Table 2. The collocates are words that occur within a 10-word window of gout with much greater than chance frequency. For example, given the overall frequency of gout and flares in the corpus, one would expect them to co-occur 61.606 times (on average) in a corpus of this size if they were randomly distributed. In fact, they co-occur 1,239 times in this corpus, showing a strong association between the two words. Strong collocates of gout include flares, acute, flare, and attacks. These terms frequently co-occur with gout but are, in actuality, clinically very distinct from it. Based on this analysis, the word that mostly reflects the meaning of gout is flares; while this is an accurate term for the physical manifestation of gout, it does not accurately convey the underlying causes of it. In effect, gout is used as an umbrella term that refers to the underlying hyperuricemia, the flares and attacks, and the acute and chronic stages.

### A point-of-care Raman spectroscopy-based device for the diagnosis of gout and pseudogout: Comparison with the clinical standard microscopy [^111Yq8km]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the usefulness of a novel medical device based on Raman spectroscopy for the rapid point-of-care diagnosis of gout and pseudogout, a shoebox-sized point-of-care Raman spectroscopy (POCRS) device was developed. This device included a disposable syringe microfiltration kit to collect arthropathic crystals from synovial fluid, along with a customized automated Raman spectroscopy system to chemically identify crystal species. Diagnosis according to the findings of POCRS was compared with the clinical standard diagnosis based on compensated polarized light microscopy (CPLM) of synovial fluid aspirates collected from symptomatic patients (n = 174). Kappa coefficients were used to measure the agreement between POCRS and CPLM findings.

Overall, POCRS and CPLM results were consistent in 89.7% of samples (156 of 174). For the diagnosis of gout, the kappa coefficient for POCRS and CPLM was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.75–0.94). For the diagnosis of pseudogout, the kappa coefficient for POCRS and CPLM was 0.61 (95% CI 0.42–0.81).

Kappa coefficients indicated that there was excellent agreement between POCRS and CPLM for the diagnosis of gout, with good agreement for the diagnosis of pseudogout. The POCRS device holds the potential to standardize and expedite the time to clinical diagnosis of gout and pseudogout, especially in settings where certified operators trained for CPLM analysis are not available.

### Therapeutic advances in gout [^116xcbwS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight recent developments in the management of gout.

- **Recent findings**: Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gout from EULAR, quality of care indicators, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been published. The standards of gout diagnosis and management remain very low. Allopurinol continues to be the mainstay for serum uric acid lowering therapy. However, in an important percentage of patients receiving allopurinol, serum uric acid levels are insufficient to promote crystal dissolution. Febuxostat, a new serum uric acid lowering drug, has shown promising results. Ongoing information regarding uricase is also being reported. For the treatment of gouty inflammation, etoricoxib, a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, has been shown to be as effective as indomethacin. Additionally, the association of gout with metabolic syndrome and its comorbidities, and the newly described link between gout and myocardial infarction, highlight the importance of lifestyle and dietary modifications in the management of gout.

- **Summary**: Proper gout management requires changes in the physician's approach to the disease, specifically: (1) An unequivocal diagnosis based on urate crystal identification, (2) a clearly defined treatment goal of crystal elimination from the joints and other areas, and (3) appropriate use of the available therapeutic alternatives. Emphasizing a proper lifestyle appears to be especially important.
