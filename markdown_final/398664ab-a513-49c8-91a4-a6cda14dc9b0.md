## Question

amox dose for adult sinus infection and how many days

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the adult amoxicillin dose and duration for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (sinus infection). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming when antibiotics are indicated for ABRS versus viral disease. Then, I should verify the first-line agent and whether plain amoxicillin suffices or if amoxicillin–clavulanate is preferred. Next, I will check the FDA-labeled adult dosing regimens for amoxicillin that are applicable to ABRS. After that, I need to determine the optimal duration, reconciling FDA ranges with guideline-preferred shorter courses. I will then consider severity- and risk-based modifications, alternatives for beta-lactam allergy, and what to do if there is no improvement, to ensure the final dosing recommendation is precise and actionable [^115meHhE] [^111khKvo] [^1141GNX1].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold for using antibiotics, because I need to ensure we are treating ABRS and not viral rhinosinusitis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: antibiotics are reserved for persistent symptoms ≥ 7–10 days, severe symptoms for ≥ 3 days (fever ≥ 39°C, purulent discharge, facial pain), or "double-sickening" after initial improvement, with watchful waiting reasonable in uncomplicated cases if reliable follow-up is assured [^112WnXrG] [^116sL2Da] [^113pxXZ7].

> I initially thought amoxicillin–clavulanate was mandatory first-line, but wait, let me verify the most current guidance. The updated AAO-HNSF and AAFP reviews allow either amoxicillin alone or amoxicillin–clavulanate as first-line therapy for most immunocompetent adults without risk factors for resistance, with amoxicillin performing as well as amoxicillin–clavulanate in such patients. I should confirm that macrolides and TMP-SMX are discouraged due to resistance patterns, which they are [^115meHhE] [^111khKvo] [^115oMEci].

> Next, I should review concrete adult dosing regimens for amoxicillin in ABRS. Let me double-check the FDA Structured Product Labeling: two therapeutically standard options are 875 mg by mouth twice daily, or 500 mg by mouth three times daily, each within a 5–10 day labeled range. The total daily dose and clinical outcomes are comparable, and the BID regimen often improves adherence, especially when symptoms are prominent [^1141GNX1] [^114YAosz].

> Now, about duration — hmm, wait a minute, the label often lists 5–10 days, but I need to reconcile this with guideline-preferred shorter courses. The 2025 AAO-HNSF guideline recommends 5–7 days for most adults to minimize adverse effects and resistance without compromising efficacy, while recognizing the FDA labeling permits up to 10 days. Evidence suggests no advantage beyond 7 days in uncomplicated cases, supporting shorter courses when there is clinical response [^115meHhE] [^1141GNX1] [^115hWs8r].

> But wait, what if there is severe disease or higher risk for resistance? I need to check how that modifies the approach. For severe presentations or when risk factors for beta-lactamase–producing organisms are present, amoxicillin–clavulanate is preferred, using 875/125 mg BID for 5–7 days, with an option for XR 2000/125 mg BID in high-risk scenarios. If choosing amoxicillin monotherapy in more severe presentations, clinicians often select the 875 mg BID regimen for better pharmacodynamic exposure, although this should be balanced with the indication for clavulanate when resistance risk is substantial [^117GbG11] [^115WZJYw] [^111khKvo].

> I should also consider label nuances about "treat until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution". Hold on, I should verify how this applies here. The amoxicillin labeling includes statements about continuing therapy 48–72 hours after symptom resolution in some infections, and some SPL entries cite similar language for ABRS and other indications, but contemporary ABRS guidelines emphasize a fixed 5–7 day course for uncomplicated adult disease, rather than open-ended continuation, unless the clinical course is severe or complicated. So, I will prioritize a fixed 5–7 day duration for routine adult ABRS and reserve longer (up to 10 days) only if response is delayed or disease is severe [^115C7WoB] [^111ZHpoN] [^115meHhE].

> Next, I should review options for beta-lactam allergy. For adults with a true beta-lactam allergy, doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone are accepted alternatives; if a fluoroquinolone is used, evidence supports either a short high-dose course (e.g., levofloxacin 750 mg daily for 5 days) or a standard 10-day course, though stewardship considerations favor reserving fluoroquinolones for select cases [^111khKvo] [^115JAziY].

> I will now examine what to do if there is no improvement. I need to ensure we reassess at 3–5 days of appropriate therapy if the patient worsens or fails to improve: confirm the ABRS diagnosis, evaluate adherence, consider complications or alternative diagnoses, and if ABRS is reaffirmed, change the antibiotic class accordingly. Watchful waiting remains appropriate initially for uncomplicated cases with good follow-up, which can avoid unnecessary antibiotic exposure altogether [^11271JBL] [^113pxXZ7].

> Final recommendation, synthesizing the above: For an immunocompetent adult with uncomplicated ABRS who meets criteria for antibiotics, I recommend amoxicillin 875 mg by mouth twice daily for 5–7 days, with amoxicillin 500 mg by mouth three times daily as an equivalent alternative. In patients with severe disease or risk factors for resistance, use amoxicillin–clavulanate 875/125 mg by mouth twice daily for 5–7 days, considering the XR 2000/125 mg twice daily formulation when high-risk pharmacodynamic coverage is desired. If beta-lactam–allergic, select doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and reassess at 72–120 hours if not improving, adjusting therapy based on response and diagnostic reconsideration [^115meHhE] [^114YAosz] [^117GbG11].

---

For adult acute bacterial sinusitis, the recommended amoxicillin dose is **500 mg orally three times daily (TID) or 875 mg orally twice daily (BID)** for **5–7 days** [^115meHhE]. Use **high-dose amoxicillin (1 g TID)** if there is a risk of resistance (recent antibiotics, severe infection, or immunocompromise). If symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days [^11271JBL], reassess and consider changing therapy.

## Recommended amoxicillin dosage for adult sinus infection

The **standard adult dosage** of amoxicillin for acute bacterial sinus infection is either **500 mg orally three times daily (TID)** [^114YAosz] or **875 mg orally twice daily (BID)** [^1141GNX1] for 5–10 days [^114YAosz]. These regimens are supported by **FDA labeling and clinical guidelines** [^11552ayP] and provide effective coverage against common pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^111khKvo].

---

## Duration of amoxicillin treatment

The recommended duration of amoxicillin treatment for adult sinus infections is typically **5–7 days** [^115meHhE], and recent guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) [^11552ayP] support these shorter courses for uncomplicated cases to minimize antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. However, the duration may be extended to **10 days** [^114YAosz] [^1141GNX1] for severe infection, immunocompromised patients, or when clinical response is inadequate within the initial 3–5 days of therapy [^11271JBL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from major medical organizations provide clear recommendations on **amoxicillin use** for adult sinus infections:

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended as first-line antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in adults [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE].

- **Watchful waiting**: Antibiotic therapy should be reserved [^113aZyt5] for patients with persistent symptoms (> 10 days) [^112WnXrG], severe symptoms (fever > 39°C, purulent nasal discharge, facial pain), or worsening symptoms after initial improvement (double sickening) [^116sL2Da] [^113pxXZ7].

- **Reassessment**: Patients who fail to improve or worsen despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for 3–5 days [^11271JBL] should be reassessed, and antibiotic therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

---

## Factors influencing dosage and duration

Several factors influence **amoxicillin dosing and treatment duration**:

- **Severity of infection**: Severe infections may require higher doses (e.g. 875 mg BID [^1141GNX1]) and longer duration (10 days [^114YAosz]).

- **Patient-specific factors**: Immunocompromised patients, those with chronic sinusitis, or recent antibiotic use may require adjusted dosing and longer treatment duration [^115meHhE].

- **Clinical response**: Treatment duration should be individualized based on clinical response, with reassessment if symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days [^11271JBL].

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^117Mxw2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to determine treatment failure. In meta-analysing the placebo-controlled studies, data across antibiotic classes were combined. Primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up.

- **Main results**: Fifty-seven studies were included in the review — six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo when clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days.

### Metronidazole [^1177LzKC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dosage and administration details should be individualized and depend on various factors such as the indication for use, patient's age, weight, clinical condition, concurrent treatment, and the patient's clinical and laboratory response to the treatment.

- **Recommended dosage for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections**: Parenteral therapy can be changed to oral metronidazole therapy when conditions warrant, based on the severity of the disease and the patient's response to Metronidazole Injection. The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours, approximately 500 mg for a 70-kg adult. A maximum of 4 grams should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period. The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

- **Recommended dosage for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in pediatric patients less than 4 months of age**: The recommended dosage schedule for these pediatric patients achieves drug exposures similar to adults treated with Metronidazole Injection for this indication.

- **Recommended dosage in patients with severe hepatic impairment**: For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the metronidazole dose should be reduced.

### AugmentinXR [^114o1Y4f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Adults with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) were evaluated in three clinical studies.

- **Comparative study**: In one study, 363 patients were randomized to receive either AugmentinXR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days in a double-blind, multicenter, prospective trial. These patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated at the test of cure (day 17–28) visit. The combined clinical and radiological responses were 83.7% for AugmentinXR and 84.3% for levofloxacin at the test of cure visit in clinically evaluable patients (95% CI for the treatment difference = -9.4, 8.3). The clinical response rates at the test of cure were 87.0% and 88.6%, respectively.

- **Non-comparative trials**: The other two trials were non-comparative, multicenter studies designed to assess the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of AugmentinXR (2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days) in the treatment of 2,288 patients with ABS. Evaluation timepoints were the same as in the prior study. Patients underwent maxillary sinus puncture for culture prior to receiving study medication. At test of cure, the clinical success rates were 87.5% and 86.6% (intention-to-treat) and 92.5% and 92.1% (per protocol populations).

### Efficacy/safety of amoxicillin/clavulanate in adults with bacterial rhinosinusitis [^111p1NoR]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common and uncomfortable condition, frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Antibacterial resistance among these and other common respiratory pathogens is now widespread and of concern. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was developed to be effective against the common respiratory pathogens, including many resistant strains.

- **Materials and methods**: This open-label, non-comparative study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg in adult patients with ABRS. Requirements for study entry included a clinical diagnosis of ABRS supported by radiologic findings. In addition, a sinus puncture for bacteriologic assessment was required at study entry.

- **Results**: Overall, bacteriologic success (eradication or clinical evidence of eradication) at the follow-up visit (days 17–28) was achieved in 87.8% (722/822) of patients with one or more pathogen isolated at screening, in 93.2% (246/264) of patients with S. pneumoniae, in 96.7% (29/30) of those with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations ≥ 2 microg/mL), and in 88.7% (110/124) of patients with beta-lactamase-positive pathogens. Bacteriologic success was achieved against 6 of 7 S. pneumoniae isolates with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4/2 microg/mL or higher.

- **Conclusions**: Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was generally well tolerated. This new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation provides a suitable option.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: Background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have a bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.

Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance are the preferred initial management strategies for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms, especially those with unilateral facial pain, regardless of the duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens should be used.

### Azithromycin extended release vs amoxicillin/clavulanate: Symptom resolution in acute sinusitis [^115GvZcj]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare early symptom resolution with a single 2-g dose of azithromycin extended release or 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours in patients with acute sinusitis.

This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, observational study designed to mimic "real-world" conditions, including patients with symptoms of acute bacterial sinusitis lasting between 7 and 30 days. Key symptoms were assessed twice daily using a patient diary, and patients were interviewed by telephone at 12 and 28 days. The primary endpoint was symptom resolution at 5 days, defined as reporting "no problem" with at least 3 of 4 diary symptoms in two consecutive measures in the per-protocol population. Secondary endpoints included additional antibiotic use, sinusitis-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction.

Three hundred seventy-eight patients were randomized to a single dose of azithromycin extended release and 371 to 10 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate. In the per-protocol population at day 5, 70 out of 236 patients (29.7%) in the azithromycin extended release arm and 45 out of 238 patients (18.9%) in the amoxicillin/clavulanate arm had resolution of symptoms (difference = 10.8%; 95% confidence interval, 3.1–18.4%). By day 28, 26 out of 236 patients (11.0%) in the azithromycin extended release arm and 27 out of 238 patients (11.3%) in the amoxicillin/clavulanate arm had used additional antibiotics (difference = -0.4%; 95% CI: -6.1% to 5.3%). Additional physician visits, quality of life, and overall satisfaction were similar between groups.

### Amoxicillin for acute rhinosinusitis: A randomized controlled trial [^113aZyt5]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

Evidence to support antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis is limited, yet antibiotics are commonly used. The objective of this study was to determine the incremental effect of amoxicillin treatment over symptomatic treatments for adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis.

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial design recruited adults with uncomplicated, acute rhinosinusitis from 10 community practices in Missouri between November 1, 2006, and May 1, 2009. The intervention involved a ten-day course of either amoxicillin (1500 mg/d) or placebo, administered in 3 doses per day. All patients received a 5- to 7-day supply of symptomatic treatments for pain, fever, cough, and nasal congestion to use as needed.

The main outcome measure was the improvement in disease-specific quality of life after 3 to 4 days of treatment, assessed with the Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 (minimally important difference of 0.5 units on a 0–3 scale). Secondary outcomes included the patient's retrospective assessment of change in sinus symptoms and functional status, recurrence or relapse, and satisfaction with and adverse effects of treatment. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interview at days 3, 7, 10, and 28.

A total of 166 adults (36% male; 78% with white race) were randomized to amoxicillin (n = 85) or placebo (n = 81); 92% concurrently used 1 or more symptomatic treatments (94% for the amoxicillin group vs. 90% for the control group; p = 0.34). The mean change in Sinonasal Outcome Test-16 scores was not significantly different between groups on day 3.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Some unanswered questions in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) antibiotic research are identified by several expert guidelines, which call for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short- or long-term antibiotics significantly impacts patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomized studies with larger population sizes are necessary. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, studies are required to conclusively determine its effectiveness in CRS, given the frequency of its prescription for this condition.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, with the majority prescribed for respiratory diseases caused by viruses. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is a suitable condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, a significant consideration in the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.

### Levofloxacin [^115JAziY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined ABS were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multi-center study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for ten days.

Clinical success rates, defined as the complete or partial resolution of pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the TOC visit, 22 days post-treatment.

* **Note**: Forty percent of the subjects in this trial had specimens obtained by sinus endoscopy. The efficacy data for…

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes, and the side effects of different treatments.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2; MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013); EMBASE (1974 to March 2013); SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey, accessed 15 January 2013); and reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model.

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

- **Main results**: We included 10 trials involving 2,450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hf1vB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The study of a 12-week course of azithromycin failed to show a significant improvement in subjective or objective outcomes at the completion of the course. However, 12 weeks after completion of the antibiotics, 50% of the AZM group reported an improvement or cure compared to 9% in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The single dosing per week is a notable feature of this study, and the authors felt that AZM may have been ineffective due to underdosage.

Macrolides have been shown to reduce TH1-mediated non-eosinophilic inflammation when used for durations of at least three months. It may be that there are specific endotypes that will respond better to macrolides than others.

There are no published DBRCTs of long-term non-macrolide antibiotics in CRS, but there are a few studies with less rigorous experimental designs. Dubin et al. performed a study of non-macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of CRSsNP. In this study, culture-directed antibiotics (clindamycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate) were given to patients with CRSsNP. Sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks and compared to baseline scans. There was an improvement in CT scores between baseline and week 3, but no significant improvements between week 3 and week 6. The authors concluded that a longer course of antibiotics may achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution in some patients.

Study weaknesses included a small analysable sample size (n = 16), a lack of a washout period, and the inclusion of patients who were already on antibiotics (an average of four previous antibiotic treatments).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

- **Action statements**: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish between different types of rhinosinusitis based on specific criteria.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^115oMEci]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially with respect to antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend against the use of TMP/SMX or macrolide antibiotics alone for the treatment of ABRS due to high rates of resistance among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.

### Treatment failure and adverse events after amoxicillin-clavulanate vs amoxicillin for pediatric acute sinusitis [^113Egc1u]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common indications for antibiotic prescribing in children, with an estimated 4.9 million such prescriptions in the US annually. A consensus does not exist regarding the optimal empirical antibiotic. This study compares amoxicillin-clavulanate vs amoxicillin for the treatment of acute sinusitis in outpatient children.

This cohort study involved children and adolescents aged 17 years or younger who had a new outpatient diagnosis of acute sinusitis and a same-day new prescription dispensation of either amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin, using a nationwide healthcare utilization database. Propensity score matching was employed to mitigate confounding effects.

- **Exposure**: A new prescription dispensation of amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Treatment failure, defined as an aggregate of a new antibiotic dispensation, an emergency department or inpatient encounter for acute sinusitis, or an inpatient encounter for a sinusitis complication, was assessed 1 to 14 days after cohort enrollment. Adverse events evaluated included gastrointestinal symptoms, hypersensitivity and skin reactions, acute kidney injury, and secondary infections.

The cohort included 320,141 patients. After propensity score matching, there were 198,942 patients (99,471 patients per group), including 100,340 (50.4%) females, 101,726 (51.1%) adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, 52,149 (26.2%) children aged 6 to 11 years, and 45,067 (22.7%) children aged 0 to 5 years. Treatment failure occurred in 1.7% overall.

### Efficacy and tolerability of telithromycin for 5 or 10 days vs amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 10 days in acute maxillary sinusitis [^115hWs8r]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2003). High credibility.

Telithromycin (HMR 3647) is a new ketolide antimicrobial that was developed for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of oral telithromycin, at 800 mg once daily for 5 or 10 days, with that of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, at 500/125 mg three times daily for 10 days, in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS).

A total of 754 patients with AMS of less than 28 days' duration were randomized to receive either telithromycin for 5 days followed by placebo for 5 days, telithromycin for 10 days, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 10 days. Clinical outcome was assessed at a test-of-cure (TOC) visit between days 17 and 24 and at a late post-therapy visit between days 31 and 45.

Analysis of clinical outcome on a per-protocol basis (n = 434) demonstrated therapeutic equivalence among the three regimens at the TOC visit; in each treatment group, the clinical cure rate was approximately 75%. Only a few patients (3 to 5 in each group) had relapsed by the late post-therapy follow-up visit. Telithromycin was generally safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were mild or moderate gastrointestinal effects, which occurred with similar frequency in all three groups.

We conclude that 5 or 10 days of telithromycin at 800 mg once daily is as effective clinically and as well tolerated as 10 days of treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Telithromycin, therefore, appears to be a valuable option for the treatment of AMS.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116zHKhf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The utilization and role of antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have evolved over time. Historically, antibiotics for CRS have been prescribed empirically, as swabs for culture have not been routinely taken in clinical practice. The choice of agent and the duration of its prescription have varied considerably based on the clinician's training and experience, as well as the clinical setting. Various guidelines have been developed to rationalize antibiotic prescription for this indication, but there are practical challenges in applying them, particularly when guidelines are developed in different healthcare environments. These challenges include variable treatment costs and antibiotic resistance rates. Notably, global consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics nearly doubled from 2000 to 2015, and prescribing for CRS remains one of the most common indications. Furthermore, in some countries, many antibiotics are dispensed without a prescription.

Although several antibiotics are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) or unspecified rhinosinusitis (RS), no antibiotic has FDA approval specifically for CRS. Despite this, antibiotics are still commonly prescribed for CRS. Between 2006 and 2010 in the United States, the antibiotic classes most commonly prescribed for CRS consultations were penicillins/beta-lactams (33%), macrolides (26%), and quinolones (19%). In a 2015 survey, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the drug of choice for adult and pediatric CRS patients among private practitioners in South Korea, whereas hospital-based doctors preferred macrolides for adult CRS patients and third-generation cephalosporins.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis update [^114QsmB7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of *Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery*, featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management — including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function — and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, an immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Implementing guidelines on acute maxillary sinusitis in general practice — a randomized controlled trial [^112339ym]. Family Practice (2007). High credibility.

Management of acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) is not optimal; antibiotics are often prescribed for viral sinusitis, which leads to many problems, including antimicrobial resistance. Guidelines have been proposed as a means to change professional practices.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to study whether a nationwide guidelines implementation programme has an effect on the management of AMS in primary care.

- **Methods**: A multi-centre randomized controlled trial was conducted in 30 health centres (HCs) covering a population of 819,777 people from 1998 to 2002. The participating HCs were randomized to implement guidelines either according to a problem-based learning (PBL) or an academic detailing (AD) method facilitated by local GPs. Data were gathered during one week in November in all study years and also from external control HCs in 2002. The main outcome measure was compliance with the key points of AMS management in national care guidelines.

- **Results**: Implementation of guidelines produced minor changes towards the recommended practices in the management of AMS. Use of the first-line drug amoxicillin increased slightly (from 39% to 48% in AD centres and from 33% to 45% in PBL centres, controls 40%). The proportion of courses of antibiotics with recommended duration increased in MIKSTRA study centres (from 34% to 40% in AD centres and from 32% to 47% in PBL centres, controls 43%).

- **Conclusions**: A nationwide guidelines implementation project produced modest changes in the management of AMS. There were no significant differences between AD and PBL education.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests, including nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology in creating this guideline.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented by an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Specific issues considered**:
	1. Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children.
	2. Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, non-antibiotic regimens.
	3. The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children under six years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number, and the results are somewhat conflicting.

This article reviews the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and also summarizes the guidelines.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients with three or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after three to five days of symptoms, or seven or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including the use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114uHCQS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Several non-placebo-controlled randomized studies compared parallel, short-term antibiotic regimens in cases of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Fan et al. found that patients in a higher dose clarithromycin group demonstrated better nasal symptom scores, as well as improved Lund-Kennedy and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) scores at weeks 2 and 4, compared with both their baseline values and the low dose clarithromycin group. Namyslowski et al. showed improvement in CRS or acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS) symptoms at days 3 to 5 in patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to those taking cefuroxime. However, by days 15 to 18, there was no significant difference in clinical cure rates or bacteriologic eradication between the groups. The other five studies showed no difference in symptomatology outcomes between head-to-head comparisons of various antibiotics given in short courses. The absence of a placebo arm in these studies precludes substantive conclusions, and only a minority of these studies evaluated outcomes after one month.

There have been a number of studies on the efficacy of long-term macrolide and non-macrolide antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Several phase 4 studies have demonstrated symptom improvement, but each study has methodological flaws limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. These studies have been reviewed in detail elsewhere.

At the time of writing, there have been only two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) of long-term antibiotic therapy for CRS. Both studies evaluated a 12-week treatment with macrolides: Wallwork et al. evaluated roxithromycin at 150 mg daily in 64 patients.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^113AApZc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). High credibility.

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis and, if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies, and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2,058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics.

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^116g1zbi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past two decades, with ABRS accounting for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995. It ranked as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection; however, bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms lasting at least 10 days. Important factors to consider when selecting an antibiotic regimen for ABRS include the severity of disease, rate of disease progression, earlier antibiotic treatment, regional resistance rates, and, in children, age under five years and attendance at day care centers.

The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny due to emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, are no longer reliable. Newer antibiotics may be required to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### Amoxicillin [^115C7WoB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing for adult and pediatric patients > 3 months of age**: Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy. Dosing for infections caused by bacteria that are intermediate in their susceptibility to amoxicillin should follow the recommendations for severe infections. The children's dosage is intended for individuals whose weight is less than 40 kg. Children weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to the adult recommendations.

- **Dosing in neonates and infants aged ≤ 12 weeks (≤ 3 months)**: Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended upper dose of amoxicillin is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Unpyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the high utilization of antibiotic treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), there is a paucity of high-quality prospective studies. For treatment of CRS with antibiotics for less than 3 weeks, the majority of studies focus on the treatment of acute exacerbations of CRS (AECRS). While there are several non-placebo controlled studies and two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) on the role of prolonged treatment with macrolide antibiotics for CRS, there are few studies evaluating non-macrolide therapies. Herein, we will review the available evidence.

For the purposes of this discussion, three to four weeks or less is considered a 'short-term' antibiotic course and greater than three to four weeks is considered a 'long-term' course. In general practice, the duration of courses is usually shorter than 10 days. The aim of short-term antibiotic courses is to treat suspected acute bacterial infections causing exacerbations.

There have been only two small placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of short-term antibiotics in CRS, excluding studies focused only on AECRS. Sabino et al. studied patients with acute exacerbations of CRS with or without polyps and found that following a two-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11), both groups exhibited overall improvement on day 14 compared to day 0 (p < 0.01). Van Zele conducted a three-arm study comparing a 20-day course of doxycycline, oral methylprednisolone, and placebo in 47 patients with CRSwNP (either after surgery or with grade 3).

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: Continuing challenges and current management [^112SaKn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. Although the most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral, many patients still receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits significantly impact healthcare costs and contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens. This reflects the challenges in differentiating viral from bacterial disease.

Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, which is the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not suitable for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis is crucial to identify patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected based on local resistance patterns, ensuring their spectrum of activity covers common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines serve to aid practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains regarding the disparity of guideline recommendations as well as some recommendations being outdated. This review presents three illustrative case studies designed to provide some clarity with regard to these guidelines.

- **Case 1**: A typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous two weeks.

- **Case 2**: A more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy, ultimately requiring referral to an otolaryngologist.

- **Case 3**: An atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan.

It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide some helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Current management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the role of moxifloxacin [^1127DAUT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are common among adults and are associated with a significant amount of morbidity. The symptoms of rhinosinusitis include nasal drainage, congestion, and sinus pressure. A bacterial sinus infection is more likely if these symptoms worsen after 5–7 days or do not improve after 10–14 days.

The majority of bacterial episodes have been associated with *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae*. In the era of increasing resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides, treatment guidelines have been formulated worldwide to assist clinicians in selecting antibacterials. According to one model, the following antibacterials are most likely to provide desired outcomes (90%-92% predicted clinical efficacy) for adults: respiratory fluoroquinolones (i.e. moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin), ceftriaxone, and high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g of amoxicillin/day and 250 mg of clavulanate/day).

Although the role of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of this condition is evolving, fluoroquinolones are often recommended as second-line therapy or as first-line therapy for selected patients (e.g. those who received antibacterials in the previous 4–6 weeks or adults with moderate-to-severe disease).

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: Background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.

- **Diagnosis**: Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have a bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.

- **Imaging**: Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases.

- **Management**: Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms — especially those with unilateral facial pain — regardless of the duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens should be selected.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^116sL2Da]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy initiation, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend reserving antibiotics for patients with rhinosinusitis who present with fever, facial pain, and purulent nasal drainage persisting for 7–10 days. This recommendation also applies to patients showing improvement followed by worsening of symptoms (double-sickening) or experiencing severe symptoms lasting ≥ 3 days.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. The diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

### Antibiotic recommendations for acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis: Conundrum no more [^111b1Y38]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

There has been a substantial change in the prevalence and microbiologic characteristics of cases of acute otitis media due to the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Trends in nasopharyngeal colonization and the microbiology of acute otitis media support a change in the recommendation for antibiotic management of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis in children.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose, short-course regimen of levofloxacin, a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study was conducted. This study involved 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis, comparing levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

- **Clinical success rates**: In the microbiologically evaluable population, clinical success rates (defined as complete or partial resolution of pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to the extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary) were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit. The 95% confidence interval was [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg.

- **Rates of clinical success by pathogen**: In the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, comparable results were observed for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.

### No "one-size-fits all": Chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^114TZTYt]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

Sinusitis, both acute and chronic, is a prevalent infection in primary care, leading to nearly 30 million diagnoses annually and accounting for over 10% of antibiotic-related visits. Despite national guidelines advocating for prudent antibiotic use, management practices vary significantly, emphasizing sinusitis as a critical target for antimicrobial stewardship in optimizing outpatient prescribing.

International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) encounter coding is now foundational for outpatient stewardship metrics that identify suboptimal outpatient antibiotic use. Although several studies have illustrated the utility of the antibiotic prescribing rate (APR) as a billing data-based antibiotic stewardship metric, few have evaluated its value for diagnoses such as sinusitis, where antibiotics are situationally indicated. We assessed the impact of different ICD-10 definitions on outpatient sinusitis APR to characterize its use and utility as a stewardship metric for these diagnoses.

### Trends and frequencies of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis outpatient visits in adults [^117JwWGC]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze the trends and frequency in which recommended first-line therapy — amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate — was prescribed for acute sinusitis based on Otolaryngology and other gold standard guidelines. The study also aimed to analyze differences in prescription behaviors of otolaryngologists compared with non-otolaryngologists for outpatient adult acute sinusitis visits.

Weighted patient data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were analyzed to calculate visit rates and trends of antibiotic prescriptions for adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis from 2007 to 2019. Visits with multiple prescribed antibiotics or concomitant diagnoses requiring antibiotics were excluded. Each visit was classified based on the type of antibiotic prescribed.

Acute sinusitis was diagnosed in 0.63% of all outpatient visits from 2007 to 2019 (95% confidence interval: 0.56%-0.71%). Amoxicillin had the greatest increase in prescription frequency (13.4%), whereas macrolides had the largest decrease in prescription frequency (13.9%). Among adult acute sinusitis outpatient visits in which antibiotics were prescribed, recommended first-line antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin alone was used in 40.4% of visits. The most common antibiotic prescribed at otolaryngologist visits was amoxicillin-clavulanate (20.5%), while macrolides were the most common at non-otolaryngologist visits (26.0%). A greater proportion of otolaryngologist visits resulted in no antibiotics being prescribed for acute sinusitis (36.8% vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001).

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they are responsible for billions of dollars in health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of the two conditions is identical. In the majority of children with each condition, a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes them to the development of the acute bacterial complication. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infection predisposes children to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires performance of tympanocentesis in the former and sinus aspiration in the latter. The identification of a virus from the nasopharynx in either case does not obviate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

This executive summary discusses the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis", which has been published as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. To facilitate the implementation of the guideline recommendations, this article highlights the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. Fourteen developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management (including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function), and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy.

Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify the management of rhinosinusitis, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, an immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is necessary due to new clinical trials, recent systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

- **Methods**: This summary outlines the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition). This manual summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery and infectious diseases.

### Moxifloxacin vs amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of acute sinusitis [^116gtXFD]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin with that of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults.

- **Materials and methods**: Five hundred seventy-five patients from Latin American countries were randomized to receive oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 7 days, or oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 500/125 mg 3 times daily for 10 days, in a prospective, open study.

- **Results**: At the test-of-cure visit (7–14 days after the end of therapy), the clinical success rate in the moxifloxacin group was 93.4%, similar to that in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group (92.7%). Documented bacteriological eradication plus presumed eradication rates in the moxifloxacin (96.5%) and the amoxicillin/clavulanate (96.7%) groups were also similar. Drug-related adverse events were recorded in 32.2% of patients in the moxifloxacin group and 29.7% in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group. Patient discontinuation in the trial due to adverse events occurred for 10 patients in the moxifloxacin group and 6 in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, in terms of clinical and bacteriological response, moxifloxacin was equivalent to amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis [^115JMaDZ]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments for acute sinusitis as they are used in community pediatric practice. While antimicrobial treatment for children with acute sinusitis is commonly used, its significant clinical benefit remains unclear.

Methods involved a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in three community pediatric practices in St. Louis, Missouri. A total of 188 patients, aged 1 to 18 years, with 10 to 28 days of persistent sinus symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of acute sinusitis, were randomized to receive 14 days of amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/day in 3 daily doses), amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/day in 2 daily doses), or placebo. The change in sinus symptoms was assessed both by a quantitative symptom score (the S5 score) and subjectively by the parent. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects of treatment and recurrence or relapse of sinus symptoms. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews over a 2-month period.

Results showed that, of the 161 patients included in the analysis, 58 received amoxicillin, 48 received amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 55 received placebo. Day 14 improvement rates were 79%, 81%, and 79%, respectively. There were no differences in the 14-day change in S5 score among treatment groups. The rates of adverse events were 19% for amoxicillin, 11% for amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 10% for placebo. The rates of relapse were 12% for amoxicillin, 13% for amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 13% for placebo. The rates of recurrence were 9% for amoxicillin, 13% for amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 13% for placebo.

### Telithromycin new product overview [^112vmfx6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs), including community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis, significantly contribute to healthcare costs in the United States. Although many prescriptions for antibiotics are written each year for the treatment of CARTIs, most are prescribed on an empiric basis. Concerns about the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the changing pattern of pathogens isolated from subjects with CARTIs have raised questions about the empiric treatment paradigm.

When choosing appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CARTIs, physicians must consider not only the spectrum of activity of antibiotics but also the potential risk of resistance. Telithromycin is the first member of the ketolide class, a new family of antimicrobials structurally related to the macrolides, to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CARTIs. The spectrum of activity of telithromycin includes common typical and atypical causative pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Clinical trials have shown that telithromycin is as effective as traditionally used antimicrobial agents in the treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112tjjJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS), and there is some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in treating a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials assessing antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, reflecting both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS.

This article reviews the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence and understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. The focus will primarily be on diffuse primary CRS in adults, but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will also be discussed. This review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis. CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolution…

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: Advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [^112WnXrG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Concerning the medical management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, particularly regarding antibiotic therapy initiation, the ACP/CDC 2016 guidelines recommend reserving antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days. Antibiotic treatment is also advised for those experiencing the onset of severe symptoms, such as a high fever (greater than 39°C), purulent nasal discharge, or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days. Additionally, antibiotics are recommended if there is a worsening of symptoms following a typical viral illness lasting 5 days that was initially improving, a situation often referred to as "double sickening".
