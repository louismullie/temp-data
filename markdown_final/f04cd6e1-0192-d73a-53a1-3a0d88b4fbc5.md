## Question

In a patient with HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer who is at a chemotherapy decision point, how should TROPION-Breast01 influence choosing Dato-DXd versus standard single-agent chemotherapy (ICC)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how TROPION-Breast01 should influence the choice between datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) and standard single-agent chemotherapy (investigator's choice chemotherapy, ICC) in HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer at a chemotherapy decision point. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and where this fits in the treatment sequence. Then, I should verify the trial design and endpoints. Next, I will examine efficacy outcomes, followed by safety and tolerability. After that, I need to check guideline alignment and regulatory status. I will then consider patient selection and practical management, including ocular and oral toxicities. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note limitations and uncertainties, especially around overall survival and prior ADC exposure.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and where Dato-DXd fits in the treatment pathway. In HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer, patients typically receive endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the first line, and chemotherapy is reserved after endocrine resistance or when endocrine therapy is unsuitable. TROPION-Breast01 enrolled patients who had progressed on endocrine therapy, were deemed unsuitable for further endocrine therapy, and had received 1–2 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, which places Dato-DXd as a second- or third-line chemotherapy alternative in this population [^d7f45955] [^e7c1f7ca].

> Wait, let me verify the trial design and endpoints before drawing conclusions. TROPION-Breast01 was a global, phase 3, open-label, randomized study of 732 patients comparing Dato-DXd 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks versus ICC (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine), with dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review and overall survival. Stratification factors included prior lines of chemotherapy, prior CDK4/6 inhibitor use, and geography, and the analysis plan allocated alpha to control type I error across the dual primaries [^d7f45955] [^379c6274].

> I will now examine efficacy. Dato-DXd significantly improved median PFS to 6.9 months versus 4.9 months with ICC, corresponding to a 37% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52–0.76; P < 0.0001), and this benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups including prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure, prior taxane/anthracycline exposure, age, region, and ECOG performance status. Objective response rate was also higher with Dato-DXd at 36.4% versus 22.9% with ICC, and time to first subsequent therapy and PFS2 were delayed, suggesting benefits beyond first progression [^d7f45955] [^336d2036].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about survival. I initially thought there was a positive OS signal, but wait, I should double-check the maturity and final analysis. The initial readout showed a non-significant OS trend favoring Dato-DXd (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.62–1.14), and the FDA approval summary later reported that OS did not improve at final analysis (median OS 18.6 vs 18.3 months; HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.83–1.22), so there is no proven OS benefit at this time, which tempers enthusiasm despite the clear PFS advantage [^e7c1f7ca] [^d7f45955].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability carefully. Dato-DXd had substantially fewer grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events than ICC (20.8% vs 44.7%), with less neutropenia and less febrile neutropenia, and fewer dose reductions and interruptions. However, Dato-DXd has a distinct toxicity profile with frequent but mostly low-grade stomatitis and ocular surface events, and a low but real risk of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, which requires vigilance and structured management plans [^d7f45955] [^6f0e676c] [^1ca6ff99].

> I need to ensure this aligns with guidelines and regulatory status. The FDA approved Dato-DXd for HR+/HER2− unresectable or metastatic breast cancer after prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy, reflecting the TROPION-Breast01 population and the PFS benefit. NCCN includes Dato-DXd as an option in the second- or subsequent-line chemotherapy setting, while noting the OS endpoint was not met and that prior ADC exposure was not studied, so sequencing remains uncertain. ASCO guidance supports sequential single-agent chemotherapy in endocrine-refractory HR+/HER2− disease, and Dato-DXd now joins the list of reasonable single agents in this space [^e7c1f7ca] [^77120569] [^1adaec5b].

> Let me consider patient selection and practical management. Dato-DXd is appropriate for patients with measurable disease after 1–2 prior chemotherapies in the metastatic setting who are not candidates for further endocrine therapy. Patients with clinically significant corneal disease or active ILD should generally avoid Dato-DXd, and baseline and periodic ophthalmologic exams are recommended. For stomatitis prophylaxis, steroid-containing mouthwash and oral care protocols are advised, and for ocular surface events, frequent lubricating drops and contact lens avoidance are standard. I should confirm that patients understand the hair-loss risk, which is moderate and often manifests as thinning rather than complete alopecia, and counsel on infusion-related reaction prophylaxis with antihistamine and acetaminophen [^ead97f1f] [^6ba5800a] [^e4c12fc2] [^e1d99844].

> But wait, what if the patient already had an ADC, or is HER2-low and might benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan instead. I should double-check sequencing guidance. T-DXd is preferred for HER2-low disease after at least one chemotherapy in metastatic disease, whereas SG is generally considered after two prior chemotherapies, and TROPION-Breast01 excluded prior TROP2- or topoisomerase I–targeted ADCs, so the activity of Dato-DXd after SG or T-DXd is unknown. Thus, if the patient is HER2-low and has not had T-DXd, T-DXd may be prioritized, and if already exposed to SG, Dato-DXd could still be considered given non-overlapping antibody targets, though data are limited and cross-resistance remains a theoretical concern [^23c1f2b2] [^77120569] [^d7f45955].

> I should also weigh disease burden and symptoms. For patients needing rapid disease control due to symptomatic visceral disease or imminent organ compromise, combination chemotherapy may still be reasonable per guidelines, whereas for most patients with indolent or asymptomatic disease, sequential single agents like Dato-DXd are appropriate. The PFS advantage of Dato-DXd is clinically meaningful in this context, and the better tolerability profile can preserve quality of life compared with traditional cytotoxics [^1adaec5b] [^33c0272e] [^d7f45955].

> Let me synthesize a recommendation. For HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer at a chemotherapy decision point after 1–2 prior chemotherapies and progression or unsuitability for further endocrine therapy, Dato-DXd should be strongly considered as a preferred single-agent option over ICC based on a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS improvement, higher response rate, and a more favorable tolerability profile, acknowledging that OS was not improved and that prior ADC exposure was not studied. If the tumor is HER2-low and T-DXd has not been used, T-DXd may be prioritized, and if SG has already been used, Dato-DXd remains a reasonable next-line option with appropriate monitoring for stomatitis, ocular events, and ILD [^d7f45955] [^e7c1f7ca] [^77120569] [^23c1f2b2].

> Finally, I should confirm key limitations and uncertainties. OS did not improve in the final analysis, so the magnitude of clinical benefit is primarily in disease control and quality-of-life–sparing toxicity rather than survival. Prior ADC exposure was an exclusion, so optimal sequencing after SG or T-DXd is uncertain. And while TROP2 expression is biologically plausible, routine TROP2 testing is not recommended to select patients, so tissue biomarker-driven selection is not currently standard. Shared decision-making should incorporate these points, patient preferences, and comorbidities, with proactive supportive care plans for oral and ocular toxicities [^e7c1f7ca] [^77120569] [^7eb08d09].

TROPION-Breast01 shows that **Dato-DXd improves median PFS to 6.9 months** (vs 4.9 months with ICC; HR 0.63) [^d7f45955] and **reduces grade ≥ 3 adverse events to 20.8%** (vs 44.7% with ICC) [^d7f45955], establishing it as a new standard option for HR+/HER2− mBC after endocrine therapy and 1–2 prior chemotherapies [^e7c1f7ca]. Dato-DXd is **FDA-approved** for this indication [^9500a8da], and NCCN recommends it as a reasonable alternative to single-agent chemotherapy in this setting [^77120569]. Key toxicities (stomatitis, ocular events, ILD) are manageable with prophylaxis and monitoring [^6ba5800a] [^e4c12fc2], and OS was not significantly improved in the final analysis [^e7c1f7ca], so counseling should reflect this limitation [^77120569].

## Clinical trial design and patient population

- **Design**: Phase 3, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial [^d7f45955].
- **Population**: 732 patients with HR+/HER2− mBC, progression after endocrine therapy, 1–2 prior chemotherapies [^d7f45955].
- **Intervention**: Dato-DXd 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks vs ICC (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) [^d7f45955].
- **Primary endpoint**: PFS by BICR; OS was a dual primary endpoint [^d7f45955].

---

## Efficacy outcomes

| **Endpoint** | **Dato-dxd** | **Icc** | **Hazard ratio (hr)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Median PFS (BICR) | 6.9 months | 4.9 months | 0.63 (95% CI 0.52–0.76; P < 0.0001) [^d7f45955] |
| Median OS (final analysis) | 18.6 months | 18.3 months | 1.01 (95% CI 0.83–1.22) [^e7c1f7ca] |
| Objective response rate (ORR) | 36.4% | 22.9% | 1.95 (95% CI 1.41–2.71) [^ccee0b99] |
| Disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks | 79.5% | 69.8% | Not specified [^notfound] |

---

PFS was significantly improved with Dato-DXd, while **OS was not significantly different** at final analysis [^e7c1f7ca].

---

## Safety profile

- **Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs**: 20.8% with Dato-DXd vs 44.7% with ICC [^d7f45955].
- **Most common TRAEs**: Stomatitis (50%), nausea (51.1%), alopecia (36.4%), fatigue (27.8%) [^1ca6ff99].
- **Grade ≥ 3 stomatitis**: 6.4% with Dato-DXd [^d7f45955].
- **Ocular events**: Dry eye and keratitis were common but mostly grade 1–2; grade 3 events occurred in 0.8% [^1ca6ff99].
- **Interstitial lung disease (ILD)**: Adjudicated drug-related ILD occurred in 3.3% (mostly grade 1–2; one grade 5 event) [^1ca6ff99].

---

## Comparison with standard chemotherapy

Dato-DXd offers **superior efficacy** (higher PFS and ORR) and a **better tolerability profile** (lower grade ≥ 3 TRAEs and fewer dose reductions/interruptions) than ICC [^d7f45955] [^6f0e676c]. These advantages support its use as an alternative to traditional chemotherapy in this setting [^e7c1f7ca].

---

## Regulatory approval and guideline recommendations

The **FDA approved Dato-DXd** for HR+/HER2− mBC after prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy based on TROPION-Breast01 [^e7c1f7ca]. NCCN includes Dato-DXd as a reasonable alternative to single-agent chemotherapy in this population [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Suitable for patients with HR+/HER2− mBC who have progressed after endocrine therapy and 1–2 prior chemotherapies [^d7f45955].
- **Monitoring**: Regular ophthalmologic exams and vigilance for ILD are recommended [^6ba5800a].
- **Prophylaxis**: Steroid-containing mouthwash and antiemetics can mitigate stomatitis and nausea [^6ba5800a] [^e4c12fc2].
- **Limitations**: OS was not improved; prior ADC exposure was not studied, so sequencing remains uncertain [^e7c1f7ca] [^77120569].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

TROPION-Breast01 demonstrates that **Dato-DXd improves PFS and has a more favorable safety profile** than standard chemotherapy in HR+/HER2− mBC after endocrine therapy and 1–2 prior chemotherapies [^d7f45955]. Given FDA approval and guideline support, Dato-DXd is a new standard option in this setting, with counseling on OS limitations and proactive management of stomatitis, ocular events, and ILD [^e7c1f7ca] [^77120569].

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Design and Patients

The TROPION-PanTumor01 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) is an ongoing phase I, two-part, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose study of Dato-DXd in patients with advanced solid tumors including HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC conducted at 17 sites in Japan and the United States (Data Supplement, Fig S1, online only). The study comprises a dose-escalation portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) and an ongoing dose-expansion portion to assess safety and tolerability. The full study design, dose escalation, and results for the non–small cell lung cancer cohort have been reported previously.

Enrolled patients were 18 years and older with HR+/HER2– BC or TNBC with tumors that had relapsed or progressed after local standard treatments or for which no standard treatment was available. Patient disposition is described in the Data Supplement.

Study Treatment

Intravenous Dato-DXd was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Patients received Dato-DXd until unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease (PD), or withdrawal of consent. During the study, 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks was determined to have the optimal benefit-risk ratio and was declared the RDE. In the dose-expansion portion, patients received the RDE (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks).

METHODS

Study Design and Patient Eligibility Criteria

TROPION-Breast01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) was a global, phase 3, open-label, randomized study. Full details of its design have been published previously, and additional details are provided in the Protocol (online only). Key eligibility criteria were as follows: age ≥ 18 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, inoperable or metastatic HR+/HER2– breast cancer (per ASCO–College of American Pathologists guidelines; HER2– defined as IHC 0, 1+ or 2+/ISH–), and received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy in the inoperable/metastatic setting. Patients who had experienced progression on endocrine therapy and for whom further endocrine therapy was unsuitable (per investigator assessment) were eligible for enrollment in the final amended protocol although the original protocol allowed endocrine therapy–naïve patients to enroll if endocrine therapy was unsuitable. Previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor(s) was not required because of geographic variations in availability, but there was a cap applied to patients who had NOT received previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Previous treatment involving a chemotherapeutic agent targeting topoisomerase I (including ADCs) and previous TROP2-targeted therapy were not permitted. Patients with clinically stable brain metastases were eligible.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous Dato-DXd 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or single-agent ICC (eribulin, 1.4 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8, once every 3 weeks; capecitabine, 1,000 or 1,250 mg/m² orally twice daily on days 1–14, once every 3 weeks; vinorelbine, 25 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8, once every 3 weeks; or gemcitabine, 1,000 mg/m² intravenously on days 1 and 8, once every 3 weeks). Random assignment was centrally performed using an Interactive Response Technology system and stratified by the number of previous lines of chemotherapy (1 v 2), geographic region (United States/Canada/Europe v other geographic regions of the world), and previous use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes v no).

Treatment continued until investigator-assessed radiologic progression (per RECIST v1.1), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or until any other predefined protocol discontinuation criterion was met.

Although their payloads have similar mechanisms of action, sacituzumab govitecan and Dato-DXd have demonstrated distinct AE profiles in similar but not identical patient populations. The mode of action of Dato-DXd may contribute to its safety profile compared with other TROP2-directed ADCs. The selective payload delivery of Dato-DXd, which is enabled by the selectively cleavable plasma-stable linker that releases DXd after proteolytic processing by tumor cell–enriched lysosomal enzymes, reduces systemic exposure while achieving a sustained response, resulting in an improved benefit-risk profile. This may account for the comparatively low incidences of neutropenia and diarrhea in this study compared with sacituzumab govitecan.

Study limitations include the relatively small number of patients in each cohort and the single-arm open-label study design without a comparator. However, the findings from this study provide rationale for further investigation of Dato-DXd as a treatment option for advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, which is ongoing in several phase III trials. In patients with advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2– BC, Dato-DXd is being compared with single-agent chemotherapy as second- or third-line therapy in the randomized, phase III TROPION-Breast01 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), which recently met its primary PFS end point (median PFS 6.9 months and confirmed ORR 36.4%). In patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC, Dato-DXd is being investigated as first-line therapy compared with chemotherapy in the randomized, phase III TROPION-Breast02 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). Additional studies investigating Dato-DXd in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab in patients with TNBC are also underway, including the phase III TROPION-Breast03 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), TROPION-Breast04 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), TROPION-Breast05 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), and the BEGONIA phase Ib/II trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). -

Notable differences in dosing schedule between ADCs may affect physician and patient preferences for specific ADCs; Dato-DXd requires less frequent administration (once every 3 weeks) than sacituzumab govitecan (day 1 and day 8 every 3 weeks). Further studies are required to understand the potential impact of specific properties of ADCs on safety and efficacy and to evaluate ADC sequencing. Real-world retrospective studies show that the preferred sequence of ADCs remains unclear, and prospective studies are underway evaluating optimal ADC sequencing.

The TROPION-Breast01 study had several potential limitations. First, there was a change in treatment landscape for endocrine-refractory HR+ metastatic breast cancer during the conduct of the study. Second, slightly more patients randomly assigned to the ICC arm than the Dato-DXd arm did not receive their allocated treatment, which is likely due to patient preference not to receive standard chemotherapy in an open-label study. Third, the use of prophylactic steroid-containing mouthwash was recommended but not mandated (because it is not globally available), and it was challenging to accurately assess the impact of mouthwash use on the prevention of stomatitis since the study was not designed to address this question.

Overall, Dato-DXd demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a favorable and manageable safety profile compared with ICC for a patient population with previously unmet need for more efficacious and less toxic therapies. Further phase 3 studies are now in progress evaluating Dato-DXd in other breast cancer settings, including early and metastatic TNBC, either as monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapy. - The results of TROPION-Breast01 support Dato-DXd as a potential new therapeutic option for patients with previously treated, inoperable or metastatic, HR+/HER2– breast cancer.

PURPOSE

The global, phase 3, open-label, randomized TROPION-Breast01 study assessed the trophoblast cell surface antigen 2–directed antibody-drug conjugate datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) in hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer.

METHODS

Adult patients with inoperable/metastatic HR+/HER2‒ breast cancer, who had disease progression on endocrine therapy, for whom endocrine therapy was unsuitable, and had received one to two previous lines of chemotherapy in the inoperable/metastatic setting, were randomly assigned 1:1 to Dato-DXd (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) or ICC (eribulin/vinorelbine/capecitabine/gemcitabine). Dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and overall survival (OS).

RESULTS

Patients were randomly assigned to Dato-DXd (n = 365) or ICC (n = 367). Dato-DXd significantly reduced the risk of progression or death versus ICC (PFS by BICR hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76]; P < .0001). Consistent PFS benefit was observed across subgroups. Although OS data were not mature, a trend favoring Dato-DXd was observed (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.14]). The rate of grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with Dato-DXd was lower than ICC (20.8% v 44.7%). The most common TRAEs (any grade; grade ≥ 3) were nausea (51.1%; 1.4%) and stomatitis (50%; 6.4%) with Dato-DXd and neutropenia (grouped term, 42.5%; 30.8%) with ICC.

CONCLUSION

Patients receiving Dato-DXd had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a favorable and manageable safety profile, compared with ICC. Results support Dato-DXd as a novel treatment option for patients with inoperable/metastatic HR+/HER2‒ breast cancer who have received one to two previous lines of chemotherapy in this setting.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan in advanced or metastatic HR + / HER2-and triple-negative breast cancer: results from the phase I TROPION-panTumor01 study [^4a58eee2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized antitrophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) monoclonal antibody linked to a potent, exatecan-derived topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a plasma-stable, selectively cleavable linker.

Patients and Methods

TROPION-PanTumor01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03401385) is a phase I, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study evaluating Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated solid tumors. The primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Dato-DXd. Secondary objectives included evaluation of antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics. Results from patients with advanced/metastatic hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer (BC) or triple-negative BC (TNBC) are reported.

Results

At data cutoff (July 22, 2022), 85 patients (HR+/HER2- BC = 41, and TNBC = 44) had received Dato-DXd. The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 26.8% (95% CI, 14.2 to 42.9) and 31.8% (95% CI, 18.6 to 47.6) for patients with HR+/HER2- BC and TNBC, respectively. The median duration of response was not evaluable in the HR+/HER2- BC cohort and 16.8 months in the TNBC cohort. The median progression-free survival in patients with HR+/HER2- BC and TNBC was 8.3 and 4.4 months, respectively. All-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; any grade, grade ≥ 3) were observed in 100% and 41.5% of patients with HR+/HER2- BC and 100% and 52.3% of patients with TNBC. Stomatitis was the most common TEAE (any grade, grade ≥ 3) in both HR+/HER2- BC (82.9%, 9.8%) and TNBC (72.7%, 11.4%) cohorts.

Conclusion

In patients with heavily pretreated advanced HR+/HER2- BC and TNBC, Dato-DXd demonstrated promising clinical activity and a manageable safety profile. Dato-DXd is currently being evaluated in phase III studies.

DISCUSSION

In this primary analysis, TROPION-Breast01 met its dual primary PFS end point; Dato-DXd reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 37% versus ICC in patients with inoperable or metastatic HR+/HER2– breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy in this setting (HR, 0.63; P < .0001 per BICR). Consistent PFS benefit was observed across prespecified subgroups, including previous therapies (taxanes/anthracyclines, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and endocrine therapy), geographic region, age, race, and ECOG performance status. PFS benefit was maintained over time, with 9-month PFS rates approximately double with Dato-DXd compared with ICC (37.5% vs 18.7%), and 12-month PFS rates of 25.5% vs 14.6%. For the dual primary end point of OS, a trend in improvement was observed with Dato-DXd versus ICC; however, OS data were immature at this DCO, and the study is continuing to the next planned analysis for OS. Of note, at DCO, almost 2.5 times the number of patients remained on treatment with Dato-DXd compared with ICC. ORR was superior with Dato-DXd (36.4%; two CRs) compared with ICC (22.9%; no CRs); duration of response and DCR at 12 weeks were also numerically improved with Dato-DXd versus ICC. Moreover, TFST, PFS2, and TSST were all delayed in the Dato-DXd arm, indicating that the benefits of Dato-DXd versus ICC extended beyond the first progression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

TROPION-PanTumor01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) is a phase I, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study evaluating Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated solid tumors. The primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Dato-DXd. Secondary objectives included evaluation of antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics. Results from patients with advanced/metastatic hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer (BC) or triple-negative BC (TNBC) are reported.

RESULTS

At data cutoff (July 22, 2022), 85 patients (HR+/HER2– BC = 41, and TNBC = 44) had received Dato-DXd. The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 26.8% (95% CI, 14.2 to 42.9) and 31.8% (95% CI, 18.6 to 47.6) for patients with HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, respectively. The median duration of response was not evaluable in the HR+/HER2– BC cohort and 16.8 months in the TNBC cohort. The median progression-free survival in patients with HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC was 8.3 and 4.4 months, respectively. All-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; any grade, grade ≥ 3) were observed in 100% and 41.5% of patients with HR+/HER2– BC and 100% and 52.3% of patients with TNBC. Stomatitis was the most common TEAE (any grade, grade ≥ 3) in both HR+/HER2– BC (82.9%, 9.8%) and TNBC (72.7%, 11.4%) cohorts.

CONCLUSION

In patients with heavily pretreated advanced HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, Dato-DXd demonstrated promising clinical activity and a manageable safety profile. Dato-DXd is currently being evaluated in phase III studies.

The efficacy of DATROWAY was evaluated in TROPION-Breast01 (NCT05104866), a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of 732 patients with unresectable or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative (IHC 0, IHC1+ or IHC2+/ISH-) breast cancer. Eligible patients must have progressed on and deemed not suitable for further endocrine therapy. Patients were required to have received 1 or 2 lines of prior chemotherapy in the unresectable or metastatic disease setting. Patients were excluded for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids, ongoing ILD/pneumonitis, clinically active brain metastases, or clinically significant corneal disease at screening. Patients were also excluded for ECOG performance status > 1. Randomization was stratified by previous lines of chemotherapy (one or two), prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (yes or no), and geographical region.

A total of 732 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either DATROWAY 6 mg/kg (N = 365) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (N = 367) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Single agent chemotherapy was determined by the investigator before randomization from one of the following choices: eribulin (60%), capecitabine (21%), vinorelbine (10%), or gemcitabine (9%).

### FDA approval summary: datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic, HR-positive, HER2-Negative breast cancer [^e7c1f7ca]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

On January 17, 2025, the FDA approved datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk (DATROWAY, Dato-DXd), a Trop-2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate, for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer who have received prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. Approval was based on results from TROPION-Breast01 (TB01), a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial comparing Dato-DXd to investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC). The trial was designed with dual primary endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and overall survival (OS). TB01 demonstrated a 2-month improvement in median PFS for Dato-DXd compared to ICC (6.9 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively; stratified hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.76; p < 0.0001). The OS endpoint was not met; at the final analysis (FA) of OS, the median OS was 18.6 months in the Dato-DXd arm and 18.3 months in the ICC arm (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.22). Although there was no OS improvement, Dato-DXd was also not associated with a clear trend toward potential detriment compared to ICC. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Dato-DXd were stomatitis, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, constipation, dry eye, keratitis, and vomiting. Overall, the favorable benefit-risk profile for Dato-DXd supported its approval for the intended indication.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with metastatic hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer are initially treated with endocrine therapy with/without other targeted therapies such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. - Until recently, for patients with endocrine-resistant disease or patients ineligible for endocrine therapy, single-agent chemotherapy was the standard of care. However, chemotherapy is associated with limited clinical benefit, and substantial toxicities that negatively affect the quality of life of patients. With the advent of novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies, a new treatment paradigm is emerging for the postendocrine therapy setting after chemotherapy with HER2-targeted ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-low disease - and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)–directed ADC sacituzumab govitecan for HER2-negative disease. - However, there remains an unmet need for novel treatment options to further improve efficacy and safety outcomes in this patient population.

TROP2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein broadly expressed in multiple solid tumors, including breast cancer. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a TROP2-directed ADC consisting of a humanized anti-TROP2 immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody attached to a highly potent topoisomerase I inhibitor payload via a plasma-stable, tumor-selective, cleavable linker. In the phase 1 TROPION-PanTumor01 study, Dato-DXd showed encouraging antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated HR+/HER2– breast cancer, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 27% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 85%. Dato-DXd has also shown promising antitumor activity in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in TROPION-PanTumor01, and several phase 3 studies in TNBC are ongoing. -

Here, we report the primary results from the phase 3 TROPION-Breast01 study, which evaluated Dato-DXd versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) in patients with inoperable or metastatic HR+/HER2– breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy in this setting.

DISCUSSION

In this first-in-human phase I study of Dato-DXd, encouraging antitumor activity and manageable safety profile were observed in patients with heavily pretreated advanced HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC.

Dato-DXd demonstrated clinical activity (confirmed ORR 26.8% [HR+/HER2– BC] and 31.8% [TNBC]), and responses were durable (DOR NE [HR+/HER2– BC] and 16.8 months [TNBC]). Although patient numbers were small, the higher ORR and longer median OS and PFS observed in the topo I–naïve TNBC subgroup compared with those in the overall TNBC population also suggest that tumors may start to develop resistance to topo I inhibition through previous exposure. Alternatively, with 11 of 14 ADC-pretreated patients having received sacituzumab govitecan, outcomes may be related to previous targeting of TROP2 in these patients. Overall, the topo I–naïve subgroup was moderately less pretreated, which could also contribute to the improved efficacy profile observed. Although no patients in the HR+/HER2– BC cohort received previous topo I inhibitor–based ADC therapy, patients with a ≥ 30% decrease in measurable tumor sum of the diameters had only 1–2 previous lines of chemotherapy, suggesting that increasing resistance to topo I inhibition may be partly due to the cumulative effect of previous treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Together, these results provide rationale for further evaluation of Dato-DXd in earlier lines of treatment for patients with HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC.

The safety profile of Dato-DXd in both BC cohorts was manageable, with low incidences of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, few dose modifications, and no drug-related deaths. While nausea was common, it was generally manageable with antiemetic prophylaxis (Data Supplement). Modest incidences of hematologic toxicities were observed, and few grade ≥ 3 events were reported.

Cataracts were observed in patients across both cohorts, with treatment-emergent grade 1 to 2 events reported in six (14.6%) and four (9.1%) patients in the HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC cohorts, respectively. While these incidences are notable, most events were not considered drug-related by the investigator, and known risk factors for cataract development were enriched in the study population on the basis of age, sex, and treatment history. - Development of cataracts and other ocular events continues to be monitored in ongoing trials of Dato-DXd.

Importantly, T-DXd has also shown impressive activity in HER2-low breast cancer, defined as a score of 1+ on immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis or as an IHC score of 2+ and negative results on in situ hybridization (ISH). More recently, it even showed relevant activity in HER2 ultra-low breast cancer (IHC 0 with faint staining in ≤ 10% of cells). The DESTINY-Breast04 trial was a landmark study demonstrating that T-DXd significantly improved PFS and OS in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer compared to chemotherapy. This trial included both hormone receptor (HR)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The results established T-DXd as the first targeted therapy for HER2-low disease, offering a new treatment paradigm for this population. Trials like DESTINY-Breast06 investigated the efficacy of T-DXd in HER2-ultra-low metastatic breast cancer and demonstrated that T-DXd significantly and meaningfully improved PFS to 13.2 months compared to 8.1 months with the physician's choice of chemotherapy (TPC) in patients with HR-positive, HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.

SG is the third ADC approved for breast cancer treatment and the first approved for treating TNBC based on the results from the ASCENT trial. It is also now approved for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (IHC 0, IHC 1 +, or IHC 2 + /ISH-) in patients who have previously received endocrine-based therapy and at least two prior systemic treatments based on results from the TROPiCS-02 trial. Both ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials demonstrated significant improvements in both PFS and OS in this challenging patient population, emphasizing SG's potential to address treatment-resistant breast cancers.

The phase III TROPION-Breast01 trial investigated Dato-DXd, the newest Trop-2-directed ADC recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have received 1 to 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. The trial demonstrated that Dato-DXd significantly improved median PFS, achieving 6.9 months compared to 4.9 months in the standard chemotherapy arm; however, it did not lead to an improvement in OS.

End Points and Assessments

The primary objective of dose escalation and expansion was to investigate the safety and tolerability of Dato-DXd. Secondary objectives for each portion were to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of Dato-DXd, total anti-TROP2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a (DXd payload); investigate the antitumor activity of Dato-DXd; and assess the incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) against Dato-DXd.

Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST version 1.1and included confirmed objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and time to response (TTR). Tumor response definitions are included in the Data Supplement.

Safety end points included adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), and AEs of special interest (AESIs). AEs were investigator-determined and graded (1 to 5) according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs version 5.0. AESIs consisted of grouped terms of predefined Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms. An independent interstitial lung disease (ILD) adjudication committee was responsible for reviewing all potential cases of ILD/pneumonitis to confirm the diagnosis and assess drug-relatedness. Toxicity management guidelines for ILD were introduced from the beginning of the study, with guidelines for other AESIs added to the protocol at later dates.

PK parameter calculations are included in the Data Supplement.

Statistical Analysis

The data cutoff date was July 22, 2022. The full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses, unless otherwise specified.

Patient disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, treatment exposure, TTR, ADA incidence, and AEs were summarized descriptively. ORR, DCR, and CBR were summarized along with two-sided 95% exact CIs using the Clopper-Pearson method. DOR, PFS, and OS were summarized and displayed using the Kaplan-Meier method; median time to event for these end points with two-sided 95% CIs was summarized using the Brookmeyer‐Crowley method.

The study TROPION-Breast01 was published by Aditya Bardia and colleagues in 2025 in the journal J Clin Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the trial question was: what is the role of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with HR+/HER2- unresectable or metastatic breast cancer? In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the population was: 732 patients (723 female, 9 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with previously treated HR+/HER2- unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. The key exclusion criteria were infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals; HBV or HCV infection; cardiac disease; any treatment containing a chemotherapeutic agent targeting topoisomerase 1 or TROP2-targeted therapy; hypersensitivity to datopotamab deruxtecan; hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies. In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the interventions were: n = 365 datopotamab deruxtecan (6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) n = 367 single-agent chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine based on the investigator's choice). In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median progression-free survival (6.9 months vs. 4.9 months; HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.92). In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time to first subsequent therapy (8.2 months vs. 5 months; HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.22) Significant increase in overall response rate (36.4% vs. 22.9%; OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.71). In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events. significant difference in grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (20.8% vs. 44.7%). In the TROPION-Breast01 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with previously treated HR+/HER2- unresectable or metastatic breast cancer, datopotamab deruxtecan was superior to single-agent chemotherapy with respect to median progression-free survival.

### Antibody-drug conjugates for treating early-stage breast cancer: current use, anticipated evolutions [^49ffc525]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The TROPION-Breast03 (NCT05629585) trial will help define the potential role of Dato-DXd and durvalumab in the treatment of patients with early-stage TNBC who do not experience pCR after neoadjuvant therapy. This randomized phase III study compares Dato-DXd ± durvalumab to investigator's choice of post-neoadjuvant therapy, with the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival. In parallel, the TROPION-Breast04 (NCT06112379) trial will evaluate whether neoadjuvant Dato-DXd combined with durvalumab, followed by adjuvant durvalumab, can offer improved efficacy compared to the standard pembrolizumab and a chemotherapy combination regimen as used in KN522. The study focuses on patients with previously untreated TNBC or HR-low breast cancer (defined as ER and/or progesterone receptor expression between 1% and < 10%, with neither receptor reaching ≥ 10%) and HER2-negative status.

While the combination of ADCs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) shows promise as a potential therapeutic approach, safety concerns remain due to the risk of overlapping toxicities. A meta-analysis of ADCs and ICI combination side effects was conducted and found that the safety profile of the ADC plus ICI is comparable to that of ADC monotherapy. However, it increases the risk of certain toxicities of special interest, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) (15.0% with T-DXd plus ICI vs. 11.5% with T-DXd alone), highlighting the need for careful monitoring.

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd)

Dato-DXd is an ADC comprising a topoisomerase I inhibitor a derivative of exatecan, and a linker (deruxtecan) to a monoclonal antibody (datopotamab) directed to trophoblast cell-­surface antigen 2 (TROP2), a protein that is broadly expressed in several types of solid tumors. Dato-DXd has shown promising efficacy in multiple solid tumors as demonstrated in the phase I TROPION-PanTumor01 trial. Based on the trial results, mNSCLC and HR+/HER2− mBC were further studied in phase III, randomized, open-label studies. Dato-DXd is the first ADC to demonstrate statistically significant improvement in PFS over docetaxel in patients with previously treated locally advanced/mNSCLC (Table 1).TROPION-Lung01 studied a broad patient population, including those with squamous or nonsquamous (NSQ) NSCLC with and without actionable genomic alterations, but the observed patient benefit was driven by the NSQ population. A pooled analysis of 117 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-­positive mNSCLC from TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-­Lung05 also demonstrated encouraging clinical activity with Dato-DXd. The remainder of this review will focus on the data from the 453 patients with NSQ mNSCLC in the TROPION-­Lung01 trial (Table 1).TROPION-Breast01 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in PFS with Dato-DXd over the investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) for patients with inoperable or metastatic HR+/HER2− BC previously treated with ET and 1–2 prior lines of chemotherapy (N = 732). Dato-DXd received FDA approval for HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in patients who have received prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease based on the TROPION-­Breast01 results and continues to be studied in several phase III trials across BC and LC.

INTRODUCTION

Hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer (BC) and triple-negative BC (TNBC) together represent approximately 80% of BC cases in the United States. Although recent advances in therapy have improved outcomes, the 5-year survival rate in patients with metastatic disease remains poor (34% and 13% for HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, respectively).

For patients with metastatic HR+/HER2– BC, the recommended standard of care is endocrine therapy (ET) plus a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor. - However, approximately 10% of patients with HR+ metastatic BC show primary resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, and secondary or acquired endocrine resistance is inevitable in most patients. - For patients with TNBC, chemotherapy remains the standard treatment option for advanced/metastatic disease.- For patients who have disease progression or are refractory to standard therapies, treatment options remain limited.-

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) aim to address this unmet need by potentially reducing systemic toxicity and improving response rates through selective payload delivery to tumors. Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is a transmembrane protein sporadically expressed in healthy tissue but broadly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, - making TROP2 an attractive tumor-associated antigen for treatment of these BC subtypes. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a TROP2-directed ADC comprising a humanized anti-TROP2 immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a highly potent topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor, a derivative of exatecan, via a plasma-stable, tumor-selective, tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker, resulting in reduced systemic exposure and off-target adverse effects. Internalization of Dato-DXd into TROP2-expressing cells leads to death of target tumor cells and bystander killing of neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment.

Efficacy and safety results of Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC are presented from the phase I TROPION-PanTumor01 trial.

Dato-DXd is an investigational humanized trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed monoclonal antibody–drug (topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugate. It is being studied in several indications across solid tumors and has demonstrated promising clinical trial results in the lung and breast cancer settings. In the TROPION-Lung01 phase III trial (NCT04656652), Dato-DXd improved median progression-free survival (mPFS) over docetaxel in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) (4.4 vs 3.7 months). Similarly, Dato-DXd showed clinical benefit in mNSCLC patients with actionable genomic alterations (e.g. EGFRm) in the phase II TROPION-Lung05 clinical trial (NCT04484142). In the TROPION-Breast01 phase III trial (NCT05104866), Dato-DXd demonstrated statistically significant improvement in mPFS (6.9 vs. 4.9 months) over the investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative metastatic breast cancer (HR + /HER2- mBC). Dato-DXd had a manageable safety profile in both trials with no new safety signals observed. The incidence rate of all-grade stomatitis was 55.2% in TROPION-Lung01 patients, 66% in TROPION-Lung05 patients, and 55.6% in TROPION-Breast01 patients. In TROPION-Breast01 patients, the median time to onset of stomatitis was 22 days and the median time to resolution was 36.5 days. Grade ≥ 3 stomatitis was less common (6% and 7% in lung and breast cancer patients, respectively), and stomatitis resulted in a low rate (< 1%) of Dato-DXd discontinuation in both trials (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0).

21In the phase 1 TROPION-PanTumor01 study, Dato-DXd showed encouraging antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated HR+/HER2– breast cancer, with an objective response rate of 27% and a disease control rate of 85%. 22Dato-DXd has also shown promising antitumor activity in patients with triple-negative breast cancer in TROPION-PanTumor01, 22and several phase 3 studies in TNBC are ongoing. 23–27. For the dual primary end point of OS, a trend in improvement was observed with Dato-DXd versus ICC; however, OS data were immature at this DCO, and the study is continuing to the next planned analysis for OS. Of note, at DCO, almost 2. 5 times the number of patients remained on treatment with Dato-DXd compared with ICC. ORR was superior with Dato-DXd compared with ICC; duration of response and DCR at 12 weeks were also numerically improved with Dato-DXd versus ICC.

Moreover, TFST, PFS2, and TSST were all delayed in the Dato-DXd arm, indicating that the benefits of Dato-DXd versus ICC extended beyond the first progression. 32The rate of adjudicated drug-related ILD was low and consistent with rates reported previously with Dato-DXd in breast cancer. 22 1, 2The median PFS of 4. 9 months in the ICC arm of TROPION-Breast01 was generally consistent with previous reports for single-agent chemotherapy. 5, 6The approvals of the ADCs, trastuzumab deruxtecan 9, 10and sacituzumab govitecan, 14, 15were based on studies involving patient populations with differences in HER2 expression levels and number of previous lines of chemotherapy compared with TROPION-Breast01. 37and < 10% with sacituzumab govitecan in TROPiCS-02. 17 23-27The results of TROPION-Breast01 support Dato-DXd as a potential new therapeutic option for patients with previously treated, inoperable or metastatic, HR+/HER2– breast cancer.

Introduction

Trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 (TROP2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions in various signaling pathways associated with carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in many cancers, including breast cancer. There are now several TROP2-targeted therapies in development, including TROP2-targeted antibody–drug conjugates (ADC), including sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd, DS-1062a). SG was recently approved by the FDA for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor–positive (HR +) breast cancer, and urothelial cancer and is currently being assessed in other tumor types. Dato-DXd is currently being evaluated in several tumor types, including metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HR + breast cancer, and TNBC. In the TROPION-PanTumor01 trial, the objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review was 26.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.2%–42.9%] and 31.8% (95% CI, 18.6%–47.6%) for patients with HR + /HER2 − breast cancer and TNBC, respectively. In the phase III trial TROPION-Breast01, Dato-DXd significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with the investigator's choice of chemotherapy (6.9 vs. 4.9 months; HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52–0.76; P < 0.0001) in 732 patients with inoperable or metastatic HR + breast cancer who had received previous chemotherapy.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics

Between October 18, 2021, and December 26, 2022, a total of 1,003 patients were enrolled across 166 centers in 20 countries (Fig 1). Overall, 732 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 365 to the Dato-DXd arm and 367 to the ICC arm. Five (1.4%) and 16 (4.4%) patients, respectively, were randomly assigned but did not receive their allocated intervention, so 360 patients received Dato-DXd and 351 received ICC (207 [59%] eribulin, 75 [21.4%] capecitabine, 38 [10.8%] vinorelbine, and 31 [8.8%] gemcitabine).

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics in the two treatment groups were generally well balanced (Table 1). Previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy had been received by a majority (82.5%) of patients. At data cutoff (DCO, July 17, 2023), almost 2.5 times the number of patients remained on treatment with Dato-DXd compared with ICC (93 of 360 patients [25.8%] in the Dato-DXd arm and 39 of 351 patients [11.1%] in the ICC arm).

Safety

At DCO, the median duration of treatment was longer in the Dato-DXd arm compared with the ICC arm (6.7 months [range, 0.7–15.6] v 4.1 months [range, 0.2–17.4]). Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 93.6% and 86.3% of patients in the Dato-DXd (n = 360) and ICC (n = 351) safety populations, respectively. However, the rate of grade ≥ 3 TRAEs with Dato-DXd was less than half that with ICC (20.8% v 44.7%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 5.8% of patients in the Dato-DXd arm and 9.1% in the ICC arm. TRAEs led to dose reductions in 20.8% of patients in the Dato-DXd arm versus 30.2% in the ICC arm and dose interruptions in 11.9% versus 24.5% of patients, respectively (if multiple dose adjustments were made for a TRAE, only the worst action taken was captured). Treatment discontinuations because of TRAEs were reported in 2.5% of patients in the Dato-DXd arm and 2.6% in the ICC arm. No fatal TRAEs were reported in the Dato-DXd arm by the investigator, whereas one patient in the ICC arm died because of a TRAE (febrile neutropenia).

Statistical Analysis

Primary efficacy analysis for the dual primary end points was performed in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomly assigned patients. PFS and OS were analyzed using a log-rank test stratified by the number of previous lines of chemotherapy in the inoperable/metastatic setting, previous use of CDK4/6 inhibitors, and geographic region. The hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs were estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. Subgroup analyses of PFS were performed. In the analysis of PFS, data for patients whose disease had not progressed or who had died were censored at the time of their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment. In the analysis of OS, data for patients who were not known to have died were censored at the last recorded date the patient was known to be alive.

The planned sample size was 700 randomly assigned patients; assuming a 30% screen failure rate, the planned enrollment was 1,000 patients. Assuming a true HR for PFS of 0.55, 419 PFS events would provide > 99% power to demonstrate PFS significance at the two-sided alpha level of 1%. Hypotheses were tested using a multiple testing procedure including the dual primary end points. To control for type I error at a two-sided alpha level of 5%, an alpha level of 1% was allocated to the PFS dual primary analysis and the remaining 4% alpha level was allocated to the OS analysis. As the PFS crossed the efficacy threshold, the 1% type I error allocated to the PFS end point was reallocated to the OS end point for a total two-sided type I error of 5%. Final analysis of OS will be performed when approximately 444 OS events have occurred. Details of statistical methods are provided in the Protocol.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^8b28731d]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload and a monoclonal antibody directed to trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2, a protein that is broadly expressed in several types of solid tumors. In the TROPION-Lung01 phase III trial (NCT04656652), Dato-DXd demonstrated statistically significant improvement in median progression-free survival (mPFS) over docetaxel (4.4 vs. 3.7months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.91, P = 0.004]) in patients with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Improvement in PFS was demonstrated in patients with nonsquamous mNSCLC (mPFS: 5.5 vs. 3.6months, HR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.51–0.79) and those with NSQ mNSCLC and actionable genomic alterations (mPFS: 5.7 vs 2.6months, HR = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.21–0.60). A pooled analysis of previously treated patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive NSCLC from TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Lung05 (NCT04484142) treated with Dato-DXd supported clinical activity (mPFS: 5.8months, 95% CI, 5.4–8.2). In the TROPION-Breast01 phase III trial (NCT05104866), Dato-DXd demonstrated statistically significant improvement in mPFS over the investigator's choice of chemotherapy (6.9 vs. 4.9months, HR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.52–0.76, P < .0001) in patients with previously treated post-endocrine therapy hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Dato-DXd also demonstrated a distinct safety profile in both trials. The successful implementation of any new anticancer therapy requires learning how to prevent, monitor, and manage treatment-related adverse events (AE). Information can be gained from real-world clinical practices, institutional approaches, and multidisciplinary teams who treat patients with Dato-DXd to provide a better patient experience and improved outcomes. Here, we discuss practical insights and management and treatment of key AEs from Dato-DXd, including oral mucositis/stomatitis, nausea and vomiting, ocular surface events, and interstitial lung disease garnered from a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals experienced in treating patients with Dato-DXd.

Study Assessments

Tumor imaging assessments were conducted per RECIST v1.1 every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 48 weeks and every 9 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter until investigator-assessed progressive disease (PD). After PD, one further follow-up scan could be performed per the assessment schedule.

Safety was assessed from screening until 35 days after the last dose of study drug; protocol prespecified adverse events of special interests (AESIs) were to be followed until resolution. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 and were treated according to Dato-DXd toxicity management guidelines for patients in the experimental arm (Appendix Table A 1, online only). Study drug doses could be delayed for up to 3 consecutive cycles from the planned date of administration, and treatment was discontinued if further delays were required. Up to two dose reductions were permitted for Dato-DXd (4.0 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks and 3.0 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks), but doses could not be re-escalated per protocol; if toxicity requiring further dose reduction occurred, treatment was discontinued. In the ICC arm, toxicity and dosing modifications were managed per drug label and standard institutional practice by the investigator. An independent interstitial lung disease (ILD) adjudication committee reviewed all cases of potential ILD/pneumonitis to assess whether the event was ILD/pneumonitis and, if so, whether it was related to the study drug. As part of an oral care plan starting before study drug initiation and continuing throughout treatment in both arms, prophylactic mouthwash use (four times daily) was advised with steroid-containing mouthwash highly recommended but not mandated. Prophylactic cryotherapy (ice chips or ice water held in the mouth throughout the infusion) was also suggested. To comply with regulatory requirements for Dato-DXd, ophthalmologic assessments were mandated for both study arms at screening, every three cycles, as clinically indicated during the study and at the end of treatment; daily use of artificial tears and avoidance of contact lenses were recommended. Prophylactic antiemetic agents were highly recommended before infusion of Dato-DXd and on subsequent days as needed. Premedication was required before any dose of Dato-DXd including antihistamines and acetaminophen, with or without glucocorticoids.

### Multicenter retrospective cohort study of the sequential use of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) [^ea3460b3]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an expanding class of biotherapeutics that have improved the therapeutic index of systemic chemotherapy. ADCs have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy of physician's choice in several phase III clinical trials including for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC), HR + /HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and in HER2-low MBC –. Based on these studies, three ADCs are now FDA-approved for the treatment of HER2-negative MBC: sacituzumab govitecan (SG) for mTNBCand HR + /HER2- MBC, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for HER2-low MBC, and most recently Dato-DXd for HR + /HER2- MBC. These ADCs have different antibody targets (TROP2 for SG and Dato-DXd and HER2 for T-DXd); all utilize topoisomerase I (TOP-1) inhibitor payloads. Additional ADCs are in development with multiple ongoing phase III trials in both early-stage and metastatic disease.

### US food and drug administration approval summary: fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low unresectable or metastatic breast cancer [^c77482bb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The US Food and Drug Administration approved fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (DS-8201a, T-DXd) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low (immunohistochemistry 1 + or immunohistochemistry 2+/in situ hybridization-) breast cancer who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods

Approval was based on DESTINY-Breast04, a phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, determined at a central laboratory. A total of 557 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 373) or physicians' choice of chemotherapy (n = 184).

Results

The study met its primary efficacy end point of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review assessment in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cohort (N = 494) with an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 0.51(95% CI, 0.40 to 0.64; P < .0001). Key secondary end points were also met, including PFS in the intent-to-treat population with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.63; P < .0001), overall survival (OS) in the HR+ cohort with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; P = 0.0028) and OS in the intent-to-treat with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84; P = 0.0010). The safety profile of T-DXd was consistent with previously approved indications, and no new safety signals were observed in this study population.

Conclusion

The approval of T-DXd in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer was based on statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS and OS improvements observed in the DESTINY-Breast04 trial and represents the first approved therapy specifically for the treatment of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan versus chemotherapy in previously treated inoperable / metastatic hormone receptor-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer: primary results from TROPION-breast01 [^5537f1d1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Until recently, the standard treatment for patients with endocrine-refractory (or ineligible) metastatic breast cancer was single-agent chemotherapy. The median PFS of 4.9 months in the ICC arm of TROPION-Breast01 was generally consistent with previous reports for single-agent chemotherapy. The approvals of the ADCs, trastuzumab deruxtecan, and sacituzumab govitecan, were based on studies involving patient populations with differences in HER2 expression levels and number of previous lines of chemotherapy compared with TROPION-Breast01, limiting efficacy comparisons.

Differences in ADC antibody targets, payload used, linker, and drug-to-antibody ratio may lead to variations in the overall safety profiles of each agent. For example, sacituzumab govitecan has a linker with a lower serum stability, whereas Dato-DXd has a linker that exhibits high serum stability and only releases a low level of payload in plasma, which may decrease systemic toxicity. While hematologic toxicity was uncommon with Dato-DXd in TROPION-Breast01, sacituzumab govitecan treatment-related neutropenia occurred in 70% of patients (grade ≥ 3 in 51%) in TROPiCS-02. Hematologic toxicities were also frequently observed with the TROP2-directed ADC, sacituzumab tirumotecan (SKB264/MK-2870), in an early phase trial, where the most common grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were decreased neutrophil count (37%), decreased white blood cell count (22%), and anemia (15%). Diarrhea is also a common TRAE with sacituzumab govitecan (grade ≥ 3 in 9%), whereas no grade ≥ 3 diarrhea events were reported with Dato-DXd in TROPION-Breast01. There is also variation in stomatitis rates between different TROP2-directed ADCs: 50% with Dato-DXd in TROPION-Breast01, 46.3% with sacituzumab tirumotecan, and < 10% with sacituzumab govitecan in TROPiCS-02.

Datopotamab deruxtecan

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is another ADC directed against TROP-2 with a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker and a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload. Due to its efficacy in the phase I TROPION-PanTumor01 trial in HER2-negative breast cancer, it is currently being studied in patients with advanced breast cancer via the phase III TROPION-Breast 01 [NCT05104866] and the TROPION-Breast 02 study [NCT05374512]. Notably, preliminary results from the BEGONIA trial evaluating the combination of Dato-DXd with durvalumab as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced metastatic TNBC demonstrated 74% confirmed objective response rates. Based on this, the TROPION-Breast03 [NCT05629585] is evaluating the role of Dato-DXd in the adjuvant setting either as monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab in comparison to standard of care with capecitabine or pembrolizumab or both, in patients with TNBC and residual disease following neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, I-SPY2, an adaptive randomized trial, is also evaluating Dato-DXd in patients with HER2-negative disease [NCT01042379] in combination with durvalumab in the neoadjuvant setting.

Ongoing trials

Multiple studies are ongoing in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant settings (Table 3). An active area of research is clinical trials evaluating ADCs in the adjuvant setting, particularly in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. SASCIA (NCT04595565) is a phase III randomized trial comparing sacituzumab govitecan versus therapy of physician's choice in patients who are HER2 negative with defined thresholds for residual disease that differ based on whether the patient is HR + HER2 negative versus TNBC. OptimICE-RD is randomizing patients with residual TNBC after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery to sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab for 8 cycles versus therapy of the physician's choice or pembrolizumab and capecitabine. TROPION-Breast03 (NCT05629585) is evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan with or without durvalumab in patients with TNBC with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The comparator group is standard-of-care therapy with a 2:1:2 randomization of datopotamab deruxtecan for 8 cycles and durvalumab for 9 cycles: datopotamab deruxtecan monotherapy: capecitabine, pembrolizumab, or the combination. In addition, sacituzumab tirumotecan (MK-2870) combined with pembrolizumab is being combined with pembrolizumab in patients with TNBC and residual disease in a phase 3 trial (NCT006393374).

### The evolving landscape of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for treatment of prostate cancer [^018ffffb]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

ESG401 is another ADC composed of an anti-TROP2 antibody conjugated to the TOPI inhibitor SN-38. Preliminary results from a phase I clinical trial in patients with pre-treated solid tumors (including prostate cancer) demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising antitumor activity. ESG401 was found to have improved systemic stability and a prolonged half-life compared to SG, resulting in better tolerability: ESG401 had 11% less rates of grade ≥ 3 neutropenia than SG, with most cases of neutropenia unperceivable and easily manageable. ESG401 also had an overall response rate of 34.2%, a disease control rate of 65.8%, and a clinical benefit rate of 50%. Enrollment in the trial is still ongoing (NCT04892342).

Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is another anti-Trop-2 ADC consisting of the payload DXd, a highly potent TOPI inhibitor. Selective delivery of Dato-DXd is enhanced by the plasma-stable linker cleaved by tumor cell-enriched lysosomal enzymes. In the TROPION-PanTumor01 and TROPION-PanTumor02 phase I clinical trials, Dato-DXd demonstrated meaningful clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in advanced/metastatic HR + /HER2– and triple-negative breast cancers, urothelial carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (NCT03401385, NCR05460273) –. While common AEs included nausea and stomatitis, Dato-DXd had an improved benefit-risk profile compared to SG, with lower incidences of neutropenia and diarrhea. Results from the Phase III TROPION-Breast01 and TROPION-Lung01trials demonstrated greater progression-free survival on Dato-DXd compared to standard-of-care therapy, leading to the FDA approval of Dato-DXd in metastatic HR + /HER2– breast cancer and EGFR + NSCLC. The ongoing TROPION-PanTumor03 Phase II clinical trial is assessing the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of Dato-DXd in patients with various advanced/metastatic solid tumors, including mCRPC. No results have been published yet (NCT05489211).

Dato-DXd demonstrated a favorable and manageable safety profile in TROPION-Breast01, consistent with that observed in previous studies of Dato-DXd. Notably, the rate of grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in the Dato-DXd arm was less than half that in the ICC arm, and TRAEs led to fewer dose reductions and interruptions in the Dato-DXd arm versus the ICC arm. The use of prophylactic mouthwash (steroid-containing, if available) was recommended but not mandated to prevent oral mucositis/stomatitis; these events were mostly grade 1–2. Most ocular surface events with Dato-DXd were grade 1–2, and over half were dry eye; patients were advised to use artificial tears and avoid contact lenses. Importantly, the frequent ophthalmologic assessments that were mandated throughout the study (every three cycles), per regulatory requirement, likely contributed to the rate of reported ocular surface events, as demonstrated by the observed rates of ocular surface events in the ICC arm (11.7%) where the incidence is higher than that generally associated with chemotherapy. The rate of adjudicated drug-related ILD was low (3.3%) and consistent with rates reported previously with Dato-DXd in breast cancer.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^02fbdad0]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our real-world study brings into focus pivotal facets of the treatment landscape for individuals diagnosed with HR+/HER2-low mBC receiving CT. Though most patients received CT after completing at least 1 HT-based regimen, about one-fourth of patients managed in the community practice setting initiate CT as 1L therapy likely due to high disease burden and worse clinical pathological characteristics. The clinical outcomes associated with CT were suboptimal with median PFS of less than 10 months. Consequently, our study highlights a critical gap in available therapeutic alternatives to CT in early lines of therapy, underscoring the pressing need for innovative and more efficacious treatment options to meet the evolving needs of patients navigating HR+/HER2-low mBC. The advent of HER2-targeted treatment for this indication will likely help to address this gap, with T-DXd potentially representing an alternative for patients in need of more effective treatment in early lines of therapy.

### US food and drug administration approval summary: trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor-positive, unresectable or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-ultralow breast cancer [^62dc51e6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, DS-8201a) for patients with unresectable or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have tumor progression on previous endocrine therapy (ET) and have hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]-) or HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) tumors.

Patients and Methods

Approval was based on DESTINY-Breast06, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of 866 patients with HR-positive breast cancer, including 713 patients with HER2-low and 153 with HER2-ultralow tumors. Patients were required to have progressed on previous ET and must not have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Random assignment was 1:1 to T-DXd or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or capecitabine). Previous CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, previous taxane use in the (neo)adjuvant setting, and HER2 status (IHC2+/ISH- v 1+ v IHC 0 with membrane staining) were stratification factors.

Results

There was a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the HER2-low population of 13.2 months (95% CI, 11.4 to 15.2) in the T-DXd arm and 8.1 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 9.0) in the chemotherapy arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75], P < .0001). The trial also met its key secondary end point, PFS by BICR in the overall population, with a HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.76, P < .0001).

Conclusion

T-DXd is a new treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, unresectable or MBC with HER2-low or HER2-ultralow tumors who have experienced progression on ET. This is the first indication specifying the category of HER2-ultralow expression in breast cancer, and an assay to select patients for this category was approved contemporaneously.

Details of the most frequently reported TRAEs by preferred term are shown in Table 3. In the Dato-DXd versus ICC arms, the most common TRAEs of any grade (> 25% of patients) were nausea (51.1% v 23.6%), stomatitis (50% v 13.1%), alopecia (36.4% v 20.5%), and neutropenia (grouped term comprising neutropenia and neutrophil count decreased; 10.8% v 42.5%).

TABLE 3.
TRAEs (all grades) Occurring in ≥ 10% of Patients and Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in ≥ 1% of Patients in Either Arm (safety population)

Treatment-related AESIs are shown in Appendix Table A 4; most were manageable per toxicity management guidelines. Oral mucositis/stomatitis events in the Dato-DXd arm were mostly low grade (any grade/grade 1/grade 2: 55.6%/25.3%/23.3%) and led to discontinuation in one patient. Ocular surface events were mostly grade 1 (any grade/grade 1/grade 2: 40%/31.9%/7.2%) and led to discontinuation in one patient (with dry eye). Patients in the ICC arm also underwent the ophthalmologic assessments every three cycles during the study and had a 11.7% ocular surface event rate. In both arms (Dato-DXd v ICC), the most frequent ocular surface events were dry eye (21.7% v 7.7%). Three patients had grade 3 ocular surface events in the Dato-DXd arm (one patient with dry eye, one patient with punctate keratitis, and one patient with dry eye and ulcerative keratitis; no grade 4/5 events); there were no grade ≥ 3 ocular surface events with ICC. Twelve patients (3.3%) in the Dato-DXd arm had adjudicated drug-related ILD/pneumonitis (Appendix Table A 4); most events were grade 1/2, but two patients had adjudicated grade 3 drug-related events, and one patient had an adjudicated grade 5 drug-related event (this grade 5 event was characterized by the investigator as grade 3 pneumonitis, with death attributed to disease progression).

When considering Dato-DXd as a treatment option in both mNSCLC and mBC, clinicians need perspectives on managing AEs in real-world clinical practice. Perspectives of different institutions and members of multidisciplinary teams (MDT) with experience in Dato-DXd AE management and treatment are valuable, and as a result, better reflect the different health care professionals (HCPs) and practices using Dato-DXd.

This paper represents perspectives from 4 medical oncologists, 2 nursing professionals, and 1 pharmacist with experience using Dato-DXd in either mNSCLC or mBC across multiple US-based practices. We discuss how we incorporated clinical trial AE management and treatment protocols into our practices and share additional insights gained from collectively treating > 100 patients with Dato-DXd. We cover prophylaxis, monitoring, and management of OM/S, nausea and vomiting (N/V), OSEs, and interstitial lung disease (ILD).

### Real-world outcomes of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HR-negative HER2-low metastatic breast cancer [^165c85a0]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

HER2-low breast cancer (BC), defined by an immunohistochemical (IHC) score of 1+ or 2+ in the absence of HER2 gene amplification, has emerged as a distinct clinical entity following the demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). This subtype is present in approximately 50–60% of hormone receptor (HR)-positive BC and about 12–20% of HR-negative cases, representing a heterogenous population with diverse prognostic outcomes and treatment response.

The landmark DESTINY-Breast 04 (DB-04) trial, the first phase III trial to establish efficacy of T-DXd in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC), enrolled 557 patients who had received one to two prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. T-DXd significantly improved outcomes compared with physician's choice treatment, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.9 months vs. 5.1 months (hazard ratio (HR): 0.50, P < 0.001), and median overall survival (OS) of 23.4 months vs. 16.8 months (HR: 0.64, P = 0.001). These findings were further extended by the DB-06 trial, which also demonstrated survival benefits with T-DXd in both HER2-low and HER2-ultralow (IHC zero with any membrane staining) mBC populations.

However, both trials included limited representation of HR-negative HER2-low mBC patients. DB-04 trial enrolled only 58 HR-negative patients, with 40 receiving T-DXd, while DB-06 excluded this subgroup entirely. This underrepresentation has left a critical evidence gap regarding the efficacy of T-DXd in HR-negative HER2-low mBC, particularly relative to other treatment options such as the anti-trop 2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) Sacituzumab govitecan (SG).

To address this unmet need, we conducted a multicenter real-world study to evaluate the clinical performance of T-DXd in HR-negative HER2-low mBC.

Neutropenia

If not properly treated, severe hematological adverse reactions may lead to complications such as bleeding, febrile neutropenia, and potential subsequent infection up to sepsis. Therefore, early assessment and management, including dose reduction (Supplementary Table S4) are of utmost importance.

In patients receiving T-DM1, the incidence of all grade neutropenia ranged from 5% to 11% across trials, while severe neutropenia (grade ≥ 3, including febrile neutropenia) was reported in up to 6% of patients, a lower rate compared to other cytotoxic agents. Indeed, neutropenia was a common AE in patients treated with T-DXd, occurring in about 70% of patients, being the main reason for dose reduction and drug interruption. Interestingly, febrile neutropenia was a rare event (only 1.6% in DESTINY-Breast01 and 0.3% in DESTINY- Breast04 trials). Conversely, severe or life-threatening neutropenia cases were frequently reported with SG: indeed, among the 64% of patients reporting this AE, 13% suffered from a grade 4 event. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 6% of cases, reaching 8% in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients. Nevertheless, less than 1% of patients with febrile neutropenia discontinued the treatment permanently. In the phase 1/2 ongoing study U31402-A-J101 (NCT02980341; JapicCTI-163401), hematological toxicities are the most reported AEs with HER3-DXd, with grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurring in 39.6% of patients, while the reported rate after a single dose in the SOLTI TOT-HER3 trial is 19%. Conversely, in the TROPION-PanTumor01 study, no cases of neutropenia grade ≥ 3 were described with Dato-DXd, and the frequency of this toxicity was low.

Anemia

The incidence of severe anemia in patients treated with T-DM1 was as low as 2.7%, even though the population enrolled was pretreated with other chemotherapies. This rate was similar in patients treated with T-DM1 (1.1%) as first line for mBC. Conversely, patients treated with ADCs such as T-DXd, SG, Dato-DXd, and HER3-DXd reported higher incidence of grade 3–4 anemia (10% in DESTINY-Breast04; 8% in ASCENT, 4% in TROPION-PanTumor01, and 18.7% in U31402-A-J101 trials, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2, for grade 3 and 4 anemia, treatment should be withheld until improvement to grade < 2 and resumed at a lower dose level. Packed red blood cell transfusion should be administered per institutional protocol, but it is necessary in case of grade 4 anemia or symptomatic grade 3 (tachycardia, shortness of breath, chest pain, exertional dyspnea, mild headache, syncope, and severe fatigue affecting work and daily activities). In case of grade 2 anemia, blood iron level testing is crucial to evaluate a functional iron deficiency (serum ferritin ≤ 800 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%), where iron supplementation should be considered. Intravenously administered iron supplements are preferred for their better efficacy, oral supplementation is more common, although less effective.

Unfortunately, the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents has not been investigated for ADCs and their use is not mentioned in the different trials.

Antibody-drug conjugates and related agents — eligibility and safety: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki may be used in those previously treated with at least one line of endocrine-based therapy in the metastatic setting and is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis; regular monitoring for this serious side effect is recommended. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy may be used after prior treatment including endocrine therapy, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and at least two lines of chemotherapy, one of which was a taxane, and at least one of which was in the metastatic setting. Datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk is indicated as second- or subsequent-line therapy for those who have received a prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease; it did not meet the OS endpoint in the TROPION-Breast01 trial, and the benefit of using datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk in patients with prior ADC treatment are not known as the TROPION-Breast01 trial did not include patients with prior ADC treatment.

### Chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer that is either endocrine-pretreated or hormone receptor-negative: ASCO guideline update [^8553e25b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Recommendation 3.2 — chemotherapy strategy for HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) states that patients no longer benefiting from endocrine therapy (ET) "should be offered single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination therapy", with combination regimens allowed "for symptomatic or immediately life-threatening disease for which time may allow only one potential chance for therapy", and the panel rates this as evidence based with moderate quality and strong strength. Choice of agent "should be based on individualized patient and provider assessment of preferences, risks, and benefits". Supporting data from the phase III CALGB 40502/NCCTG N063H trial showed 799 patients randomized to paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or ixabepilone; the ixabepilone arm closed for futility, paclitaxel median PFS was 11 months, ixabepilone was inferior (hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.93; P < .001), and nab-paclitaxel was not superior (PFS, 9.3 months; hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.45; P = 0.054). The page also notes that NCCN "recommends first-line chemotherapy with a taxane (paclitaxel is the preferred agent) or an anthracycline" and "endorses sequential single-agent chemotherapy as the preferred approach".

Third-line or greater therapy — Recommendation 3.1 specifies that if a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treatment, and the patient has already received pertuzumab and T-DXd, clinicians should recommend third-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy-based treatment. Overall, there is a lack of head-to-head trials and therefore insufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over another.

TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 efficacy results.

Table 2 details Dato-DXd–associated AEs of interest demonstrated in the TROPION-Lung01 (N = 468; data cutoff: March 29, 2023) and TROPION-Breast01 (N = 732; data cutoff: July 17, 2023) trials. Oral mucositis/stomatitis (OM/S) was the most common AE related to Dato-DXd in these populations (Table 2). AE management and treatment recommendations for Dato-DXd evolved based on experiences from TROPION-­PanTumor01, TROPION-Lung01, and TROPION-Breast01 clinical trials (Table 3). Of note, prophylactic measures for OM/S and ocular surface events (OSE) were recommended in the AE management guidelines for TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 studies but were not mandated. Thus, rates of OM/S and OSEs from the trials may not reflect the effectiveness of prophylactic measures. Dato-DXd has a similar target and payload to currently approved ADCs (sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd], respectively), but the safety profile differs. Thus, as with other approved ADCs, a specific understanding of prevention, monitoring, and management of Dato-DXd–related AEs is needed for patient safety.

### Point: combination versus single-agent chemotherapy: the argument for sequential single agents [^809d0fd6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Metastatic breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and treatment decisions depend on several individualized patient and tumor characteristics. Although combination therapy often shows improved response rates in metastatic breast cancer, few studies have shown superiority in overall survival. The choice of combination versus sequential single-agent treatment, therefore, must consider many factors, with no one strategy right for all patients. This article reviews several important clinical trials that address this issue, and argues for single-agent sequential therapy for most patients with metastatic breast cancer.

In the clinical trials, neutropenia and diarrhea occurred in patients treated with Dato-DXd, albeit at lower grades and ratEs than chemotherapy. Any-grade neutropenia occurred at rates of 4% in the Dato-DXd arm and 25% in the docetaxel arm in the NSQ population of the TROPION-Lung01 trial. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was rare in the NSQ population, occurring in less than 1% of patients treated with Dato-DXd compared to 22% with docetaxel, while febrile neutropenia rates were low, at 0% and 7%, respectively. In the TROPION-­Breast01 trial, any-grade neutropenia occurred at rates of 11% in the Dato-DXd arm and 43% in the ICC arm. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia occurred at rates of 1% in the Dato-DXd arm and 31% in the ICC arm. Any-grade diarrhea occurred at rates of 10% in the Dato-DXd arm and 20% in the docetaxel arm in the NSQ population of the TROPION-Lung01 trial, and grade ≥ 3 diarrhea occurred at rates of < 1% in the Dato-DXd arm and 1% in the docetaxel arm. In the TROPION-Breast01 trial, any-grade diarrhea occurred at rates of 8% in the Dato-DXd arm and 12% in the ICC arm. There were no instances of grade ≥ 3 diarrhea in the Dato-DXd arm in the TROPION-­Breast01 trial. Although rates of neutropenia and diarrhea are lower in the Dato-DXd arms than in the chemotherapy arms, patients receiving Dato-DXd should be monitored for neutropenia and diarrhea and treated according to institutional guidelines, if needed.

JCO Oncology Practice (2023). High credibility.

ASCO rapid recommendation update — evidence and timing for T‑DXd and SG in hormone receptor–negative metastatic breast cancer: In DESTINY‑Breast04, only 11% (63 patients) had hormone receptor–negative disease, with a 5.6 month PFS difference for T‑DXd versus control; in ASCENT, among 55 patients who relapsed within 12 months and were treated after only one prior line, a similar 4.2‑month PFS and 6‑month overall survival (OS) benefit of SG over treatment of physician's choice was seen; for these reasons, the optimal timing of T‑DXd or SG in the second‑line and later setting is less clear, and patients with HER2 IHC 0 and ISH‑negative disease should not be considered for T‑DXd at this time but could be considered for SG after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens or one prior regimen if relapse was early.

Although patients were more heavily pretreated (> 50% of patients with greater than or equal to three lines of therapy and 21.7% with greater than or equal to five lines of therapy) than those in trials that established the second-line SOC, Dato-DXd demonstrated greater efficacy with an acceptable safety profile. Historical results from pivotal trials included ORRs ranging from 3.3% to 14%, DCRs of 41.3%-53%, median DORs of ≤ 9.1 months, and median PFS of 2.7–3.0 months in patients who received docetaxel - (with PFS of 3.5–4.3 months in recent trials). Addition of a VEGF inhibitor resulted in modest improvement (ORR, ≤ 23%; median PFS, 4.5 months; DCR, 64%). However, cross-trial comparisons are confounded by differences in patient populations.

The unique ADC platform characteristics and emerging clinical profile in advanced NSCLC support further development of Dato-DXd in NSCLC and other tumors. - A comprehensive phase III development program in advanced NSCLC includes evaluation of Dato-DXd as monotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC with or without AGAs (TROPION-Lung01, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) and as first-line therapy combined with pembrolizumab for patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥ 50% (TROPION-Lung08, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), combined with pembrolizumab with or without a platinum agent in nonsquamous NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of < 50% (TROPION-Lung07, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), and combined with durvalumab and carboplatin (AVANZAR, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). Additionally, promising antitumor activity and a similar safety profile were seen in the breast cancer cohorts of TROPION-PanTumor01 and in combination with durvalumab in BEGONIA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). - Investigations in other tumors are ongoing.

In summary, Dato-DXd demonstrated a manageable safety profile and promising antitumor activity with durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. On the basis of the dose-response relationship and optimal benefit-risk profile, the 6-mg/kg once every 3 weeks dose was selected for further development. Multiple randomized confirmatory studies are further evaluating Dato-DXd as a treatment for NSCLC in first-line and later settings.

Discussion

In the ICARUS-BREAST01 study, HER3-DXd showed considerable efficacy in patients with HR + HER2 − advanced breast cancer who had previously progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and one line of chemotherapy. Most of the patients achieved a confirmed treatment response (ORR 53.5%) and experienced prolonged disease control. In addition, HER3-DXd showed a manageable safety profile, with a low rate of grade ≥ 3 TRAEs and TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Notably, the rate of ILD adjudicated as drug related was low (8.1%), most being grade 1 and thus allowing treatment recovery at ILD resolution, except in three cases. T-DXd was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with inoperable or metastatic HR + HER2-low breast cancer after at least one line of chemotherapy and, more recently, also for patients with HR + HER2-low or HER2-ultralow breast cancer that has progressed after at least one endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting, based on the remarkable results of the DESTINY-Breast04 and DESTINY-Breast06 trials. Overall, the clinical results of the ICARUS-BREAST01 study appear to be comparable to those observed with T-DXd in the DESTINY-Breast04 study, although the latest included a more pretreated population. For these patients, T-DXd is not an option if HER2 expression is < 1% (about 20% of HER2-nonoverexpressing tumors), and the efficacy of T-DXd in the HER2-ultralow setting was based on exploratory analyses of the DESTINY-Breast06 study. Therefore, the ICARUS-BREAST01 findings emphasize the need for a large phase 3 study in patients with HR + HER2 − breast cancer, who can no longer benefit from endocrine therapy, to determine the efficacy of HER3-DXd in HER2-null tumors and also in HER2-low or HER2-ultralow breast cancers, in which it could be a valuable alternative to T-DXd, considering some differences in the safety profile. This study would also provide an opportunity to further validate the preliminary findings, suggesting a positive trend between HER3-enriched populations and PFS, which helps to refine patient selection strategies. Furthermore, although the ICARUS-BREAST01 study excluded patients previously treated with ADCs, because they were designed before the results of the pivotal trials of DESTINY-Breast04, TROPICS-02 and DESTINY-Breast06 (refs.), we recognize the importance of investigating the activity of HER3-DXd after previous ADCs. Previous clinical data showed that ADC resistance may sometimes derive from reduced target expression, while preserving payload sensitivity –. Leveraging these preclinical and clinical data, we designed the ICARUS-BREAST02 study, which is currently evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of HER-DXd either as a single agent or in combination with olaparib in patients who have progressed on previous treatment with T-DXd.

Other AEs

Other Dato-DXd AEs occurred at rates similar to or less than chemotherapy rates. For example, grade 1–2 alopecia occurred at rates of 36% in the Dato-DXd arm and 37% in the docetaxel arm in the NSQ population of the TROPION-Lung01 trial. In the TROPION-Breast01 trial, grade 1–2 alopecia occurred at rates of 36% in the Dato-DXd arm and 21% in the ICC arm. In our clinical experience, Dato-DXd–treated patients experience hair thinning more so than hair loss, but complete hair loss is possible. We educate patients that hair thinning or loss may occur and, if available, inform them on how to access wigs if needed before starting treatment. Use of cold caps to prevent hair loss with ADCs is under investigation, and more data are needed to clarify the efficacy of this approach. IRRs occurred at rates of 8% in the Dato-DXd arm and 9% in the docetaxel arm of the NSQ population of the TROPION-Lung01 trial with no grade 3 events. In the TROPION-Breast01 trial, IRRs occurred at rates of 7% in the Dato-DXd arm and 3% in the ICC arm with 1 grade 3 event in the Dato-DXd arm. Best practices for preventing Dato-DXd–related IRRs can be found in the supplemental information. Refer to Table S2 for clinical trial protocol management and treatment strategies for IRRs.

Discussion

We reported the results of the multicenter, retrospective Italian study DE-REAL, which investigated the safety and efficacy of T-DXd in a real-world population of patients with HER2+ mBC. We showed that T-DXd is safe, active and effective in patients with HER2+ mBC. Of note, T-DXd was similarly effective when used in different lines of therapy, and regardless of HR status. Overall, our findings support the efficacy of T-DXd in a real world setting, thus providing additional evidence of clinical relevance of this novel drug for patients with HER2+ mBC.

T-DXd showed unparalleled efficacy in metastatic HER2+ BC previously exposed to other standard anti-HER2 therapies. Although T-DXd has massively entered our daily practice based on excellent results of prospective clinical trials, the safety, feasibility, and antitumor efficacy of T-DXd in a real-world population of patients with HER2+ mBC remains unknown.

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Its retrospective design introduces potential biases in data collection and patient selection. The sample size was limited, particularly in key subgroups such as those with prior ADC exposure or presence of BM, which may affect the generalizability and statistical power of the findings. The lack of centralized pathology review for HER2 and HR status may also contribute to assessment variability. Moreover, the inclusion of only Chinese patients may limit the extrapolation of results to other ethnic populations. Heterogeneity in treatment patterns across participating centers could have additionally influenced outcomes. Future prospective, multicenter studies with larger cohorts, longer follow-up, and centralized biomarker validation are warranted to confirm these findings.

In summary, this real-world analysis supports T-DXd as an effective treatment option for patients with HR-negative HER2-low mBC, extending evidence from pivotal trials to a more heterogeneous clinical setting. Larger prospective studies incorporating comprehensive biomarker evaluation are needed to validate these results across diverse populations, identify reliable predictive biomarkers and optimize treatment sequencing strategies for this distinct molecular subtype.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel for previously treated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: the randomized, open-label phase III TROPION-lung01 study [^68262513]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The randomized, open-label, global phase III TROPION-Lung01 study compared the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) versus docetaxel in patients with pretreated advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

Patients received Dato-DXd 6 mg/kg or docetaxel 75 mg/m² once every 3 weeks. Dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Objective response rate, duration of response, and safety were secondary end points.

Results

In total, 299 and 305 patients were randomly assigned to receive Dato-DXd or docetaxel, respectively. The median PFS was 4.4 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.6) with Dato-DXd and 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 4.2) with docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.91]; P = 0.004). The median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.0 to 13.9) and 11.8 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 12.8), respectively (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.14]; P = 0.530). In the prespecified nonsquamous histology subgroup, the median PFS was 5.5 versus 3.6 months (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.79]) and the median OS was 14.6 versus 12.3 months (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.05]). In the squamous histology subgroup, the median PFS was 2.8 versus 3.9 months (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.95 to 2.08]) and the median OS was 7.6 versus 9.4 months (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.92]). Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 25.6% and 42.1% of patients, and any-grade adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 8.8% and 4.1% of patients, in the Dato-DXd and docetaxel groups, respectively.

Conclusion

Dato-DXd significantly improved PFS versus docetaxel in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC, driven by patients with nonsquamous histology. OS showed a numerical benefit but did not reach statistical significance. No unexpected safety signals were observed.

DESTINY-Breast01 (NCT03248492) is an open-label, international, multicenter, phase 2 study of T-DXd in patients with HER2-positive mBCthat supported the regulatory approval of T-DXd in the US in 2019, followed by other global approvals. Updated longer-term efficacy results from the March 2021 data analysis were recently presented and are summarized in Table 1. Consistent with prior results, T-DXd provided patients with high rates of durable responses, with a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 62% (95% CI, 54.5%-69.0%), the median duration of response (DOR) of 18.2 months (95% CI, 15.0 months-NE), median progression-free survival (PFS) of 19.4 months (95% CI, 14.1–25.0 months), and median overall survival of 29.1 months (95% CI, 24.6–36.1 months) in a heavily pretreated population of patients with HER2-positive mBC (median duration of follow up 26.5 months). Most recently, the phase III DESTINY-Breast03 (NCT03529110) trial in patients with HER2-positive mBC demonstrated that treatment with T-DXd resulted in significantly longer median PFS of (not reached [95% CI, 18.5 months-NE]) compared to 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6–8.2 months) (hazard ratio 0.28 [95% CI, 0.22–0.37]) than in patients treated with T-DM1 in the second or greater line setting (median duration of follow-up was 16.2 months for T-DXd and 15.3 months for T-DM1).

### Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer: long-term survival analysis of the randomized, phase 3 DESTINY-breast04 trial [^f25b3e86]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In DESTINY-Breast04 (NCT03734029), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival compared with treatment of physician's choice of chemotherapy (TPC) for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low (HER2-low) (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC2+/in situ hybridization-negative) metastatic breast cancer. After an extended median follow-up of 32.0months, median OS in the overall cohort was 22.9months for T-DXd and 16.8months for TPC (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.55–0.86). For the hormone receptor-positive cohort, median OS was 23.9 and 17.6months for T-DXd and TPC, respectively (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.55–0.87). Median OS also favored T-DXd in exploratory analyses of hormone receptor-negative, estrogen receptor IHC 1%-10% and estrogen receptor IHC > 10% cohorts. The overall safety profile of T-DXd was acceptable and generally manageable. Results confirm T-DXd as standard of care after prior chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03734029.

### Survival in patients with HR + / HER2-metastatic breast cancer treated with initial endocrine therapy versus initial chemotherapy. A French population-based study [^40d33eef]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

According to international guidelines, endocrine therapy (ET) is the preferred option for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. In spite of clear recommendations, these are not strictly followed in daily practice. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of the first anti-metastatic treatment therapy choice on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Methods

In this population-based study, we included patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer recorded in the Côte d'Or Breast Cancer Registry. Differences in PFS and OS between patients initially treated with chemotherapy (CT) or ET were analysed in Cox proportional hazards models. In a sensitivity analysis, we used a propensity score (PS) to limit the indication bias.

Results

Altogether, 557 cases were included, 280 received initial ET and 277 received initial CT. PFS and OS in patients initially treated with ET was improved significantly when compared to patients with initial CT (respectively, HR = 0.83 (95% CI 0.69–0.99) and HR = 0.71 (95% CI 0.58–0.86)). The results of the sensitivity analysis supported these findings.

Conclusion

This study shows that treating patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer with initial ET could provide a survival advantage in comparison with initial CT.

### Efficacy and safety of antibody drug conjugates in previously treated hormone receptor positive HER2 negative (or low) metastatic breast cancer – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^75cdb6af]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have improved outcomes for metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative or low breast cancer; however, direct efficacy comparisons are limited. We compared trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), sacituzumab govitecan (SG), and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in chemotherapy-pretreated HR+/HER2-negative or low metastatic breast cancers.

Methods

This meta-analysis conducted a comprehensive search of the Embase and Ovid Medline databases up to July 2025. Efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR). Hazard and odds ratios were calculated for the relevant outcomes. Safety was assessed using grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs).

Results

Four randomized controlled trials were included. All 3 ADCs significantly improved PFS (P < 0.00001) and ORR (P = 0.008) compared with chemotherapy. Both T-DXd and SG demonstrated significant OS benefits (P = 0.002), whereas Dato-DXd did not (P = 0.94). For SG, OS benefit was observed primarily in later (≥ 3) lines (P = 0.03). Among them, T-DXd demonstrated the most favorable outcomes across PFS, OS, and ORR, particularly in earlier lines. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were most frequent with SG (60.2%), followed by T-DXd (52.6%) and Dato-DXd (20.8%). Neutropenia was the most common grade ≥ 3 TRAE with SG and T-DXd, while stomatitis was most common with Dato-DXd.

Conclusions

T-DXd demonstrated better efficacy in pretreated HR+/HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC), especially in earlier lines. SG showed significant OS benefit primarily in later lines. Dato-DXd showed no OS benefit but had the most favorable safety profile.

### A phase II study of atezolizumab, pertuzumab, and high-dose trastuzumab for central nervous system metastases in patients with HER2-Positive breast cancer [^6d8ebcca]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

As this study was designed, several treatment regimens have shown intracranial and extracranial activities in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases. Neratinib was evaluated in the phase II Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium 022 clinical trial. As monotherapy, neratinib was associated with a CNS-ORR of 8% and a CBR of ∼20% at 4 months; in combination with capecitabine, a CNS-ORR of 49% was observed. In the phase Ib tucatinib plus trastuzumab study, intracranial responses were observed in 12% of patients receiving twice-daily tucatinib 300 mg plus trastuzumab and 6% of patients receiving once-daily tucatinib 750 mg plus trastuzumab; the CBR at 4 months in each group was 35% and 53%, respectively. In the randomized phase II HER2CLIMB trial, among 291 patients with brain metastases, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine significantly reduced the risk of progression in the brain or death by 68% versus placebo plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22%–0.48%; P < 0.0001). Among 75 patients with active brain metastases and measurable intracranial disease at baseline, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine significantly increased the CNS ORR versus placebo (47.3% versus 20.0%; P = 0.03; ref.). In the randomized phase III HER2CLIMB-02 trial, the combination of T-DM1 plus tucatinib resulted in a median PFS of 7.8 months versus 5.7 months with T-DM1 plus placebo among patients with brain metastases (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46%–0.89%; ref.). Among patients with brain metastases who enrolled in the randomized phase III TROPION-Breast01 trial, datopotamab deruxtecan produced a median PFS of 5.6 months versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.39%–1.42%; ref.). Finally, accumulating data suggest a potential intracranial efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan. In a pooled analysis of the DESTINY-Breast01, 02, and 03 clinical trials, trastuzumab deruxtecan consistently demonstrated superior rates of intracranial response over comparator in patients with treated/stable (45.2%) and untreated/active brain metastases (45.5%; ref.).

### Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3-directed antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 3-expressing metastatic breast cancer: a multicenter, phase I / II trial [^50f38326]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients enrolled in this study were representative of a heavily pretreated patient population with advanced disease, and the demographics were similar to those in other recent phase III trials evaluating ADCs in patients with HR+/HER2– breast cancer and TNBC. However, these data may under-represent the frequency of visceral metastases observed in clinical practice because of the selection biases of the controlled trial setting, such as limiting ECOG PS to 0 or 1.

Effective treatment options for this patient population are limited; treatments in the later-line setting are not standardized, and outcomes are suboptimal, particularly for patients with HER2– breast cancer. Although this study had limited patient numbers, an encouraging median OS of 14.6 months was observed in patients with HR+/HER2– breast cancer (median PFS, 7.4 months) and TNBC (median PFS, 5.5 months). ADCs targeting other cell surface receptors are being explored as potential treatments in the later-line setting for patients with HER2– breast cancer. In the TROPiCS-02 trial, sacituzumab govitecan led to improved efficacy in patients with HR+/HER2– breast cancer compared with chemotherapy (median PFS, 5.5 v 4.0 months; median OS, 14.4 v 11.2 months). In the phase III ASCENT trial, patients with TNBC also experienced treatment benefit from sacituzumab govitecan compared with physician's choice chemotherapy (median PFS, 4.8 v 1.7 months; median OS, 11.8 v 6.9 months). These findings are comparable with HER3-DXd and further support the exploration of ADCs as a treatment paradigm in advanced breast cancer.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^e4c12fc2]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis/stomatitis (hereafter stomatitis) is a common dose-limiting toxicity seen with various classes of cancer treatment. Symptoms associated with stomatitis, primarily oral pain, may impact patient quality of life and may lead to dose delay and reduction or treatment discontinuation. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel trophoblast cell surface antigen 2-directed antibody-drug conjugate undergoing clinical investigation in multiple solid tumor types. Stomatitis is among the most reported adverse events associated with Dato-DXd, with most cases being grades 1–2. This article reviews the incidence of stomatitis seen with Dato-DXd, including in the phase III pivotal studies TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 (in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, respectively), both studies met a dual primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care chemotherapies. Developing new cancer therapies requires evidence-based strategies to successfully prevent, monitor, and manage adverse events. Accordingly, a thorough evaluation of potential underlying mechanisms, risk factors, available clinical data, and adequacy of preventive and management recommendations for stomatitis is presented here. Prophylaxis recommendations for a daily oral care plan include oral hygiene education and the use of a prophylactic steroid-containing mouthwash. Ongoing studies continue to collect data on Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis to further characterize clinical features and possible mechanisms of this toxicity. Appropriate management may reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of events, improve quality of life, and support patient adherence to treatment.
