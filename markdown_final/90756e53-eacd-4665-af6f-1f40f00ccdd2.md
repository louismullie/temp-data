## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to place, when to retrieve, and how to manage inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that anticoagulation is first-line therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Then, I should verify the narrow, evidence-based indications for IVC filter placement. Next, I will examine scenarios where filters are not recommended, including prophylactic use and routine use with therapeutic anticoagulation. After that, I need to review special populations such as trauma, cancer, and pregnancy. I will then assess device-related complications and the importance of retrieval, including advanced techniques. Finally, I should confirm practical management steps, including structured follow-up, documentation, and quality metrics, and close with a concise clinical algorithm that aligns with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of VTE treatment, and IVC filters are adjuncts reserved for select situations where anticoagulation cannot be used or has failed despite appropriate therapy, not substitutes for anticoagulation [^116VpriD] [^111Wg3Ph].

> I will now examine the strongest indication, which is acute VTE with an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. Here, guidelines converge on considering a retrievable filter and planning for removal once anticoagulation can be safely resumed, ideally within weeks rather than months to mitigate device-related harms [^111cE1G6] [^117Dad4A] [^114tM7xd] [^113bxVgo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine use in anticoagulated patients. Randomized trials and contemporary guidelines show that adding a filter to therapeutic anticoagulation reduces PE but increases DVT without improving mortality, so routine placement during acute VTE on anticoagulation is not recommended, and I should double-check that this applies to both DVT and PE contexts [^111nkFtr] [^116VpriD] [^111Wg3Ph].

> Next, I should review prophylactic placement in patients without confirmed VTE. Guidelines consistently recommend against routine prophylactic filters in trauma, major surgery, and bariatric surgery because benefits are unproven and harms may outweigh benefits, even though some observational trauma data suggest fewer PEs without mortality benefit, which I need to interpret cautiously given confounding and low-quality evidence [^1119SMU8] [^1146ovYS] [^113QQtCg].

> Let me consider recurrent VTE on therapeutic anticoagulation. The first instinct might be to place a filter, but wait, I should verify the guidance to address anticoagulation failure first by switching agent, intensifying therapy, or evaluating adherence and drug interactions, reserving filters for rare cases where the cardiopulmonary risk of recurrence clearly outweighs filter risks [^1136i82C] [^112zoJ23].

> I need to check special populations carefully. In cancer, evidence is very low quality and observational signals suggest potential harm without clear benefit, so filters should be avoided unless there is a true contraindication to anticoagulation, in which case a retrievable device with early removal is preferred, and I should confirm that structured follow-up is emphasized to avoid nonretrieval [^111cxKDg] [^113bxVgo] [^115CyCZt].

> For pregnancy, let me think about the limited data. Case series suggest filters can be used safely when anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, but I should confirm that maternal positioning and fetal shielding are considered and that retrieval planning is explicit, ideally with removal postpartum once anticoagulation can be resumed [^111jMiXN] [^113bxVgo].

> I should confirm device-related risks to inform counseling and retrieval urgency. Complications include caval thrombosis, filter thrombosis, migration, fracture, and perforation, with risk rising with dwell time, which reinforces the principle to minimize indwelling duration and pursue timely retrieval when the indication resolves [^115rrHDQ] [^114VqKjX] [^113y4Gs5].

> Now, I will examine retrieval strategy. I need to ensure a structured follow-up program is in place because it improves retrieval rates, and I should verify that routine preprocedural imaging is not required unless there are specific concerns, while advanced techniques such as laser sheaths can rescue difficult retrievals with high success but require experienced operators and careful risk–benefit assessment [^115CyCZt] [^115JHiy9] [^111LTod6] [^112BjZ88].

> Let me review practical management steps. At placement, I should document the indication, expected duration, and a concrete retrieval plan, communicate this clearly to the care team and patient, and enter the patient into a registry or tracking system, then schedule retrieval as soon as anticoagulation is feasible, ideally within 29–54 days, with contingency plans for advanced retrieval if standard snare fails [^113bxVgo] [^115CyCZt] [^111LTod6].

> I should double-check quality metrics and real-world performance. Compliance with guideline-concordant indications remains suboptimal, retrieval rates are often low, and FDA safety communications correlate with declining use but persistent overuse, so institutional protocols, education, and audit-and-feedback loops are essential to align practice with evidence [^117GFjbm] [^114eBuNn] [^112ZAJsT].

> But wait, what if the patient develops a new contraindication to anticoagulation during extended therapy? I need to ensure I do not reflexively place a filter, as guidelines suggest against routine placement in this scenario except in rare circumstances where PE risk remains high and procedural risks are acceptable, reinforcing individualized decision-making and reassessment of ongoing need [^116MWZoy] [^113iTgmR].

> Let me synthesize a concise clinical algorithm to guide decisions: if the patient has acute VTE and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, consider a retrievable filter and plan early removal. If the patient has acute VTE and is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, do not place a filter routinely. If the patient has no VTE, avoid prophylactic filters except in extraordinary, guideline-specified contexts. If the patient has recurrent VTE on anticoagulation, address failure first and reserve filters for exceptional risk–benefit scenarios. Throughout, embed structured follow-up to secure timely retrieval and mitigate complications [^111Wg3Ph] [^116VpriD] [^113bxVgo].

---

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are indicated for patients with acute VTE who have an **absolute contraindication to anticoagulation** [^111cE1G6] or develop major bleeding on therapy [^111p7UGB]. They are **not recommended for routine use** in patients already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation [^111Wg3Ph] [^111nkFtr], as filters do not reduce mortality and increase DVT risk [^116VpriD]. Retrievable filters should be removed as soon as anticoagulation is feasible, ideally within 29–54 days [^113bxVgo] [^113y4Gs5], to minimize complications such as thrombosis, migration, and fracture [^117AAFGc] [^1113wY3W]. Routine prophylactic use in trauma, surgery, or cancer is not supported by evidence [^1119SMU8] [^1146ovYS] [^111p7UGB]; filters should be used selectively and with structured follow-up to ensure timely retrieval [^115CyCZt].

---

## Indications for IVC filter placement

Current guidelines converge on **limited indications** for IVC filter placement:

- **Absolute contraindication to anticoagulation**: Acute VTE (DVT or PE) with a contraindication to anticoagulation (e.g. active major bleeding, recent intracranial hemorrhage) [^1141VkEG] [^113WMr1L].

- **Major bleeding on anticoagulation**: Development of major bleeding requiring cessation of anticoagulation [^111p7UGB].

- **Recurrent VTE despite therapeutic anticoagulation**: Rarely considered when anticoagulation failure is confirmed and risk of PE is high [^1136i82C].

---

## Contraindications to IVC filter placement

There are **no absolute contraindications** to IVC filter placement; relative contraindications include:

- **Severe uncorrectable coagulopathy**: Increased risk of procedural bleeding.

- **Severe contrast allergy**: Risk of anaphylaxis during venography.

- **Infection at the insertion site**: Risk of bacteremia and sepsis.

- **Extreme caval diameter anomalies**: May preclude safe filter deployment.

---

## Types of IVC filters

IVC filters are broadly categorized as **permanent** and **retrievable**. Permanent filters are designed for long-term use, typically in patients with permanent contraindications to anticoagulation, whereas retrievable filters are intended for temporary use and should be removed once anticoagulation can be resumed [^113bxVgo].

---

## Procedural considerations

### Pre-procedural planning

Pre-procedural planning should include **imaging** — ultrasound, CT venography, or MRI — to assess caval diameter, thrombus location, and renal vein anatomy [^111hW18f]. Laboratory evaluation with coagulation parameters (INR, aPTT, platelet count) and renal function tests is also recommended [^notfound].

---

### Insertion technique

Insertion is commonly performed via the **femoral or jugular vein** under fluoroscopic or intravascular ultrasound guidance [^111hW18f]. The filter is positioned below the renal veins to minimize renal vein thrombosis risk [^notfound].

---

### Post-procedural care

Post-procedural care includes **observation** for bleeding, hematoma, or infection, and **anticoagulation** when feasible to reduce thrombotic complications [^1129iTsj].

---

## Complications associated with IVC filters

IVC filters are associated with **both immediate and delayed complications**:

| **Complication** | **Incidence** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Filter thrombosis | 2–10% | Thrombus formation within the filter, potentially causing caval occlusion [^1136i82C] |
| Filter migration | 1–3% | Displacement of the filter from its intended position [^117AAFGc] |
| Filter fracture | 1–2% | Structural failure with potential embolization of fragments [^115rrHDQ] |
| Caval perforation | 1–2% | Penetration of the caval wall, potentially causing hemorrhage or organ injury [^1113wY3W] |
| Infection | < 1% | Rare but serious complication [^117AAFGc] |

---

## Retrieval of IVC filters

Retrievable filters should be removed as soon as anticoagulation can be safely resumed, typically within **29–54 days** [^113bxVgo] [^113y4Gs5]. Structured follow-up programs significantly improve retrieval rates and reduce complications [^115CyCZt] [^116i7k9P]. Advanced retrieval techniques (e.g. laser sheath) are available for difficult retrievals [^111LTod6] [^112BjZ88].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

IVC filters reduce the risk of **pulmonary embolism** in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, but they do not reduce overall mortality [^116VpriD] [^111mdpr9]. They are associated with an increased risk of **recurrent DVT** and long-term complications if not retrieved [^116VpriD] [^115rrHDQ].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **Routine use with anticoagulation**: Not recommended [^111Wg3Ph] [^111nkFtr].

- **Prophylactic use**: Not recommended in trauma, surgery, or cancer patients without confirmed VTE [^1119SMU8] [^1146ovYS].

- **Retrievable filters**: Preferred when temporary filtration is anticipated; routine anticoagulation solely due to filter presence is not recommended [^115kQxu6].

---

## Controversies and ongoing research

Controversies include overuse, low retrieval rates, and conflicting evidence on benefit in specific populations [^112k7LJX]. Ongoing research, including the **PRESERVE study**, aims to clarify safety, effectiveness, and optimal use of IVC filters [^115W9CzH].

---

IVC filters are indicated for patients with acute VTE and contraindications to anticoagulation, but they are **not recommended for routine use** in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation [^111Wg3Ph]. Retrievable filters should be removed promptly once anticoagulation can be resumed, and structured follow-up is essential to minimize complications [^116JTtbW] [^115CyCZt].

### Prophylactic indications for vena cava filters: critical appraisal [^117K4r3r]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Vena caval filters (VCFs) were developed and initially used for therapeutic indications, primarily to prevent recurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) or its occurrence in selected cases of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), where risk of PE was very high and anticoagulant therapy (AC Rx) was deemed ineffective, contraindicated by concurrent disease, or had to be discontinued because of complications. Prophylactic indications-where there was no DVT or PE but the risk of them was considered very high and AC Rx was contraindicated or considered ineffective-were invoked relatively infrequently at first, but when percutaneous placement became routine in the late 1980s, this indication increased steadily. The categories of patients considered at high-enough risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), albeit temporary, to justify VCF have also expanded steadily, most with little objective basis for choosing VCFs over other methods of prophylaxis. In many of these prophylactic categories, eg, patients undergoing surgery associated with a high risk of VTE, the risk is for a limited period only, until the patient is ambulatory or AC Rx can be instituted. In addition, there are potential disadvantages to leaving a permanent filter in, especially in younger patients with an extended longevity outlook and no ongoing risk of VTE. This was brought out in the PREPIC trial. This realization has, in turn, spurred interest in developing temporary or retrievable filters for short-term prophylactic use. No design has yet proven entirely satisfactory for this purpose, but the practice of placing such filters for prophylactic indications has steadily grown, using available devices. This article critically reviews these trends, suggests directions for future developments, and recommends necessary studies on which to base the practice of prophylactic VCF use.

### A retrospective cohort study assessing the incidence of inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion following prophylactic IVC filter insertion: is anticoagulation necessary during filter dwell? [^115Yqqwa]. Injury (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters play a role in preventing venous thromboembolism after major trauma where deep venous thrombosis (DVT) risk is up to 80%. It has been suggested that IVC filters are thrombogenic and many patients are therefore placed on therapeutic anticoagulation during IVC filter dwell citing concern of in situ IVC thrombosis, even in the absence of existing DVT.

Methods

Between 1 June 2018 and 31 December 2021, this retrospective study assessed the incidence of IVC thrombosis following prophylactic IVC filter insertion. Groups were defined according to the presence or absence of therapeutic anticoagulation during filter dwell. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of IVC thrombus at retrieval.

Results

A total of 124 patients were included. Anticoagulation was prescribed in 29 and anticoagulation was not prescribed in 63. A further 32 patients developed a new thrombosis episode after the prophylactic IVC filter was placed, and 29 were prescribed anticoagulation part-way during filter dwell as a result of this diagnosis. No cases of IVC occlusion were observed in any patient group.

Conclusions

Caval thrombosis was not observed after prophylactic filter placement, with or without the prescription of anticoagulation. While prospective trials are needed to increase the level of evidence, based on these results the use of therapeutic anticoagulation during IVC filter dwell should not be dictated by the presence of an IVC filter alone but rather by the presence of a related thrombosis event.

### Current controversies in inferior vena cava filter placement: expert panel narrative review [^116S5BpU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite inferior vena cava (IVC) filter practice spanning over 50 years, interventionalists face many controversies in proper utilization and management. This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or who are undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement as appropriate. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Certain cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources. The views expressed should help guide clinical practice, future innovation, and research.

### Vena cava filters: uses and abuses [^1154eRgv]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, there are more than 10 permanent and optional retrievable vena cava filters in use in North America and Europe. Indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement are intuitive and filters are used in patients who have deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and contraindications to anticoagulation, or in patients who hemorrhage while anticoagulated for DVT. Multiple studies have proposed broadening the use of IVC filters as primary venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in certain patient populations. Many permanent IVC filters have been well studied and have superior performance characteristics. On the other hand, optional retrievable IVC filters are attractive in the patient with a well-defined, short-term risk for VTE and contraindications to anticoagulation. Filter retrieval after the patient can be anticoagulated would eliminate the long-term risk of DVT associated with permanent IVC filter placement. Unfortunately, most optional retrievable filters are relatively new and have little to no data on their long-term performance when used as permanent filters, and the percentage of retrievable filters actually removed is less than 50%. The spirited debate concerning which patient should get which filter is just beginning. More prospective, randomized trials evaluating optional retrievable filters are needed to answer these important questions.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to indications for IVC filter placement, ACC/ACCP/ACS/AHA/SIR/SVM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not place IVC filter, with rare exceptions, in patients undergoing extended anticoagulation for PE and have completed the acute phase of treatment in whom a contraindication to anticoagulation develops.

Acute DVT without PE — In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without pulmonary embolism (PE) and a contraindication to anticoagulation, "we suggest that an IVC filter be considered based on various clinical risk factors, as outlined in the rationale". This recommendation is labeled "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement", and the evidence base notes "No studies were identified in the systematic review that met the inclusion criteria for this question". Despite limited evidence, "the panel agreed that most, but not all, patients with an acute proximal DVT and a contraindication to anticoagulation should receive an IVC filter", considering "cardiopulmonary status/reserve, extent and location of DVT, ongoing thrombotic risk, and expected duration of contraindication to anticoagulation". "In selected circumstances… it may be reasonable to not place an IVC filter", and "Monitoring for recurrence or extension of lower-extremity clot is recommended in such patients". The panel further judged that benefits "probably outweighs the harms", there is "probably no important uncertainty or variability in how patients value outcomes", there were no identified cost-effectiveness studies and routine placement/removal "entails moderate costs", and "acceptability of IVC filter placement varies among different stakeholders".

### Predicting the safety and effectiveness of inferior vena cava filters study: design of a unique safety and effectiveness study of inferior vena cava filters in clinical practice [^115W9CzH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Death from venous thromboembolism remains a significant cause of death worldwide. Although anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment in patients at risk for venous thromboembolism, inferior vena cava (IVC) filter use has increased exponentially over the last decade driven predominantly by the prophylactic use in patients at risk for venous thromboembolism despite limited evidence supporting this practice. The Predicting the Safety and Effectiveness of Inferior Vena Cava Filters (PRESERVE) Study is being implemented by the Society for Vascular Surgery, Society of Interventional Radiology, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and several IVC filter manufactures to better understand the safety, effectiveness, and current patterns of real-world use of IVC filters.

Methods

The PRESERVE Study includes IVC filters from seven manufacturers: ALN (ALN ± hook), Argon (Option Elite), B. Braun (LP, Vena Tech Convertible), CR Bard (Denali), Cook (Gunther Tulip), Cordis (OptEase, TrapEase), and Philips Volcano (Crux). The indications for filter placement, filter brand, complications, stability, frequency and success of retrieval, and clinical effectiveness of each filter will be recorded. Approximately 2100 patients (300 for each filter brand included in the study) are intended to be enrolled at 60 U.S. centers.

Results

Men and women age 18 years or older requiring IVC filters for prevention of venous thromboembolism will be included in the study if no contrast allergy is present and they are willing to commit to the prescribed study follow-up. Participants will be evaluated at discharge, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after filter placement and/or 1 month after retrieval, which ever occurs first. Intravascular ultrasound examination or venography will be done before and after IVC filter placement, with abdominal plain film at 3 months, and contrast enhanced computed tomography scans at 12 and 24 months to evaluate filter stability. The primary safety end point is a composite of clinical end points, including freedom from perforation, embolization, thrombosis, recurrent DVT, and defined serious adverse events. Secondary end points include mechanical stability and procedure related complications at 3 months, major adverse events at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and filter tilt of more than 15° at any point.

Conclusions

The PRESERVE Study represents the largest prospective study ever undertaken to investigate real-world outcomes with contemporary use of IVC filters. The investigators await results with the hope that it can improve patient care.

### Indications, complications, and management of inferior vena cava filters: the experience in 952 patients at an academic hospital with a level I trauma center… [^113zcUkn]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Participants In total, 978 patients. Twenty six patients were excluded from the study because of incomplete medical records. Intervention Placement of retrievable IVC filter. Main Outcome Measures In total, 952 medical records were included in the analysis. Conclusion and Relevance Our research suggests that the use of IVC filters for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombotic events, combined with a low retrieval rate and inconsistent use of anticoagulant therapy, results in suboptimal outcomes due to high rates of venous thromboembolism. The Prévention du Risque d'Embolie Pulmonaire par Interruption Cave study6 was the first randomized controlled trial to assess filter placement. Patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis were randomized to receive therapeutic anticoagulant therapy with unfractionated heparin, transitioned to war farin, or similar therapy with insertion of an IVC filter.

The study found a significant decrease in pulmonary emboli in the first 12 days after IVC filter placement. However, patients with filters had a significantly increased rate of recurrent DVT at 2 years. One patient had more than 1 reason for retrieval failure, including a clot in the filter, and protrusion from the IVC. Of these unsuccessful attempts, 2 occurred during the index hospitalization, 1 shortly after discharge, and the remaining 10 failed after the filter had been in place for more than 85 days. The median retrieval time after filter placement was 122 days. No complications of filter retrieval were documented. A filter insertion procedure note that specifies the indication for filter placement and the anticipated duration of placement is now mandatory for all IVC filter insertions.

Patients are given educational material after filter placement stating that most filters should be removed once the risk for blood clots has subsided or anticoagulant therapy is tolerated. Every IVC filter is promptly entered into a central interdepartmental registry and tracked until retrieval. In conclusion, our research suggests that the frequent use of IVC filters for VTE treatment and prophylaxis, combined with a low retrieval rate and inconsistent use of anticoagulant therapy, results in suboptimal outcomes, such as mechanical filter failure and high rates of VTE. More comprehensive longitudinal data would likely identify additional complications. To better analyze the risks associated with IVC filter placement, a prospective randomized trial or cohort study is needed for indications other than proximal DVT.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism on therapeutic anticoagulation — For patients on full therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE (DVT, PE) who experience recurrent VTE, "we suggest that a filter not be placed, with few exceptions. Reasons for anticoagulation failure should always be addressed", rated "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ✰✰✰". "No studies were identified" assessing filters in this setting, and "switching to a different anticoagulant agent or dose escalation… is sufficient to prevent recurrent VTE" in many cases; if objectively confirmed recurrence occurs with no modifiable anticoagulation issue, "We recommend IVC filter placement only… " and "Only when the potential risk of cardiopulmonary deterioration outweighs the risk of IVC filter placement and ongoing thrombotic risks from an indwelling device should placement be recommended". Risks are noted: "procedural bleeding… filter complication (eg, embolization or perforation)… IVC filter thrombosis, and increased risk of DVT… are all well documented". The panel considered outcomes — "recurrent PE, recurrent DVT, major and minor bleeding, clinically meaningful IVC filter-related complications, postthrombotic syndrome, and mortality" — meaningful, and stated that "the balance of benefits and harms varies in different clinical situations".

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRadiologic management of venous thromboembolism-inferior vena cava filters [^114KwA1Q]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE)-deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of VTE prophylaxis and therapy is anticoagulation. In select patients with VTE, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are used to prevent pulmonary embolism by trapping emboli as they pass from the lower extremity venous system through the IVC. These guidelines review the indications for placement of IVC filters in acute and chronic VTE, as well as the indications for retrieval of implanted IVC filters. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Complications associated with indwelling inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — management is: In patients with complications attributed to indwelling IVC filters, we suggest filter removal be considered after weighing filter- versus procedure-related risks and the likelihood that filter removal will alleviate the complications (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ☆☆☆). The panel agreed that symptomatic complications conclusively related to an IVC filter such as penetration, moderate to severe pain, filter migration, filter fragment embolization, or infection are unlikely to improve with conservative management. In these cases, assessment for filter retrieval is warranted. These procedures should therefore be performed by physicians who have experience performing them and with access to the necessary equipment and devices (eg, laser sheath, forceps) for advanced retrieval techniques. When considering one of these procedures, the patient's ongoing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE risk should be assessed, and measures to treat or prevent recurrent VTE included in the management plan after filter removal. Based on this, the panel judged that the balance between benefits and harms varies.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — routine placement during therapeutic anticoagulation for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE): In patients with acute VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) who are being treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, we recommend against routine placement of an IVC filter (Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). The panel considered data from 3 large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 observational retrospective comparative study, and taken together these data suggest that IVC filters in addition to anticoagulation may reduce the risk of PE but increase the risk of DVT, with no difference in mortality. Benefits and harms were judged to favor the comparison (no IVC filter), and the panel judged that there is probably important uncertainty or variability in how patients value outcomes. The panel judged that routine IVC filter placement would lead to a moderate increase in costs and resources used to evaluate and treat IVC filter complications, that acceptability to stakeholders probably varies, and that placement is probably feasible except in communities where interventionalists may not be available to place an IVC filter. Given the high efficacy of contemporary anticoagulation, future research should focus on whether IVC filter placement is beneficial in patients with acute VTE who have contraindications to therapeutic anticoagulation.

Literature search.

In addition, a comprehensive search of English language literature was performed in MEDLINE and Embase to identify studies that evaluated the safety of in situ IVC filters during pregnancy. The search was based on both Medical Subject Headings terms and alternative general key words "pregnancy" and "vena cava filter". The search strategy can be found in supplemental Table 1. We also manually searched for studies presented as abstracts at conferences of the American Society of Hematology, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, European Congress on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Society of Reproductive Investigation, American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, European Society of Cardiology, Society of Interventional Radiology, and Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe. No restrictions with regard to publication date were applied; the search was performed on 7 August 2020. Two reviewers (I.B. and A.G.) independently screened titles and abstracts of all studies. Full-text articles of potentially relevant studies were examined for eligibility. Studies presenting original data were included if (1) the study population included at least 1 patient who had a pregnancy with in situ IVC filter and (2) the following outcomes were reported: IVC filter complications during pregnancy, obstetric outcomes, or recurrent VTE. All references of included studies were manually searched to identify articles that had not been identified. Quality of included studies was critically appraised for by I.B. and A.G. using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for case series and case reports. Risk of bias assessment was not conducted because case series and case reports are by nature prone to bias. Moreover, risk of bias assessment was considered not of value for cohort studies when data of only a single patient was extracted. The following data were extracted from included studies: age at insertion, date of insertion, indication, location, type, complications of IVC filter during pregnancy, thrombotic history, obstetric history, pregnancy outcome (duration, mode of delivery, condition and birth weight of neonate), concomitant anticoagulation during pregnancy, and pregnancy-related VTE.

Study outcomes

The primary outcome of this study consisted of complications of IVC filter during pregnancy or diagnosed up to 6 weeks postpartum and included migration (> 2 cm), tilt (> 15°), or fracture of the IVC filter, penetration (> 3 mm) of the vena cava wall, or IVC filter thrombosis or bleeding caused by IVC filter complications. Secondary outcomes were mode of delivery and pregnancy-related (during pregnancy or up to 6 weeks postpartum) recurrent VTE.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with thrombolysis or embolectomy — observational studies largely report reduced mortality with inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in unstable patients and some stable cohorts, though one analysis found no significant difference; the panel recommends evaluation for filter placement during thrombolytic therapy in unstable PE. Among unstable patients receiving thrombolysis, in-hospital mortality was lower with a filter (7.6% vs 18%; RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.39–0.47), and another database showed lower all-cause mortality with a filter (21% vs 48%; RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33–0.59) and lower 3‑month mortality after pulmonary embolectomy (5.9% vs 44%; RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.61), whereas an analysis of high‑risk PE undergoing thrombolysis found no significant mortality difference (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.61–1.21). In stable cohorts treated with thrombolysis, lower in‑hospital mortality with filters has also been reported (5.2% vs 16.1%; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.27–0.39). The panel recommends evaluation of patients with PE in unstable condition (in shock or on ventilatory support) for filter placement while they are undergoing thrombolytic therapy, judged that the potential benefits probably favor the intervention in select patients, that there is probably no important uncertainty or variability in valuing outcomes, did not identify cost‑effectiveness studies and judged routine placement would lead to moderate costs and moderate resource utilization, that acceptability probably varies, that routine placement is probably feasible except where interventionalists are unavailable, and noted that adding a filter in unstable PE has not been studied in a prospective comparative manner.

Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) undergoing advanced therapies — guideline statement and evidence: In patients with DVT who are undergoing advanced therapies, we suggest considering the placement of IVC filters only in select patients (Strength of Recommendation: Limited). Evidence includes one randomized controlled trial and two observational studies. In the randomized trial, 141 patients were assigned to filter (n = 70) or no filter (n = 71); pulmonary embolism (PE) was detected in 1 of 14 symptomatic patients with a filter vs 2 of 22 without a filter (1.4% vs 11.3% of total population; p = 0.048), and placement was not associated with any complications. A retrospective cohort found no difference in PE or complications between groups, while another National Inpatient Sample analysis found no significant differences in in‑hospital mortality or most bleeding outcomes but higher hematoma formation with filters (3.4% vs 2.1%; p = 0.009). Therefore, the panel recommends placing filters only in select patients undergoing advanced therapies who, in the assessment of the proceduralists, are at high risk of clinically significant procedure‑related PE. The panel judged that potential benefits are closely balanced with potential harms, that there is probably no important uncertainty or variability in valuing outcomes, that no cost‑effectiveness studies were identified and costs of placement and removal might be offset by decreased cost of PE treatment, that placement would be acceptable to key stakeholders, and that routine placement is probably feasible though most but not all facilities will have access.

### Inferior vena cava filters in the asymptomatic chronically occluded cava: to remove or not remove? [^114QUiXJ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Risks of IVC filter insertion are numerous but include IVC stenosis or thrombosis and may result in caval occlusion. Acute IVC occlusion is almost always symptomatic, and treatment can be aggressive such as catheter-directed thrombolysis or conservative such as anticoagulation. The more challenging cohort of patients is those where there has been chronic complete occlusion of the IVC without symptoms, sometimes only identified at the time of routine filter retrieval. We explore the available evidence and discuss different management approaches in this circumstance ranging from aggressive to conservative. However, given that the overall incidence of filter-related complications is very low, at this stage we find no compelling evidence to support aggressive management without symptoms.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter for cancer patients with recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite anticoagulation — recommendation and evidence: The ASH guideline panel suggests not using an IVC filter over using a filter (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). The evidence base identified 1 observational study with no systematic review or RCT, and adding an IVC filter did not show any apparent benefits (recurrent pulmonary embolism [PE]), but the evidence is very uncertain. Harms may be large with very uncertain estimates: for mortality, RR, 1.36, 95% CI, 0.69–2.68; ARI, 132 more per 1000; 95% CI, 114 fewer to 618 more per 1000; for second recurrent VTE, RR, 5.80, 95% CI, 1.96–17.13; ARI, 331 more per 1000; 95% CI, 66–1000 more per 1000; and for major bleeding, RR, 2.90; 95% CI, 0.94–8.99; ARI, 197 more per 1000; 95% CI, 4 fewer to 827 more per 1000). Remarks note that an IVC filter may be required if there is a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy (active bleeding or urgent surgery required); if required, a retrievable filter is preferred and should be removed once anticoagulation can be safely resumed.

### Inferior vena cava filters in venous thromboembolism [^1148SQNL]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vena cava filters have been used for the prevention of pulmonary embolism in patients with venous thromboembolism since the 1930s. Historically, vena cava filters were used in patients with either a contraindication to or a complication of systemic anticoagulation or in those with recurrent pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulation. However, indications for placement have broadened even in the absence of support from randomized controlled trials as the deployment procedure became less complex. With more recently available optional retrievable filters, physicians have another valuable tool to use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients who are not candidates for systemic anticoagulation or, perhaps, more importantly, have only a temporary indication for filtration. As with permanent filters, there is a clinical need for robust clinical studies to establish appropriate indications and define long-term outcomes because there are only case series to guide the current usage of such filters.

### Inferior vena cava filters in the management of venous thromboembolism [^114JLqaL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, both retrievable and permanent, are indicated for the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients contraindicated for anticoagulant therapy, in those with anticoagulant therapy complications, and perhaps for those with recurrent PE despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Because of the lack of randomized controlled trials (only 1 has been published), clinicians have little evidence-based information to assist them in determining proper use of IVC filters. The introduction of retrievable filters and the ease of insertion have stimulated increased use of these devices without strong evidence or follow-up to assess either efficacy or longer-term clinical outcomes. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend IVC filter insertion only in patients with proven venous thromboembolism and an absolute contraindication for anticoagulation.

### Advanced techniques for removal of retrievable inferior vena cava filters [^113PEyqD]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have proven valuable for the prevention of primary or recurrent pulmonary embolism in selected patients with or at high risk for venous thromboembolic disease. Their use has become commonplace, and the numbers implanted increase annually. During the last 3 years, in the United States, the percentage of annually placed optional filters, i.e., filters than can remain as permanent filters or potentially be retrieved, has consistently exceeded that of permanent filters. In parallel, the complications of long- or short-term filtration have become increasingly evident to physicians, regulatory agencies, and the public. Most filter removals are uneventful, with a high degree of success. When routine filter-retrieval techniques prove unsuccessful, progressively more advanced tools and skill sets must be used to enhance filter-retrieval success. These techniques should be used with caution to avoid damage to the filter or cava during IVC retrieval. This review describes the complex techniques for filter retrieval, including use of additional snares, guidewires, angioplasty balloons, and mechanical and thermal approaches as well as illustrates their specific application.

### Inferior vena cava filter use and patient safety: legacy or science? [^115rrHDQ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

There has been a dramatic increase in vena cava filter (VCF) use over the past 20 years in the absence of evidence that filters provide a net patient benefit or are required in most cases. This increase is largely attributable to the availability of retrievable filters and expanded indications, particularly as primary prophylaxis in patients thought to be at high risk of pulmonary embolism. Substantial variability in VCF use, unrelated to patient clinical factors, has been shown between hospitals, from region to region, and among various countries. Despite the lack of direct evidence for the benefit of VCFs for any indication, it is appropriate to insert a retrievable VCF in patients with a recent proximal deep vein thrombosis and an absolute contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation and then to remove the filter once the bleeding risk decreases and the patient has been anticoagulated. Unfortunately, a high proportion of retrievable filters are not removed, even after the reason for their placement has long passed. Retrievable filters are associated with substantial rates of complications if they are not removed, including penetration of the vena caval wall, fracture and embolization of filter fragments, and caval occlusion. Patient safety priorities and medical-legal concerns mandate careful selection of patients for VCF placement and removal shortly after anticoagulation has been initiated.

### A review of interventions to increase vena cava filter retrieval rates [^116i7k9P]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) are indicated for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients when anticoagulation has failed or is contraindicated. Retrievable IVCFs are not always retrieved despite clinical recommendations. The purpose of this review is to compare results in the literature regarding interventions and to improve IVCF retrieval rates.

Methods

Articles were identified via the search terms "vena cava filters" and "inferior vena cava filters" in conjunction with "retrieval". Searches were repeated in MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database. Exclusion criteria included duplicates, misidentified subject matter, study period before 2008, and lack of control group. Two independent reviewers screened key elements in the identified manuscripts, including the targeted intervention population, study design, IVCF retrieval rates, and other outcomes. A third reviewer corroborated results and consolidated findings.

Results

Seventeen articles were identified for review. Of these, 12 were physician-targeted interventions, and 8 were patient-targeted interventions (3 studies included both). IVCF retrieval rates varied substantially for each study, but all reviewed studies reported improvement in retrieval rate following intervention. Only 5 studies reported decreased IVCF indwell times in intervention groups. Reported complication rates from IVCF retrievals were low, ranging from 0 to 2%.

Conclusions

IVCF retrieval rates were improved by all interventions in the reviewed studies. Findings suggest that IVCF retrieval rates can be best improved by tracking patients typically lost to follow-up. Literature suggests that successful tracking requires an individual or team of individuals who have been assigned dedicated clinical responsibility for coordinating care following IVCF placement.

### Indications for inferior vena cava filter placement: do physicians comply with guidelines? [^117GFjbm]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement has increased significantly over the past few decades, but indications for filter placement vary widely depending on which professional society recommendations are followed, and it is uncertain how compliant physicians are in adhering to guidelines. This study assessed documented indications for IVC filter placement and evaluated compliance with standards set by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR).

Materials and Methods

A single-center, retrospective medical record review in a metropolitan, 652-bed, acute care, teaching hospital. Inpatient filter placement over a 26-month period was reviewed. The study measured compliance with established guidelines, relationship of medical specialty to filter placement, and evaluation of self-referral patterns among physicians.

Results

Compliance with established ACCP guidelines was poor regardless of whether the IVC filter insertion was performed by interventional radiology (IR; 43.5%), vascular surgery (VS; 39.9%), or interventional cardiology (IC; 33.3%) staff. Compliance with the less restrictive SIR guidelines was better (77.5%, 77.1%, and 80% for IR, VS, and IC, respectively). There was a greater degree of guideline compliance when filter placement was recommended by internal medicine (IM)-trained physicians than by non-IM-trained physicians: 46.3% of IR-placed filters requested by IM physicians met ACCP criteria whereas only 24.0% of filters recommended by non-IM specialties were compliant with criteria (P = .03). In the VS group, these compliance rates were 45.8% and 31.5%, respectively (P = .03). Among IR-placed filters, 84.0% of IM-recommended filter placements were compliant with SIR guidelines, versus only 48.0% of non-IM-recommended placements (P ≤ .001). In the VS group, these compliance rates were 87.8% and 69.6%, respectively (P ≤ .001).

Conclusions

There is poor physician compliance with guidelines for IVC filter placement. Most filter indications meeting SIR guidelines are for patients classified as "falls risks", failures of anticoagulation, patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve and patients non compliant with anticoagulation medications. This single-center study suggests a need for harmonization of current guidelines espoused by professional societies.

### Inferior vena cava filter retrieval: patient selection, procedural planning, and postprocedural complications [^114VqKjX]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Utilization of retrievable inferior vena cava filters (rIVCFs) has come under increased scrutiny because of historically high rates of placement, generalized lack of retrieval when the inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) is no longer indicated, and reports of device-related complications. These events have led to an increased interest in IVCF retrieval, including the development of advanced endovascular retrieval techniques and the proliferation of specialized clinical practices for rIVCFs. We aim to describe the indications for IVCF retrieval, patient selection, procedural planning, and procedural complications and management. CONCLUSION. IVCFs continue to have a role in the prevention of pulmonary embolism in select patients. Rising awareness of device-related complications paired with historically low retrieval rates has prompted renewed emphasis and interest in filter retrieval. Diligent follow-up and procedural planning permit prompt and safe filter retrieval.

### Update on inferior vena cava filters [^117LkGAV]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

The ravages of thromboembolic disease continue to plague patients despite improvements in diagnostic imaging and anticoagulation regimens. In certain cases, standard medical therapy for thromboembolism is contraindicated, results in complications, or fails to adequately protect patients from embolic insults. These patients are treated with insertion of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. Although it appears that IVC filters do reduce long-term pulmonary embolism (PE) rates, there may be a higher associated incidence of IVC thrombosis and lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) than with anticoagulation alone. This article will address attributes of the theoretical ideal IVC filter, recently introduced IVC filters, complications of use of IVC filters, and results of recent IVC filter studies. Alternative sites for filter placements are then reviewed, along with use of temporary and retrievable IVC filters and use of IVC filters for prophylactic situations.

### Comparison of inferior vena cava filter use and outcomes between cancer and non-cancer patients in a tertiary hospital [^113P9WRT]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While accepted indications for the use of inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) in patients with a venous thromboembolism (VTE) have remained stable, their use continues to be frequent. Retrieval rates are still low, being particularly notable in the population with cancer. This study aims to review the rate of adherence to guidelines recommendation and to compare retrieval rates and complications in both cancer and non-cancer patients.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed including 185 patients in whom an IVCF was placed in Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and IVCF-related outcomes were analyzed. A strongly recommended indication (SRI) was considered if it was included in all the revised clinical guidelines and non-strongly if it was included in only some.

Results

Overall, 47% of the patients had a SRI, without differences between groups. IVCF placement after 29 days from the VTE event was more frequent in the cancer group (46.1 vs. 17.7%). Patients with cancer (48.1% of the cohort) were older, with higher co-morbidity and bleeding risk. Anticoagulation resumption (75.3% vs. 92.7%) and IVCF retrieval (50.6% vs. 66.7%) were significantly less frequent in cancer patients. No significant differences were found regarding IVCF-related complications, hemorrhagic events and VTE recurrence.

Conclusions

SRI of IVCF placement was found in less than half of the patients. Cancer patients had higher rates of IVCF placement without indication and lower anticoagulation resumption and IVCF retrieval ratios, despite complications were similar in both groups.

### Inferior vena cava filters: past, present, and future [^115Dg1np]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have existed as a treatment option for VTE for decades. Advances in medical technology have provided physicians with several options for devices that can be placed on either a permanent or temporary basis; however, there are limited data from randomized, controlled trials on the appropriate use of IVC filters. This contemporary review summarizes the history of IVC filters and the types that are available in clinical practice. It reviews the literature on the use of IVC filters and discusses the indications that professional societies have endorsed for their use. In addition, it outlines the complications of IVC filter placement and future research directions.

There continues to be controversy on the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and venous thromboembolism. In this state of the art review, the benefits and risks of IVC filters are discussed. Based on the current state of knowledge regarding the efficacy and risks of this therapy, guidelines are suggested regarding the patients who need and who do not need this expensive, risky, but potentially life-saving therapy.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — trauma patients without known venous thromboembolism (VTE): In trauma patients without known acute VTE, the guideline states "we recommend against the routine placement of IVC filters for primary VTE prophylaxis" (Strength of Recommendation: Moderate). Evidence cited includes a randomized study performed "before routine use of thromboprophylaxis" showing "(2% vs 20%)" pulmonary embolism (PE) rates, and a randomized cohort with contraindication to prophylactic anticoagulation in which "None of the patients in the IVC filter group had symptomatic PE, whereas 5 patients (14.7%) in the no-filter group had symptomatic PE; however, this difference was not found to be significant (RR, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00–0.55)". Observational data report "Among 59 patients who received a prophylactic IVC filter, 9 experienced a PE" and that placement was "associated with an increased incidence of DVT (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.15–2.93; p = 0.01)", with administrative data showing PE prevalence "higher (14.7%)… than… (0.5%)". The panel also notes increased VTE risk when pharmacoprophylaxis is delayed "for 5 days or greater following injury".

Indwelling inferior vena cava (IVC) filters with mitigated pulmonary embolism (PE) risk — removal guidance is: In patients with indwelling retrievable/convertible IVC filters whose risk of PE has been mitigated or who are no longer at risk for PE, we suggest IVC filters be routinely removed/converted unless risk outweighs benefit (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ☆☆☆). In patients with indwelling permanent IVC filters whose risk of PE has been mitigated or who are no longer at risk for PE, we suggest against routine removal of filters (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ☆☆☆). The Food and Drug Administration stated that the risk-to-benefit ratio favors IVC filter removal within 29–54 days after implantation if the risk of PE has passed, and the panel, in line with this recommendation, also recommends removal of retrievable IVC filters when the risk of PE has been mitigated, as early as retrieval of the IVC filters is considered safe.

### Inferior vena cava filters [^116JTtbW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has increased dramatically in recent decades, despite a lack of evidence that their use has impacted venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality. This increased use appears to be primarily driven by the insertion of retrievable filters for prophylactic indications. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that IVC filters are frequently associated with clinically important adverse events, prompting a closer look at their role. We sought to narratively review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of IVC filter placements. Inferior vena cava filters remain the only treatment option for patients with an acute (within 2–4 weeks) proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation. In such patients, anticoagulation should be resumed and IVC filters removed as soon as the contraindication has passed. For all other indications, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of IVC filters and high-quality trials are required. In patients where an IVC filter remains, regular follow-up to reassess removal and screen for filter-related complications should occur.

### Guidelines and the use of inferior vena cava filters: a review of an institutional experience [^1177xhoF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Based on the American College of Chest Physicians 2004 antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma 2002 guidelines, placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is indicated in patients who either have, or are at high risk for, VTE, but have a contraindication or failure of anticoagulation. Our aim is to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving IVC filters within-guidelines (WG) and outside-of-guidelines (OOG).

Methods

The 558 patients who received an IVC filter were divided into two groups called WG or OOG. The WG group met the criteria described above and the OOG group did not have a contraindication to or a failure of anticoagulation.

Results

The WG group had 362 patients and the OOG group had 196 patients. The OOG group had one (0.5%) patient with post-filter pulmonary embolism (PE), two (1%) with IVC thrombosis, and seven (3.6%) with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The WG group had five (1.4%) patients with post-filter PE, 13 (3.6%) with IVC thrombosis, and 34 (9.4%) with DVT. All patients who developed post-filter PE had a DVT before filter placement, and patients who did not have a prior VTE event were at a significantly lower risk of developing post-filter IVC thrombosis and PE.

Conclusion

Our data do not support the use of an IVC filter outside of guidelines in patients without prior VTE who can tolerate anticoagulation because of the low risk of developing PE.

Anticoagulation in patients with indwelling inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — panel stance: Given the paucity of evidence, the panel favors appropriate anticoagulation that is based on the venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related indication rather than the presence of an IVC filter. In addition, the panel stresses the importance of assessing the ongoing need for the IVC filter and endorses prompt IVC filter retrieval when the need has resolved. The panel judged that the harms (excess bleeding risk) of adding anticoagulation when the VTE-related indication has resolved outweigh potential benefits.

### Trends in inferior vena cava filter placement and retrieval at a tertiary care institution [^114yQUQ2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine practice patterns of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion and retrieval at a tertiary care institution.

Methods

A retrospective review of all IVC filter procedures performed at the University of Pennsylvania and entered into the Penn cohort of the Vascular Quality Initiative registry between January 2013 and September 2017 was performed. Data collected included demographics, venous thromboembolism risk factors, indications for filter placement, and presence and timing of retrieval. Trend analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to evaluate factors associated with failure to retrieve the filter.

Results

During the study period, 627 IVC filters were inserted. The mean age was 52.8 ± 16.9 years, and 49.3% were male; 39.2% were placed for a major indication, whereas 58.1% were placed for prophylaxis. There was a significant decline in overall frequency of filter placement during the period observed, with a 33% decrease from 2015 to 2016 and a 26% decrease from 2016 to 2017 (P < .001), with an overall retrieval rate of 44.9%. In contrast, there was a corresponding increase in filter retrieval, with a 20% increase in 2015 and a 68% increase in 2016 (P = .02). In evaluating trends separated by indication, there was a significant decline in prophylactic filter placement (P < .001) and a trend toward an increase in retrieval of prophylactic filters (P = .09). Whereas there was not a significant change in number of filter insertions for major indication (P = .06), filter retrievals for major indication filters increased (P = .01). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that longer time to follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; P < .001) and discharge to rehabilitation facility (OR, 6.14; P < .001) were predictive of failure to retrieve the filter. In contrast, filter placement at a later date within our study period (OR, 0.90; P < .001) and prophylactic indication for filter placement (OR, 0.36; P < .001) were protective from filter nonretrieval.

Conclusions

These results show both a decline in overall IVC filter placement and an increase in overall IVC filter retrieval at our institution. These trends are predominantly due to a decrease in prophylactic filter placement as well as an overall increase in filter retrieval. Further study should be dedicated to increasing the retrieval rate in this population of patients.

### The role of inferior vena cava filters in pulmonary embolism [^116kyJt9]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 600,000 cases of clinically significant PE in the United States annually, and roughly 200,000 deaths per annum directly attributable to PE. By far the most frequent cause of PE is deep vein thrombosis originating in the lower extremities, which travels to the pulmonary vasculature. The mainstay of treatment is anticoagulation, but multiple additional treatments exist for patients in whom anticoagulation is inadequate or contraindicated. The absolute indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filtration are narrow, but many filters are placed in patients with relative indications. There is growing concern for overuse of IVC filters, with a relatively low rate of retrieval. It is essential for interventional radiologists to understand the appropriate and correct use and retrieval of IVC filters. Familiarity with placement techniques, protocols and techniques for retrieval, current and emerging technologies, and the clinical model for management of venous thromboembolism, will ensure that interventional radiologists remain an integral member of the care team for these often complex patients.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with contraindication to anticoagulation — IVC filter placement: For patients with acute PE and a contraindication to anticoagulation, we suggest an IVC filter be considered based on clinical risk factors, with Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Evidence is mixed: in administrative claims data of 126,030 patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation (n = 45,771 IVC filter; n = 80,259 no filter), IVC filter placement was associated with higher 30‑day mortality (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13–1.22; P < .001). In a retrospective cohort of patients with acute VTE and temporary contraindication, 1,095 received filters and 1,922 did not; filters were associated with reduced all‑cause death at 30 days (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95) and 90 days (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90), no difference in recurrent PE at 1 year (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.67–1.61), and higher recurrent DVT at 1 year (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16–1.52). Despite limited high‑quality evidence, expert consensus indicates that most, but not all, such patients should receive a filter; factors to consider include VTE risk, cardiopulmonary status/reserve, hemodynamic response to PE, residual DVT, and expected duration of the contraindication. In selected circumstances (small or clinically insignificant PE with minimal or no residual DVT and short‑term contraindication), it may be reasonable not to place a filter, with monitoring for recurrence or extension of lower‑extremity clot and PE recommended.

### Predictors of attempted inferior vena cava filters retrieval in a tertiary care centre [^115MJgoP]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Retrieval rates of optional recovery inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in US hospitals range from 11–70%. We conducted a retrospective study in a Canadian tertiary care centre to determine retrieval rates and predictors of filter removal.

Methods

Consecutive patients who had a retrievable IVC filter inserted or removed between January 2007 and December 2010 were identified. Data collected included baseline demographics, indications for filter insertion and removal, documentation of an IVC filter management plan, reasons for non-retrieval, complications, and death.

Results

275 patients with a median age of 60years were followed in hospital for a median of 17 patient-days (range 1–876). Indications for filter placement were acute or prior VTE with contraindication to anticoagulation (72.4%), high risk of PE (11.3%) and primary prophylaxis (13.8%). Retrieval was attempted in 165 patients (60%) and was successful in 146 patients (53.1%). The most common reason for failed retrieval was filter thrombus. Predictors of attempted retrieval included documentation of filter plan (odds ratio [OR] 16.7; p < 0.001), surgical indication for IVC filter insertion (OR 4.8; p = 0.002), age ≤ 70years (OR 3.8; p = 0.001), Hematology service involvement (OR 3.0; p = 0.006), and presence of metastatic cancer (OR 0.2; p = 0.001). Thrombotic complications occurred in 48 patients, including 3 patients who died of fatal PE.

Conclusion

Our filter retrieval rate is suboptimal. Improvements in follow-up documentation or a dedicated clinical service may help increase retrieval rates.

### Appropriateness guidelines for inferior vena cava filter utilization: a contemporary review [^1172ckVS]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Concern regarding the exponential increase in optional utilization of inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) in the early 2000s with a persistent low retrieval rate nationwide has resulted in increased scrutiny regarding clinical application of IVCFs. IVCFs are used in a variety of clinical scenarios, ranging from thromboembolic protection in patients with deep venous thrombosis and contraindication to anticoagulation to prophylactic deployment in multitrauma and critically ill patients. Evidence supporting IVCFs as mechanical thromboembolic protection in certain clinical scenarios has been established through evidenced-based guidelines. As an adjunct to evidence-based guidelines, appropriateness criteria to address specific clinical scenarios and facilitate clinical decision making when considering placement of an IVCF have been developed. In this review, current evidence-based and appropriateness guidelines are summarized.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters during anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism — In patients undergoing anticoagulation for acute VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]) who develop a contraindication, "we suggest that an IVC filter be considered in the setting of ongoing significant clinical risk for PE", and for those receiving extended anticoagulation after acute treatment for VTE with a new contraindication, "we suggest that an IVC filter not be placed, with rare exceptions", both labeled "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement ✰✰✰" with "Strength of evidence (certainty of evidence): Expert opinion". Evidence was absent: "No studies met our inclusion criteria… during acute (≤ 3 mo) or extended therapy (> 3 mo) VTE (DVT, PE)", and the panel judged that benefits vs harms "were judged to favor the comparison (ie, no IVC filter)", routine filter placement "would lead to moderate increase in costs", and acceptability "probably varies" among stakeholders.

Importance

Retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters were designed to provide temporary protection from pulmonary embolism, sparing patients from long-term complications of permanent filters. However, many retrievable IVC filters are left in place indefinitely.

Objectives

To review the medical records of patients with IVC filters to determine patient demographics and date of and indication for IVC filter placement, as well as complications, follow-up data, date of IVC filter retrieval, and use of anticoagulant therapy.

Design and Setting

A retrospective review of IVC filter use between August 1, 2003, and February 28, 2011, was conducted at Boston Medical Center, a tertiary referral center with the largest trauma center in New England.

Participants

In total, 978 patients. Twenty six patients were excluded from the study because of incomplete medical records.

Intervention

Placement of retrievable IVC filter.

Main Outcome Measures

In total, 952 medical records were included in the analysis.

Results

Of 679 retrievable IVC filters that were placed, 58 (8.5%) were successfully removed. Unsuccessful retrieval attempts were made in 13 patients (18.3% of attempts). Seventy-four venous thrombotic events (7.8% of 952 patients included in the study) occurred after IVC filter placement, including 25 pulmonary emboli, all of which occurred with the IVC filter in place. Forty-eight percent of venous thrombotic events were in patients without venous thromboembolism at the time of IVC filter placement, and 89.4% occurred in patients not receiving anticoagulants. Many IVC filters placed after trauma were inserted when the highest bleeding risk had subsided, and anticoagulant therapy may have been appropriate. While many of these filters were placed because of a perceived contraindication to anticoagulants, 237 patients (24.9%) were discharged on a regimen of anticoagulant therapy.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our research suggests that the use of IVC filters for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombotic events, combined with a low retrieval rate and inconsistent use of anticoagulant therapy, results in suboptimal outcomes due to high rates of venous thromboembolism.

### Updated trends in inferior vena cava filter use by indication in the United States after food and drug administration safety warnings: a decade analysis from 2010 to 2019 [^112ZAJsT]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Overall inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) utilization has decreased in the United States since the 2010 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication. The FDA renewed this safety warning in 2014 with additional mandates on reporting IVCF-related adverse events. We evaluated the impact of the FDA recommendations on IVCF placements for different indications from 2010 to 2019 and further assessed utilization trends by region and hospital teaching status.

Methods

Inferior vena cava filter placements between 2010 and 2019 were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database using the associated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and Tenth Revision codes. Inferior vena cava filter placements were categorized by indication for venous thromboembolism (VTE) "treatment" in patients with VTE diagnosis and contraindication to anticoagulation and "prophylaxis" in patients without VTE. Generalized linear regression was used to analyze utilization trends.

Results

A total of 823717 IVCFs were placed over the study period, of which 644663 (78.3%) were for VTE treatment and 179054 (21.7%) were for prophylaxis indications. The median age for both categories of patients was 68 years. The total number of IVCFs placed for all indications decreased from 129616 in 2010 to 58465 in 2019, with an aggregate decline rate of -8.4%. The decline rate was higher between 2014 and 2019 than between 2010 and 2014 (-11.6% vs -7.2%). From 2010 to 2019, IVCF placement for VTE treatment and prophylaxis trended downward at rates of -7.9% and -10.2%, respectively. Urban nonteaching hospitals saw the highest decline for both VTE treatment (-17.2%) and prophylactic indications (-18.0%). Hospitals located in the Northeast region had the highest decline rates for VTE treatment (-10.3%) and prophylactic indications (-12.5%).

Conclusion

The higher decline rate in IVCF placements between 2014 and 2019 compared with 2010 and 2014 suggests an additional impact of the renewed 2014 FDA safety indications on national IVCF utilization. Variations in IVCF use for VTE treatment and prophylactic indications existed across hospital teaching types, locations, and regions.

Clinical Impact

Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are associated with medical complications. The 2010 and 2014 FDA safety warnings appeared to have synergistically contributed to a significant decline in IVCF utilization rates from 2010–2019 in the US. IVC filter placements in patients without venous thromboembolism (VTE) declined at a higher rate than VTE. However, IVCF utilization varied across hospitals and geographical locations, likely due to the absence of universally accepted clinical guidelines on IVCF indications and use. Harmonization of IVCF placement guidelines is needed to standardize clinical practice, thereby reducing the observed regional and hospital variations and potential IVC filter overutilization.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116VpriD]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in addition to anticoagulation for acute DVT or PE — The PREPIC randomized trial showed that placement of a permanent IVC filter increased DVT, decreased PE, and did not influence VTE (DVT and PE combined) or mortality. The published PREPIC 2 randomized trial found that placement of an IVC filter for 3 months did not reduce recurrent PE, including fatal PE, in anticoagulated patients with PE and DVT who had additional risk factors for recurrent VTE. It is also stated that it is uncertain if there is benefit to placement of an IVC filter in anticoagulated patients with severe PE (eg, with hypotension), and that the recommendation against insertion of an IVC filter in anticoagulated acute PE may not apply to this select subgroup.

### Indications, complications and outcomes of inferior vena cava filters: a retrospective study [^115cThT8]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inferior vena cava filters are used to prevent embolization of a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis when the risk of pulmonary embolism is thought to be high. However, evidence is lacking for their benefit and guidelines differ on the recommended indications for filter insertion. The study aim was to determine the reasons for inferior vena cava filter placement and subsequent complication rate.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort of patients receiving inferior vena cava filters in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2011. Main outcome was the indication of inferior vena cava filter insertion. Other measures include baseline demographic and medical history of patients, clinical outcomes and filter retrieval rates.

Results

464 patients received inferior vena cava filters. An acute deep vein thrombosis with a contraindication to anticoagulation was the indication for 206 (44.4%) filter insertions. No contraindication to anticoagulation could be identified in 20.7% of filter placements. 30.6% were placed in those with active cancer, in which mortality was significantly higher. Only 38.9% of retrievable filters were successfully retrieved.

Conclusions

Inferior vena cava filters were placed frequently in patients with weak or no guideline-supported indications for filter placement and in up to 20% of patients with no contraindication to anticoagulation. The high rates of cancer and the high mortality rate of the cohort raise the possibility that some filters are placed inappropriately in end of life settings.

The indications for the use of an inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) in the context of deep venous thrombosis to prevent pulmonary embolism remain controversial. Despite wide use in clinical practice, great variation exists in national and international guidelines in regard to the indications. In addition, clinical practice is based on poor-quality data from trauma and bariatric surgery with a high incidence of complications. It is often difficult to assess their efficacy and lack of filter retrieval appears to be a substantial issue compared with a potential benefit by insertion of these devices. Complications usually refer to increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, filter perforation, filter penetration, filter migration, inferior vena cava occlusion and subsequently failure in pulmonary embolism prevention. Evidence from low-quality studies or registries, with small numbers of patients and conflicting findings, does not allow for a strong recommendation for or against the use of IVCFs. IVCFs should only be considered in cases of very high risk of pulmonary embolism and in perioperative situations at very high risk of bleeding, resulting in a prolonged contra-indication to pharmacological prophylaxis.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement techniques — evidence summary and committee guidance: A low-quality observational study comparing fluoroscopic guidance with bedside intravascular ultrasound (US) guidance reported 117 intravascular US–placed filters versus 571 fluoroscopically placed filters, with procedural-related complications occurring more frequently with intravascular US (4.3% vs 0.4%, respectively; p = 0.006) and no difference in indwelling complications (IVC thrombosis, DVT, or PE). Given insufficient evidence, the committee cannot recommend one placement method over another, and regardless of technique, the method employed should clearly demonstrate vena caval anatomy and diameter(s), the location of the renal and iliac veins, and the presence or absence of thrombus in the vena cava at or near the planned implantation site. Evidence is also insufficient to guide choice of venous access (jugular versus femoral or other), which is likely dependent on operator experience and expertise and patient-specific characteristics, including the site and extent of venous thrombosis and previous operations or instrumentation. The panel judged that the benefits and harms of each technique are closely balanced; that the outcomes are meaningful with probably no important uncertainty in how people value them; that no cost-effectiveness studies were identified but there are moderate costs associated with increased resource utilization; and that any insertion method is acceptable and probably feasible to implement.

### FDA grants marketing authorization for inferior vena cava… [^112BjZ88]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

- For Immediate Release: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration authorized marketing of the first laser-based device for the removal of Inferior Vena Cava filters. The device is designed for patients who have an IVC filter, a small cage-like device inserted into the largest vein in the body to capture blood clots and prevent them from traveling to the lungs. The new device, called the Philips CavaClear Laser Sheath, is intended for the removal of tissue to facilitate detachment of an IVC filter during retrieval when previous methods of removal have failed. IVC filters are commonly used to treat patients who are at risk for pulmonary embolism when treatment with blood thinners cannot be used or is ineffective.

While some IVC filters are left in place permanently, the FDA issued a safety communication in 2014 based on reports of adverse events associated with IVC filters and recommended that implanting physicians consider removing the filter as soon as blood clots are no longer a risk for the patient. During removal, the Philips CavaClear Laser Sheath device is designed to facilitate detachment of firmly adherent IVC filters from the IVC wall using ultraviolet laser energy to remove a small amount of the tissue. The device is designed for use in conjunction with conventional snare devices to assist in IVC filter removal. The FDA assessed the safety and effectiveness of the device through a retrospective, real-world evidence clinical study. The study, which evaluated laser-assisted IVC filter removal in 265 patients at seven clinical sites, demonstrated a procedural technical success rate of 96%.

The study had a 3% rate of significant device-related complications, including IVC injury causing extravasation, hematoma formation, and filter breakage. Use of the Philips CavaClear Laser Sheath device is contraindicated when a blood clot is present within the filter or surrounding veins, when the IVC filter is not accessible, or when the filter is nonmetal. The device may not be used in removal of Bird's Nest IVC filters and VenaTech IVC filters. The FDA reviewed the device through the De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no legally marketed predicate device to which the device can claim substantial equivalence. The FDA granted the marketing authorization to Philips.

### Effect of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone on risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^111nkFtr]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PREPIC 2 was published by Mismetti P and colleagues in 2015 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism and Deep vein thrombosis. In the PREPIC 2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of retrievable IVC filter plus anticoagulation in patients with acute VTE? In the PREPIC 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PREPIC 2 study, the population was: 399 patients (207 female, 192 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic PE associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity. The key exclusion criteria were insertion of a vena cava filter indicated because of a transient or permanent contraindication to anticoagulation therapy or because recurrent thromboembolism had occurred despite adequate anticoagulant therapy, vena cava filter already inserted, noncancer surgery within the past 3 months or cancer surgery within the past 10 days, life expectancy < 6 months, and pregnancy. In the PREPIC 2 study, the interventions were: n = 200 IVC filter implantation (filter implantation plus anticoagulation) n = 199 no IVC filter implantation (anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation). In the PREPIC 2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in symptomatic recurrent PE at 3 months (3% vs. 1.5%; RR 2, 95% CI 0.51 to 7.89). In the PREPIC 2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in recurrent PE at 6 months, Kaplan-Meier estimates (3.5% vs. 2%; HR 1.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 6.09). In the PREPIC 2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in major bleeding at 3 months (4% vs. 5%) and major bleeding at 6 months (6.5% vs. 7.5%). In the PREPIC 2 study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic PE associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity, IVC filter implantation was not superior to no IVC filter implantation with respect to symptomatic recurrent PE at 3 months.

### Association of inferior vena cava filter placement for venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation with 30-day mortality [^111mdpr9]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of inferior vena cava filter placement with 30-day mortality in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation?

Findings

In this cohort study, using 2 different statistical methods with adjustment for immortal time bias, inferior vena cava filter placement in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality.

Meaning

Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of inferior vena cava filter placement in patients with venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation.

### Temporary inferior vena cava filters: how Do we move forward? [^113y4Gs5]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Despite their widespread use, the indications for the selective use of temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filters remains uncertain with few trials supporting their use. Additionally, the risks of long-term temporary IVC filter insertion are being increasingly discussed amongst the mainstream media and through multiple class action lawsuits. Retrievable IVC filters were specifically designed to have a less secure implantation in order to facilitate retrieval. However, multiple reports have demonstrated significant filter-related complications, most commonly related to duration of implantation. Furthermore, the risk is not isolated to one manufacturer alone. The incidence of filter-related complications is linearly related to its duration of time on the market. Currently, the FDA recommends that IVC filters be removed within 25–54 days of their implantation. Unfortunately, little evidence exists to show that this recommendation is followed routinely. Recently, the PRESERVE Trial (NCT02381509) was initiated as a multicenter non-randomized open label study to determine the safety and effectiveness of commercially available IVC filters (both temporary and permanent) in individuals who require mechanical prophylaxis against pulmonary embolism. Until such evidence is developed, temporary IVC filters should be implanted based on best available evidence and routinely removed within the guidelines of the FDA of 25–54 days. A fair question at this point is whether the design features themselves that are required to manufacture a low profile removable IVC filter can achieve effective prophylaxis against pulmonary embolism at a low rate of short and long-term complications.

### Inferior vena cava filters: what radiologists need to know [^1113wY3W]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are a controversial mechanical adjunct in the prevention of pulmonary embolism, the most serious result of venous thromboembolism. Despite modern IVC filters being in clinical use for more than 45 years, there is still uncertainty amongst many radiologists about the indications for IVC filter placement and their removal, particularly the more recent prophylactic use in patients without confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Recently published guidelines on filter use from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and other professional bodies are discussed. The vast majority of IVC filters in the UK are inserted by interventional radiologists, so radiologists may be the first point of contact for information requested by other clinicians. The increasing use of filters means that radiologists will encounter filters increasingly often during abdominal cross-sectional imaging. Awareness of common filter-related complications, such as tilting, thrombosis, and caval perforation, is useful to reassure or alert other clinicians. The potential role of filters in upper extremity DVT and requirement for concomitant anticoagulation is discussed.

### Inferior vena cava filters [^113bBDu4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is common. Most pulmonary emboli arise as thromboses in the deep veins of the lower extremities and may result in serious complications. Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are intended to prevent the passage of deep vein thrombosis to the pulmonary arteries. Accepted indications for IVCF placement include the presence of acute venous thromboembolism with inability to administer anticoagulation medication or failure of anticoagulation. Despite these clear indications, IVCF have been commonly placed in patients for primary prevention of pulmonary emboli in patients deemed to be at high risk, along with several other "soft" indications. As a result, IVCF use has been rising over the past 2 decades, especially given the retrievable nature of modern devices. Nonetheless, IVCF are not free of complications, which may occur during implantation and retrieval and while retained in the body. Despite this increase in use, the long-term efficacy remains unclear, and the management of patients with retained filters is often controversial. Finally, filter retrieval in eligible patients is relatively infrequent, suggesting that systems must be in place to improve appropriate filter use and to increase retrieval.

### Inferior vena cava filters: a framework for evidence-based use [^111p7UGB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Although most patients can be managed safely with anticoagulation, inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) represent an important alternative to anticoagulation in a small subset of patients. IVCF use has expanded exponentially with the advent of retrievable filters. Indications for IVCFs have liberalized despite limited evidence supporting this practice. Because indiscriminate use of IVCFs can be associated with net patient harm, knowledge of the risks and benefits of these devices is essential to optimal evidence-based practice. Patients with acute VTE and absolute contraindications to anticoagulation or major complications from anticoagulation are universally agreed indications for IVCFs. However, the reliance on IVCFs for primary VTE prophylaxis in high-risk patients is not substantiated by the available literature. This review examines trends in IVCF use, practice-based recommendations on IVCF use in various clinical scenarios, complications associated with indwelling IVCFs, and indications for IVCF retrieval.

### Association of inferior vena cava filter placement for venous thromboembolic disease and a contraindication to anticoagulation with 30-day mortality [^1148trMi]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an incidence of 117 cases per 100 000 person-yearsand a 1-year mortality for PE of at least 22% in patients with Medicare. Treatment of patients with VTE is based on anticoagulation, but for many patients, this therapy is contraindicated owing to recent surgery or underlying coagulopathies. In patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation, major professional societies, including the American College of Chest Physicians, American Heart Association, Society of Interventional Radiology, American College of Radiology, and the British Committee for Standards in Haematologyrecommend consideration of IVC filter placement. While IVC filters have been widely available since the 1960s, their use in the United States has steadily and dramatically increased from 2000 procedures in 1979 to more than 100 000 procedures in 2005. More recently, rates have begun to decline with approximately 96 000 procedures in 2014. This use has occurred despite the absence of data on a mortality benefit associated with IVC filter placement. An early randomized clinical trial showed a reduction in the number of symptomatic PEs but no reduction in mortality after IVC filter insertion. Importantly, this trial excluded patients with a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy, which is, to our knowledge, the most widely accepted indication for IVC filter placement and the only indication for which the several professional societies agree. Retrievable IVC filters were analyzed in a randomized clinical trialof patients with PE and a high likelihood of recurrence. In this trial, IVC filters did not lower recurrent PE, but patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation were excluded. Thus, the findings of existing randomized clinical trials are not applicable to a large segment of the VTE population.

### Guideline compliance and indications for inferior vena cava filter placement at a quaternary care medical center [^116kFQcb]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study investigated physician compliance with indications for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement according to the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the 2011 Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective medical record review of 231 retrievable IVC filters placed between August 15, 2016, and December 28, 2017, at a large urban academic medical center. Guideline compliance to the 2012 ACCP and the 2011 SIR guidelines, and indications for IVC filter placements were assessed through an adjudication protocol. Filter retrieval and complication rates were also examined.

Results

Compliance to guidelines was low (60.2% for ACCP; 74.0% for SIR), especially for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients (ICU 74.6% vs non-ICU 54.8%, p = 0.007 for ACCP; ICU 82.5% vs non-ICU 70.8%, p = 0.092 for SIR). After adjudication, 8.2% (19/231) of filters were considered non-indicated but reasonable, 17.7% (41/231) non-indicated and unreasonable, and 13.9% (32/231) SIR-indicated but not ACCP-indicated. The most common indication was venous thromboembolism with contraindication to anticoagulation. The most common reasons for non-compliance were distal deep venous thrombosis with contraindication to anticoagulation (19/60, 31.6%) and clot burden (19/60, 31.6%). One-year filter retrieval and 90-day complication rates were 32.0% (74/231) and 6.1% (14/231), respectively.

Conclusion

Compliance to established guidelines was low. Reasons for non-compliance included limitations or discrepancies in guidelines, as well as non-evidence-based filter placements.

Clinical Impact

Despite increasing utilization of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, guideline compliance for IVC filter placement among providers is unclear. The results of this study indicate that physician compliance to established guidelines is poor, especially in non-intensive-care-unit patients. Noncompliance stems from non-evidence-based filter placement as well as differences and limitations in guidelines. Avoiding non-indicated IVC filter placement and consolidation of guidelines may significantly improve guideline compliance. The critical insights gained from this study can help promote judicious use of IVC filters and highlight the role of venous thromboembolism experts in navigating complex cases and nuances of guidelines.

### Continued high rates of IVC filter use… [^112k7LJX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Inferior vena cava filters have drawn my attention since I learned about their serious risks from Nicholson and colleagues' careful study1 of the high fracture rate of IVC filters in 2010. At that time, I commented, "Remarkably, these filters, which are placed inside the IVC, were considered Class II by the FDA — the same risk category of mercury thermometers — and received approval without any clinical data of safety and effectiveness identified in their 510 clearances". 2 Publication of the Nicholson study prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to review the adverse event database and issue a safety warning in 2010 related to reports of 921 adverse events since 2005 and reminded doctors to remove these retrievable filters. Despite the FDA warning, most retrievable filters are never retrieved3.

In addition, evidence suggests that the longer the filter is in place the higher the chance of fracture.
1. I learned more about the evidence of benefit from IVC filters from the summary of Prasad et al. 4 Furthermore, studies show that many IVC filters are placed in persons who are able to take anticoagulants, which is the appropriate first-line treatment for prevention of pulmonary embolism. Indeed, in a chart review of 3 hospitals in Massachusetts only 50% of IVC filters were placed for appropriate indications. 5 In addition, the use of IVC filters has expanded to include other groups of patients for whom there is no evidence of benefit, such as prophylactic use prior to bariatric surgery. The report by Reddy et al6 in this issue documents continued unacceptably high rates of IVC filter use after the FDA warning and continued lack of evidence of benefit.

As is true for many treatments that were later shown to be harmful and have been abandoned, such as antiarrhythmic medications for patients following myocardial infarction, or metal-on-metal hips, some argue that it is impossible to do a randomized clinical trial of IVC filters because practice patterns are set. 7 As is true for many invasive treatments, IVC filter use is much higher in the United States than any other country. In the absence of evidence of benefit and definite harms, IVC filters get a Less Is More designation. There should be a moratorium on their use unless or until there are data showing efficacy greater than risk.

### The effectiveness of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters in trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QQtCg]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Trauma is known to be one of the strongest risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). Current guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparin therapy for prevention of PE, but trauma places some patients at risk of excess bleeding. Experts are divided on the role of prophylactic inferior vena cava (IVC) filters to prevent PE.

Objective

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the comparative effectiveness of prophylactic IVC filters in trauma patients, particularly in preventing PE, fatal PE, and mortality.

Data Sources

We searched the following databases for primary studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, clinicaltrial.gov, and the Cochrane Library (all through July 31, 2012). We developed a search strategy using medical subject headings terms and text words of key articles that we identified a priori. We reviewed the references of all included articles, relevant review articles, and related systematic reviews to identify articles the database searches might have missed.

Study Selection

We reviewed titles followed by abstracts to identify randomized clinical trials or observational studies with comparison groups reporting on the effectiveness and/or safety of IVC filters for prevention of venous thromboembolism in trauma patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and abstracted data. For studies amenable to pooling with meta-analysis, we pooled using the random-effects model to analyze the relative risks. We graded the quantity, quality, and consistency of the evidence by adapting an evidence-grading scheme recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Results

Eight controlled studies compared the effectiveness of no IVC filter vs IVC filter on PE, fatal PE, deep vein thrombosis, and/or mortality in trauma patients. Evidence showed a consistent reduction of PE (relative risk, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06–0.70]; I(2) = 0%) and fatal PE (0.09 [0.01–0.81]; I(2) = 0%) with IVC filter placement, without any statistical heterogeneity. We found no significant difference in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (relative risk, 1.76 [95% CI, 0.50–6.19]; p = 0.38; I(2) = 56.8%) or mortality (0.70 [0.40–1.23]; I(2) = 6.7%). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 additional PE with IVC filters is estimated to range from 109 (95% CI, 93–190) to 962 (819–2565), depending on the baseline PE risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

The strength of evidence is low but supports the association of IVC filter placement with a lower incidence of PE and fatal PE in trauma patients. Which patients experience benefit enough to outweigh the harms associated with IVC filter placement remains unclear. Additional well-designed observational or prospective cohort studies may be informative.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in the treatment of patients with or at substantial risk of venous thromboembolic disease.

Materials and Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel developed key questions to address in the guideline, and a systematic review of the literature was conducted. Evidence was graded based on a standard methodology, which was used to inform the development of recommendations.

Results

The systematic review identified a total of 34 studies that provided the evidence base for the guideline. The expert panel agreed on 18 recommendations.

Conclusions

Although the evidence on the use of IVC filters in patients with or at risk of venous thromboembolic disease varies in strength and quality, the panel provides recommendations for the use of IVC filters in a variety of clinical scenarios. Additional research is needed to optimize care for this patient population.

### Retrievable vena cava filters: clinical experience [^114kji8z]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize currently available literature regarding indications for inferior vena cava filters, potential problems associated with the different filters available, and the efficacy and safety of retrievable inferior vena cava filters.

Recent Findings

The placement of permanent filters may present a number of long-term complications such as filter occlusion and an increased risk of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Furthermore, patients who require inferior vena cava interruption often have short-term contraindications to anticoagulant therapy, and thus only require filters for temporary indications. Four different retrievable filters have recently received approval for temporary insertion, and preliminary data suggest that the use of these filters is associated with a low rate of pulmonary embolism and complications related to filter insertion. Retrieval was uneventful in almost all patients. No randomized clinical trials have yet been performed, and available information is based on the results of either retrospective or prospective cohort studies.

Summary

Retrievable filters are a very attractive alternative to either permanent or temporary filters when inferior vena cava interruption becomes necessary, thanks to the advantages of very easy management and the possibility of their being left in place for a long time and removed when they become unnecessary.
