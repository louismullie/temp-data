## Question

What topical treatments are similar to Amlactin to treat severe xerosis of the skin? Trying to find alternative for insurance.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical alternatives to Amlactin for severe xerosis and options that may be covered by insurance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Amlactin actually is and its labeled indication. Then, I should verify mechanistic equivalents such as urea and other alpha-hydroxy acids. Next, I will review barrier repair options like ceramide-containing moisturizers and petrolatum occlusives. After that, I need to consider special cases such as heparinoid moisturizers and when anti-inflammatory prescriptions are appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize an insurance-aware, stepwise plan and confirm safety counseling points for keratolytics and emollients.

> Let me first confirm the product details so we don't jump to conclusions: Amlactin is ammonium lactate 12%, which is FDA-indicated for xerosis and ichthyosis vulgaris; its mechanism is primarily humectant plus keratolytic via lactic acid, which helps soften scale and improve hydration, and the standard adult dosing is twice daily application for xerosis or ichthyosis vulgaris [^112w447e] [^114m7qE2] [^115yamcn] [^115yzbhQ].

> I will now examine direct therapeutic alternatives with similar mechanisms, because these are most likely to be clinically comparable and covered: generic ammonium lactate 12% is the same active ingredient and typically the most cost-effective substitution; urea cream 20–40% is another keratolytic-humectant option, and in a bilateral randomized study, 40% urea outperformed 12% ammonium lactate for several clinical measures at day 14; lower-strength lactic acid lotions exist OTC and can be useful if cost or access is a barrier, though higher-concentration urea or prescription ammonium lactate generally provide stronger keratolysis in severe xerosis [^115yamcn] [^115yzbhQ] [^111ZcbBy].

> Next, I should review barrier repair strategies because persistent xerosis reflects impaired stratum corneum hydration and lipids: ceramide-containing moisturizers are supported by consensus and clinical studies to improve hydration and reduce transepidermal water loss, and can serve as maintenance after keratolytic induction; petrolatum-rich occlusives meaningfully reduce TEWL and are inexpensive adjuncts; optimally, moisturizers blend humectants, ceramides, and occlusives to normalize barrier while providing symptom relief and itch reduction [^113cJNQw] [^11286JA2] [^115xQnEC] [^113Par9u].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any additional emollient classes have evidence in severe secondary xerosis states: heparinoid-containing moisturizers, particularly formulations with glycerin and petrolatum, have improved water content and clinical dryness in dialysis-associated xerosis in randomized, multicenter studies, although availability varies by region; these can be reasonable options where accessible or via compounding, but conventional ceramide-based or petrolatum-rich emollients remain widely available in the U.S [^1154aVAn] [^113A2CFQ] [^1179QTDc].

> Let me consider escalation therapy for flares, but wait, I need to ensure I'm not conflating pure xerosis with eczematous inflammation: topical corticosteroids can be used briefly for inflamed, eczematous xerosis but are not maintenance therapy due to atrophy risk; I initially thought calcineurin inhibitors might be general options for xerosis, but hold on, that's imprecise — calcineurin inhibitors are steroid-sparing agents for atopic dermatitis with xerosis rather than for noninflammatory dry skin per se, so they should be reserved for an eczematous component or AD overlap rather than routine xerosis [^11641v3c] [^117AuJtQ] [^113qActq] [^115NWUzc].

> I should now outline a practical, evidence-based sequence: start with generic ammonium lactate 12% twice daily for induction if Amlactin access is limited; if unavailable or not tolerated, substitute urea 20–40% and titrate to effect; after control, transition to daily ceramide-containing moisturizer for maintenance and layer petrolatum at night or over fissure-prone areas to limit TEWL; throughout, emphasize frequent emollient use and water-exposure minimization as core measures for pruritic xerosis [^115yamcn] [^111ZcbBy] [^111yrqmd] [^11286JA2].

> I need to check payer considerations so recommendations are feasible: therapeutic substitution of branded with equivalent generics reduces spend, and generic ammonium lactate is typically tier-1 or low-cost cash; OTC ceramide moisturizers and petrolatum are economical and eligible for HSA/FSA; if patients react to certain emollients, remember lanolin is a potential sensitizer in older adults, so fragrance-free, lanolin-free formulations may improve adherence and reduce dermatitis risk [^117B5QvM] [^113ivjFz].

> But wait, what about safety and tolerability of keratolytics in severe xerosis with fissuring — let me reconsider application guidance: lactic acid and urea can sting on open fissures; advise applying to slightly damp skin after bathing, then sealing with an occlusive; for highly irritated areas, temporarily prioritize bland emollients until barrier improves, then reintroduce keratolytics; consistent, generous use of medical moisturizers is first-line in asteatosis/xerosis guidelines and should be continued even after symptoms abate for relapse prevention [^113g1PUa] [^11286JA2].

> I should double-check that the key options align with the request for "similar" treatments and insurance-friendly picks: generic ammonium lactate 12% is mechanism-identical to Amlactin and usually cheapest; urea 20–40% is a well-supported alternative that may be superior for some outcomes; ceramide moisturizers and petrolatum provide barrier support for maintenance and are widely accessible; short courses of low-potency steroids or calcineurin inhibitors are reserved for eczematous flares rather than baseline xerosis care [^112w447e] [^111ZcbBy] [^113cJNQw] [^11286JA2].

> Bottom line, to mirror Amlactin's effects for severe xerosis while minimizing cost: use generic ammonium lactate 12% first, pivot to urea 20–40% if needed, and maintain with ceramide-based moisturizers plus petrolatum occlusion; escalate briefly to anti-inflammatory topicals only if inflamed eczematous features appear, and continue liberal emollient use to prevent relapse and pruritus, adjusting for tolerability and access as needed [^115yamcn] [^111ZcbBy] [^113cJNQw] [^111yrqmd].

For severe xerosis, **urea 20–40% creams** (e.g. Eucerin Roughness Relief, Ureacin-20, Carmol 40) are the closest alternatives to Amlactin, offering comparable or superior keratolytic and hydrating effects [^111ZcbBy]. Ceramide-based moisturizers (e.g. CeraVe, Eucerin Advanced Repair) are also effective for **barrier repair and hydration** [^113Par9u]. For cost-sensitive patients, **petrolatum-based ointments** (e.g. Aquaphor, Vaseline) provide strong occlusion and hydration at low cost [^11286JA2]. Urea creams are often covered by insurance and are suitable substitutes for ammonium lactate products.

---

## Urea-based creams and lotions

Urea is a keratolytic and humectant that softens keratin, increases water uptake, and reduces scaling and fissuring [^11286JA2]. Urea 20–40% is **effective for severe xerosis** and a practical alternative to ammonium lactate [^111ZcbBy].

- **Eucerin Roughness Relief Lotion (urea 10%)**: Effective for moderate to severe xerosis; widely available and often covered by insurance.

- **Ureacin-20 Cream (urea 20%)**: Comparable to ammonium lactate for severe xerosis; often covered by insurance.

- **Carmol 40 Cream (urea 40%)**: Superior to 12% ammonium lactate for severe hyperkeratotic xerosis; effective for thickened, scaly skin [^111ZcbBy].

---

## Ceramide-containing moisturizers

Ceramides restore barrier function and reduce transepidermal water loss (TEWL), improving hydration and pruritus [^115xQnEC]. Ceramide-based moisturizers are **effective for severe xerosis** and are often covered by insurance. CeraVe Moisturizing Cream/Lotion contains **ceramides and hyaluronic acid** and is effective for **barrier repair** in severe xerosis, while **Eucerin Advanced Repair Cream/Lotion** contains ceramides and urea and is effective for barrier repair in severe xerosis.

---

## Petrolatum-based ointments

Petrolatum is a strong occlusive that reduces TEWL and improves hydration [^11286JA2]. Petrolatum-based ointments are **effective, inexpensive, and widely available** [^114uPTKk]. Aquaphor Healing Ointment and Vaseline Petroleum Jelly are petrolatum-based and **effective for severe xerosis and fissured skin** [^116A8WPo].

---

## Alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) formulations

AHAs (e.g. glycolic acid) provide keratolytic and humectant effects similar to ammonium lactate [^1122otcb]. AHA formulations are **effective alternatives** for severe xerosis [^1122otcb]. Glytone Exfoliating Body Lotion (glycolic acid 17.5%) and Neostrata Lotion Plus (glycolic acid 15%) are **effective for severe xerosis and hyperkeratotic skin**.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting alternatives

- **Urea vs. ammonium lactate**: Urea 40% cream is superior to 12% ammonium lactate for severe hyperkeratotic xerosis [^111ZcbBy].

- **Ceramide-containing moisturizers**: Improve barrier function, reduce TEWL, and improve hydration and pruritus in severe xerosis [^115xQnEC].

- **Petrolatum-based ointments**: Effective for severe xerosis and fissured skin; inexpensive and widely available [^11286JA2].

---

## Insurance coverage considerations

Urea-based creams are often **covered by insurance** and practical alternatives to ammonium lactate. Ceramide-containing moisturizers are likewise often **covered** and effective for severe xerosis. Petrolatum-based ointments are **inexpensive**, widely available, and effective for severe xerosis [^11286JA2].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **First-line alternatives**: Urea-based creams (20–40%) and ceramide-containing moisturizers [^113g1PUa].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Petrolatum-based ointments for additional occlusion and hydration [^11286JA2].

### Algorithm to improve patient comfort and treat diabetes mellitus-related xerosis [^113cJNQw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM)-related cutaneous disorders such as xerosis frequently occur in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Gentle cleansers and moisturizers are underused to prevent xerosis or provide effective early treatment and maintenance.

- **Methods**: The project used a modified Delphi hybrid process comprising face-to-face discussions followed by an online review process. A panel of physicians who treat patients with diabetes used information from literature searches coupled with expert opinions and their experience to develop a practical algorithm to improve outcomes for patients with DM-related xerosis.

- **Results**: The algorithm for DM-related xerosis aims to inform dermatologists and other health care professionals caring for patients with DM. The first section of the algorithm addresses education and behavioral measures. Treatment adherence is a considerable challenge in people with DM, making education essential. The second section discusses the assessment of the skin condition. The third section reports on an interdisciplinary team-based approach to patients with DM-related xerosis. The algorithm describes treatment and maintenance approaches using cleansers and moisturizers for mild, moderate, and severe xerosis, distinguishing between the body, face, hands, and feet.

- **Conclusion**: The algorithm supports educating health care professionals and patients on xerosis prevention and treatment using ceramide-containing gentle cleansers and moisturizers to improve patient comfort and prevent complications. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(4): doi:10.3684

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^11286JA2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Emollients, as one intervention, are the mainstay of treatment for those with already established eczema, as detailed in a Cochrane Review. This is because dry skin (xerosis) is a key feature of eczema, and topical moisturizers play an integral role in the standard treatment of eczema of all severities. Emollients can decrease transepidermal water loss (TEWL), increase stratum corneum hydration, improve comfort, and reduce itch when used on skin that already has active eczema. Therefore, they are a key component in the treatment of eczema and may be more effective than interventions such as less frequent bathing or the use of water softeners for eczema prevention.

All moisturizers contain varying amounts of active ingredients such as humectants or ceramides, as well as excipient ingredients such as emulsifiers. Humectants, such as glycerol or urea, aid in the retention and attraction of water by the stratum corneum. Ceramides are intracellular lipids found in the stratum corneum that are reduced in lesional eczematous skin. Occlusives such as petrolatum form a layer on the skin surface that may prevent TEWL across the stratum corneum and can soften the skin. Moisturizers can be hydrophilic or lipophilic. Hydrophilic moisturizers attract water and are important for skin hydration, whereas lipophilic moisturizers tend to stay on the surface to aid the skin barrier.

### Use of an alternative method to evaluate erythema severity in a clinical trial: Difference in vehicle response with evaluation of baseline and postdose photographs for effect of oxymetazoline cream 1.0% for persistent erythema of rosacea in a phase IV study [^115zk4CW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients in the oxymetazoline arm who achieved at least a 1‐grade Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) improvement from baseline in the phase IV study, in which investigators were allowed to refer to the baseline photograph while evaluating post‐treatment photographs, was not significantly different from that in the phase III trials, which required live, static assessments. However, a significantly lower proportion of patients treated with vehicle had at least a 1‐grade CEA improvement when reference to the baseline photograph was allowed compared with the proportion when live, static assessments were required (P < 0.001 for 1 h and 12 h; P < 0.0001 for 3 h, 6 h, and 9 h).

- **Proportions of patients with rosacea**: At least a 1‐grade CEA improvement in the phase IV study compared with the phase III trials for patients in the oxymetazoline group and the vehicle group (merged population). CEA scale: 0, clear; 1, almost clear; 2, mild erythema; 3, moderate erythema; 4, severe erythema. a P < 0.001 for the comparison between phase IV and phase III data. b P < 0.0001 for the comparison between phase IV and phase III data.

Figure 2 shows representative photographs of patients evaluated in this study. The patient treated with oxymetazoline (Fig. 2a) achieved at least a 1‐grade CEA improvement from baseline, whereas the patient treated with vehicle (Fig. 2b) did not. The CEA ratings for the patient treated with oxymetazoline were consistent regardless of the investigator's ability to see the baseline photograph, whereas the apparent treatment eff…

### Skin barrier and dry skin in the mature patient [^111r4bgV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dry skin is the most common clinical manifestation of dermatologic diseases and presents with itching, redness, and desquamation — signs and clinical manifestations that are not only physically uncomfortable but also affect patients psychologically. The water content in the stratum corneum is largely dependent on the composition and amount of intercellular lipids. These lipids regulate the loss of water from the skin and the levels of hygroscopic substances of the natural moisturizing factors, which are responsible for the retention of water in the stratum corneum. The prevention of water loss and the penetration of potentially toxic substances and microorganisms into the body are among the most important functions of the skin, acting as a natural frontier between the inner organism and the environment.

Skin barrier defects occur in several skin diseases; however, the influence of aging on skin barrier function is largely unknown, and conflicting results have been reported. In this review, the structure and function of the barrier in relation to the aging process are discussed.

### Comparison of novel aluminium lactate versus aluminium chloride-based antiperspirant in excessive axillary perspiration: First prospective cohort study [^113PWQFD]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Aluminium chloride-based antiperspirants are an effective topical therapeutic option for mild to moderate states of excessive perspiration. Its use is primarily limited by the occurrence of skin irritation, especially in sensitive skin types. The objective of this study was to compare the antiperspirant efficacy and tolerability of a novel antiperspirant with 12.5% aluminium lactate, and a 12.5% aluminium chloride-based antiperspirant. This cohort study was conducted as a two-sided self-assessment comparison between both preparations in healthy volunteers to generate self-care-related data.

Almost half of the participants stated that aluminium chloride was more efficacious than aluminium lactate; 22% stated aluminium lactate was more efficacious than aluminium chloride; 28% observed no difference in the efficacy of both preparations (p = 0.04). However, 88% described greater tolerability with aluminium lactate (p < 0.0001). In this study, aluminium lactate showed significantly greater tolerability than aluminium chloride, although the latter tended to show slightly greater efficacy.

### Topical moisturizer meaningfully reduces disease severity in atopic patients with xerosis [^115KVFQi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Repairing the epidermal barrier is critically important in atopic dermatitis (AD), but the effect of moisturizer on quality of life (QOL) is not well characterized.

- **Objective**: To assess whether the use of a moisturizer improves QOL in atopic patients with xerosis.
- **Methods**: Thirty-five (35) adults with xerosis and AD received a moisturizer designed for AD to apply daily for three months. Adherence was assessed with electronic monitors. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at baseline and follow-up.
- **Results**: Mean adherence to the moisturizer was 46%. Dryness improved from 1.9 at baseline to 1.4 at follow-up (P = 0.02). DLQI improved from 3.3 at baseline to 1.5 at 3 months (P = 0.005). The "feeling self-conscious or embarrassed due to their skin condition" DLQI item improved from 0.79 at baseline to 0.14 at 3 months (P = 0.0009).

Moisturizers are the foundation of AD treatment. Even non-medicated topical emollients can improve QOL in patients with AD.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^111XZHdx]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Dry skin is observed in 50%–90% of patients with end-stage renal disease and persists or even worsens despite dialysis. Pruritus is also reported in 12%–90% of patients with end-stage renal disease. Suggested causes of pruritus in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis include dry skin, the influence of dialysis membranes, and the effect of increased circulating pruritic cytokines. A descriptive study of the risk factors for pruritus in patients undergoing dialysis revealed more intense pruritus in patients with dry skin than in those with normal skin. Additionally, a greater number of dermatoses and longer duration of dialysis are reportedly associated with poorer scores on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a tool used to measure the quality of life (QOL) related to skin disease. For pruritus in particular, greater severity is reportedly associated with poorer QOL and higher mortality.

Dry skin in patients undergoing dialysis is regarded as a type of xerosis, for which treatment with a moisturizer is recommended. In Japan, heparinoid-containing products have been approved as prescription moisturizers and are used to treat xerosis associated with skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, senile xeroderma, and dry skin in patients undergoing dialysis. Pruritus is typically treated with antihistamines, but there is reportedly no correlation between the severity of pruritus and blood histamine levels in patients undergoing dialysis. In fact, antihistamines are ineffective in many cases of pruritus.

### Xerosis and pruritus as major EGFRI-associated adverse events [^115mNyMv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Quality of life during EGFRI treatment is an essential consideration for patients. Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrate the development of total and domain scores of FACT-EGFRI-18 over time. Scores on the physical domain were significantly higher during all six weeks compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The functional domain for all grades showed a significantly higher score in the sixth week compared to baseline (p = 0.039). In patients with grade 1/2, the dispersion in these domains is relatively low (Figure 2c). However, the social-emotional domain did show significant changes within the grade 3/4 sample (Figure 2d). Notably, there is a large spread in the "social-emotional" and "functional" domains for patients with grade 3/4 at weeks 0 and 1, which was consistent with the spread prior to the start of EGFRI treatment; in week 0, the standard error is negative, and over time, this spread decreases. For all domains and items, a higher score indicates a lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The total FACT-EGFRI-18 score decreased during treatment, reflecting a decrease in HRQoL.

- **Table 2: Domain and total scores FACT-EGFRI-18 per week**: Scores are presented in mean (standard deviation). Domain scores are calculated as the sum of all corresponding items, ensuring at least 50% of the items are answered for reliable calculation. The total score is determined by subtracting the domain scores from 72 (the maximum possible total score) and correcting for the number of answered items. Thus, low HRQoL is reflected by a high domain score and a low total score.

FACT-EGFRI-18 stands for Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–EGFRI.

### Treatment of dry eye disease [^116sEVJe]. The Consultant Pharmacist (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dry eye disease:

- **Definition**: DED, also known as dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic, multifactorial condition characterized by a deficiency in tear production or excessive evaporation, leading to ocular surface inflammation and discomfort.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of DED involves two main mechanisms: aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear deficiency is due to decreased tear production, often associated with age, autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, or certain medications. Evaporative dry eye is primarily due to meibomian gland dysfunction, which results in an unstable tear film and increased tear evaporation.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of DED varies widely globally, depending on the geographic region and the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from 5% to 50%. In the US, the prevalence of DED in adults is estimated at 5–7%, with rates 2–3 times higher in females.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DED include older age, female sex, contact lens wear, screen time, environmental factors such as pollution and low humidity, hormonal changes such as menopause, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and certain medications including antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and some antihypertensives.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of DED is characterized by symptoms of ocular discomfort, irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and visual disturbances. Signs of DED include conjunctival injection.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^112T6VKe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The implications for research in the area of topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis highlight several key issues that should be attended to in future trials:

- **Methodological quality**: Trial investigators should describe random sequence allocation, allocation concealment, and blinding when reporting trials. This would lead to greater certainty in conclusions.

- **Completeness of reporting**: Enhanced reporting of side effects and conflicts of interest is necessary.

- **Validated outcome measures**: This review emphasizes the importance of using validated outcome measures. Expert committees of dermatologists should define outcomes that would objectively assess treatment efficacy in seborrhoeic dermatitis. These measures should be streamlined and validated. In the interim, all trials should report the proportions of participants with complete clearance of symptoms.

- **Participant-oriented outcome variables**: Measures such as a quality of life index would enhance the objectivity of the efficacy assessment and provide participants' perspectives on treatment efficacy. Future research should consider using these measures in a standardized manner for outcome assessment.

- **Compliance with treatment regimen**: This clearly impacts outcomes for any mode of treatment. A summary documentation of actual compliance among participants completing trials could be used to stratify analyses of efficacy.

Longer-term assessments with follow-up of at least one year are needed because seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic condition with a high relapse rate. This approach will also enable better long-term assessment of side effects. A comprehensive treatment regimen is needed for sustained management.

### A randomized controlled clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of an active moisturizing lotion with colloidal oatmeal skin protectant versus its vehicle for the relief of xerosis [^111Q3bGX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Xerosis is a common skin condition, occurring most often in the winter and in low relative humidity, which results in loss of moisture, cracking, and desquamation. Many emollient creams and lotions are available for use as preventive moisturizers. However, few controlled experiments have been published comparing the efficacy of active moisturizing products versus the vehicle used to deliver the products to the skin. Therefore, we conducted this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study to objectively compare a commercially available moisturizing product against its own vehicle. The active colloidal oatmeal moisturizer used in this study showed significant benefits versus its vehicle control in several dermatological parameters used to measure skin dryness.

### Topical lifitegrast therapy for dry eye disease [^111e3e9W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

- **Unit of analysis issues**: We will use participants as the unit of analysis. For trials with a parallel design and only two arms (intervention 1 versus control or intervention 1 versus intervention 2), no unit of analysis issues will exist. In multi-arm studies, when three or more intervention groups are compared, we plan to combine groups to perform pairwise comparisons. For dichotomous outcomes, we will sum across both the sample sizes and the number of participants with events. For continuous outcomes, we will use methods described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to combine means and standard deviations.

- **Dealing with missing data**: We will use data imputed by the included studies, but we will not impute missing data except for estimating standard errors of the means, whenever feasible. We will use the intention-to-treat analysis for all analyses. We will contact study authors, as needed, to clarify a study's eligibility for the review, assess the risk of bias, and request missing outcome data. Two separate attempts will be made to contact the study authors, each two weeks apart. If we do not receive a response from the study authors within one month, we will use the information available in the published article, trial register, or protocol to the best of our ability.

- **Reporting bias assessment**: We will compare the results from published studies to those included only in unpublished reports when available (e.g. conference abstracts, trial registers, regulatory agency documents). We will also assess for discrepancies.

### Short- and long-term effects of two emollients on itching and skin restoration in xerotic eczema [^1122otcb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). High credibility.

Pruritus is associated with various skin diseases, dry skin, and, with it, an impaired skin barrier function. The study objective was to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of two emollients on symptoms and skin barrier functions in xerotic eczema. This was a randomized, double-blind study enrolling females and males with bilateral itching. Two emollients, containing lactic acid and refined almond oil with or without polidocanol, were administered on the left versus right body sides. Itching severity, skin moisture, lipid content, and pH were assessed on Day 1, within 30–120 minutes after the first administration, and on Days 7 and 14, and compared with baseline assessments. The severity of itching decreased 30 minutes after the first administration of both emollients compared with baseline (p < .0001) and reached a maximum reduction of 63% (p < .0001) and 69% (p < .0001) on Day 14. Skin moisture and lipid content increased after the first application and further improved within 14 days of treatment (p < .0001). Both emollients were well tolerated, and only a few adverse events were reported. This study confirmed the clinical efficacy of the two study emollients to substantially reduce itching already after the first administration and restore skin barrier integrity and thus should be considered a therapeutic approach for xerotic eczema.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^113A2CFQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: The primary endpoint was the water content of the stratum corneum (WCSC) at week 4. The WCSC was measured each day of evaluation, 1 to 2 hours after the start of a dialysis session. For each participant, a site in either the left or right hypochondriac region was designated as the measurement site. Measurements were conducted using the same instruments as a previous study: Corneometer and Multi Display Devices MDD4 (Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Köln, Germany). The corneometer measures WCSC based on the electrical capacitance of the skin surface (at approximately 15 µm depth), delivering values from 0 to 120 arbitrary units (AU). On each evaluation day, the WCSC was measured five times, and the average was recorded.

- **Secondary endpoints**:
	- **Skin dryness score**: A board-certified dermatologist centrally rated the severity of skin dryness on a five-point scale, according to criteria shown in supporting information Table S1. This rating was based on photographs of the hypochondriac region taken on each day of evaluation.
	- **Pruritus visual analog scale score**: Participants rated their skin pruritus at the study product application site on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0 mm indicating no pruritus and 100 mm indicating the worst possible pruritus) before the start of dialysis on each day of evaluation.
	- **Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score**: Participants assessed skin disease-specific quality of life (QOL) at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 by completing the DLQI questionnaire, which comprises six domains: "Symptoms and feelings", (further details continue).

### Benzaclin [^1134n7si]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

During clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse event in the BenzaClin treatment group was dry skin (12%). The actual incidence of dry skin might have been greater were it not for the use of a moisturizer in these studies. Anaphylaxis, as well as allergic reactions leading to hospitalization, have been reported during post-marketing use of clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Dry skin in the elderly: Complexities of a common problem [^113ivjFz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Dry skin, or xerosis, is a common condition in older adults but is not a normal part of aging. Geriatric patients may have several incurable but treatable chronic diseases that affect their skin. Xerosis in older adults is multifactorial, with contributing factors including intrinsic changes in keratinization and lipid content, the use of diuretics and similar medications, and the overuse of heaters or air conditioners. Xerosis causes pruritus, which can lead to excoriations and an increased risk of skin infections. Patients can mitigate the effects of xerosis by increasing ambient humidity, modifying their bathing techniques and products, and using emollients to replace the skin's lipid components. Care should be taken to avoid skin sensitizers such as lanolin, aloe vera, and parabens found in many emollients, as these may lead to delayed hypersensitivity reactions. This contribution reviews the intrinsic and extrinsic aging processes of the skin and advises practical changes in the environment and emollient application that can be recommended to patients.

### Moisturizers for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions [^115FyaAv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The maintenance of normal hydration is an important function of the skin. The stratum corneum provides an antimicrobial, antioxidant, and UV barrier and plays an integral role in maintaining skin hydration. Environmental factors and disease states may compromise the barrier function of the stratum corneum, leading to excessively dry skin. Evidence supports the use of moisturizers in the treatment of various skin conditions, and a wide variety of these products are currently available.

- **Pharmacologic and physiologic considerations**: The presence of moisturizing agents in a compound may not guarantee optimal moisturization effects. Factors such as concentration, bioavailability, and proper determination of moisturization effects, as well as patient-based considerations, can potentially influence the effects of moisturizer ingredients.

While moisturizers as adjunctive therapy have proven benefits in enhancing the management of certain dermatologic conditions, the incorporation of moisturizing ingredients into topical treatments may not translate into clinical benefit, particularly in the enhancement of skin barrier function.

### Elidel [^117XUxuG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Patients using Elidel Cream, 1% should receive the following information and instructions:

- **Serious side effects**: Elidel Cream, 1% may cause serious side effects. It is not known if Elidel Cream, 1% is safe to use for a long period of time. A very small number of people who have used Elidel Cream, 1% have had cancer (for example, skin or lymphoma), although a link with Elidel Cream, 1% use has not been shown. Because of this concern, patients should not use Elidel Cream, 1% continuously for a long time and should apply it only to areas of skin affected by eczema.

- **Use in children**: Elidel Cream, 1% is not for use on children under 2 years old.

- **Sun exposure**: Patients should avoid sun lamps, tanning beds, or ultraviolet light therapy during treatment with Elidel Cream, 1%. Limit sun exposure even when the medicine is not on the skin. If outdoors after applying Elidel Cream, 1%, patients should wear loose-fitting clothing to protect the treated area from the sun. Physicians should provide advice on other types of sun protection.

- **Application and precautions**: Do not cover treated skin with bandages, dressings, or wraps; however, normal clothing is acceptable. Elidel Cream, 1% is for topical use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, vagina, or rectum. Contact with these areas can cause burning or irritation, so immediately wipe off any Elidel Cream, 1% from these sites.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^1154aVAn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

This study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, before-after, parallel-group comparative study. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to groups A and B. In group A, the study product was applied for 2 weeks (period I), while in group B, it was applied for 8 weeks (2 weeks in period I plus 6 weeks in period II). Randomization of the participants was conducted before initiation of treatment. Study assessments were performed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

A heparinoid-containing product was applied for 2 weeks in group A and 8 weeks in group B. Informed consent was obtained before the start of treatment. Efficacy assessments were performed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. In patients who discontinued the treatment, final assessments were performed on the day of discontinuation.

The study product was a heparinoid moisturizer containing glycerin, petrolatum, and squalene as the major additives (Hirudoid Lotion 0.3%; Maruho Co. Ltd. Osaka, Japan). It was applied to dry and itchy areas, including the hypochondriac region (the site at which the WCSC was measured), in principle twice daily in the morning and after taking a bath (or at bedtime on a day without bathing). However, it was applied once daily after dialysis on the days of assessments, according to the study schedule. The amount to be applied was based on the fingertip unit, with 0.5 g regarded as the amount required to cover the area of two palms.

### Promoting a healthy skin barrier using skin care in people with mature skin xerosis [^113Par9u]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Most people are living into their sixties and beyond. Fundamental changes in chronologically aged skin have significant and widespread dermatological implications. This review discusses aging-associated alterations in epidermal function leading to xerosis and related pruritus and the benefits of maintaining or restoring a healthy skin barrier using skincare, specifically ceramide-containing skincare.

- **Methods**: A panel of seven dermatologists convened for a meeting to review aspects of xerosis in mature skin, skin barrier changes, and nuances in the treatment and maintenance of mature skin using gentle cleansers and moisturizers. From the selected literature, 13 statements were drafted. During the meeting, the draft statements underwent the panel's evaluation at a workshop, followed by a plenary discussion adopting five statements using evidence from the literature coupled with the panel's opinions and experiences.

- **Results**: The exact etiology of xerosis is not entirely understood and likely depends on several genetic and environmental mechanisms. Aging-associated changes in epidermal function include a marked reduction in total lipids in the stratum corneum relative to young skin due to reduced epidermal lipid synthesis. In aging skin, xerosis is significantly associated with pruritus. Studies have shown that lipid-containing skin care, such as a gentle ceramide-containing cleanser and moisturizer, promotes a healthy barrier, reducing xerosis and pruritus in individuals with mature skin.

### Roxybond [^11559wZ6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Roxybond is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Indications and usage**: Roxybond is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve Roxybond for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products):
	- Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,
	- Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Roxybond should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### Panretin [^115X2UkB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 1, a total of 268 patients were entered from centers in the U.S. and Canada. Patients were treated topically three to four times a day with either Panretin® gel or a matching vehicle gel for a minimum of 12 weeks, followed by an open-label phase for patients who had not yet progressed on Panretin® gel. Responses during the double-blind phase are detailed below.

Responses to Panretin® gel were observed in both previously untreated patients and in patients with prior systemic and/or topical KS treatment. A total of 72 patients responded to Panretin® gel during the randomized or crossover portions of the study. At a median duration of monitoring of 16 weeks, only 15% of the 72 patients had relapsed. Panretin® gel would not be expected to affect the development of new lesions in untreated areas. These new lesions were seen in about 50% of patients, with similar rates in treated and untreated patients, both responders and non-responders. The patients' assessment of their overall satisfaction with the drug effect on all treated lesions significantly favored Panretin® gel.

Study 2 was an international study with a planned enrollment of 270 patients. Patients were treated topically twice a day with Panretin® gel or a matching vehicle for 12 weeks. The study was stopped early because of positive interim results in the initial 82 patient data set. Responses to Panretin® gel were seen both in previously untreated patients and in patients with prior systemic and/or topical KS treatment.

### Aklief [^114NH4UC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

What should I avoid while using AKLIEF Cream? Minimize exposure to sunlight. You should avoid using sunlamps, tanning beds, and ultraviolet light during treatment with AKLIEF Cream. If you have to be in sunlight or are sensitive to sunlight, use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more, and wear protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat to cover the treated areas.

- **Avoid applications on certain skin conditions**: Avoid using AKLIEF Cream on skin areas with cuts, abrasions, eczema, or on sunburned skin.

- **Avoid certain skin products**: Refrain from using skin products that may dry or irritate your skin, such as:
	- Medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers
	- Soaps, cleansers, and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effects
	- Products that contain high amounts of alcohol

- **Avoid the use of "waxing" as a hair removal method** on skin treated with AKLIEF Cream.

What are the possible side effects of AKLIEF Cream? AKLIEF Cream may cause serious side effects including local skin irritation. Local skin reactions are common with AKLIEF Cream, are most likely to happen during the first four weeks of treatment, and may decrease with continued use. Signs and symptoms of local skin reactions include redness, scaling, dryness, and stinging or burning.

### Xerosis and pruritus as major EGFRI-associated adverse events [^112f8DzW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical and research endeavors in patients with various cancers who receive medical management consisting of EGFRIs have primarily focused on papulopustular eruption as an EGFRI-associated adverse event (AE), which results in an important decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, the study shows that xerosis and pruritus are also significant AEs with a major impact on HRQoL, justifying more focus on HRQoL related to these symptoms and their prevention and treatment in future research.

In clinical practice, xerosis and pruritus are infrequently discussed during patient counseling prior to treatment, as they are less visible than the more common papulopustular eruption. Providing patients adequate information about treatment and possible AEs has shown a positive effect on patients' emotional and physical well-being. Thus, counseling patients prior to EGFRI treatment about potential xerosis and pruritus is important, as well as taking preventive measures against these AEs.

### The science of skin: Measuring damage and assessing risk [^116eX5J2]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). High credibility.

Water is a main component of the skin and plays a key role in the physiological balance of important skin functions, such as barrier effects to external water, chemicals, and allergens. It also affects the biomechanical properties of the skin. The level of skin hydration has been associated with susceptibility to pressure injury, wound chronicity, and healing, as the condition of the periwound skin is a relevant factor for the progress of wound healing. Dry skin is prevalent in the aged population and is associated with a higher risk of itching, stinging, burning, skin tightness, and skin tears. Conversely, excessive hydration, also known as skin maceration, increases the coefficient of friction (CoF) of the skin and the risk of skin damage from friction and pressure. This, in turn, affects the mechanical properties of the skin. Epidermal hydration can be assessed using electrical, thermal spectroscopic, and microwave methods.

Measuring the electrical conductance of the skin provides a measure of hydration. For example, skin maceration — a condition in which corneocytes take up significant amounts of water — is correlated with an increase in the measured electrical conductance. This technique can be used to compare the effectiveness of various barrier creams by measuring the electrical conductance before and after repeated soak cycles. Skin hydration can also be assessed in studies of periwound skin near venous leg ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and pressure-prone areas of the sacrum as predictive information for wound healing potential or pressure injury development.

### Retin-a [^113QGcrH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind: Apply RETIN-A once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying RETIN-A every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. Wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying medication; it is important for the skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation.

It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Using too much may irritate the skin, waste medication, and won't provide faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying.

- **Cream**: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with RETIN-A (tretinoin) cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin, and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin.

- **Gel**: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job.

### Evidence-based skincare: The importance of offering moisturization, relief, and protection in common skin disorders [^114uPTKk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Skincare treatments should encompass moisturization, relief, and protection. Without these elements, treatments may be ineffective for common skin disorders.

- **Moisturization**: Adequate hydration is crucial to maintaining skin barrier function and preventing transepidermal water loss. Emollients and humectants are often recommended.

- **Relief**: Patients with skin disorders often experience symptoms such as itching and inflammation, necessitating treatment options that provide significant relief.

- **Protection**: Sunscreen and antioxidants are essential for protecting the skin against environmental damage. This protection helps to prevent exacerbation of skin conditions.

Overall, skincare regimens for common disorders should not only treat symptoms but also offer comprehensive care that includes moisturization, relief, and protection.

### Estimation of potential savings through therapeutic substitution [^117B5QvM]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic substitution offers potential to decrease pharmaceutical expenditures and potentially improve the efficiency of the health care system.

- **Objective**: To estimate potential savings through therapeutic substitution in terms of both overall and out-of-pocket expenditures of branded drugs when a generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Repeated cross-sectional study using the 107,132 individuals included in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010–2012) along with their reported prescribed medicine use. The Orange Book, company financial statements, US Food and Drug Administration records, and published research were used for adjunctive information.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Estimated excess expenditure due to branded drug overuse when a lower-cost generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

- **Results**: The study included 107,132 individuals between 2010 and 2012, of whom 62.1% (95% CI, 61.4%-62.8%) reported use of any prescribed medicine. A total of 31.5% (95% CI, 30.7%-32.2%) used a medication from an included drug class, whereas 16.6% (95% CI, 16.0%-17.1%) of the population used a branded drug from the included classes compared with 24.0% (95% CI, 23.4%-24.7%) who used a generic and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.4%) who used both. In the included drug classes, the majority of the drugs were generics, with a total of 93.5 billion standardized doses compared with 47.4 billion standardized doses of branded drugs. Total expenditure of the branded drugs acc

### Ciclodan [^115tvcXK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In the vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the US, 9% (30/327) of patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% (Nail Lacquer), and 7% (23/328) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material.

The incidence of these adverse events within each body system was similar between the treatment groups, except for skin and appendages: 8% (27/327) and 4% (14/328) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event, respectively. The most common were rash-related adverse events: periungual erythema and erythema of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% (Nail Lacquer) (5% [16/327]) than in patients treated with vehicle (1% [3/328]). Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included nail disorders such as shape change, irritation, ingrown toenail, and discoloration.

The incidence of nail disorders was similar between the treatment groups (2% [6/327] in the Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% (Nail Lacquer) group and 2% [7/328] in the vehicle group). Moreover, application site reactions and/or burning of the skin occurred in 1% of patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% (Nail Lacquer) (3/327) and vehicle (4/328).

### English version of guidelines for the management of asteatosis 2021 in Japan [^113g1PUa]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

This is the English version of guidelines for the management of asteatosis 2021 in Japan. Asteatosis, a synonym for xerosis, is found in a wide range of diseases that induce dry skin through impaired functions of either water retention of the stratum corneum or skin covering with acid mantle. Patients with asteatosis may experience pruritus. Moisturizers are the first-line treatment for asteatosis, and their adequate use must be recommended. The main purpose of the present guidelines is to define skin symptoms requiring treatment with moisturizers for medical use in patients with asteatosis. If deterioration, marked scaling, or scratch marks are predicted, therapeutic intervention with moisturizers for medical use should be considered even in the absence of pruritus.

Regarding six important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice (clinical questions), we evaluated the balance between the benefits and harm of medical interventions by referring to previous reports of clinical research, and we presented the recommendation grades and evidence levels to optimize the patient outcome through medical interventions.

### Tazorac [^116cUMvv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Apply a thin layer of Tazorac Cream only to the affected area once daily in the evening. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.

- **Important administration instructions**: Tazorac Cream is for topical use only. Tazorac Cream is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. If contact with mucous membranes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Wash hands thoroughly after application.

- **Psoriasis**: It is recommended that treatment starts with Tazorac Cream, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm²) of Tazorac Cream once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the cream. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of Tazorac Cream. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of Tazorac Cream to these areas should be carefully avoided.

- **Acne**: Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm²) of Tazorac Cream 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using Tazorac Cream [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Clinical significance of the water retention and barrier function-improving capabilities of ceramide-containing formulations: A qualitative review [^115xQnEC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

From among the 41 reports discussing the moisturizing and barrier function‐improving effects of ceramide‐containing formulations, we searched for comparative RCTs (which have a high level of evidence) targeting patients with skin barrier function disorders. After excluding studies that used skin irritation models in healthy individuals, we found 12 reports that targeted skin illnesses. The breakdown of these studies is as follows: atopic dermatitis, eight reports; xerosis, three reports; and hand–foot skin reaction, one report.

Most studies on atopic dermatitis targeted mild‐to‐moderate illness, and ceramide‐containing formulations were shown to improve skin function, such as by increasing water content and inhibiting transepidermal water loss. Below are outlines of several representative examples from these reports:

- **Marseglia et al**: Targeted patients with mild‐to‐moderate atopic dermatitis. They compared 72 cases in which a ceramide‐containing cream was used (mean age, 6 years) with 35 cases in which a cream base was used (mean age, 5.8 years). There was an obvious improvement in symptoms among patients who used the ceramide‐containing cream, and they concluded that the cream was effective for treating mild‐to‐moderate atopic dermatitis.

- **Sugarman et al**: Targeted patients with moderate‐to‐severe atopic dermatitis. They compared 59 cases in…

### Diffuse plate-like sheets of desquamation [^114Uc6WY]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

What is the reported appropriate next step in management for these refractory lesions?

- **A. Topical retinoid**: Incorrect. Traditionally, topical retinoid therapy has been used as first-line agents along with topical steroids and anti-seborrheic agents in mild cases.

- **B. Systemic retinoid**: Correct. Refractory cases have been treated successfully with oral acitretin 10 mg daily. Systemic retinoids should be considered with caution, as liver enzyme abnormalities can occur. The mechanism behind retinoids as effective therapy is unknown. One proposed theory involves retinoids causing upregulation of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, leading to local chemotherapeutic resistance in keratinocytes. Another theory describes the role of retinoids in aiding to terminally differentiate epidermal cells, leading to reduced uptake of chemotherapy within keratinocytes.

- **C. Ammonium lactate**: Incorrect. Ammonium lactate is not used for severe, refractory cases. It has previously been used for mild-to-moderate hyperkeratotic lesions secondary to ponatinib.

- **D. Mycophenolate mofetil**: Incorrect. Mycophenolate mofetil can be considered as a steroid-sparing agent for psoriasiform and erythrodermic eruptions secondary to tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, it is contraindicated in the setting of this patient's leukemia.

- **E. Urea**: Incorrect. Keratolytics, such as urea, have been used as initial therapy for mild-to-moderate ponatinib-induced rashes.

### Clinical evaluation of 40% urea and 12% ammonium lactate in the treatment of xerosis [^111ZcbBy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Urea and ammonium lactate are used for the treatment of xerosis, with different degrees of success. This study compares the clinical effectiveness of these two agents.

- **Objective**: To compare the effectiveness and tolerance of a 40% urea topical cream (Carmol 40) from Doak Dermatologics, a subsidiary of Bradley Pharmaceuticals, Inc, and 12% ammonium lactate topical lotion (Lac-Hydrin 12%) from Westwood Squibb, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, bilateral paired comparison study was conducted involving 25 men and women who were undergoing treatment for moderate to severe xerosis. The study included evaluations upon initiation of the study, following a 14-day treatment period, and treatment follow-up on day 28.

- **Results**: Eighteen study participants completed the entire 28-day evaluation period. Evaluation of treatment benefit was based on instrumental measurement of water loss from the skin surface, skin capacitance, skin desquamation, skin roughness, subject self-assessment of skin, and investigator evaluation. Results indicated that clinical observation ratings by patients and investigators, as well as instrument measures, show differences between the two treatments. Most measures show that improvement is achieved in less time with 40% urea cream than with 12% ammonium lactate lotion. On day 14, the 40% urea cream was superior to the 12% ammonium lactate lotion as measured by skin roughness, fissure reduction, thickness, and dryness.

- **Discussion**: At day 14 of treatment, 40% urea cream was superior to 12% ammonium lactate for most measures.

### Efficacy of a skin condition-adapted solution for xerosis and itch relief associated with aging [^113QPR7u]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

In recent decades, the stratum corneum (SC) has been recognized for its multifunctional role in maintaining the homeostasis of the human epidermal barrier. A better understanding of the SC's ability to act as its own biosensor in detecting dysfunction and integrating restorative actions can help identify the origin of certain skin conditions. A more holistic understanding of the morphological changes of the SC during the natural aging process and how it deviates in disease states can help bring about new treatment strategies. Some important recent clinical studies point to new treatments and add to the existing body of research on corneobiology. These studies offer some explanation of and validation for the various ingredients incorporated into moisturizers and barrier repair devices aimed at treating pruritus and xerosis associated with the aging skin.
