## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the probability of randomly selecting a four-digit number from 1000 to 9999 such that all digits are different and the unit digit is odd. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of four-digit numbers. Then, I should count how many of those have all digits distinct. Next, I will count how many of those distinct-digit numbers also have an odd unit digit. Finally, I will compute the probability and simplify the fraction to match the answer choices.

> Let me first confirm the total sample space. Four-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999, inclusive, so there are 9999 − 1000 + 1 = 9000 total numbers. Wait, let me verify that arithmetic: 9999 − 1000 is 8999, plus 1 is indeed 9000, so the denominator is 9000.

> Next, I should count how many four-digit numbers have all digits different. I need to ensure I handle the constraint that the first digit cannot be zero. For the thousands place, I have 9 choices (1–9). For the hundreds place, I have 9 choices (0–9 minus the digit already used). For the tens place, I have 8 choices. For the units place, I have 7 choices. So the total with all digits distinct is 9 × 9 × 8 × 7 = 4536. Hold on, I should double-check: 9 × 9 is 81, 81 × 8 is 648, and 648 × 7 is 4536, which matches.

> Now, I will count how many of those 4536 distinct-digit numbers also have an odd unit digit. The odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so 5 choices for the units place. But wait, what if the odd digit I pick for the units place conflicts with digits already chosen in the higher places? I need to consider two cases: when the units digit is not zero and when it is zero, but since the units digit must be odd, zero is not an option, so I only need to worry about overlap with the thousands, hundreds, and tens digits. Let me think about this carefully: I should fix the units digit last and adjust the earlier choices accordingly. If I fix the units digit as one of the 5 odd digits, I then have 8 choices for the thousands place (1–9, excluding the chosen odd digit), 8 choices for the hundreds place (0–9, excluding the thousands digit and the units digit), and 7 choices for the tens place (excluding the three digits already used). So the count is 8 × 8 × 7 × 5 = 2240. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I could just multiply 4536 by 5/10, but that would assume independence between digit uniqueness and parity, which isn't quite right because the constraint on the first digit changes the effective proportions. Let me reconsider: the case-based approach I just used is safer and yields 2240.

> I should confirm the arithmetic for the favorable outcomes. 8 × 8 is 64, 64 × 7 is 448, and 448 × 5 is 2240, so there are 2240 favorable numbers with all digits distinct and the unit digit odd.

> Finally, I will compute the probability. Probability equals favorable outcomes divided by total outcomes, so 2240 / 9000. Let me simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 40 to get 56 / 225. I should double-check that 2240 ÷ 40 is 56 and 9000 ÷ 40 is 225, which is correct. So the probability is 56/225, which corresponds to option B.

The probability of randomly selecting a four-digit number (1000–9999) with all distinct digits and an odd units digit is **56/225**. Here's the reasoning: there are 9000 total four-digit numbers. For favorable outcomes, the units digit must be odd (5 choices: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the thousands digit has 8 choices (1–9, excluding the units digit), the hundreds digit has 8 choices (0–9, excluding the thousands and units digits), and the tens digit has 7 choices (0–9, excluding the three digits already used), giving 5 × 8 × 8 × 7 = 2240 favorable numbers. Thus, the probability is 2240/9000 = 56/225.

## Total number of four-digit numbers

Four-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999, so the total count is:

9999–1000 + 1 = 9000

---

## Counting favorable outcomes

We need four-digit numbers with **all distinct digits** and an **odd units digit**.

- **Units digit (D)**: must be odd → 5 choices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
- **Thousands digit (A)**: 1–9, excluding D → 8 choices.
- **Hundreds digit (B)**: 0–9, excluding A and D → 8 choices.
- **Tens digit (C)**: 0–9, excluding A, B, and D → 7 choices.

Total favorable outcomes:

5 × 8 × 8 × 7 = 2240

---

## Calculating the probability

Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

[2240/9000] = [56/225]

---

## Final answer

The probability is **56/225**, which corresponds to option **B**.

---

## Verification of the answer

To ensure correctness, let's cross-verify the calculation:

- **Total four-digit numbers**: 9000.
- **Favorable outcomes**: 2240.
- **Probability**: 2240/9000 = 56/225.

The calculation is consistent and matches option **B**.

---

## Conclusion

The probability of randomly selecting a four-digit number with all distinct digits and an odd units digit is **56/225**.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Making sense of number words and Arabic digits: does order count more? [^10cd7b6e]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

The ability to choose the larger between two numbers reflects a mature understanding of the magnitude associated with numerical symbols. The present study explores how the knowledge of the number sequence and memory capacity (verbal and visuospatial) relate to number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Preschool children's (N = 140, M age-in-months = 58.9, range = 41–75) knowledge of the directional property of the counting list as well as the spatial mapping of digits on the visual line were assessed. The ability to order digits on the visual line mediated the relation between memory capacity and number comparison skills while controlling for cardinal knowledge. Beyond cardinality, the knowledge of the (spatial) order of numbers marks the understanding of the magnitude associated with numbers.

### Multimodal mechanisms of human socially reinforced learning across neurodegenerative diseases [^ac7c3a4f]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Behavioural data: socially reinforced learning task

We adapted an SRL task validated in a behavioural study with healthy persons. By pressing predefined keys, participants were asked to judge the category membership 'A' or 'B' of three-digit numbers presented repeatedly across six cycles on a computer screen. Visual feedback immediately followed each number–category judgement (Fig. 1A). Participants were informed that there was no underlying rule defining the category membership of each number. Knowledge of the correct or incorrect outcome of previous category judgements for a particular number served to enhance performance over subsequent cycles. The task comprised two feedback conditions. In the SRL condition, socioemotional feedback was given a single face with one smiling and one angry expression for correct and incorrect responses, respectively. The faces' gender matched the participant's gender. In the NSRL condition, feedback was given via green and red circles displayed for correct and incorrect responses, respectively. At the end of the experiment, participants were explicitly asked about the valence of each feedback type (Table 3). All groups presented adequate comprehension of these two factors (with no significant differences; for details see Supplementary material). Each trial consisted of an initial stimulus (a three-digit number) presented in white colour over a black background for 1500 ms, followed by a black screen (1000 ms) and then by categories' options ('A' and 'B') positioned to the left and right of the screen over left/right arrows, respectively. Participants had to respond by choosing a letter through the corresponding computer keyboard arrows with their dominant hand. Afterwards, another black screen was shown for a random period (between 2000 and 2500 ms). Finally, social or non-social feedback was provided for 1000 ms. Instructions and a set of two practice trials were presented before each block. The order of SRL/NSRL blocks alternated, with the first being social for half of the participants. Categories A or B were counterbalanced in a pseudorandom design across blocks. In total, participants completed six blocks (three SRL, three NSRL). Four different three-digit numbers (four trials) were repeated across six cycles per block. In total, 24 different numerical stimuli and 144 trials were run per subject. The number of trials did not change according to performance. For further details on the task design see Supplementary material. Accuracy and response time data were collected for each trial. During the whole task, high-density EEG recordings were obtained to assess potential electrophysiological differences between SRL and NSRL modulations across groups (see below).

### Association between socioeconomic status and Parkinson's disease: findings from a large incident case-control study [^87fa7bfe]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

Setting and participants

The present incidence-based case and control study was conducted between April 2021 and May 2022 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, which has the highest ethnic diversity. The source population included more than 1.8 million individuals above 50 years living in Tehran's 22 districts.

Case selection

Cases were people from the source population who were diagnosed with PD during the study period. For the recruitment of cases, out of a total of six referral centres in Tehran, two centres including Hazrat-e-Rasool Hospital's neurology clinic and Tehran's northwest clinic were used. All incident cases were diagnosed by at least one neurologist using the Movement Disorder Society's criteria. Out of a total of 543 new cases during the study period, 508 (response rate:93%) were included in the study.

Control selection

The study's controls were individuals without PD residing in Tehran's 22 districts at the time of the study. The clinical symptoms and signs of PD were explained at the beginning of the interview to reduce the probability of unknown cases being misclassified among the controls. Controls were selected proportionately to the population of Tehran's 22 districts using the random digit dialling (RDD) technique based on the RDD standard protocol. Phone numbers were created by adding four random digits to the area codes of Tehran's districts. At the time of the call, 5329 of these numbers were either non-residential or inactive. The remaining 1979 numbers were reduced by 609 since none of their family members met the eligibility criteria. A total of 1038 (response rate: 63.9%) of the 1370 eligible households agreed to participate in the interview; 23 were excluded due to incomplete interviews and 1015 completed questionnaires were included in the study (figure 1). The Kish method was used in this study to choose one participant from the eligible family members. The sampling date for controls and the diagnosis date for cases were considered as the index date.

### Exploring rural households' knowledge and perception of acute kidney injury in the Southern region of the Gambia: a mixed-method community-based cross-sectional study design [^10dee35d]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Sampling and sample size

We employed a multistage sampling technique to select communities, households and individuals for the interviews. The process was initiated by randomly selecting communities within each LGA boundary proportionate to the effect of AKI outbreak in the Lower River Region — 25 communities, West Coast Region — 23 communities, Central River Region — 35 communities and Upper River Region — 40 communities as in figure 1.

Figure 1
The map is adapted from the Ministry of Health's Epidemiology and Disease Control Acute Kidney Injury updates prepared on 14 October 2022. AKI, acute kidney injury.

Additionally, proportionate sampling was used to determine the necessary sample size per community based on the population of each community. At the community level, households were selected randomly using a taxpayer's list provided by the Alkalo of the local villages. A random number table was generated on the basis of four digits, and selection was done using a blind guess to point to a number. The next three digits were also selected until the required household sample was met. Finally, a simple random sampling method was used to select the respondents from each household. To be eligible for participation, respondents had to be residents of the selected household for at least 6 months and 18 years or older. However, guests and individuals who were sick were excluded from this study.

The estimated minimum sample size was calculated using the Epi Info software V.7.0. Using The Gambia's projected population of approximately 2 million, we used a 95% CI, a design effect of 0.05 and a precision of 99.9%. This estimation led to a sample size of 2000 respondents from selected households in AKI-affected districts across enumeration areas. With incomplete records and a non-response rate of 8.7%, we then recruited and interviewed 2174 respondents.

### Aftereffects of cognitively demanding acute aerobic exercise on working memory [^b177299d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Two-back task

Participants were presented with a continuous sequence of single-digit numbers from 0 to 9, and were instructed to press one of two buttons with their index fingers corresponding to whether the currently presented single-digit matched (right button) or did not match (left) the digit presented two previously in the sequence. Seventy-two stimuli were presented, and the first two trials were discarded, leaving 70 trials to be analyzed. Target stimuli (i.e. matched digits) within the remaining trials were pseudorandomly presented with a probability of 33% (i.e. 23 trials). Each stimulus was presented for 200 ms with a fixed stimulus onset asynchrony of 2500 ms, and thus the task duration was 3 min. Outcome variables for the two-back task included response accuracy and RT on hit trials (i.e. correct identification of matched digits) and correct rejection trials (i.e. correct identification of unmatched digits). We also assessed intraindividual variability (i.e. standard deviation of RT [SDRT]) on hit and correct rejection trials, which is considered as a measure of cognitive fatigue.

Switch task

Participants were presented with a continuous sequence of single-digit numbers from 1 to 9, excluding 5, which were enclosed within a solid or dashed square. This task asked participants to press one of two buttons with their index fingers corresponding to whether the digit was lower (left button) or higher (right) than 5 for the digit surrounded by a solid square, or whether the digit was odd (left) or even (right) for the digit surrounded by a dashed square. Seventy-two stimuli were presented, and the first trial was discarded, leaving 71 trials to be analyzed. The task (i.e. low/high or odd/even) changed predictably every two trials (i.e. AABBAA…), resulting in 36 nonswitch and 35 switch trials. All eight digits were pseudorandomly presented with equal probability. Each stimulus was presented for 200 ms with a fixed stimulus onset asynchrony of 2500 ms, and thus the task duration was 3 min. Participants performed four blocks of this 3-min switch task during the interventions in both cognition conditions. Outcome variables for the switch task included response accuracy, RT, and SDRT on nonswitch and switch trials. Data from one participant were lost due to experimenter error, and analyses for the switch task performance were thus conducted for 27 participants.

### Number processing induces spatial performance biases [^177809db]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Response speed in parity judgments is faster with the left hand for small numbers (e.g., 1 or 2) and faster with the right hand for larger numbers (e.g., 8 or 9). This effect suggests that number processing can induce systematic spatial biases in bisection tasks.

Method

Neurologically healthy participants bisected visually presented stimuli with a pencil. Stimuli were long strings of uniform digits (experiment 1) or lines with single digit flankers (experiment 2).

Results

Bisection performance was biased to the left of center for strings made of digits 1 or 2 and to the right of center for strings made of digits 8 or 9. Line bisection was biased toward the flanker representing the larger magnitude, regardless of its position.

Conclusions

These results extend previous findings and support the notion of an automatic association of number magnitudes with spatial response codes. The effect may be useful for an assessment of semantic number processing in special populations.

### Cost analysis of the PARENT trial of community health workers in early childhood preventive care: a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized clinical trial [^095b76c4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Uncertainty in DEX Estimates

DEX conveys the strength of the evidence from multiple sources by taking 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each estimate to create an uncertainty distribution for each result and report a 95% uncertainty interval (UI). A draw is a number randomly selected from the distribution, where a number that occurs more frequently is more likely to be selected. To propagate uncertainty in our analysis, 1000 draws for each of the unit costs were calculated with DEX results for 1000 draws for spending and 1000 draws for number of encounters; for example, the first draw of the unit cost was the ratio of the first draw for spending divided by the first draw for encounters. eTable 2 in Supplement 1 shows the frequency, mean unit cost, SD, and coefficient of variation of the 10 DEX conditions that were most frequently reported by parents, by service type and age category.

FQHC Revenue Model

In the PARENT trial, intervention participants were more likely to have completed all WCVs in a 12-month period compared with control participants. In the Prospective Payment System (PPS), for FQHCs, each WCV is reimbursed at a specified rate. Consequently, increased WCV attendance translates directly to additional revenue. We obtained the WCV 2021 PPS rate for each clinic and calculated additional revenue from greater WCV attendance, based on national guidelines for WCV periodicity, by age and a cohort of children who entered at birth and progressed through visits at each age. Our estimates used the intervention WCV attendance rates, the observed cohort size (minimum, mean, and maximum), and the 4 levels of payment (PPS) rates for the trial's 10 participating clinics.

To estimate recurring intervention costs, we used CHW salary and benefits at each of the clinics. Each CHW tracked their time devoted to intervention activities (including non–patient facing time such as follow-up and record keeping) on a random sample of days. These activities did not include training time, because this is a fixed cost, and the decision about continuing a service is based on variable costs. The recurring cost of the CHW was multiplied by the percentage of time devoted to the intervention and compared with the additional revenue.

### Dissociative and prioritized modeling of behaviorally relevant neural dynamics using recurrent neural networks [^535cb760]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Numerical simulations

To validate DPAD in numerical simulations, we perform two sets of simulations. One set validates linear modeling to show the correctness of the four-step numerical optimization for learning. The other set validates nonlinear modeling. In the linear simulation, we randomly generate 100 linear models with various dimensionality and noise statistics, as described in our prior work. Briefly, the neural and behavior dimensions are selected from 5 ≤ n y, n z ≤ 10 randomly with uniform probability. The state dimension is selected as n x = 16, of which n 1 = 4 latent state dimensions are selected to drive behavior. Eigenvalues of the state transition matrix are selected randomly as complex conjugate pairs with uniform probability within the unit disk. Each element in the behavior and neural readout matrices is generated as a random Gaussian variable. State and neural observation noise covariances are generated as random positive definite matrices and scaled randomly with a number between 0.003 and 0.3 or between 0.01 and 100, respectively, to obtain a wide range of relative noises across random models. A separate random linear state-space model with four latent state dimensions is generated to produce the behavior readout noise 𝜖 k, representing the behavior dynamics that are not encoded in the recorded neural activity. Finally, the behavior readout matrix is scaled to set the ratio of the signal standard deviation to noise standard deviation in each behavior dimension to a random number from 0.5 to 50. We perform model learning and evaluation with twofold cross-validation (Extended Data Fig. 1).

### Reinforcement learning increasingly relates to memory specificity from childhood to adulthood [^beea5b85]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To ensure that models within each comparison set were distinguishable from one another, we conducted recoverability analyses in which we generated 100 simulated datasets of 151 simulated agents. Parameters for each simulated agent were drawn randomly from uniform distributions with minima and maxima determined by the minimum and maximum fitted values from the empirical data. In addition, for the model with two initial q values, we constrained their non-transformed values to be at least 1 apart. For the model with a separate counterfactual learning rate, we constrained the non-transformed values of the counterfactual learning rates to be greater than −2 (so that its transformed value would be distinguishable from 0) and to be at least 1 apart from the choice learning rate. We then fit each simulated dataset with all three models in each model comparison set, and fed these first-level fits through the same second-level fitting and model comparison algorithm that we used with our empirical data. We then examined the proportion of the 100 simulated experiments for which the model with the highest exceedance probability matched the true, generating model.

### Psychological interventions that decrease psychological distance or challenge system justification increase motivation to exert effort to mitigate climate change [^a271fd13]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants completed 24 trials in total, presented in a randomized order. For half of the trials, credits were for a climate charity, and the other half of trials could benefit a control, non-climate-relevant food charity. The descriptions of these charities were tightly matched, both endorsed by the United Nations, with the climate charity described as an organization that "prevents climate change by reducing carbon emissions", while the food charity "prevents starvation by providing food". Credits were converted into donations at the end of the study and made to the two charities.

Work for environmental protection task (WEPT)

In the modified version of this task, participants made up to eight decisions of whether to screen a page of numerical stimuli for specific features (even first digit, odd second digit). Each completed page led to a tree being planted via donations to tree-planting organization. Participants were first exposed to a demonstration of the WEPT, identifying all target numbers with an even first digit and odd second digit. They then read information stating that planting trees is one of the best ways to combat climate change and that they would have the opportunity to plant up to eight trees if they chose to engage in additional pages of the task (one tree per completed page). Each page contained 60 numbers to screen for target numbers and displayed icons of eight trees, one of which was coloured green to mark their progress in the task. Participants were allowed to exit the task at any point.

Climate beliefs

Participants rated four items in terms of "How accurate do you think these statements are?" (0 = not at all accurate to 100 = extremely accurate): "Taking action to fight climate change is necessary to avoid a global catastrophe", "Human activities are causing climate change", "Climate change poses a serious threat to humanity" and "Climate change is a global emergency". The measure had high internal consistency in the large ICPC sample, (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93, n = 59,440) and in the participants included in our analysis (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94, n = 3055).

### Does antenatal micronutrient supplementation improve children's cognitive function? Evidence from the follow-up of a double-blind randomised controlled trial in Nepal [^3e84e143]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

We used a counting Stroop test to assess children's executive function. The number–quantity Stroop task involved three conditions. In each condition, the children were asked to name the quantity of items in rows of one to seven identical items. In the baseline condition, children were asked to name the quantity of X in a row (eg, the correct response to XX is 'two'). Second, in the congruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the equivalent digits (eg, 55555 = 'five'). Finally, in the third, incongruent condition, they were asked to name the quantity of digits in a number with the non-equivalent digits (eg, 1111 = 'four'). We recorded the time that children took to correctly name all items for each condition. We then derived two scores from these totals. An interference score was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the incongruent condition. This represented the potentially disruptive effect of automatic reading of the incongruous digits on quantity naming. A facilitation score was calculated by subtracting results for the congruent condition from those for the baseline, representing the enhancing effect of congruent digits.

Training of the testers was comparable to that for the US standardisation of the UNIT. The principal investigator (SD) was trained by two experienced UK-based psychologists (one clinical, one experimental, AK and FL) in the general principles of psychometric assessment and procedures specific to the UNIT and the counting Stroop test. She recruited two testers from Dhanusha district who were fluent in the local language (Maithili) and had a background in education and social science. The testers were trained for 15 days to administer the tests and practised under supervision for a week with children aged 10–13. We video-recorded the testers' practice administrations of the UNIT. These were checked by the two experienced psychologists to ensure adherence to standardised testing procedures.

SD and the two other testers administered the UNIT and Stroop tests in an office with minimal distractions located in Janakpur. The testers recorded the children's UNIT raw and scaled scores on a form with a unique child identification number. We checked each form individually and confirmed the scores using the proprietary CompuScore (V.1.1) UNIT software. These audited raw, scaled and standardised scores were double-entered into a Microsoft Access database. We identified discrepancies between first and second entries and resolved them by consulting the original forms.

### Lateralized neural responses to letters and digits in first graders [^ab365260]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that 6‐year‐old children display specific neural responses to visually presented letters and digits, both arbitrary visual shapes conveying culturally acquired meaning. Remarkably, this differential brain response to letters/digits occurred in a very fast presentation mode (< 170 ms per stimulus), low‐level confounds being controlled through random changes at every stimulus onset. These results suggest that already at the beginning of first grade, letters and digits give rise to specific neural responses, directly indicating selective modes of processing for one category compared to the other.

This novel finding goes beyond previous study where categorical responses emerged between familiar letters and unfamiliar pseudofonts (Lochy et al. 2016). At this age, children have had limited reading and arithmetic instruction, but they already possess letter and number knowledge due to early sociocultural and preschool‐related exposure to print (Wright et al. 1991; for digits see also Mejias & Schiltz, 2013; Hoffmann, Hornung, Martin, & Schiltz, 2013). Our results contrast with previous studies on the neuronal substrate of (differential) letter and digit processing in children. An fMRI study with 4‐year‐old preschoolers revealed greater selectivity for symbols (letters and digits) than objects (shoes and faces) processing in the left hemisphere, but no difference for letters versus digits (Cantlon et al. 2011). In a working memory task involving letters, digits or faces, 8‐year‐old children also did not show specific activation for letters versus digits (Libertus et al. 2009). Recently, an ERP study (Park et al. 2017) did not reveal lateralized response pattern for letters versus digits in 7‐ and 10‐year‐old children. Here on the contrary, inspection of topographies indicated that letters (vs. digits) are selectively associated with left occipital responses (PO9) and digits (vs. letters) to right occipital responses (PO10). In line with neuropsychological data (Starrfelt & Behrmann, 2011), topographies and amplitude values also suggested stronger discrimination abilities for digits than letters in 6‐year‐olds. While requiring further investigation, this might be because digits contain only 10 exemplars, and all (except 0) were presented here. In contrast, letters contain 26 exemplars, and only a subset was used (among which "J" and "Z", not very frequent in French). Finally, digits might bear a meaning by themselves, already known at this age, whereas letters do not mean anything in isolation.

### Neural association between non-verbal number sense and arithmetic fluency [^3b9765a4]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Numerosity comparison

Three dot arrays were presented simultaneously on the screen. The target array was presented in upper part of the screen, and two candidate arrays were presented in the lower half of the screen. Participants were asked to judge which candidate array contained the same number of dots as the target array. However, as this was not a matching task, the layout of the dots differed even when the number of dots was the same. For half of the trials, the total area taken up by the dots was the same for all three arrays. For the other half, the average area for a single dot (total area/number of dots) was the same for all three arrays. Dot size varied and dots were randomly distributed within a circle. Choices were made by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. The task comprised 120 trials that were divided into two 60‐trials blocks.

2.3.3 Simple addition

We used a simple single‐digit addition task. For each trial, an addition problem was presented in the middle of the upper part of the screen and two candidate answers, one of which was correct, were presented side by side in the lower part of the screen. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer by pressing the "Q" (left candidate) and "P" (right candidate) keys on the keyboard. There are 81 possible single‐digit addition problems starting from 1 + 1 and ending at 9 + 9. To avoid repeating the same problem more than once, this test only had 81 trials.

2.3.4 Simple subtraction

The subtraction problems were the reversed calculations from the single‐digit addition. Thus, there are 81 possible problems starting from 2 to 1 and ending at 18 to 9. Again, to avoid repeating problems, this test only had 81 trials. All other aspects of the task were the same as the simple addition task.

2.3.5 Character rhyming

Two Chinese characters were presented simultaneously on the screen. Participants were asked to judge whether they rhymed or not. This test had 120 trials.

### Beginnings of place value: how preschoolers write three-digit numbers [^82ad7c0f]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Place value notation is essential to mathematics learning. This study examined young children's (4- to 6-year-olds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e.g., "six hundred and forty-two"). Children's attempts often consisted of "expansions" in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0s or other insertions marking place (e.g., "600402" or "610042"). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e.g., 642). Potential experiences contributing to expanded number writing and the observed gender differences are discussed.

### Vortioxetine versus placebo for major depressive disorder: a comprehensive analysis of the clinical trial dataset [^4ac8f7a3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of studies of vortioxetine in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Data Sources: Abstracts were identified using PubMed by cross-referencing vortioxetine with placebo and randomize d. No language or publication year restrictions were used.

Study Selection: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials comparing oral vortioxetine monotherapy with placebo for acute treatment of MDD.

Data Extraction: Data were extracted with a pre-coded form, as follows: number of patients randomized, treatment group, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) response and remission rates, and mean change in scores from baseline and standard errors for the MADRS, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST).

Results: 7,269 subjects randomized to vortioxetine (n = 3,630) or placebo (n = 3,639) from 17 studies were included. The probability of receiving placebo did not predict difference in change in MADRS scores between vortioxetine and placebo (estimate = 4.1, P = 0.54). The standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% CI) for change in MADRS score for vortioxetine overall versus placebo was 0.33 (0.24 to 0.41) and was 0.24 (0.08 to 0.39), 0.33 (0.19 to 0.47), 0.26 (-0.06 to 0.58), and 0.44 (0.27 to 0.62) for 5-mg, 10-mg, 15-mg, and 20-mg doses, respectively. Greater difference in efficacy between drug and placebo was observed in studies with a low rather than a high placebo response rate.

Conclusions: Vortioxetine is more effective than placebo in improving depression, anxiety, and cognition. Less informative or uninformative studies obscured the true treatment effect.

### New designs for phase 2 clinical trials [^a90544dc]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary "response" variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, "treatment effects", are confounded with differences between the trials, "trial effects". Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.

### Concerns regarding… [^70dc23c9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Controversy about hyperparameter optimization of various machine learning models

In this study, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not described, even though different combinations of hyperparameters are crucial for model building and validation.

In the field of machine learning, using default hyperparameters may not be suitable for specific datasets. Lack of hyperparameter optimization can prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, leading to less stable performance, high heterogeneity, and insufficient robustness, which negatively affects model building and generalization. Different combinations of hyperparameters significantly impact the predictive efficacy of the model. Failure to adequately perform hyperparameter optimization may result in models that do not achieve optimal predictive efficacy. This causes selection bias in the model and ultimately leads to incorrect decisions.

Machine learning is prone to model overfitting and poor generalization if the built-in hyperparameters are not properly set. Therefore, hyperparameter optimization in the field of machine learning is a scientific, rigorous, and reliable practice.

### Multidimensional imaging model for diagnosing primary open-angle glaucoma using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images [^c92235a2]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Development of DL algorithm

This multidimensional imaging model used four basic CNN models (Swin_base_patch4_window7_224_in22k, Inception ResNet V.2, inception_V.3, Xception). First, only one type of image (ie, fundus photography) was used to train each independent CNN model. The training dataset was input to these four CNN models, and by iterating over batches of training data, the models automatically adjusted the parameters to minimise the loss function via a backpropagation algorithm. At the end of each training epoch, the training progress of the model was evaluated based on the accuracy of the training dataset. Additionally, various aspects of the network architecture, including the number of layers, the number of filter banks per layer, the size of the filters, the number of steps and the use of batch normalisation, were optimised by randomly exploring the hyperparameters, similar to the hyperparameter optimisation carried out for the feature-based approach. We selected significant hyperparameters and then uniformly sampled 1000 times for each training fold. The CNN model internally used the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function normalised at the hidden layer output to improve model stability. Simultaneously, the Adam optimiser was used for training the network. In each model, the Softmax classifier processed the input image features to output the probability that the subject was glaucomatous. The parameters with the highest AUC in the validation set were used to calculate the AUC in the test set. This process was repeated 5 times (5-fold cross-validation). Each fold randomly divides all the data into five parts and takes one as the test dataset. The remaining four parts are then equally divided into five parts; these are taken as one validation set and four parts as the training dataset. Repeat the above process five times.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Genetic susceptibility to cancer: the role of polymorphisms in candidate genes [^f9b8b5a4]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Continuing advances in genotyping technologies and the inclusion of DNA collection in observational studies have resulted in an increasing number of genetic association studies.

Objective

To evaluate the overall progress and contribution of candidate gene association studies to current understanding of the genetic susceptibility to cancer.

Data Sources

We systematically examined the results of meta-analyses and pooled analyses for genetic polymorphisms and cancer risk published through March 2008.

Study Selection

We identified 161 meta-analyses and pooled analyses, encompassing 18 cancer sites and 99 genes. Analyses had to meet the following criteria: include at least 500 cases, have cancer risk as outcome, not be focused on HLA antigen genetic markers, and be published in English.

Data Extraction

Information on cancer site, gene name, variant, point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI), allelic frequency, number of studies and cases, tests of study heterogeneity, and publication bias were extracted by 1 investigator and reviewed by other investigators.

Results

These 161 analyses evaluated 344 gene-variant cancer associations and included on average 7.3 studies and 3551 cases (range, 508–19 729 cases) per investigated association. The summary odds ratio (OR) for 98 (28%) statistically significant associations (P value < .05) were further evaluated by estimating the false-positive report probability (FPRP) at a given prior probability and statistical power. At a prior probability level of 0.001 and statistical power to detect an OR of 1.5, 13 gene-variant cancer associations remained noteworthy (FPRP < 0.2). Assuming a very low prior probability of 0.000001, similar to a probability assumed for a randomly selected single-nucleotide polymorphism in a genome-wide association study, and statistical power to detect an OR of 1.5, 4 associations were considered noteworthy as denoted by an FPRP value < 0.2: GSTM1 null and bladder cancer (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.6; P = 1.9 x 10(-14)), NAT2 slow acetylator and bladder cancer (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26–1.68; P = 2.5 x 10(-7)), MTHFR C677T and gastric cancer (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.31–1.77; P = 4.9 x 10(-8)), and GSTM1 null and acute leukemia (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14–1.25; P = 8.6 x 10(-15)). When the OR used to determine statistical power was lowered to 1.2, 2 of the 4 noteworthy associations remained so: GSTM1 null with bladder cancer and acute leukemia.

Conclusion

In this review of candidate gene association studies, nearly one-third of gene-variant cancer associations were statistically significant, with variants in genes encoding for metabolizing enzymes among the most consistent and highly significant associations.

### Dyscalculia and the calculating brain [^c12edb0d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyscalculia, like dyslexia, affects some 5% of school-age children but has received much less investigative attention. In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to "many" with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.

### Symbolic arithmetic knowledge without instruction [^d0ca42f7]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is fundamental to science, technology and economics, but its acquisition by children typically requires years of effort, instruction and drill. When adults perform mental arithmetic, they activate nonsymbolic, approximate number representations, and their performance suffers if this nonsymbolic system is impaired. Nonsymbolic number representations also allow adults, children, and even infants to add or subtract pairs of dot arrays and to compare the resulting sum or difference to a third array, provided that only approximate accuracy is required. Here we report that young children, who have mastered verbal counting and are on the threshold of arithmetic instruction, can build on their nonsymbolic number system to perform symbolic addition and subtraction. Children across a broad socio-economic spectrum solved symbolic problems involving approximate addition or subtraction of large numbers, both in a laboratory test and in a school setting. Aspects of symbolic arithmetic therefore lie within the reach of children who have learned no algorithms for manipulating numerical symbols. Our findings help to delimit the sources of children's difficulties learning symbolic arithmetic, and they suggest ways to enhance children's engagement with formal mathematics.

Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjects and methods

Study design and patients

This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 2 trial comparing PTCy with standard ATG as GVHD prophylaxis in patients receiving a RIC regimen before HSCT from matched sibling donors (MSD) or 10/10-HLA MUD in 11 French medical centers. The trial was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes d'Aulnay-sous-Bois (France). Eligible patients were aged 18–70 years, diagnosed with a hematological malignancy, including acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorder, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, and lymphoma, for which a RIC HSCT was indicated. Eligibility criteria for RIC HSCT included at least one of the following parameters: (i) patient age older than 50 years; (ii) heavily pre-treated patients who had received an autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) or with more than two lines of chemotherapy before HSCT; and (iii) patients with poor performance status because of significant medical comorbidities i.e. a Karnofsky score of at least 70. Only HLA-matched family donors and 10/10-HLA MUD were selected for the purpose of this study, donor selection was performed on the basis of high resolution (4 digit) typing of HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1. The complete eligibility criteria are in the protocol (Supplementary appendix 1). Mobilized PBSCs was the only stem cell source accepted. All patients gave informed consent.

Randomization

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PTCy (experimental arm) or ATG (control arm). Allocation was done centrally. Patients were included and assigned to treatment up to 30 days before transplantation. Investigators had access to treatment assignments at their own centers. The statistician had access to data, in keeping with the need to report to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.

### Genome-wide mutational biases fuel transcriptional diversity in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [^119257d3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Mutation and selection lead to transcriptional plasticity

Next we aimed to link specific transcriptional changes to genetic variants and to underlying mutational biases. It has been previously reported that mutations can create new Pribnow boxes (TANNNT motifs) that are recognised by sigma factor A, SigA, and lead to the overexpression of downstream genes. To test the influence of such mutations, we scanned all the single nucleotide variants across the 19 samples that either create or disrupt TANNNT motifs. We found 603 variants that created new Pribnow boxes in at least one strain and 81 that disrupted existing boxes (Supplementary Data 6). We investigated whether the observed impact on the Pribnow boxes resulted from stochastic mechanisms (i.e.g.enetic drift) or from non-random processes (i.e. selection). By comparing the number of expected versus observed occurrences (see Methods), we have obtained a probability of 0.006 for the observed number of disrupted boxes by chance and a probability of 2.5E−54 for the observed number of new boxes by random processes. So, it seems that non-random processes are acting to modulate the number of Pribnow boxes in the MTBC.

To test if selection is behind the observed number of boxes, we randomly introduced all the genomic mutations observed in the 19 strains and repeated the process 1000 times (Fig. 3a). We obtained a probability of 0 (z -score = 15.59) for having at least the same number of observed new boxes (n = 683) and a probability of 0.015 (z -score = 2.24) of having at least the same number of disrupted boxes (n = 81). Hence, it is unlikely that stochastic processes have been responsible for the observed occurrence of Pribnow boxes across the MTBC phylogeny. In addition, when we repeated this permutation test for other sigma factors' −10 consensus sequences such as SigE (cGTT), SigG (CGANCA) and SigJ (CGTCCT), we observe the opposite pattern (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Notes). Our observations support the hypothesis that new SigA boxes are maintained by selection and not genetic drift.

### Ventral midbrain stimulation induces perceptual learning and cortical plasticity in primates [^6d624b70]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Classical conditioning electrophysiology paradigm

Trials were initiated when the monkey fixated on a central white fixation point. After a randomized fixation period (1000–2000 ms), one of the five possible abstract visual stimuli was randomly selected and presented for 500 ms. A juice reward delivery 400 ms into the presentation of visual stimulus was dependent on the probability of reward associated with that visual stimulus. Each visual stimulus was associated with a unique color, shape, position on the screen and reward probability (0, 25, 50, 75, 100%). Stimulus presentation and juice reward delivery timing were recorded with a photocell. Spiking activity was amplified and filtered to 500–5000 Hz. Neural activity and photocell pulses were digitized at 12,207 Hz (PZ5 Neurodigitzer, Tucker-Davis Technologies). Spikes were manually thresholded and sorted to remove non-spike waveforms and remaining spiking data was combined as MUA (Plexon Offline Sorter). Peri-stimulus time histograms from −300 to +400 ms were constructed for each stimulus (bins = 10 ms). MUA was normalized to the mean activity during the baseline period (−1000–0 ms). From all the electrodes that had sufficient SNR to record MUA (eight of 34), we present data from a representative electrode with higher SNR although responses to reward predicting stimuli were consistent across electrodes.

Experiments 1 and 2 color discrimination task

Monkeys were first trained on an orthogonal color discrimination taskwith the purpose to disengage the animal's attention from the stimulus of interest (i.e. the gratings in experiment 1 and random dot patterns in experiment 2). Trials of this task began with a randomized fixation period followed by the presentation of one of two possible color targets for 500 ms. The color target (0.22° × 0.22° square) was positioned 7.5° above the central, white fixation point (0.14° × 0.14° square). After the 500 ms presentation of the color target, right hand responses were used to report color target A (more red) and left hand response were used to report color target B (more blue). Correct responses were followed by juice rewards. A left or right hand response was recorded when the monkeys hand interrupted an infrared light beam within the left and right hand box, respectively. The colors of the left and right hand targets were titrated such that performance was kept at ~75–80% correct responses.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^6d2dfdda]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

### A prognostic enrichment strategy for selection of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in clinical trials [^9bfc63a8]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Incomplete or ambiguous evidence for identifying high-risk patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome for enrollment into randomized controlled trials has come at the cost of an unreasonable number of negative trials. We examined a set of selected variables early in acute respiratory distress syndrome to determine accurate prognostic predictors for selecting high-risk patients for randomized controlled trials.

Design

A training and testing study using a secondary analysis of data from four prospective, multicenter, observational studies.

Setting

A network of multidisciplinary ICUs.

Patients

We studied 1,200 patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome managed with lung-protective ventilation.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We evaluated different thresholds for patient's age, PaO2/FIO2, plateau pressure, and number of extrapulmonary organ failures to predict ICU outcome at 24 hours of acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis. We generated 1,000 random scenarios as training (n = 900, 75% of population) and testing (n = 300, 25% of population) datasets and averaged the logistic coefficients for each scenario. Thresholds for age (< 50, 50–70, > 70 yr), PaO2/FIO2 (≤ 100, 101–150, > 150mm Hg), plateau pressure (< 29, 29–30, > 30cm H2O), and number of extrapulmonary organ failure (< 2, 2, > 2) stratified accurately acute respiratory distress syndrome patients into categories of risk. The model that included all four variables proved best to identify patients with the highest or lowest risk of death (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84–0.88). Decision tree analyses confirmed the accuracy and robustness of this enrichment model.

Conclusions

Combined thresholds for patient's age, PaO2/FIO2, plateau pressure, and extrapulmonary organ failure provides prognostic enrichment accuracy for stratifying and selecting acute respiratory distress syndrome patients for randomized controlled trials.

### The NASSS framework for ex post theorisation of technology-supported change in healthcare: worked example of the TORPEDO programme [^922ee8d8]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

The analysis identified interacting complexities in the TORPEDO programme which played out differently in different sites and settings. These are presented under the NASSS domains below. Direct quotes from the new primary dataset of ex post interviews are labelled "ex post interview [number]"; quotes from the original TORPEDO dataset are labelled with the original coding notation (e.g. 2282–005, with the first four digits indicating the original study site number and the last three digits indicating the participant number).

The condition

HealthTracker was designed for use in two kinds of patient: those who already had cardiovascular disease and those (usually asymptomatic) who were potentially at high risk of developing it. Established cardiovascular disease is well characterised, and guidelines for its management are relatively uncontested and widely accepted. The evidence base on managing cardiovascular risk is more complex. It is skewed towards a white European and North American population (especially the US Framingham study, on which the HealthTracker algorithm was partially based). Furthermore, since cardiovascular risk is a continuous variable influenced by multiple risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, HealthTracker could not offer an unambiguous binary categorisation of patients into "high risk" or "low risk".

In Australia (as elsewhere), cardiovascular disease is strongly patterned by socio-demographic factors: it is commoner in those who are poor, those with low health literacy, and in Aboriginal people. Such individuals are more likely to have comorbidities such as diabetes or mental health conditions ("High risk is a sort of multifarious set of component conditions" — ex post interview 2). They may also have cultural beliefs and practices that affect their ability and willingness to understand the risk communication and comply with preventive treatment.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^45deacdb]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

2.2 Measures

Descriptive statistics for all measures─separately by mode of response─are reported in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Descriptive statistics.

2.3 Cognitive outcomes

The 2021–2022 telephone survey included neurocognitive assessments of (1) auditory attention and working memory; (2) verbal learning and episodic memory; (3) letter fluency; and (4) semantic fluency. The Web survey included two assessments of episodic memory via (5) a verbal paired associates task and (6) a visual paired associates task. Each task on the phone survey was evaluated by a team of trained scorers; for most tasks, independent re‐scoring allowed us to identify and correct problems in scoring.

2.3.1 Auditory attention and working memory

In a "forward number span" task, participants heard increasingly longer lists of digits, one digit per second, and were immediately asked to repeat the digits in the same order. Each item provided two chances to repeat a certain length of digits; the task was discontinued if participants incorrectly recalled two sequences of the same length of digits in a row. Then, in a "backward number span" task, sample members completed the same task except that numbers were to be read back in reverse order.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### A BERT model generates diagnostically relevant semantic embeddings from pathology synopses with active learning [^8db551da]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Model performance in label prediction.

a The mean F1 scores and the standard deviation computed across four validation experiments for each label from the final models are shown. Our training strategy was to treat all labels independently. On average, the micro-average F1 score is 0.779 (Supplementary Table S 2). Interestingly, the label "acute lymphoblastic leukemia" and "acute leukemia" has the lowest F1 score (0.59 and 0.60), though its sample size in the dataset is similar to that of "acute promyelocytic leukemia" (0.94). This may imply the performance is not determined solely by data size; other factors also play an important role. b Marginal improvement with expert feedback on randomly selected cases is shown. Pathologists reviewed the model's predictions in 8 batches (100 randomly selected cases per batch, 800 cases in total). For each batch, the newly reviewed cases were added to the training set to re-train the model, and the updated model was used to make the next batch's predictions (Supplementary Fig. S 6). Dots represent each model generation's performance as judged by the hematopathologists. When tested against the validation set (lines), the model started at the micro-average F1 score of 0.779. With more labeled cases provided, the model's performance improves slightly to reach a maximum of 0.811, which shows that more cases only provide marginal improvement when randomly selected (i.e. not enriched for rare labels by active learning). We used the feedback to simulate this experiment on another three models. The values here are the average of the results from the four experiments.

### Factors associated with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder among US children: results from a national survey [^27d33ff5]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

NSCH data

NSCH is a population-based, cross-sectional, random-digital-dialing survey using a complex, multi-cluster, probability sampling design. This survey was sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Maternal and Child Health Bureau in partnership with the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The data were collected by random-digital-dialing households with children under 18 years of age from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the period of April 2007 to July 2008. A child was randomly selected from each of the sampled households to be the subject of the survey. The parent or guardian who knew the most about the selected child's health and health care was interviewed with questions over the telephone. The interview was conducted in both English and Spanish, and consisted of questions regarding demographics, child's health and functional status, health insurance coverage, health care access and utilization, medical home, family functioning, parental health, and neighborhood/community characteristics. A total of 91,642 children of age 17 years or under, with an overall weighted response rate of 55.3% were included in NSCH 2007 study. Population based estimates were obtained by assigning sampling weights to each sampled child for whom an interview was completed. Detailed information about the design of the NSCH is available at.

Study sample

According to the DSM-IV, the diagnosis of ADHD requires the child to experience ADHD characteristics such as lack of attention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity in at least two different settings, namely home and school; while previous studies also show that the earliest onset age for a child to be diagnosed and treated for ADHD can be below 7 years. As one of the two settings required for the diagnosis of ADHD is school, we considered children between 5 to 17 years old to be our study sample. There were a total of 68,634 responses given by the parents or guardians of children aged 5 to 17 years. Since the NSCH is a population based survey, the selected sample is a representative sample of children aged 5 to 17 years in the US.

### The association of APOE genotype and cognitive decline in interaction with risk factors in a 65–69 year old community sample [^ed76fecc]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Cognitive tests

Speed

Mental speed was measured with the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test, which asks the participant to substitute as many digits for symbols as possible in 90 seconds.

Reaction time (RT)

Reaction time (RT) was tested using a small box held with both hands, with left and right buttons at the top to be depressed by the index fingers. There were four blocks of 20 trials measuring simple reaction time (SRT), followed by two blocks of 20 trials measuring choice reaction time (CRT). Means were calculated after removing outliers. This was done by first eliminating any values under 100 ms or over 3,000 ms. Next, means and standard deviations were calculated for each individual for each block, and values outside three standard deviations from the individual's block mean were eliminated.

Memory

Immediate and delayed recall were assessed with the first trial of the California Verbal Learning Test, which involves recalling a list of 16 nouns. The interval between immediate and delayed recall was occupied by a test of grip strength.

Working memory

Working memory was assessed with the Digits Backwards subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, which presents participants with series of digits at the rate of one per second and asks them to repeat the digits backwards.

General cognitive impairment

The 11 item Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered primarily for screening purposes. However, the MMSE provides a reliable measure of mental status, covering aspects of cognition (in particular, orientation to time and place) that were not measured by the other cognitive tests.

Cognitive change scores were calculated for each test by subtracting Wave 1 scores from Wave 2 scores.

Candidate gene selection

Using version 63 (ALL) or version 64 (AML) of the COSMIC database, we compiled lists of genes relevant in AML and ALL. To do this, we used the Tissue search feature, selecting samples from 'hematopoietic and lymphoid' tissue followed by 'NS' for Subtissue type. For AML, we further refined our gene list by selecting 'hematopoietic' from the Histology menu and, from the subHistology menu, 'Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Acute myeloid leukaemia associated with MDS', 'Acute myeloid leukaemia myelodysplastic syndrome therapy related NOS' and 'Acute myeloid leukaemia therapy related'. For ALL, we selected 'Lymphoid Neoplasm' from the Histology menu followed by 'Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia' and 'Acute lymphoblastic B cell leukaemia' from the subHistology menu. Having filtered by tissue and histology, we selected all genes with sequence variation in our cohort, which yielded a list of 126 ALL-associated genes and 655 AML-associated genes. Thirty-four genes were shared between candidate gene sets. These genes are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Hypergeometric and permutation testing

Hypergeometric (Fisher's Exact) testing was performed using the 'phyper' function in the R software statistics package (version 2.15.3; available at http://). P -values (using an α = 0.005 to increase stringency) were generated by comparing the aggregate number of rare, non-synonymous, predicted deleterious variation in each patient group against either the matched mothers, the unaffected control population, the opposite patient group or the opposite group of mothers. Unaffected controls consisted of 12 unaffected Caucasian pediatric exomes.

Permutation analysis was executed in the R software package using the 'sample' function in the base package. Using this function, a distribution of the number of rare (not listed in dbSNP 135 or the 1000 Genomes Project), non-synonymous and predicted deleterious variants (per multiple prediction algorithms using Annovar)was created by performing 100 000 iterations of randomly selecting the number of genes identified via filtering (126 ALL-associated genes or 655 AML-associated genes).

Dideoxy sequencing

Confirmatory dideoxy sequencing was performed at Washington University's Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory using primers listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Social and medical history and medications

In an initial interview participants gave contact details, education (age at leaving school, further and higher education, and highest qualification obtained), main occupation (and that of their spouse for women), and age at retirement. Details of overcrowding at age 11 were obtained by asking about the number of rooms in their house at this time and the number of people living there. Smoking history and current alcohol consumption were noted. Disease history and current medications were obtained in a structured interview.

Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale

This assesses recent mood states. It contains 7 items for anxiety and 7 for depression. The maximum score on each scale is 21, with probable anxiety or depression at scores of 11 or over.

Cognitive tests

Mini-Mental State Examination

This is commonly used as a screening test for dementia. The maximum score is 30. Scores of less than 24 are used by some researchers and clinicians to indicate possible dementia.

Logical Memory I

This is a test of immediate verbal declarative memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale-III UK. It involves the immediate recall of a story with 25 elements which is read aloud. Two stories are administered, with recall after each one. The second story is administered twice. Participants are informed that they will be asked about the stories again later.

Verbal fluency

This task is said to assess executive function. The participant is asked to name as many words as possible beginning with the letters C, F, and L, and is given one minute for each letter. Proper names are not allowed and repeated words are scored only once.

Prior cognitive ability

Two tests that estimate prior cognitive ability were administered. Both the National Adult Reading Test and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading require the participant to pronounce 50 irregular words.

Digit symbol coding

This subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III UK was used to assess speed of information processing. The participant enters a symbol according to a given number-symbol code, completing as many as possible in two minutes.

Backward digit span

This is a test of working memory from the WMS-III UK. Increasingly-long strings of digits are read at a given rate by the tester, and the participant repeats them backwards.

### Utility of medical record diagnostic codes to ascertain attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities in populations of children [^e3051459]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Because the prevalence of cases in the cohort is relatively low, the number of cases is less than the number of non-cases. By minimizing misclassification error misclassification is roughly equally likely to occur in those predicted/classified as case and non-case status; as a result, we would expect a higher proportion of true cases will be misclassified as compared to that of non-cases, leading to low sensitivity and high specificity. One approach to overcome this sensitivity/specificity imbalance is assigning more weight to the cases during model training, thereby increasing the cost of misclassifying a case as compared to a non-case. Several case-weight options were considered in the derivation dataset, modeling prior probabilities for cases ranging from 10 to 75% (representing the proportion of LD or ADHD cases after different weights are assigned).

For each of these methods, additional factors were considered. The first was whether to include within the classifier all ICD-9 codes or a subset of codes that are plausibly related to the diagnosis in question. The former approach makes no presuppositions and uses all data, but may also increase the possibility of spurious associations or overfitting, especially as the number of events within the dataset is relatively modest and substantially less than the number of codes considered (3597). The latter approach may increase specificity, but may also miss important unanticipated associations. For the latter, experts in pediatric neurodevelopment, independently and without access to the data, developed a list of select ICD-9 codes that could conceivably indicate a diagnosis of LD or ADHD, respectively. The LD list included 38 unique ICD-9 codes and ADHD list included 34 unique codes (additional file 1).

### The genetic relationship between educational attainment and cognitive performance in major psychiatric disorders [^fc60a14a]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Trail-Making-Test (TMT)

The TMT is a measure of visual attention and task switching and is one of several executive functioning measures. The test consists of two parts, part A assesses psychomotor speed of the participant, and part B assesses switching between two automated tasks (counting and reciting the alphabet). The time taken to complete each part of the test was measured and the difference in time needed (part B-part A) was used, as it is considered a more accurate measure of the divided attention and alternating sequencing tasks tested in part B –. In this case, a higher score meant worse cognitive performance.

Verbal digit span

The verbal digit span, from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, assesses short-term (forward digit-span) and working memory capacity (backward digit-span). Briefly, participants were asked to recall verbally a sequence of digits, with increasingly longer sequences in each trial. For each correctly recalled string of digits, one point was given. The test was ended when the participant was unable to correctly repeat two presented strings of the same length. The difference between the forward and backward task is that the latter involves mental manipulation as the participant is required to repeat the digits in backward order. A score for each task was considered.

Digit-Symbol-Test (DST)

The DST is a subset of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scaleand measures processing speed, working memory, visuospatial processing and attention. In this test, the participant was asked to use a key of numbers 1–9 with coinciding symbols to draw the appropriate symbol that matched the number given. The participant was given 120 s to fill in as many corresponding symbols as possible. In the end, the correct number of symbols drawn was totaled to get an overall score.

Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT)

The VLMT is the German version of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test. This word-list learning paradigm assesses several memory parameters through serial list learning with subsequent distraction, retrieval after distraction and half-hour time delay, and through a recognition task. The test consists of two different word lists which are each 15 independent words and a recognition list which includes 30 words from the two lists and 20 similar distractor words. Four VLMT scores were rated, the first for the number of correctly recalled words from the first list, a second score for the number of words lost after distraction, a third score of words lost after a time interval, and a fourth score of correctly recalled words from the recognition list.

Pediatric coding — CPT within HCPCS and National Drug Code (NDC) usage explains that the American Medical Association (AMA) maintains and annually publishes CPT, CPT is level I of HCPCS, and HCPCS level II identifies products/services not in CPT and is produced and maintained by CMS; CMS often creates G codes within level II. For medications, drug products are reported by an NDC, a "10-digit, 3-segment number"; the first segment has "4 to 5 numbers" for the labeler, the second has "3 to 4 numbers" for strength and form, and the third is a "1- to 2-digit number" for package size/types; Medicare and many payers require NDC code reporting on medication claims.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^8785ac70]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The methodology of STEP 1 and 4 has been described previously.

2.1 Study designs

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial (Figure S1). Participants were randomized 2:1 to once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, with lifestyle intervention for 68 weeks. STEP 4 (NCT03548987) was a randomized withdrawal trial in which all participants received semaglutide during a 20‐week run‐in period (Figure S2). Participants reaching the once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg target maintenance dose at week 20 were randomized 2:1 to continue semaglutide or switch to placebo for 48 weeks. All participants received lifestyle intervention throughout the 68 weeks.

Both trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Protocols were approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each study site. All participants provided written informed consent.

2.2 Study population

Participants in both trials were aged ≥ 18 years with one or more self‐reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with one or more weight‐related comorbidity without diabetes.

In the sustained WM trial (STEP 4, NCT03548987), 902 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. Those completing a 20‐week run‐in period are being randomly assigned in a 2:1 manner to receive continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for an additional 48 weeks to assess WL (Figure 4, Table 1). Approximately 750 eligible participants will be randomly assigned. In addition, it has a withdrawal trial design to assess the change in weight after switching from semaglutide to placebo.

Sustained weight management trial design (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity 4). This is a 68‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐armed, multicenter, multinational withdrawal clinical trial, with 7 weeks of follow‐up without treatment for safety assessments, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) with placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, in people with obesity or overweight. *During the 20‐week run‐in period, participants start a dose escalation (visit 2 [week 0]) with semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity for 20 weeks. The run‐in period includes 4 weeks at the target dose (semaglutide subcutaneously, 2.4 mg once weekly).

In the long‐term WM trial (STEP 5, NCT03693430), 304 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo to assess WL (Figure 5, Table 1) over a 2‐year period.

### Shift schedule with fewer short daily rest periods and sickness absence among health care workers: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^34dcd44b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Randomization and Intervention

Between August 19 and September 10, 2020, hospital care units (clusters) were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either a 6-month shift schedule with minimal short daily rest periods (intervention) or a schedule maintaining the usual number of short daily rest periods (control). To ensure that units had comparable numbers of short daily rest periods, they were stratified by medical function into 10 subgroups (2–19 units each). In strata with an odd number of units, the extra unit was randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 conditions. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated sequence. Given the nature of the intervention, blinding health care workers or unit managers to a condition was not possible. Initial analyses were conducted by a statistician (S. A.L.) blinded to group allocation. Subsidiary and cost-benefit analyses were conducted without blinding.

After randomization in September 2020, units planned their 6-month shift schedules according to their assigned condition. Intervention units aimed to eliminate short daily rest periods in the schedules, but complete removal proved infeasible due to staffing constraints, absences, and last-minute shift changes. Human resources supported managers with guidance and sample schedules (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Intervention units could implement the 6-month intervention schedule in either half of the shift rotation year. Control units were matched by size and medical function to ensure comparable workload and work demands and to align observation periods (ie, reference and intervention periods), minimizing seasonal effects on sickness-related absence. They maintained usual shift scheduling with no changes in the number of short daily rest periods. The first intervention units implemented their schedules on January 11, 2021, with the final unit completing the period on May 22, 2022.

### Arsenic and all-retinoic acid for acute promyelocytic leukemia: yes, it really is as good as it seems [^7da4f2e5]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Another way to potentially optimize this therapy is to determine how much arsenic is really needed to achieve these high-quality outcomes. The selection of four cycles of consolidation with arsenic was somewhat arbitrary, and no one should lose sight of the fact that arsenic is a group 1 human carcinogen with neurotoxic and hepatotoxic effects. Identifying the minimum necessary number of cycles would be a worthwhile endeavor for the field.

Finally, lest we be too self-congratulatory about how well we are doing with this dreadful malignancy, let us not forget how many patients die of APL before their disease is recognized and treated. At present, in areas of the world that have complete access to standard-of-care leukemia treatment, most APL patients die because their care providers are unknowingly observing the natural history of untreated APL. The failure to recognize APL rapidly is a problem without an immediate solution. However, perhaps in this digital age, there is a ray of hope for this problem. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms combined with digital scanning technology may offer an automated way of identifying an APL patient, leading to the same sort of electronic red flag that occurs when a patient with a low electrolyte or platelet count is evaluated by an emergency room physician. We are probably not far off from that future.

2.1 Participants

A total of 32 healthy voluntary children were initially recruited for this study. Three participants were excluded due to either incomplete imaging data (N = 1) or the presence of structural image anomalies (N = 2). The ART toolbox was employed to detect artifact points with two criteria: (1) frame‐to‐frame displacement > 0.5 * voxel size; (2) signal amplitude surpassing three standard deviations above the average whole‐brain signal. Subjects were eliminated when more than one‐third of the time points exhibited artifacts. Ultimately, no subject was eliminated due to measurement artifacts. Consequently, 29 participants (16 males, mean age = 8.61 ± 0.92) were included in the analyses. All participants were right‐handed, had normal or corrected‐to‐normal vision, and had no history of neurological diseases. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all child participants, and the children themselves also gave their assent to participate in the study. Ethical approval of the study was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute.

2.2 Stimuli and Experimental Design

Each participant completed the dot number comparison task in the scanner and the basic arithmetic fluency test outside the scanner.

In the dot comparison task, all stimuli consisted of arrays of black dots presented on a gray circular area against a black background (Figure 1A). The number of dots ranged from 1 to 9. The total area and density were kept constant across all stimuli, while the element size of each dot and its presentation location were randomized. The numerical distance between stimuli ranged from 1 to 6, and the magnitude of the dot pairs and their numerical distances were orthogonalized. So, 12 basic dot pairs were used: 5–6, 4–6, 5–7, 2–5, 3–6, 4–7, 1–5, 4–8, 2–7, 3–8, 2–8, and 3–9. The order in which the two dot patterns within each pair were presented was counterbalanced, resulting in 24 pairs in total. Each pair was repeated three times, yielding a total of 72 trials. These trials were randomly distributed across three runs, each consisting of four mini‐blocks of six trials. Four rest blocks were interspersed between the task blocks in each run. The stimuli were presented in a pseudo‐random sequence, ensuring that no more than four consecutive trials required the same response side, and the same pair of stimuli was not presented consecutively.

2.6 Machine learning algorithms

To assess the efficacy of each diffusion metric for diagnostic prediction in BD, we evaluated the discriminative power of four classifiers: Ridge and Lasso regression, the Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and the Random Forest classifier, which were selected for their computational efficiency and excellent performance in a previous study with similar data (Salvador et al.). All possible combinations of algorithms and diffusion metrics (i.e. n = 4 × 4) were considered in pairwise classifications of the matched samples of healthy control participants and patients with BD. Specifically, the libraries kernlab, glmnet, and randomForest available for the R statistical software were used for the machine learning analyses. To have a non‐biased performance assessment, we applied the classifiers by implementing a stratified 10‐fold cross‐validation procedure, as described by Nunes et al. and Salvador et al. The optimal regularization values for the Ridge and Lasso classifiers were selected through internal cross‐validation within the training samples. For the GPC and the Random Forest classifiers, default hyperparameter values were used (apart from the number of trees in the Random Forest, which was set to 1000 as in two previous studies [Salvador et al.]). A simple bootstrap procedure was applied to the individual test predictions to obtain the 95% confidence intervals for the accuracies.

Finally, we also built algorithms that combined information from all four measures (FA, IASF, Dpar, and MD) in a single classifier. Specifically, we applied the three approaches that had provided the highest accuracies in a multimodal study previously carried out in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (Salvador et al.). On the one hand, we made simple classification updates by considering the average of the four prediction probabilities provided by the four measures. Alternatively, the highest of the four probabilities (in absolute value) was evaluated for prediction. Finally, a two‐step Ridge classifier was also applied, as described in Salvador et al. based on selecting the 20% most relevant voxels from each measure map and then carrying out a second fitting merging the voxels chosen from the four modalities.

### Association of identification of facility and transportation for childbirth with institutional delivery in high priority districts of uttar pradesh, India [^dc438a1b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Study design and participants

Community Behaviour Tracking Survey (CBTS), a cross-sectional quantitative survey, was conducted between June–October 2018 in rural areas of 25 HPDs of Uttar Pradesh by the UPTSU. The CBTS was designed to provide estimates of indicators of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (RMNCH) program at block and districts levels in the selected geography. Accordingly, four population subgroups were chosen for data collection to measure different indicators under RMNCH. The survey methodology of CBTS is detailed elsewhere. The Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) of this survey was the working area of an ASHA that caters to approximately 1000 people. Simple random sampling was used to select 20 CD blocks each among 100 and 194 CD blocks in 25 HPDs. Using a simple random sampling approach, 2811 primary sampling units (PSUs) within the selected blocks were chosen for one of the four survey groups i.e. the survey group with the maximum required number of PSUs. The required number of PSUs for the remaining survey groups were randomly selected from the already selected 2811 PSUs. For this analysis, data from a total of 2646 PSUs selected in Group-1 has been used. This process is depicted in Additional file 1. In each selected PSU, all households were visited to identify women who had a pregnancy outcome including live birth, stillbirth and abortion within 59 days preceding the survey. This timeframe was chosen to obtain more recent information to avoid possible recall bias. Overall, 13,908 women were identified based on the above criteria and 12,041 of them were interviewed (86.6% response rate). The majority of women not interviewed were not available during interview or had not returned from the facility or mother's place (92.3%) and 0.7% had died during or after delivery or abortion. Among the interviewed women, 9458 women who had a delivery 2 months prior to the survey excluding those who had an abortion, were included in the analysis.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE METHODOLOGY: methodology [^1ca4ad94]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

### High-dimensional topographic organization of visual features in the primate temporal lobe [^95bf78da]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Selection of representative images for 25D feature space

We built a 25D object space by passing 200 k natural images from ImageNet, an online database, through AlexNet, a neural network for object recognition whose deep-layer units were shown to nicely explain the responses of ITC neurons, and performing independent component analysis (ICA) on the responses of units in layer fc7. The 200 k images span 1000 object classes, with 200 images randomly selected from each class. We used unit activations before ReLU because a larger portion of the response variance could be explained by the same number of dimensions, e.g. 25 independent components (ICs) could account for 78.1% of the total variance in fc7 responses before ReLU but only 49.5% after ReLU. For each IC, 50 representative images out of the 200k images with the smallest and largest angles between their 25D IC coordinates and the IC axis were selected (0° ≤ angle between vectors ≤ 180°), with the two groups of images termed "positive" and "negative" representative images of the corresponding IC, respectively (Fig. 1; note that due to copyright restrictions, the original ImageNet images in all figures are replaced with natural images from Pixabay:). Each scan consisted of "positive" and "negative" image blocks from a single IC, presented in alternation. Besides the representative images for ICs, 50 images were randomly selected as a set of control images and were presented in all fMRI sessions to serve as a baseline. For a typical block sequence of the fMRI experiment, see Fig. 1e. Each image had a size of 11° × 11° visual angles and was displayed for 500 ms. Unless otherwise stated, each fMRI scan consisted of seventeen 24-s blocks and lasted 408 s. In each block, 48 images were randomly selected from the 50 representative images and presented in random order. Each scan consisted of 8 blocks of positive images and 6 blocks of negative images. The same number of positive and negative blocks were used in the analysis (= 6 blocks), as indicated by the dashed lines in the current Fig. 1e. Three monkeys (all males) and four human subjects (three males and one female) were scanned for this stimulus set. For each IC, 12.9 and 7.7 scans were collected on average for each monkey and human subject, respectively (17.7, 9.2, and 11.6 scans per IC for individual monkeys; 8.8, 8.4, 8.0, and 5.5 scans per IC for individual human subjects).

### Second to fourth digit ratio and prostate cancer severity [^27d0a2f0]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer. There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure, would be associated with more severe disease.

Methods

Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with digit ratios to determine relationships.

Results

African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95% confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio.

Conclusion

2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.

### A comparison of phase II study strategies [^ebb760ae]. Clinical Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional oncology drug development paradigm of single arm phase II studies followed by a randomized phase III study has limitations for modern oncology drug development. Interpretation of single arm phase II study results is difficult when a new drug is used in combination with other agents or when progression-free survival is used as the endpoint rather than tumor shrinkage. Randomized phase II studies are more informative for these objectives but increase both the number of patients and time required to determine the value of a new experimental agent. In this article, we compare different phase II study strategies to determine the most efficient drug development path in terms of number of patients and length of time to conclusion of drug efficacy on overall survival.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^1078e4fd]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Assessing the reporting quality of early phase dose-finding trial protocols: a methodological review [^d7990cda]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This methodological cross-sectional study evaluated the reporting quality of early phase dose-finding protocols. The study was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO (registration no: CRD42022314572).

Included protocols

To be included in this study, protocols had to meet the following criteria: 1) phase I or phase I/II trials that include a dose (de-)escalation component, 2) treated living humans, 3) had their full protocols in English, and 4) posted between 01/01/2017 and 08/02/2023 in. No restrictions were applied to limit types of intervention or setting. To identify the potential full protocols, an electronic systematic search was performed via. Details of the systematic search can be found in Fig. 1 and Supplementary materials. Examination of potentially eligible protocols was performed independently by two authors (GV and DP) based on titles and a first screen of the protocol; potential disagreements were resolved by a third author (CY). A random sample of 80% of all eligible trial protocols were selected for complete revision and 106 full protocols were finally included in the study.

Flow diagram with the identification of early phase dose-finding protocols via.

Variables

A standardised Excel spreadsheet was created to extract data from the included protocols. The following variables were collected for all protocols if available:identifier, study title, first author (or principal investigator), study sample size (of the dose-escalation component only), area of research, protocol year, research funding, multi-centre or single-centre study and type of the dose-escalation design.

Additionally, to evaluate the reporting quality of the protocols, a checklist of items was created as a combination of 1) original items from SPIRIT 2013 and modified items tailored to dose-finding trials and 2) additional items unique to dose-finding trials considered useful by the review team. The complete list of all 68 items can be found in Supplementary Table S1. The selected items were evaluated in all included studies. Each item was assessed as " Yes " or " No ". For some items, there was the option to select " Not applicable " and these items were not evaluated. For composite items, the option " Partially " was also available (examples of partially reported items can be found in the Supplementary materials).

### Increased intra-individual variability among individuals with ADHD: first evidence from numerosity judgment and verbal and quantitative reasoning [^5a80e075]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials

The PET is a high-stakes standardized test administered in a pencil-and-paper format. It comprises approximately 130 multiple-choice questions and lasts about three hours. The test assesses cognitive abilities in verbal reasoning and quantitative reasoning, together with proficiency in English as a Foreign Language. Each of the three domains is assessed by means of two different but equivalent chapters, each having a similar structure. The quantitative reasoning domain consists of quantitative problems and graphical inference (20 items in total in each chapter). The verbal reasoning domain consists of analogies, inference items, and reading comprehension (23 items in total in each chapter). The English Language domain consists of sentence completions, analogous restatements, and reading comprehension (22 items in total in each chapter). The online Supplementary Materials display several examples of items used in the PET.

ADHD diagnosis

The present study examined the data of 3243 examinees with a diagnosis of ADHD who had applied for, and received, test accommodations when sitting the PET. The ADHD diagnosis was confirmed (by NITE's experts at the point at which examinees had applied for accommodations) on the basis of a previously obtained diagnosis made by a licensed professional, in accordance with the Israeli Ministry of Health's current guidelines for assessing ADHD in adults. The assessment involved adherence to DSM-5 (APA,) criteria, administrating ADHD rating scales and supplemental tests, conducting a physical examination, and excluding other potential (differential) diagnoses.

To be eligible for test accommodations, individuals had had to meet strict criteria and provide extensive documentation confirming the following: (a) the onset of ADHD symptoms before the age of 12; and (b) significant impairment in academic, social, occupational, or other areas of performance due to these symptoms. Examinees who received accommodations were allowed a five-minute break after every two chapters. Some of them were also provided with an enlarged answer sheet and basic calculators.

### Time to recovery from severe acute malnutrition and its predictors among under five children admitted to therapeutic feeding units of general and referral hospitals in tigray, Ethiopia, 2020: a prospective cohort study [^213826da]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study setting and design

A prospective cohort study design was conducted among children aged 6–59 months admitted with SAM in selected general and referral hospitals in Tigray having therapeutic feeding units. Most catchment areas of each hospital are known to have districts that have been identified as hot spots for acute malnutrition by the Tigray regional health bureau. The cases were followed for a maximum of four weeks (28 days) and monitored on a daily basis starting from the date at which each patient is admitted to the therapeutic feeding unit until declaration of any outcome or if they are lost from follow-up.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All malnourished children admitted to these hospitals within the study period were included in the study as they are admitted to the therapeutic feeding units. Children with severe acute malnutrition in the therapeutic feeding units within the study period who were transferred from other health facilities, or if they have any deformity that hinders in taking anthropometric measurements precisely were excluded from this study.

Sampling

Sample size was computed using STATA, Version 14. In most of the literature reviewed weight was found to be significantly associated with recovery. The variability of 0.5 (SD) of covariate of interest was used, probability of recovery observed 0.824 and considering any particular outcome to be with 5% marginal error and 95% confidence interval of certainty (α = 0.05). Finally, the number of subjects needed to achieve a power of 80% and assuming no subject to withdraw from the follow up, the total sample size required was 232 with an estimated number of events (E) 191. From 16 general and referral hospitals, 8 of them were selected randomly (using simple random sampling) to be included in the study.

### Association of genetic variants linked to late-onset Alzheimer disease with cognitive test performance by midlife [^6af56807]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying the youngest age when Alzheimer disease (AD) influences cognition and the earliest affected cognitive domains will improve understanding of the natural history of AD and approaches to early diagnosis.

Objective

To evaluate the age at which cognitive differences between individuals with higher compared with lower genetic risk of AD are first apparent and which cognitive assessments show the earliest difference.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from UK Biobank participants of European genetic ancestry, aged 40 years or older, who contributed genotypic and cognitive test data from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015. Data analysis was performed from March 10, 2020, to January 4, 2022.

Exposure

The AD genetic risk score (GRS), which is a weighted sum of 23 single-nucleotide variations.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Seven cognitive tests were administered via touchscreen at in-person visits or online. Cognitive domains assessed included fluid intelligence, episodic memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and prospective memory. Multiple cognitive measures were derived from some tests, yielding 32 separate measures. Interactions between age and AD-GRS for each of the 32 cognitive measures were tested with linear regression using a Bonferroni-corrected P value threshold. For cognitive measures with significant evidence of age by AD-GRS interaction, the youngest age of interaction was assessed with new regression models, with nonlinear specification of age terms. Models with youngest age of interaction from 40 to 70 years, in 1-year increments, were compared, and the best-fitting model for each cognitive measure was chosen. Results across cognitive measures were compared to determine which cognitive indicators showed earliest AD-related change.

Results

A total of 405 050 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [7.9] years; 54.1% female) were included. Sample sizes differed across cognitive tests (from 12 455 to 404 682 participants). The AD-GRS significantly modified the association with age on 13 measures derived from the pairs matching (range in difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 2.5%-11.5%), symbol digit substitution (range in difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 2.0%-5.8%), and numeric memory tests (difference in mean cognition per decade increase in age for 1-SD higher AD-GRS, 8.8%) (P = 1.56×10–3). Best-fitting models suggested that cognitive scores of individuals with a high vs low AD-GRS began to diverge by 56 years of age for all 13 measures and by 47 years of age for 9 measures.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, by early midlife, subtle differences in memory and attention were detectable among individuals with higher genetic risk of AD.

### Phenotypic and genetic analysis of cognitive performance in major depressive disorder in the generation scotland: Scottish family health study [^dcc099c7]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Four cognitive domains were measured in Generation Scotland: processing speed (Wechsler Digit Symbol Substitution Test; recoding symbols to digits — DST), verbal declarative memory (Wechsler Logical Memory Test; sum of immediate and delayed recall of an oral story — LM1 and LM2), executive functioning (the phonemic verbal fluency test; using the letters C, F, and L, each for one minute — VFT), language (the Mill Hill Vocabulary Scale, Junior and Senior Synonyms combined — finding a synonym of a given word — MHVS) and the difference between logical memory immediate and delayed (LM1–LM2). The correlation between scores on tests of these different cognitive domains are reported in Supplementary Tables S1 - S4.

In addition to age and sex, we selected lifestyle factors (self-reported smoking and alcohol intake), socioeconomic status (the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation), medication usage (anti-depressants and mood stabilisers) and 15 genetic principal components to control for population stratification. These variables have been previously used as covariates in Cullen et al. 2015to investigate cognitive differences in depression using the UK Biobank cohort.

Genetic data

DNA of 20,128 GS:SFHS participants was analysed by means of high density genome-wide bead array genotyping (Illumina OmniExpress 700K SNP GWAS and 250K exome chip). We selected a set of unrelated individuals for use in our analyses, to remove the influence of shared environments. We removed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and individuals with a missingness of > 1% and removed rare SNPs with a minor allele frequency < 0.01 leaving 557,292 SNPs for analysis. We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysisto extract a list of genetically unrelated individuals from a predefined list of participants with a known MDD SCID diagnosis or controls. Seven thousand, one hundred and seventy-two unrelated individuals (relatedness < 0.025, corresponding to second degree cousins) were selected, of which 1042 individuals (14.5%) were diagnosed with either single or recurrent depression. One hundred and five individuals were removed due to the lack of self-reported medical background information. Another 25 individuals with self-reported Alzheimer's and/or Parkinson's disease were removed leading to a total of 7012 individuals, of which 1021 individuals (14.5%) were diagnosed with a form of depression.

### Trends of depression and anxiety during massive civil unrest and COVID-19 in hong kong, 2019–2020 [^b831f38a]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Both COVID-19 and unrest are posing a significant threat to population mental health across the globe. This study examined trends of probable depression and anxiety during a time of civil unrest and concurrent COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Four random digit dialing telephone surveys were conducted in July 2019 (n = 1112), February-March 2020 (n = 2003), April-May 2020 (n = 2008), and July-August 2020 (n = 2034). The prevalence of probable depression increased from 25.7% (95% CI: 23.2–28.3) in July 2019 to 28.2% (95% CI: 26.2–30.1) in February-March 2020, and then decreased to 15.3% (95% CI: 14.0–17.0) in April-May 2020 and 13.7% (95% CI: 12.2–15.2) in July-August 2020. The prevalence of probable anxiety was 19.2% (95% CI: 17.5–20.9) in February-March 2020 and then stabilized in April-May 2020 and July-August 2020 (14.1%, 95% CI: 12.0–15.8). Probable depression and anxiety were more prevalent among persons with high relative to low daily routine disruptions. Combined high unrest-COVID-19 stress was associated with probable depression and anxiety across all persons; high unrest stress alone was associated with probable mental disorders at high daily routine disruptions. Civil unrest and COVID-19 are jointly associated with depression and anxiety among Hong Kong citizens. While population mental health improved, daily routine disruptions is a risk factor of mental disorders at every time-point.

### Cognitive executive function in dystonia [^6e11b5d7]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Dystonia is a movement disorder considered to result from basal ganglia dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of frontal hyperactivity demonstrated in dystonia in imaging studies by examining executive function and working memory, in which the prefrontal cortex is known to be involved. We assessed 10 patients with idiopathic dystonia and 12 age- and IQ-matched normal controls. All subjects completed tests of first letter, category, and alternating category word fluency, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Stroop Colour Word Naming Test, the Missing Digit Test of working memory, a test of random number generation, a test requiring generation of self-ordered random number sequences, the Paced Serial Addition Test, a test of conditional associative learning, and finger tapping and peg insertion under unimanual, bimanual, and dual task conditions. The patients with dystonia did not differ significantly from controls on any measures of executive function or working memory used other than category word fluency and the extent of decline in tapping with one hand under dual task conditions when simultaneously inserting pegs with the other hand. For this small sample, the results suggest that unlike other movement disorders associated with fronto-striatal dysfunction such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, dystonia was not associated with deficits on the tests of executive function or working memory used. A more detailed investigation of cognitive function in a larger sample of patients is required.

### An overview of phase 2 clinical trial designs [^bf52c5c8]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments in humans. Typically, these treatments are evaluated over several phases to assess their safety and efficacy. Phase 1 trials are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new treatment, typically with a small number of patients (eg, 20–80), generally spread across several dose levels. Phase 2 trials are designed to determine whether the new treatment has sufficiently promising efficacy to warrant further investigation in a large-scale randomized phase 3 trial, as well as to further assess safety. These studies usually involve a few hundred patients. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs for clinical trials and emphasizes their critical elements and considerations. Key references to some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs are given to allow the reader to explore in more detail the critical aspects when planning a phase 2 trial. A comparison of 3 potential designs in the context of the NRG-HN002 trial is presented to complement the discussion about phase 2 trials.

### An event-based architecture for solving constraint satisfaction problems [^f2e7014a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a fundamental class of problems in computer science with wide applicability in areas such as channel coding, circuit optimizationand scheduling. Algorithms for solving CSPs are typically run on classical von Neumann computing platforms that were not explicitly designed for these types of problems. This paper addresses the question: how can we implement a more efficient computing substrate whose architecture and dynamics better reflect the distributed nature of CSPs?

Many dynamical systems that have been proposed for solving CSPs violate the 'physical implementability' condition. Non-physicality arises from the use of variables that can grow without bounds as the system is searching for solutions. On the other hand, there is a long, well-established tradition of studying physically realizable dynamical systems, for example, in the form of artificial neural networks, to solve CSPs or 'best-match problems'. Early attempts in this field used attractor networks, such as Hopfield networks, to solve NP hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problems such as the travelling salesman problem. These attractor networks, however, would often get stuck at locally optimal solutions. To overcome this problem, stochastic mechanisms were proposed, which require explicit sources of noise to force the network to continuously explore the solution space. While noise is an inextricable part of any physical system, dynamically controlling its power to balance 'exploratory' versus 'greedy' search, or to move the network from an exploratory phase to a greedy one according to an annealing schedule, is not a trivial operation and puts an additional overhead on the physical implementation.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^9f543c96]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^588d8957]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 shows the predicted mean step counts and 95% CI for the rest of the day, given the step counts accumulated from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. adjusting for age group, BMI group and sex. Overall, there was little difference in the conditional predicted mean step counts for the rest of the days between the weekdays and the weekends. On weekdays, participants who accumulated 6000 steps by 6 p.m. had a 0.692 probability of achieving 10,000 steps (all the goals) by the end of the day (refer to the Goal 3 diagonal line in Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, participants who had accumulated 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with a probability of 0.910, 0.982, 0.700, and 1, respectively. On weekends, participants who had accumulated 6500 steps by 6 p.m. 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with probability 0.852, 0.583, 0.947, 0.717 and 1, respectively. The step counts required to achieve 5000 and 7500 steps by the end of the day can be found in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### Shared and distinct neural circuitry for nonsymbolic and symbolic double-digit addition [^e42635f2]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Symbolic arithmetic is a complex, uniquely human ability that is acquired through direct instruction. In contrast, the capacity to mentally add and subtract nonsymbolic quantities such as dot arrays emerges without instruction and can be seen in human infants and nonhuman animals. One possibility is that the mental manipulation of nonsymbolic arrays provides a critical scaffold for developing symbolic arithmetic abilities. To explore this hypothesis, we examined whether there is a shared neural basis for nonsymbolic and symbolic double-digit addition. In parallel, we asked whether there are brain regions that are associated with nonsymbolic and symbolic addition independently. First, relative to visually matched control tasks, we found that both nonsymbolic and symbolic addition elicited greater neural signal in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, and the right superior parietal lobule. Subsequent representational similarity analyses revealed that the neural similarity between nonsymbolic and symbolic addition was stronger relative to the similarity between each addition condition and its visually matched control task, but only in the bilateral IPS. These findings suggest that the IPS is involved in arithmetic calculation independent of stimulus format.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^cbf53ee8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3.2 Change in body weight and

During the main treatment phase (from baseline [week 0] to week 68), semaglutide reduced body weight more than placebo (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1); observed mean weight loss was 17.3% (standard deviation [SD]: 9.3%) with semaglutide versus 2.0% (SD: 6.1%) with placebo (Table S1). After treatment withdrawal, body weight regain was observed in both the semaglutide and placebo arms (Figure 1A and Tables 2 and S1). Participants regained a mean of 11.6 percentage points (SD: 7.7) of body weight in the semaglutide arm versus 1.9 percentage points (SD: 4.8) in the placebo arm (Table S1). The net mean body weight loss over the full duration of the main treatment phase and off‐treatment extension phase (from week 0 to week 120) was 5.6% (SD: 8.9%) in the semaglutide arm versus 0.1% (SD: 5.8%) in the placebo arm (Figure 1A). At week 120, 5% or higher weight loss from baseline was observed in 48.2% of participants (95 of 197) in the semaglutide arm and in 22.6% (21 of 93) in the placebo arm.

### Machine learning for medical imaging: methodological failures and recommendations for the future [^eff32de1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Research in computer analysis of medical images bears many promises to improve patients' health. However, a number of systematic challenges are slowing down the progress of the field, from limitations of the data, such as biases, to research incentives, such as optimizing for publication. In this paper we review roadblocks to developing and assessing methods. Building our analysis on evidence from the literature and data challenges, we show that at every step, potential biases can creep in. On a positive note, we also discuss on-going efforts to counteract these problems. Finally we provide recommendations on how to further address these problems in the future.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^2896c284]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Trial sequential analysis

A meta-analysis should include a calculation of a required information size at least as large as the sample size of an adequately powered single trial to reduce the risks of random errors, taking into consideration the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis. Trial sequential analysis is a program that calculates the required information size for a meta-analysis, providing adjusted statistical thresholds for benefits, harms, or futility before the required information size is reached. Trial sequential analysis can thereby control the risks of type I and type II errors due to sparse data and repetitive testing of accumulating data. Meta-analyses not reaching the required information size are analysed with trial sequential monitoring boundaries analogous to interim monitoring boundaries in a single trial, requiring more stringent Z values to declare benefits or harms. If a trial sequential analysis results in insignificant findings before the required information size has been reached (no Z curve crossing of the trial sequential monitoring boundaries), the conclusion should be that more trials are needed to either accept or reject the intervention effect used for calculating the required sample size. If the cumulated Z curve enters the futility area, the anticipated intervention effect can be rejected.

For the trial sequential analysis calculations of binary outcomes we included trials with zero events by substituting zero with 0.5.

For the outcomes of total number of serious adverse events and total number of non-serious adverse events, we calculated the a priori diversity adjusted required information size (that is, the number of participants required to detect or reject a specific intervention effect in the meta-analysis) on the following assumptions: the proportion of participants in the control group with adverse events, a relative risk reduction or increase of 20% (25% for serious adverse events), a type I error of 5%, a type II error of 20%, and the observed diversity of the meta-analysis.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^945666c0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.
