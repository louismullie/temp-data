## Question

Ozempic indication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the FDA-approved indications for Ozempic (semaglutide) and how to distinguish them from off-label and brand-specific uses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact FDA-labeled indications for the Ozempic brand. Then, I should verify the evidentiary basis for each indication, especially cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Next, I will distinguish Ozempic-specific approvals from those tied to other semaglutide brands like Wegovy and Rybelsus. After that, I should review off-label uses and their evidentiary status. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and double-check for any inconsistencies across sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core indication. Ozempic is FDA-approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is the foundational indication supported by multiple randomized trials and reflected consistently across FDA labeling and pivotal studies [^d5d30350] [^2796f766].

> Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular indication. Ozempic carries a labeled indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, based on the SUSTAIN 6 cardiovascular outcomes trial showing a hazard ratio of 0.74 for MACE, which met both noninferiority and superiority criteria in that population [^d5d30350] [^f2fb4466] [^64fb595d].

> I need to check the renal indication next. Ozempic is also approved to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, supported by the FLOW renal outcomes program demonstrating a significant reduction in a composite kidney endpoint with hazard ratio 0.76, establishing disease-modifying renal benefit in this population [^d5d30350] [^4df0da42].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about obesity. I initially thought Ozempic might be approved for obesity, but wait, I should double-check the brand. Obesity indications belong to Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly), not Ozempic; Ozempic is not FDA-approved for weight management or obesity treatment, even though the same molecule is used at higher doses in Wegovy for chronic weight management in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with obesity or overweight with comorbidities [^e7226fe1] [^48b80a86] [^3d584436].

> Let me consider oral semaglutide to avoid confusion. Rybelsus (oral semaglutide) is approved for glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, and its cardiovascular outcomes trial (PIONEER 6) established noninferiority for MACE, but that CV risk reduction signal pertains to the oral formulation and is not a labeled indication for Ozempic, so I should not conflate them even though the active ingredient is the same [^217eb6b4] [^1e74f571].

> Next, I should review off-label uses. Off-label, semaglutide has been used for weight loss in adults without diabetes, but this remains off-label for Ozempic and should be distinguished from Wegovy's approved indication; moreover, real-world and guideline discussions highlight insurance barriers and supply constraints that complicate access when using Ozempic off-label for obesity, reinforcing that this is not a formal Ozempic indication [^57b61613] [^e5443d5f].

> I will now examine the evidentiary hierarchy to ensure I'm aligning strength of evidence with labeled claims. The glycemic control indication is supported by multiple randomized trials and is the primary labeled use; the cardiovascular risk reduction indication is supported by SUSTAIN 6 with robust MACE reduction; the CKD indication is supported by FLOW with clinically meaningful composite renal outcomes; by contrast, obesity outcomes derive from STEP trials using the 2.4 mg dose and are reflected in Wegovy's label, not Ozempic's, which is a critical distinction for prescribers [^2796f766] [^64fb595d] [^4df0da42] [^3d584436].

> But wait, what if a source conflates semaglutide indications across brands? I should confirm that any mention of obesity, MASH, or pediatric use is tied to Wegovy rather than Ozempic. Indeed, recent approvals for MASH and pediatric obesity apply to Wegovy, and while the active ingredient is identical, the indication, dose, and brand-specific labeling differ, so I need to ensure I attribute those correctly in clinical communication [^c096b85a] [^ac457089] [^48b80a86].

> Final synthesis: Ozempic (semaglutide) is FDA-approved for three indications in adults with type 2 diabetes: improving glycemic control as adjunct to diet and exercise, reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in those with established cardiovascular disease, and slowing chronic kidney disease progression and reducing renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD; it is not approved for obesity, weight management, or pediatric use, which are indications for Wegovy, and its oral counterpart Rybelsus is approved for glycemic control with supportive CV safety data but not a CV risk-reduction indication on its label [^d5d30350] [^f2fb4466] [^4df0da42] [^e7226fe1] [^217eb6b4].

Ozempic (semaglutide) is **FDA-approved** for three indications in adults with type 2 diabetes: (1) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control [^d5d30350]; (2) to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) in patients with established cardiovascular disease [^d5d30350] [^64fb595d]; and (3) to slow chronic kidney disease progression and reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, or cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^d5d30350] [^4df0da42]. Ozempic is **not approved** for obesity, weight management, or type 1 diabetes; these are separate indications covered by other semaglutide products (e.g. Wegovy) or are outside the current labeled uses [^e7226fe1] [^217eb6b4].

---

## Off-label uses

While Ozempic is **primarily indicated** for the above uses, some clinicians have explored off-label applications, including:

- **Obesity and weight management**: Although Ozempic is not FDA-approved for obesity, semaglutide at higher doses (Wegovy) is approved for chronic weight management in adults and adolescents with obesity or overweight with comorbidities [^e7226fe1] [^3d584436].
- **Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)**: Semaglutide has shown promise in reducing liver fat and fibrosis progression in clinical trials, but this remains an investigational use and is not an FDA-approved indication for Ozempic [^a6278623].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

- **Type 1 diabetes**: Ozempic is not indicated for type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: Ozempic should not be used during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks [^8fb66696].

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^e3742438]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism

The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid sidechain.

Excretion

The primary excretion routes of semaglutide-related material are via the urine and feces. Approximately 3% of the dose is excreted in the urine as intact semaglutide.

Specific Populations

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and renal impairment do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. The exposure of semaglutide decreases with an increase in body weight. However, semaglutide doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg provide adequate systemic exposure over the body weight range of 40 to 198 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. The effects of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Impact of Intrinsic Factors on Semaglutide Exposure

Patients with Renal impairment - Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in a clinically relevant manner. This was shown in a study with a single dose of 0.5 mg semaglutide in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, or kidney failure) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for subjects with both type 2 diabetes and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies (Figure 3).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89%. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure is achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. Steady-state exposure is achieved following 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean population-PK estimated steady-state concentrations following once weekly subcutaneous administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 65 ng/mL and 123 ng/mL, respectively. In the trial comparing semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg, the mean steady state concentrations were 111.1 ng/mL and 222.1 ng/mL, respectively.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 12.5L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%).

Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose.

14.2 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this trial, 3,297 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to OZEMPIC (0.5 mg or 1 mg) once weekly or placebo for a minimum observation time of 2 years. The trial compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between semaglutide and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,940 patients (58.8%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 353 (10.7%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 442 (13.4%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 562 patients (17%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. In the trial 453 patients (13.7%) had peripheral artery disease. The mean age at baseline was 65 years, and 61% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years, and mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 83% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (24%), hypertension (93%), history of ischemic stroke (12%) and history of a myocardial infarction (33%). In total, 98.0% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.6%.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^4df0da42]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OZEMPIC was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic renal replacement therapy, renal death, CV death (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.66, 0.88], p = 0.0003) as shown in Table 10 and Figure 7. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, progression to kidney failure and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial.

OZEMPIC also reduced the annual rate of change in eGFR (Figure 9), the incidence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint, consisting of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, and the incidence of all-cause death (Table 10 and Figure 8).

The treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint was generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including age, biological sex, eGFR and UACR. The treatment benefit on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline, but there were few events in these patients.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^f2fb4466]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority of OZEMPIC to placebo for time to first MACE using a risk margin of 1.3. The statistical analysis plan pre specified that the 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses would be combined. Type-1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.

OZEMPIC significantly reduced the occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio for time to first MACE

was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.95). Refer to Figure 6 and Table 9.

Properties and applications of semaglutide

The primary indication of semaglutide is type 2 diabetes. Currently, it is used as medication for adults who are obese or overweight, provided they have at least one weight-related comorbidity (for instance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol).

Semaglutide, as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, increases the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Addictionally, it supress glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells. It also contributes to a reduction in hunger and food cravings, and stimulates the satiety center in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing a feeling of fullness. It causes weight loss by reduced energy intake with minimal effects on energy expenditure.

Semaglutide is available in two forms: oral and injectable (under the skin fold). The structure of semaglutide in the subcutaneous formulation is presented in Fig. 5. Oral tablets of Ozempic are often administered once a day at doses of 7 mg and 14 mg, with an initial dose of 3 mg once a day for the first 30 days. Oral absorption of semaglutide is considerably faster than subcutaneous administration. However, other oral drugs should be administrated 30 min after swallowing the semaglutide tablet as they can disturb the absorption process. The elimination of this medication is very similar for both the oral and injectable form.

14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

OZEMPIC has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, metformin and sulfonylureas, metformin and/or thiazolidinedione, and basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of OZEMPIC was compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release (ER), and insulin glargine.

Most trials evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, and 1 mg, with the exception of the trial comparing OZEMPIC and exenatide ER where only the 1 mg dose was studied. One trial evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, OZEMPIC produced clinically relevant reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared with placebo.

The efficacy of OZEMPIC was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, diabetes duration and level of renal function impairment.

Monotherapy Use of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a 30-week double-blind trial (NCT02054897), 388 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with diet and exercise were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg or OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly or placebo. Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 54% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 4.2 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 64% were White, 8% were Black or African American, and 21% were Asian; 30% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials, 744 (23.6%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 102 OZEMPIC-treated patients (3.2%) patients were 75 years of age and over. In SUSTAIN 6, the cardiovascular outcome trial, 788 (48%) OZEMPIC-treated patients were 65 years of age and over and 157 OZEMPIC-treated patients (9.6%) patients were 75 years of age and over.

No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including kidney failure, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of OZEMPIC is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a study in subjects with different degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in semaglutide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pool of Placebo- and Active-Controlled Trials

The occurrence of adverse reactions was also evaluated in a larger pool of patients with type 2 diabetes

participating in 7 placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] including two trials in Japanese patients evaluating the use of OZEMPIC as monotherapy and add-on therapy to oral medications or insulin. In this pool, a total of 3150 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with OZEMPIC for a mean duration of 44.9 weeks. Across the treatment arms, the mean age of patients was 57 years, 3.2% were 75 years or older and 57% were male. In these trials, 60% were White, 6% were Black or African American, and 31% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, patients had type 2 diabetes for an average of 8.2 years and had a mean HbA1cof 8.2%. At baseline, 7.8% of the population reported retinopathy. Baseline estimated renal function was normal (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2) in 63.1%, mildly impaired (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73m2) in 34.3%, and moderately impaired (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m2) in 2.5% of the patients.

### The ethics of ozempic and wegovy [^71dec911]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, sold under the brand names of Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy, is one of the most popular drugs on the market. Manufactured by Novo Nordisk, semaglutide is the newest in a family of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists used most commonly to treat type II diabetes. To date, the results of semaglutide for the treatment of type II diabetes have been overwhelmingly positive. It is for the drug's effects on appetite suppression and weight loss, however, that have led its surge in popularity, with many hailing semaglutide as the new 'miracle drug for weight loss'. Despite its popularity, both the governmental and popular reception to the drug has largely been mixed. In this paper, we address a range of ethical concerns and argue that while many are legitimate, they do not provide conclusive reason not to prescribe semaglutide for weight loss.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of OZEMPIC of approximately 1 week.

### Semaglutide in the spotlight: weighing benefits against rising concerns [^e53e1f29]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

The recent surge in popularity of the antidiabetic drug, Semaglutide, marketed under the names Wegovy (which has the highest concentration of the active drug), Rybelsus, and Ozempic, for its notable efficacy in weight loss has raised pertinent considerations. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that is administered once weekly. It is effective in reducing hemoglobin A1C levels and promoting weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Further studies demonstrated significant weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors with evidence showing good toleration, although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common.

While it is commendable to find a drug that offers promising results beyond its primary intended purpose, the skyrocketing demand in developed nations necessitates vigilance.

First and foremost, there is potential for off-label abuse. With societal pressure to attain perceived ideal body weights, it is conceivable that individuals may seek this medication outside of its primary indication, potentially exposing themselves to unforeseen risks. Long-term side effects, especially when taken by non-diabetics, are not yet well documented and require continued monitoring.

Furthermore, the surge in demand can invariably drive up costs. This inflation could inadvertently limit access for diabetic patients who genuinely require Semaglutide for glycemic control. Price escalation also means increased out-of-pocket expenses, further burdening the healthcare systems of many developed countries and by extension, stifling the likelihood of patronage and usage in low- and middle-income countries.

It is imperative that endocrinologists and by extension other medical professionals, policymakers, strategic stakeholders, and regulatory bodies remain vigilant. Best still, it is most convenient to note that Semaglutide is a prescription medication and should be used under the guidance of a physician. It is not intended for recreational or non-medical use. Ongoing research, public awareness campaigns about potential risks, a vetting system for usage, and a structured pricing mechanism are vital to ensuring that Semaglutide remains both accessible and safe.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are limited data with semaglutide use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. There are clinical considerations regarding the risks of poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to semaglutide during pregnancy. OZEMPIC should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal clinical exposure based on AUC. In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys administered semaglutide during organogenesis, early pregnancy losses or structural abnormalities were observed at clinical exposure (rabbit) and ≥ 2-fold the MRHD (monkey). These findings coincided with a marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species (see Data).

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

### Prescription fills for semaglutide products by payment method [^bd5decb6]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The number of prescriptions filled for semaglutide has increased substantially, reaching 2.6 million prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies by December 2023. While Ozempic persistently accounted for most semaglutide fills, increases were considerably greater for Wegovy since its approval for weight loss in June 2021. These increases, which primarily occurred following increased awareness of weight-loss benefits in late 2022, are likely contributing to the FDA-reported shortage of Ozempic and Wegovy first issued in March 2022. Despite the disproportionate burden of obesity in Medicaid and Medicare Part D populations, and recent increases in public spending on weight-loss medications, most Wegovy fills were for the commercially insured. Limitations of this study include a lack of data on individual-level variables (age, race, and ethnicity) and indications for use (diabetes or obesity). Future research should examine how changes in Medicare Part D and Medicaid coverage restrictions influence disparities in access to these essential medications.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose and reduces body weight. All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mean 24-hour Plasma Glucose Profiles (standardized meals) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo

Insulin Secretion

Both first-and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with OZEMPIC compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo, fasting glucagon (8%), postprandial glucagon response (14 to 15%), and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration (12%).

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was similar to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate Versus Glucose Concentration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during Graded Glucose Infusion before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo and in Untreated Healthy Subjects

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady-state.

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in the studies described below with the incidence of ADAs in other studies, including those of semaglutide or of other semaglutide products.

Across the placebo- and active-controlled glycemic control trials, 32 out of 3,150 (1%) OZEMPIC-treated patients developed ADAs to the active ingredient in OZEMPIC (i.e., semaglutide). Of the 32 semaglutide- treated patients that developed semaglutide ADAs, 19 patients (0.6% of the overall population) developed antibodies cross-reacting with native GLP-1. The in vitro neutralizing activity of the antibodies is uncertain at this time.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether OZEMPIC causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of OZEMPIC and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with OZEMPIC. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of OZEMPIC, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue OZEMPIC and initiate appropriate management.

### Factors associated with semaglutide initiation among adults with obesity [^e5443d5f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Demand for novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications like semaglutide (eg, Wegovy or Ozempic) and tirzepatide (eg, Zepbound or Mounjaro) has quickly escalated. Approximately 6% of the US population reports currently taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist, but the proportion among individuals who report being told by a physician that they have overweight or obesity is closer to 1 in 5. In the US, 73.6% of the population has overweight or obesity. Historically, GLP-1 receptor agonists were exclusively approved to treat type 2 diabetes, but recent clinical trials concluded that they are highly effective at weight management and cardiovascular disease prevention, leading to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for these indications.

Individuals with obesity but without diabetes represent a unique population in the context of metabolic health. This subgroup, while sometimes characterized as metabolically healthy due to the lack of prevalent disease, is at elevated risk of developing diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions compared with individuals without obesity. They may be undertreated due to clinician and patient perceptions of risk and are often left behind in the metabolic care paradigm that focuses on obesity as a risk factor, not a disease. Individuals with concurrent dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are more likely to receive lifestyle counseling compared with those with obesity alone. This treatment paradigm appears to persist despite the approval of the novel GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity, with only 25% of patients obtaining payer coverage for new Wegovy prescriptions, which is indicated for weight management, compared with nearly triple the success rate for Ozempic, which is indicated for diabetes.

5.7 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of OZEMPIC has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In OZEMPIC clinical trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving OZEMPIC (0.5 mg 0.4%, 1 mg 0.8%) than placebo (0%).

OZEMPIC is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with OZEMPIC. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of OZEMPIC; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous hypersensitivity to OZEMPIC [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with OZEMPIC.

5.9 Acute Gallbladder Disease

Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In placebo-controlled trials, cholelithiasis was reported in 1.5% and 0.4% of patients-treated with OZEMPIC 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively. Cholelithiasis was not reported in placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

5.10 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

OZEMPIC delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking OZEMPIC, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing OZEMPIC could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking OZEMPIC.

11 DESCRIPTION

OZEMPIC (semaglutide) injection, for subcutaneous use, contains semaglutide, a human GLP-1 receptor agonist (or GLP-1 analog). The peptide backbone is produced by yeast fermentation. The main protraction mechanism of semaglutide is albumin binding, facilitated by modification of position 26 lysine with a hydrophilic spacer and a C18 fatty di-acid. Furthermore, semaglutide is modified in position 8 to provide stabilization against degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4). A minor modification was made in position 34 to ensure the attachment of only one fatty di-acid. The molecular formula is C187H291N45O59and the molecular weight is 4113.58 g/mol.

Structural formula:

OZEMPIC is a sterile, aqueous, clear, colorless solution. Each 3 mL prefilled single-patient use pen contains semaglutide 2 mg (0.68 mg/mL), 4 mg (1.34 mg/mL), or 8 mg (2.68 mg/mL). Each 1 mL of OZEMPIC solution also contains the following inactive ingredients: disodium phosphate dihydrate, 1.42 mg; propylene glycol, 14 mg; phenol, 5.5 mg; and water for injections. OZEMPIC has a pH of approximately 7.4. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH. The 2 mg/1.5 mL (1.34 mg/mL) strength is not currently marketed by Novo Nordisk Inc.

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in five randomized controlled STEP trials [^36c50332]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The semaglutide 2.4 mg group had a greater reduction in body weight by week 68 compared with the placebo groups in both pooled samples, supporting a relationship between weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment and improvements in BP and lipid levels.

BP and lipid levels were not significantly different in participants who decreased or stopped antihypertensive or lipid‐lowering treatment versus participants who experienced increases in treatment intensity. These data indicate an association between improvements in metabolic markers and treatment intensity reduction and precludef the possibility that participants inappropriately discontinued treatment (i.e. without BP or lipid improvements). In treating obesity, providers should aim to reduce the risk or consequence of comorbid diseases, which is reflected in therapy de‐escalation among some of the trial participants. However, certain medications are known to have multiple benefits beyond their primary indication (e.g. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are reno‐protective antihypertensive agents) and may require continuation for those reasons. Similarly, certain patient populations might require treatment with specific medications for reasons beyond the primary indication (e.g. patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease may require treatment with a statin regardless of lipid levels). Discontinuation may, in fact, be detrimental in such circumstances, and, as such, any decisions on changes in antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering treatment intensity should be individualized to the specific needs of the patient, completed under the advisement of the treating health care professional, and followed by appropriate monitoring of BP and lipid levels.

### Use of dulaglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide in diabetes and weight management [^57b61613]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) are effective therapies in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), providing cardioprotective benefits, and lowering weight. The use of GLP1-RA solely for weight-loss has become commonplace in many practices, which in turn has made it difficult in some areas for those with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to obtain these much-needed medications.

Methods

Using recent published literature, along with clinical experience, it has become apparent that many GLP1-RAs have become difficult to obtain for patients with diabetes.

Findings

Many clinicians started to prescribe the brand Ozempic® (semaglutide*) and dulaglutide for weight loss despite neither of them being Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for this indication. Ozempic, having outperformed dulaglutide in in both HbA 1c reduction and weight loss, along with FDA approval of semaglutide for weight loss, has quickly become widely used off-label for weight loss. This off-label use may have increased, despite the approval of semaglutide, † because many insurances will not cover semaglutide solely for weight management. Most recently, Eli Lilly was able to develop tirzepatide, ‡ which was FDA approved in May of 2022, and they are seeking fast-track FDA approval for weight loss and are projected to gain this approval within 2023.

Implications

Insurance coverage for weight management remains sparse, and obtaining these therapies for diabetes has now become more burdensome, with insurance companies requiring a prior authorization proving FDA-approved diagnosis of T2DM. Hopefully, should more GLP1-Ras receive approval for weight loss, along with an increase in insurance coverage, the burden on patients with diabetes will be lessened as they are able to quickly obtain this highly effective therapy.

In a second step, we dissected the other GLP-1 receptor agonists group (number of reports in Table S5, Additional file 1). For all treatments (except lixisenatide, which was excluded due to too low case numbers), we observe significantly higher reporting odds for semaglutide (Fig. 2).

Numbers of reports are displayed in the graph as: report for visual impairment/total number of reports, except for semaglutide (n = 417/11,558). Lixisenatide was excluded due to too low case numbers (see Additional file 1: Table S5 for number of reports). rORs were calculated with 95% CI and corresponding p-value (with Yates' correction). Abbreviations: CI: confidence interval, FAERS: Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system, rOR: reporting odds ratio, T2D: type 2 diabetes

When focusing specifically on retinopathy instead of general visual impairment, we observed similar patterns (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Notably, semaglutide showed a higher retinopathy risk compared to the other included medications.

A supplementary analysis was conducted using the brand names of the medications (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy), rather than their generic names or drug classes (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). This subgroup analysis demonstrated results consistent with our primary findings for semaglutide formulations Ozempic and Rybelsus, with statistically significant associations observed. The analysis of Wegovy was limited by insufficient adverse event reports to draw statistical conclusions, precluding meaningful interpretation of risk patterns for this formulation.

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs in individuals who discontinue liraglutide and who switch from liraglutide to once-weekly injectable semaglutide [^0e418e4d]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2022, more than 37 million Americans were living with diabetes, placing a large financial burden on the US healthcare system due to the direct costs of disease management, with additional indirect costs arising from reduced productivity. As a result of the rising prevalence of diabetes, the estimated total costs of diabetes management are projected to reach $622 billion by 2030. Comprehensive diabetes management strategies, including the use of effective glucose-lowering therapies to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, are imperative to ease the burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on the US healthcare system.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are recommended by clinical guidelines for people with T2D who have not achieved their glycemic target, and they are preferred over insulin where possible. Diabetes treatment guidelines advocate consideration of GLP-1 RAs as second-line therapy for people with T2D uncontrolled on metformin, and as first-line therapy in patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, studies have suggested that (depending on the drug prescribed) up to 48% of patients will have discontinued their initial GLP-1 RA, generally an old generation such as liraglutide, after the first year of treatment, with injection frequency appearing to be a key factor in this. All currently available GLP-1 RAs, with the exception of orally administered semaglutide, are injected subcutaneously with dosing schedules ranging from twice-daily to once-weekly (OW). Victoza (liraglutide, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; hereafter referred to simply as liraglutide) is used for treatment of T2D and is administered once-daily, while Ozempic (semaglutide, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; hereafter referred to as semaglutide), also used for treatment of T2D, is administered by OW subcutaneous injection. Evidence from randomized clinical trials and real-world evidence studies demonstrated the superior benefits in glycemic and weight control comparing semaglutide with liraglutide. Within the SUSTAIN 10 trial, treatment with OW semaglutide 1.0 mg was superior to liraglutide 1.2 mg in glycemic control (− 0.69% treatment difference in HbA1c) and in weight loss (− 3.83 kg treatment difference). Besides these, semaglutide has also shown benefits in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) outcomes, which have not been established in other GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide.

### Semaglutide therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: November 2025 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^a6278623]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This practice recommendation serves as an update to the 2023 AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now known as Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) (3) and provides implementable guidance on patient selection for treatment, consideration of comorbidities, and monitoring of treatment safety and efficacy of semaglutide. FDA-indication and Practice Recommendation: The Wegovy® formulation, whose main ingredient is semaglutide, received accelerated FDA approval in August 2025 for treating MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis (consistent with stages F2-F3 fibrosis), based on interim results of the phase 3 ESSENCE trial where 72 weeks of 2.4 mg/week subcutaneous injection resulted in achievement of both primary histologic endpoints: 1) resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis (62.9% vs 34.3% placebo, p < 0.001) and 2) ≥ 1 stage reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of MASH (36.8% vs 22.4% placebo, p < 0.001); final approval awaits long-term outcomes. Patient Selection: Candidates should have MASH with stage 2–3 fibrosis, identified using noninvasive tests (NITs) such as VCTE (8–15 kPa), MRE (3.1–4.4 kPa), or ELF (9.2–10.5), rather than liver biopsy, which is impractical and unnecessary for most patients. In those with VCTE (15–20 kPa), MRE (4.4–5 kPa), or ELF (10.5–11.3), an individualized decision to treat should be based on exclusion of cirrhosis with another confirmatory NIT, or cross-sectional imaging excluding nodular-appearing liver contour and signs of portal hypertension, or a platelet count of < 150,000/mm 3. While semaglutide is not approved to treat patients with MASH cirrhosis (VCTE > 20 kPa, MRE > 5.0 kPa, ELF > 11.3 and/or evidence of portal hypertension), those with compensated cirrhosis who are receiving semaglutide for another FDA-approved indication should be monitored carefully. Monitoring and Safety: Semaglutide showed a favorable hepatic safety profile in the ESSENCE trial, with no discontinuations due to liver enzyme elevations. Routine hepatic panels are recommended only as clinically indicated. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting), generally mild and transient; patient education and dose titration help improve tolerance. Clinicians should monitor for rare but serious risks, including acute kidney injury (from dehydration), symptomatic gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, thyroid C-cell tumors, retinopathy progression, and lean mass loss. Treatment Response and Concomitant Therapy: Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD/MASH management alongside semaglutide. Combination use with resmetirom at the dose of 2.4 mg/week has not been studied. While no NITs reliably predict histologic response at the individual patient level, reductions from baseline to 72 weeks of treatment suggest significant improvement in MASH resolution (ALT > 17 U/L or ≥ 20%; CAP ≥ 30%) and fibrosis improvement (VCTE LSM ≥ 30%; MRE LSM ≥ 20%; ELF ≥ 0.5). Non-response may be suspected if ALT or NITs worsen. Benefit is uncertain if sub-optimal response and may require an individualized approach and further follow-up.

### Prescriptions for obesity medications among adolescents aged 12–17 years with obesity-United States, 2018–2023 [^8e654ec4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide indicated for persons aged ≥ 12 years with obesity (Wegovy) and phentermine or phentermine-topiramate were the most prescribed obesity medications in 2023. The oral administration, lower out-of-pocket costs, and more consistent availability of phentermine or phentermine-topiramate (compared with semaglutide, which is administered by weekly subcutaneous injections) might be factors in the increased use among adolescents in 2023 compared with previous years.

This study excluded medications that were not FDA approved for obesity treatment in adolescents but are often used off-label for this purpose (e.g. metformin, semaglutide [Ozempic], and liraglutide [Victoza], all indicated for persons with T2DM). A sensitivity analysis including semaglutide and liraglutide regardless of indication resulted in a slightly higher prescription prevalence (0.7% in 2023). Future analyses could focus on medications prescribed off-label for obesity or for other conditions that also help with weight management.

The findings in this report indicate that health care providers tended to prescribe obesity medications to adolescents with severe obesity. Approximately 83% of adolescents who received an obesity medication prescription had severe obesity (class 2 or 3), including 52% with class 3 obesity. Higher obesity class is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, lower health-related quality of life, and declines in physical function, which might prompt providers to prescribe obesity medications to this population.

Prescribing of obesity medications also differed by sex, race, and U.S. Census Bureau region. Girls were more likely than boys to be prescribed obesity medications. In addition, although the prevalence of severe obesity among Black adolescents was 27% higher than among White adolescents, Black adolescents were 39% less likely than White adolescents to receive an obesity medication prescription. Factors that might explain differences in prescribing or low prescription rates include limited availability of the medications because of production shortages, high out-of-pocket costs, and insurance restrictions, such as lack of coverage or complex prior authorization processes. In addition, concerns among adolescents and health care providers about long-term use and safety, as well as health care provider knowledge and self-efficacy in prescribing obesity medications, could impact prescription rates.

### GLP-1 agonists: a review for emergency clinicians [^3b8a466c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapies, including GLP-1 agonists, are currently in use for treatment of diabetes and obesity. However, several complications may occur with their use.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused evaluation of GLP-1 agonist therapy and associated complications for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

GLP-1 agonists potentiate insulin release and reduce gastric emptying and food intake. These agents have demonstrated significant improvements in glucose control in diabetics and weight loss in obese patients. The two most common agents include subcutaneous semaglutide (Ozempic, approved for type 2 diabetes, and Wegovy, approved for weight loss) and liraglutide (Saxenda, approved for weight loss, and Victoza, approved for type 2 diabetes), though an oral formulation of semaglutide is available (Rybelsus). While these drugs are associated with improved long-term outcomes, there are a variety of associated adverse events. The most common include gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Pancreatitis and biliary disease may also occur. Hypersensitivity including injection site reactions have been associated with use, with reports of anaphylaxis and other rashes. Renal adverse events are most commonly associated with severe GI losses. Hypoglycemia may occur when these agents are used with sulfonylureas or insulin. There is also an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy. Due to the current shortage and expense of these medications, many patients have attempted to obtain these medications from non-licensed and unregulated agents, which may be associated with increased risk of serious complications.

Conclusions

An understanding of the indications for GLP-1 agonist use and associated adverse events can assist emergency clinicians.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists beyond diabetes management [^95f3c60b]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The first glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA], exenatide, was approved by US Food and Drug Administration in 2005, and was initially indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exenatide is a synthetic version of exendin-4, a hormone found in the saliva of a lizard native to North America that can survive extended periods without food. Exendin-4 can mimic the action of GLP-1, an incretin regulating glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 acts on pancreatic β cells to enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and promotes satiety, ultimately reducing appetite and decreasing energy.

Since 2005, the landscape of available GLP-1 RAs has greatly expanded alongside the number of their therapeutic indications. Beyond exenatide, the class now includes liraglutide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, tirzepatide, and semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic or Wegovy). Both liraglutide and dulaglutide have shown cardiovascular risk reduction in landmark trials (LEADER and REWIND, respectively), underscoring their dual benefits for glucose homeostasis and cardiovascular health. Semaglutide is highly effective for weight loss and has cardiovascular benefits as evidenced in SUSTAIN. Most recently, tizepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonist, has shown superior glycaemic control compared with the available single agonist, setting a new standard for diabetes and weight management.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^36623619]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^54857065]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; P = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

In STEP 1 (without T2D), placebo-subtracted weight loss was "16.9%" (on-treatment) and "14.9%" (in-trial), with STEP 1/3/4 yielding "16.9% to 18.2%" weight loss with a lifestyle program. In a phase 2 NASH study, semaglutide produced "13% weight loss" with fibrosis improvement in "43%" versus "7%" and "33%" with placebo. In STEP 2 (with T2D and ABCD), randomization included "2.4 mg/week", "1.0 mg/week", and placebo; placebo-subtracted weight loss was "6.2%" with 2.4 mg versus "3.6%" with 1.0 mg, and "10.6% weight loss" with 2.4 mg plus lifestyle, along with improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors.

Fig. 7
SNAC technology for Semaglutide permeation.

This illustration demonstrates how SNAC in the tablet helps oral semaglutide survive stomach acid. SNAC raises local pH, protects the drug from gastric enzymes, and increases its absorption through the stomach lining.

Preclinical pharmacoscintigraphic imaging and studies in canine models have demonstrated that semaglutide is primarily absorbed in the stomach, with higher drug concentrations detected in the splenic vein relative to the portal vein, indicating site-specific uptake. This innovative approach effectively bypasses the traditional barriers associated with oral peptide delivery, offering a clinically viable and patient-preferred alternative to injectable formulations.

Semaglutide is also available as injectable formulations, including Ozempic ® and Wegovy ®, which are widely recognized for their efficacy in the management of T2DM and obesity. Both formulations are administered as once-weekly SC injections due to the long half-life of Semaglutide (approximately one week). Furthermore, Ozempic ® is primarily used for glycemic control in diabetes patients, while Wegovy ® targets weight management by reducing hunger and enhancing satiety through activation of GLP-1 receptors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these formulations indicate that maximum plasma concentrations are typically attained within 1 to 3 days following SC administration, while steady-state plasma levels are generally achieved after 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly dosing. Dosing regimens for both products involve gradual titration to optimize therapeutic outcomes; Ozempic® progresses from 0.25 mg to a maintenance dose of up to 1 mg, whereas Wegovy® reaches a higher maintenance dose of 2.4 mg to support weight loss goals.

### PIONEER 1: randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide monotherapy in comparison with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes [^077596ef]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of the first oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, oral semaglutide, as monotherapy with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet and exercise alone. Two estimands addressed two efficacy-related questions: a treatment policy estimand (regardless of trial product discontinuation or rescue medication use) and a trial product estimand (on trial product without rescue medication use) in all randomized patients.

Research Design and Methods

This was a 26-week, phase 3a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 93 sites in nine countries. Adults with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled with diet and exercise were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily oral semaglutide 3 mg, 7 mg, 14 mg, or placebo. The primary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c. The confirmatory secondary end point was change from baseline to week 26 in body weight.

Results

In the 703 patients randomized (mean age 55 years, 50.8% male, and mean baseline HbA 1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]), oral semaglutide reduced HbA 1c (placebo-adjusted treatment differences at week 26: treatment policy estimand, -0.6% [3 mg], -0.9% [7 mg], and -1.1% [14 mg]; trial product estimand, -0.7% [3 mg], -1.2% [7 mg], and -1.4% [14 mg]; P < 0.001 for all) and body weight (treatment policy, -0.1 kg [3 mg], -0.9 kg [7 mg], and -2.3 kg [14 mg, P < 0.001]; trial product, -0.2 kg [3 mg], -1.0 kg [7 mg, P = 0.01], and -2.6 kg [14 mg, P < 0.001]). Mild-to-moderate transient gastrointestinal events were the most common adverse events with oral semaglutide. Trial product discontinuations occurred in 2.3–7.4% with oral semaglutide and 2.2% with placebo.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide monotherapy demonstrated superior and clinically relevant improvements in HbA 1c (all doses) and body weight loss (14 mg dose) versus placebo, with a safety profile consistent with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

### Patients with severe obesity are made eligible for complex abdominal wall repair after preoptimization with GLP-1 agonists: results of a bicentric pilot study [^60e4d79d]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery has recently been validated by the French health authorities for patients with severe obesity and IH as a comorbidity. Thus, bariatric surgery can be an intermediate step in optimizing patients with severe obesity for IHR. However, medical treatments, such as GLP‐1 agonists (as weekly semaglutide), seem also to be interesting to achieve significant weight loss in patients with severe obesity and comorbidities. Ozempic and Wegovy contain the same molecule (semaglutide) but in different dosages and for different indications. The indication for Ozempic is for control of diabetes, whereas the indication for Wegovy is for weight loss. For Ozempic, the doses range from 0.25 to 1 mg per week, whereas from 0.25 to 2.5 mg per week for Wegovy. The superiority of Wegovy may indeed lie in the fact that there is a dose–response relationship with weight loss. New GLP‐1 agonists will soon be available on the market with improved efficacy.

The advantage of GLP1 agonists is that, unlike bariatric surgery, they are noninvasive. They are also often patients who have undergone multiple operations, and bariatric surgery can be difficult because of the risk of adhesions. However, long‐term treatment with GLP‐1 agonists comes at a significant cost to society, especially since it must be continued over a long period of time and its cessation leads to weight regain. The article by Docimo S et al. compared the cost‐effectiveness of GLP‐1 agonists and bariatric surgery. The authors suggest that bariatric surgery seems to be cost saving compared with GLP‐1 agonists in the treatment of class II obesity. The high cost of ongoing use of GLP‐1 agonists, such as Saxenda and Wegovy, surpasses the cost of Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass in less than a year and sleeve gastrectomy within 9 months.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^657df84c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg compared with 14 mg in adults with type 2 diabetes (PIONEER PLUS): a multicentre, randomised, phase 3b trial [^9fbb8eb6]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Once-daily oral semaglutide is an effective type 2 diabetes treatment. We aimed to investigate a new formulation of oral semaglutide at higher investigational doses versus the approved 14 mg dose in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3b trial, carried out at 177 sites in 14 countries, enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) 8·0–10·5% (64–91 mmol/mol), a BMI of 25·0 kg/m 2 or greater, receiving stable daily doses of one to three oral glucose-lowering drugs. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1), by means of an interactive web response system, to once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg for 68 weeks. Investigators, site personnel, trial participants, and trial sponsor staff were masked to dose assignment throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 52, evaluated with a treatment policy estimand in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of trial drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04707469, and the European Clinical Trials register, EudraCT 2020-000299-39, and is complete.

Findings

Between Jan 15 and Sept 29, 2021, of 2294 people screened, 1606 (n = 936 [58·3%] male; n = 670 [41·7%] female; mean [SD] age 58·2 [10·8] years) received oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 536), 25 mg (n = 535), or 50 mg (n = 535). At baseline, mean (SD) HbA 1c was 9·0% (0·8; 74·4 mmol/L [SD 8·3]) and mean bodyweight was 96·4 kg (21·6). Mean changes (SE) in HbA 1c at week 52 were -1·5 percentage points (SE 0·05) with oral semaglutide 14 mg, -1·8 percentage points (0·06) with 25 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·27, 95% CI -0·42 to -0·12; p = 0·0006), and -2·0 percentage points (0·06) with 50 mg (ETD -0·53, -0·68 to -0·38; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were reported by 404 (76%) participants in the oral semaglutide 14 mg group, 422 (79%) in the 25 mg group, and 428 (80%) in the 50 mg group. Gastrointestinal disorders, which were mostly mild to moderate, occurred more frequently with oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg than with 14 mg. Ten deaths occurred during the trial; none were judged to be treatment related.

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide 25 mg and 50 mg were superior to 14 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. No new safety concerns were identified.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg — implementation and safety considerations for adults with obesity: Given the stated net benefit, semaglutide 2.4 mg "may be prioritized over other approved AOMs for the long-term treatment of obesity for most patients". It "has glucoregulatory benefits and is also approved for the treatment of T2DM". Adverse effects are noted as it "may delay gastric emptying with adverse effects of nausea and vomiting", and "gradual dose titration may help mitigate these adverse effects". Class-level risks are flagged as "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and gallbladder disease", and semaglutide "is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2".

For Study 5, the primary efficacy parameter was mean percent change in body weight from randomization (week 20) to week 68.

From randomization (week 20) to week 68, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo (Table 7). Because patients who discontinued WEGOVY during titration and those who did not reach the 2.4 mg weekly dose were not eligible for the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect the experience of patients in the general population who are first starting WEGOVY.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^cf3b1811]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outside randomized clinical trial settings, data on weight loss with semaglutide or liraglutide for obesity are generally limited to 6 months of follow-up, based on brand names approved by the FDA for T2D only, or cohorts that exclude patients who did not persist with the treatment. Furthermore, emerging data suggest that persistent coverage with GLP-1 RAs (ie, a cumulative gap of less than 90 days), is difficult to achieve, but little is known about how persistence affects weight loss. Such understanding could inform the need and scope of future research, as well as clinical and policy interventions aimed at addressing the barriers to the use of these medications. We examined weight outcomes at 1 year in patients with obesity who received injectable forms of liraglutide or semaglutide and compared outcomes by GLP-1 RA agent, indication, dosage, and persistent coverage with the medication.

### Semaglutide use in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes from real-world utilization data: an analysis of the all of US program [^fa636d0c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

4 | DISCUSSION

4.1 | Real-world data

In contrast to most assessments of semaglutide performed on data generated from controlled clinical trials, our assessment is based on real-world data from EHRs. This allowed us to better understand the effects and usage of semaglutide in everyday life. For example, we observed the variability in time on drug that is not seen in clinical trials. There was a significant decrease in percentage of patients still on semaglutide after the first year. The available data were also able to show the change in associated measurement values even after stopping semaglutide.

Similar to the results in the clinical trials leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval (Pivotal Trials) associated with semaglutide (for Ozempic andfor Rybelsus) for people with type 2 diabetes, – our evaluation also showed decreases in HbA1c, but to a lesser extent than in trials. Specifically, our results showed an average decrease of 0.75% from baseline, in contrast to 1.52% observed in the Ozempic trial and 0.9% in the Rybelsus trial.

In contrast to the real-world data in this study, the clinical trials have a set time frame (30 and 26 weeks, respectively, for the trials mentioned above), potentially limiting their ability to fully capture the comprehensive spectrum of outcomes observed. Notably, our findings reveal prolonged monitoring for longer than 1 year, a duration not accounted for in the clinical trials, showcasing additional insights, particularly concerning increases in values towards baseline.

Other studies of the real-world application of semaglutide have also shown outcomes related to the medication's usage. While in some cases these studies were limited in time scope or route of administration, they showed the safety and effectiveness of semaglutide in line with the conclusions in this study. –

4.2 | Lasting effectiveness still needs validation

Following initiation of semaglutide, significant decreases were observed in measured values for both obesity and type 2 diabetes patients. While many individuals experienced increases in their BMI, body weight and HbA1c values upon discontinuing the medication, our findings indicated that final values remained significantly lower than baseline levels, indicating the potential efficacy of semaglutide. However, further studies are needed to ascertain the lasting improvements of semaglutide.

### Spending on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among US adults [^74cf8d14]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Total spending on GLP-1 RAs in the US increased by more than 500% from 2018 to 2023 (from $13.7 billion to $71.7 billion) (Table). Total spending grew by a mean of 34% per year from 2018 to 2022 and then grew by 62% from 2022 to 2023. The changes in spending between 2018 and 2023 varied by product. Spending for semaglutide (Ozempic) increased from $0.4 billion to $26.4 billion; and for dulaglutide (Trulicity), from $5.6 billion to $17.6 billion. Combined spending on liraglutide (Victoza) and exenatide (Bydureon, Byetta) decreased from $7.1 billion to $3.1 billion, whereas spending on liraglutide (Saxenda) increased slightly from $0.6 to $0.9 billion. Spending on semaglutide (Rybelsus), semagalutide (Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) has only increased since their introduction. From 2018 to 2023, the share of total GLP-1 RA spending for dulaglutide (Trulicity) declined from 41% to 25% and the combined share of liraglutide (Victoza) and exenatide (Bydureon, Byetta) declined from 52% to 4% (Figure). By 2023, semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) made up 70% of all spending. The 2 products released since 2021, Mounjaro and Wegovy, had 17% and 10% shares, respectively. In 2023, products with an approved indication of type 2 diabetes accounted for 89% of all spending while products with an approved indication of obesity accounted for 11% of all spending.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^37b83665]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes [^cf315551]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previously, the only available glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were injectable. Approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents the first orally available GLP-1 RA.

Objective

To review the literature and describe pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of oral semaglutide, a newly approved oral GLP-1 RA.

Methods

A MEDLINE (1995-October 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the terms oral semaglutide, semaglutide, PIONEER, and a combination of those terms. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed. All English-language studies, including abstracts, evaluating oral semaglutide use in humans were included in this review.

Conclusions

The approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents a paradigm shift in the management of T2D as this is the first FDA-approved oral GLP-1 RA. Oral semaglutide may be an attractive option for patients with T2D who require improved glycemic control, would like to lose weight, and who are not interested in injectable therapy. However, the lack of positive cardiovascular (CV) and renal data are significant limitations to its use.

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

### Proteomic changes upon treatment with semaglutide in individuals with obesity [^e93fc926]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the randomized Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial (intent to treat: 1,961 adults with overweight or obesity without T2D), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in greater weight loss compared with placebo over a 68-week period (estimated treatment difference −12.4 percentage points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −13.4, −11.5; P < 0.001); half of the participants treated with semaglutide (50.5%) had a weight reduction of ≥ 15% compared with 4.9% assigned to placebo. In the randomized STEP 2 trial (intent to treat: 1,210 adults with overweight or obesity and T2D), the estimated treatment difference from baseline to week 68 for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo was −6.2 percentage points (95% CI −7.3, −5.2; P < 0.0001).

In our analysis, we used fasting serum samples collected at baseline and end of treatment in a large subset of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, STEP 1 and STEP 2, to investigate the effects of semaglutide treatment on the circulating proteome. By examining the effects following weight loss and also effects after accounting for weight loss on the proteome throughout the trial in those with and without T2D, and by comparing proteomic profiles with those of observational cohorts, we aimed to comprehensively study the proteomic effects of semaglutide treatment and elucidate the mechanism of action driving its benefits on weight- and obesity-related complications, and to determine its potential for use in new indications.

Semaglutide STEP 3 — subcutaneous semaglutide as an adjunct to intensive behavior therapy in adults with overweight or obesity — enrolled participants without diabetes mellitus, used a low-calorie, meal-replacement diet for the first 8 weeks (1000–1200 kcal/day) followed by 1200–1800 kcal/day with regular physical activity goals of 200 minutes per week and 30 individual sessions; semaglutide 2.4 mg SQ per week plus intensive behavior therapy resulted in a 16.9% reduction in body weight versus 5.7% with placebo, and the authors noted 14.9% vs 2.4% at 68 weeks in STEP 1, concluding that these findings suggest that the inclusion of intensive behavioral therapy plus an 8-week low-calorie diet ultimately may not contribute significant additional weight reduction beyond that achieved by semaglutide and less-intensive lifestyle intervention.

### Cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale, design and patient baseline characteristics for the PIONEER 6 trial [^3a9ae9d3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

Materials and Methods

PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ≥ 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

Results

Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

Conclusions

PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^64fb595d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^b93cda8e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

### Will oral semaglutide be used to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes instead of subcutaneous semaglutide? [^825fc2ad]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The 'glutides', which stimulate the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor to stimulate insulin secretion, are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide is the first glutide to be developed in an oral form. The PIONEER series of clinical trials (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) were undertaken to establish a clinical role for oral semaglutide. Areas covered: This evaluation is of PIONEER 6 in a non-inferiority phase 3a trial. In PIONEER 6, the primary outcome was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event and this was non-inferior with oral semaglutide, compared to placebo. Expert opinion: In my opinion, there are several reasons why once-daily oral semaglutide may not replace once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Most importantly, subcutaneous semaglutide has already been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing cardiovascular risk, whereas the study of this with oral semaglutide will not be completed until 2024. Secondly, it is debatable whether subjects will find the daily protocol for taking oral semaglutide more convenient than that for the weekly subcutaneous formulation.

### Insights into the early use of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice: the IGNITE study [^4165dcff]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and showed significant benefits in glycaemic control and weight reduction versus active comparators in the PIONEER phase 3a randomized controlled trial programme. In this retrospective study, we present early data on the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, from the US IBM Explorys electronic health record database. In 782 patients prescribed oral semaglutide, 54.5% were women, and the mean age (SD) was 57.8years (11.3); 66.0% of patients received their prescription from a primary care practitioner. Although prescribing information recommends increasing the dose to 7 mg after 30days, 37.0% of patients received a prescription only for the initial 3 mg dose. Mean body mass index was 36.2 kg/m 2 (7.6); mean HbA1c was 8.4% (1.8%). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to approximately 6 months after oral semaglutide initiation was -0.9% (95% CI: -1.1%; -0.6%), with greater reductions in patients with higher baseline HbA1c. These data indicate prevalent early adoption of oral semaglutide in primary care, show real-world improvements in glycaemic control, and identify potential treatment gaps.

Results

Search engine monitoring generated 1080 hyperlinks, with 317 (29.35%) for online pharmacies. Nearly one-half (134 sites [42.27%]) belonged to illegal pharmacy operations; 763 links were websites not offering products for sale, including 615 news and informational websites and 148 telemedicine websites requiring consultation to obtain prescription before purchase.

Six online vendors classified as not recommended or rogue by LegitScript and/or National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and offering parenteral semaglutide products were included in test buys. Three websites offered prefilled 0.25-mg per dose semaglutide injection pens, and 3 sold vials of lyophilized semaglutide to be reconstituted to solution for injection (1–3 mg). All vendors referred to weight loss and obesity on their product page. Prices for the smallest dose and quantity ranged from US $113 to $360 (mean [SD], US $218.5 [$93.6]) (Table).

Test purchases were confirmed via email and WhatsApp. Of 6 products purchased, only 3 were received. Three vendors selling Ozempic injections engaged in nondelivery scams requesting extra payments (range, US $650-$1200) to purportedly clear customs, confirmed as fraudulent by customs agencies. Although genuine Ozempic scored the full 22 points on the FIP checklist, test purchased products scored 8 or 9 with clear discrepancies in regulatory registration information, accurate labeling, and evidence products were likely unregistered or unlicensed.

Upon quality testing, one sample had elevated presence of endotoxin (8.95 EU/mg) indicating possible contamination, although no viable microorganisms were detected. LC-MS revealed the presence of semaglutide in all samples, but with considerably lower purity levels (7%-14% vs advertised 99%). The measured semaglutide content substantially exceeded the labeled amount in each sample by 29% to 39%, meaning that users could receive up to 39% more semaglutide per injection. These risk factors indicate likely falsification that does not meet legitimate product quality standards.

### Oral semaglutide versus subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes (PIONEER 4): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3a trial [^a04b5208]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and weight, but are currently only approved for use as subcutaneous injections. Oral semaglutide, a novel GLP-1 agonist, was compared with subcutaneous liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3a trial, we recruited patients with type 2 diabetes from 100 sites in 12 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with HbA 1c of 7·0–9·5% (53–80·3 mmol/mol), on a stable dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg or maximum tolerated) with or without a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) with an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and country of origin, to once-daily oral semaglutide (dose escalated to 14 mg), once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (dose escalated to 1·8 mg), or placebo for 52 weeks. Two estimands were defined: treatment policy (regardless of study drug discontinuation or rescue medication) and trial product (assumed all participants were on study drug without rescue medication) in all participants who were randomly assigned. The treatment policy estimand was the primary estimand. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and non-inferiority [margin: 0·4%] and superiority vs subcutaneous liraglutide) and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in bodyweight (oral semaglutide superiority vs placebo and liraglutide). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02863419, and the European Clinical Trials registry, number EudraCT 2015-005210-30.

Findings

Between Aug 10, 2016, and Feb 7, 2017, 950 patients were screened, of whom 711 were eligible and randomly assigned to oral semaglutide (n = 285), subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 284), or placebo (n = 142). 341 (48%) of 711 participants were female and the mean age was 56 years (SD 10). All participants were given at least one dose of study drug, and 277 (97%) participants in the oral semaglutide group, 274 (96%) in the liraglutide group, and 134 (94%) in the placebo group completed the 52-week trial period. Mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 26 was -1·2% (SE 0·1) with oral semaglutide, -1·1% (SE 0·1) with subcutaneous liraglutide, and -0·2% (SE 0·1) with placebo. Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide in decreasing HbA 1c (estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·1%, 95% CI -0·3 to 0·0; p < 0·0001) and superior to placebo (ETD -1·1%, -1·2 to -0·9; p < 0·0001) by use of the treatment policy estimand. By use of the trial product estimand, oral semaglutide had significantly greater decreases in HbA 1c than both subcutaneous liraglutide (ETD -0·2%, 95% CI -0·3 to -0·1; p = 0·0056) and placebo (ETD -1·2%, -1·4 to -1·0; p < 0·0001) at week 26. Oral semaglutide resulted in superior weight loss (-4·4 kg [SE 0·2]) compared with liraglutide (-3·1 kg [SE 0·2]; ETD -1·2 kg, 95% CI -1·9 to -0·6; p = 0·0003) and placebo (-0·5 kg [SE 0·3]; ETD -3·8 kg, -4·7 to -3·0; p < 0·0001) at week 26 (treatment policy). By use of the trial product estimand, weight loss at week 26 was significantly greater with oral semaglutide than with subcutaneous liraglutide (-1·5 kg, 95% CI -2·2 to -0·9; p < 0·0001) and placebo (ETD -4·0 kg, -4·8 to -3·2; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were more frequent with oral semaglutide (n = 229 [80%]) and subcutaneous liraglutide (n = 211 [74%]) than with placebo (n = 95 [67%]).

Interpretation

Oral semaglutide was non-inferior to subcutaneous liraglutide and superior to placebo in decreasing HbA 1c, and superior in decreasing bodyweight compared with both liraglutide and placebo at week 26. Safety and tolerability of oral semaglutide were similar to subcutaneous liraglutide. Use of oral semaglutide could potentially lead to earlier initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in the diabetes treatment continuum of care.

Conclusion

Orally administered semaglutide 14 mg QD as an add-on to 1–2 OADs is one of the most efficacious GLP-1 RAs for reducing HbA 1c levels and body weight, and for achieving target HbA 1c levels at 26 ± 4 weeks. In addition, the similar odds of experiencing GI AEs in comparison with other GLP-1 RAs indicate that orally administered semaglutide is well tolerated and not associated with additional burden to patients.
