## Question

Hypertensive urgency and emergency difference step 2 ck info

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about distinguishing hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency and outlining management principles for Step 2 CK preparation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and why the distinction matters. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and, more importantly, the primacy of acute target-organ damage. Next, I will review the clinical presentations and organ systems involved. After that, I need to check the management pathways for urgency versus emergency, including blood pressure targets and monitoring. Finally, I should consider controversies, special populations, and prognostic implications to ensure the synthesis is clinically complete and exam-ready.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't anchor on a misleading threshold. Hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension, typically SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 120 mmHg, with new or worsening hypertension-mediated organ damage, requiring immediate, carefully titrated intravenous therapy in a monitored setting, whereas hypertensive urgency is severe hypertension without acute target-organ damage and does not require emergent IV therapy or ICU admission, with management focused on oral agents and timely outpatient follow-up [^116KMAPg] [^111YEGHW] [^113zfcmV].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pivot point because this is where mistakes happen. The presence of acute target-organ damage, not the absolute blood pressure number, is what converts a severe hypertension presentation into a hypertensive emergency; conversely, even very high pressures without acute organ injury are managed as urgency, not emergency, so I need to ensure I'm actively screening for neurologic, cardiovascular, renal, and retinal injury rather than reacting to the number alone [^116KMAPg] [^112T6Vi2] [^113TejxY].

> I will now examine the organ systems and classic presentations to anchor pattern recognition. Neurologic: hypertensive encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; cardiovascular: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, aortic dissection; renal: acute kidney injury; retinal: papilledema, hemorrhages, exudates; obstetric: severe preeclampsia/eclampsia with lower BP thresholds for emergent therapy; these patterns should trigger emergency pathways and guide agent selection and targets [^116KMAPg] [^111PC2QK] [^115JrM47].

> Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology to calibrate pretest probability. True hypertensive emergencies are uncommon in ED populations, roughly 0.2–0.5% of ED visits, whereas hypertensive urgencies are more frequent, yet both represent high-risk phenotypes that warrant structured follow-up and risk stratification; importantly, many patients with markedly elevated BP in the ED lack acute organ injury, reinforcing the need to avoid reflexive IV therapy without indication [^115W3oBH] [^117NVadx] [^113YZ9HF].

> Next, I should review management for hypertensive urgency and make sure I don't over-treat. For urgency, avoid IV agents and rapid BP reduction; instead, confirm the reading, address pain or anxiety, and initiate or adjust oral antihypertensives with a plan to lower BP over 24–48 hours, arranging close outpatient follow-up; evidence suggests that immediate pharmacologic treatment in the ED for asymptomatic severe hypertension does not improve short-term outcomes and may cause harm, so conservative, outpatient-focused care is preferred [^116KMAPg] [^11653L4U] [^116LxkPu].

> Now, I need to ensure the emergency pathway is precise. For hypertensive emergency, admit to an ICU or high-acuity monitored setting, start a titratable IV agent, and reduce mean arterial pressure by about 10–20% in the first hour, targeting SBP reduction by no more than 25% initially; if there is no compelling condition, aim for < 160/100 mmHg within 2–6 hours and then cautiously to 130–140 mmHg over 24–48 hours; for compelling conditions, use condition-specific targets such as < 120 mmHg SBP within the first hour for aortic dissection and < 140/90 mmHg for severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, while avoiding excessive early BP drops that risk cerebral or coronary hypoperfusion [^111YEGHW] [^112BGghv] [^111PC2QK].

> Let me consider agent selection and monitoring so I don't jump to conclusions. Preferred IV options include nicardipine, labetalol, clevidipine, and nitroprusside, chosen based on comorbidities and organ involvement; continuous arterial or automated noninvasive monitoring is essential, with frequent neurologic checks and urine output assessment; after initial stabilization, transition to oral therapy and evaluate for secondary causes such as renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, or primary aldosteronism when appropriate [^116KMAPg] [^111EyfB8] [^114LhAkZ].

> But wait, what about the term "hypertensive urgency" itself — should I be using it? Some contemporary guidance argues the term adds little value and may promote unnecessary ED interventions; nonetheless, for Step 2 CK, the distinction remains part of standard frameworks, so I should use it accurately while emphasizing that the decisive factor is the presence of acute organ damage and that most patients with severe asymptomatic hypertension are best managed as nonemergent with outpatient intensification and follow-up [^113gorBx] [^115z1eFz] [^113u7qUZ].

> I should double-check special populations because thresholds and targets shift. In pregnancy, persistent SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg in the setting of preeclampsia/eclampsia constitutes a hypertensive emergency with IV labetalol or hydralazine as first-line and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis; in pediatrics, use age- and height-based percentiles to define severe hypertension and apply the same urgency versus emergency framework based on organ injury; in older adults with chronic hypertension, cerebral autoregulation is right-shifted, so overly rapid BP reduction increases ischemic risk, mandating cautious titration [^115JrM47] [^112az9TQ] [^112qUzeQ].

> Next, I should review prognosis to reinforce the need for longitudinal care. Patients discharged after hypertensive crises, especially emergencies, have high 1-year risks of death and major adverse cardiovascular events, with higher event rates after emergencies than urgencies; progression from urgency to emergency occurs in a meaningful minority, underscoring the importance of close follow-up, medication adherence assessment, and risk-factor modification after discharge [^116aURC5] [^115P3WjP] [^113u7qUZ].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach so it's actionable for the exam. First, confirm severe hypertension with accurate measurements and screen meticulously for acute target-organ damage; second, if organ damage is present, activate the emergency pathway with ICU monitoring, IV therapy, and staged BP targets; if no organ damage is present, manage as urgency with oral agents, education, and timely outpatient follow-up; throughout, avoid reflexive IV therapy without indication and remember that the number guides vigilance, but the organ injury dictates urgency [^116KMAPg] [^113zfcmV] [^111YEGHW].

Hypertensive emergency is defined by **BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg with acute target-organ damage** (brain, heart, kidney, eye, or vasculature) and requires **immediate IV therapy** with close monitoring to prevent irreversible injury [^111YEGHW] [^112T6Vi2]. Hypertensive urgency is **BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg without acute target-organ damage**; management is **oral agents** with reassessment over 24–48 hours and no routine ED intervention if asymptomatic [^113hBaaB] [^11653L4U]. The key distinction is the presence of **acute target-organ damage**, which mandates ICU admission and parenteral therapy for emergencies, whereas urgencies do not [^111YEGHW] [^111EyfB8].

| **Feature** | **Hypertensive emergency** | **Hypertensive urgency** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg with acute target-organ damage | BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg without acute target-organ damage |
| Clinical examples | - Encephalopathy <br/> - Stroke <br/> - ACS <br/> - Pulmonary edema <br/> - AKI <br/> - Retinopathy <br/> - Aortic dissection | - Severe headache <br/> - Nosebleed <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - No organ damage |
| Management | Immediate IV antihypertensives in ICU; reduce SBP by ≤ 25% in first hour, then cautiously to 130–140 mmHg over 24–48 hours [^113zfcmV] [^112BGghv] | Oral antihypertensives; reassess in 24–48 hours; avoid routine ED intervention if asymptomatic [^113hBaaB] [^11653L4U] |
| Monitoring | Continuous BP and organ function monitoring | Intermittent BP checks; outpatient follow-up |
| Prognosis | High short-term morbidity/mortality if untreated | Lower short-term risk; high long-term cardiovascular risk if uncontrolled |

Remember: **treat the patient, not the number** — organ damage, not the BP value alone, dictates urgency [^113TejxY].

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^113hBaaB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^115z1eFz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with high BP in emergency departments have worse long‐term cardiovascular outcomes than those with lower BP. This consequence is expected because these patients already have high BP levels and a longer duration of hypertension. The diagnoses of urgency and emergency would be justified if short‐term outcomes were influenced by prompt therapy in emergency departments. Nevertheless, there is no clinical trial in patients diagnosed as having hypertensive urgencies and emergencies showing the short‐term reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. The long‐term benefits would depend of the management after the discharge of the emergency department.

The denomination of hypertensive urgency for the isolated elevation of BP in the emergency room has been questioned. There is no evidence that lowering BP in a short period prevents major cardiovascular events and the prognosis was not different in patients referred to an emergency service. The resumption of medication for the chronic management of hypertension in this context can be considered.

The utility of the diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies to guide the treatment of patients in emergency departments should also be questioned. There is a clear difference between the dangerous long‐term elevation of BP, the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, and the acute elevation of BP, even if accompanied by target organ damage or dysfunction. Delayed therapy for primary clinical conditions, and treating high BP instead, continues to occur in emergency settings. Here, we propose reasons to abandon the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency (Table), which had been useful to characterize the risks of high BP but now deserves an honorable retirement.

### Hypertensive crises: challenges and management [^113agq9e]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^111KBgwn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

### Management of patients with hypertensive urgencies and emergencies: a systematic review of the literature [^1175X1Ex]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.

Methods

medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.

Results

None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.

Conclusions

Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting [^116LxkPu]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study with propensity matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.

Results

Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean (SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure, 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; p = 0.11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; p = 0.11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; p = 0.04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; p = 0.56). Patients sent home had lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; p = 0.01) and at 8 to 30 days (59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; p = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later.

### Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after emergency department visits for hypertensive urgency [^115Wgj5z]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic hypertension is an established long-term risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). However, little is known about short-term MACE risk after hypertensive urgency, defined as an episode of acute severe hypertension without evidence of target-organ damage. We sought to evaluate the short-term risk of MACE after an emergency department (ED) visit for hypertensive urgency resulting in discharge to home.

Methods

We performed a case-crossover study using deidentified administrative claims data. Our case periods were 1-week intervals from 0 to 12 weeks before hospitalization for MACE. We compared ED visits for hypertensive urgency during these case periods versus equivalent control periods 1 year earlier. Hypertensive urgency and MACE components were all ascertained using previously validated International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Clinical Modification codes. We used McNemar test for matched data to calculate risk ratios.

Results

Among 2225722 patients with MACE, 1893401 (85.1%) had a prior diagnosis of hypertension. There were 4644 (0.2%) patients who had at least 1 ED visit for hypertensive urgency during the 12 weeks preceding their MACE hospitalization. An ED visit for hypertensive urgency was significantly more common in the first week before MACE compared with the same chronological week 1 year earlier (risk ratio, 3.5 [95% CI, 2.9–4.2]). The association between hypertensive urgency and MACE decreased in magnitude with increasing temporal distance from MACE and was no longer significant by 11 weeks before MACE (risk ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.99–1.6]).

Conclusions

ED visits for hypertensive urgency were associated with a substantially increased short-term risk of subsequent MACE.

### Evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency [^116KMAPg]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when acute organ injury is present. Careful and effective strategies to reduce blood pressure and diminish the effects of pressure-mediated injury are essential. While the selection of specific antihypertensive medications varies little across different forms of hypertensive emergencies, the intensity of blood pressure reduction to the target pressure differs substantially. Treatment hinges on balancing the positive effects of lowering blood pressure with the potential for negative effects of organ hypoperfusion in patients with altered autoregulatory mechanisms. When patients do not have acute organ injury in addition to severe hypertension, they benefit from a conservative, outpatient approach to blood pressure management. In all cases, long term control of blood pressure is paramount to prevent recurrent hypertensive emergencies and improve overall prognosis. This review discusses the current evidence and guidelines on the evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^116mWJp4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgency (HU), defined as acute severe uncontrolled hypertension without end-organ damage, is a common condition. Despite its association with long-term morbidity and mortality, guidance regarding immediate management is sparse. Our objective was to summarize the evidence examining the effects of antihypertensive medications to treat.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase through May 2016.

Study Selection

We evaluated prospective controlled clinical trials, case-control studies, and cohort studies of HU in emergency room (ER) or clinic settings. We initially identified 11,223 published articles. We reviewed 10,748 titles and abstracts and identified 538 eligible articles. We assessed the full text for eligibility and included 31 articles written in English that were clinical trials or cohort studies and provided blood pressure data within 48 h of treatment. Studies were appraised for risk of bias using components recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main outcome measured was blood pressure change with antihypertensive medications. Since studies were too diverse both clinically and methodologically to combine in a meta-analysis, tabular data and a narrative synthesis of studies are presented.

Results

We identified only 20 double-blind randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies, with 262 participants in prospective controlled trials. However, we could not pool the results of studies. In addition, comorbidities and their potential contribution to long-term treatment of these subjects were not adequately addressed in any of the reviewed studies.

Conclusions

Longitudinal studies are still needed to determine how best to lower blood pressure in patients with HU. Longer-term management of individuals who have experienced HU continues to be an area requiring further study, especially as applicable to care from the generalist.

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies in emergency departments: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117NVadx]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies and of acute hypertension-mediated organ damage (aHMOD) in emergency departments is unknown. Moreover, the predictive value of symptoms, blood pressure (BP) levels and cardiovascular risk factors to suspect the presence of aHMOD is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies in emergency departments and of the relative frequency of subtypes of aHMOD, as well as to assess the clinical variables associated with aHMOD.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, OVID, and Web of Science from their inception to 22 August 2019. Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Eight studies were analysed, including 1970 hypertensive emergencies and 4983 hypertensive urgencies. The prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies was 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively [odds ratio for hypertensive urgencies vs. hypertensive emergencies 2.5 (1.4–4.3)]. Pulmonary oedema/heart failure was the most frequent subtype of aHMOD (32%), followed by ischemic stroke (29%), acute coronary syndrome (18%), haemorrhagic stroke (11%), acute aortic syndrome (2%) and hypertensive encephalopathy (2%). No clinically meaningful difference was found for BP levels at presentations. Hypertensive urgency patients were younger than hypertensive emergency patients by 5.4 years and more often complained of nonspecific symptoms and/or headache, whereas specific symptoms were more frequent among hypertensive emergency patients.

Conclusion

Hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies are a frequent cause of access to emergency departments, with hypertensive urgencies being significantly more common. BP levels alone do not reliably predict the presence of aHMOD, which should be suspected according to the presenting signs and symptoms.

### Pharmacological interventions for hypertensive emergencies [^111fZ4Zu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive emergencies, marked hypertension associated with acute end-organ damage, are life-threatening conditions. Many anti-hypertensive drugs have been used in these clinical settings. The benefits and harms of such treatment and the best first-line treatment are not known.

Objectives

To answer the following two questions using randomized controlled trials (RCTs): 1) does anti-hypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or no treatment affect mortality and morbidity in patients presenting with a hypertensive emergency? 2) Does one first-line antihypertensive drug class as compared to another antihypertensive drug class affect mortality and morbidity in these patients?

Search Strategy

Electronic sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane clinical trial register. In addition, we searched for references in review articles and trials. We attempted to contact trialists. Most recent search August 2007.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded, truly randomized trials that compare an antihypertensive drug versus placebo, no treatment, or another antihypertensive drug from a different class in patients presenting with a hypertensive emergency.

Data Collection and Analysis

Quality of concealment allocation was scored. Data on randomized patients, total serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events, withdrawals due to adverse events, length of follow-up, blood pressure and heart rate were extracted independently and cross checked.

Main Results

Fifteen randomized controlled trials (representing 869 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Two trials included a placebo arm. All studies (except one) were open-label trials. Seven drug classes were evaluated in those trials: nitrates (9 trials), ACE-inhibitors (7), diuretics (3), calcium channel blockers (6), alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists (4), direct vasodilators (2) and dopamine agonists (1). Mortality event data were reported in 7 trials. No meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes, due to insufficient data. The pooled effect of 3 different anti-hypertensive drugs in one placebo-controlled trial showed a statistically significant greater reduction in both systolic [WMD -13, 95%CI -19,-7] and diastolic [WMD -8, 95%CI, -12,-3] blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no RCT evidence demonstrating that anti-hypertensive drugs reduce mortality or morbidity in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, there is insufficient RCT evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. There were some minor differences in the degree of blood pressure lowering when one class of antihypertensive drug is compared to another. However, the clinical significance is unknown. RCTs are needed to assess different drug classes to determine initial and longer term mortality and morbidity outcomes.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^114e7PCY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^113YZ9HF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^114DQS82]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive urgency (HU) is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, without associated end-organ damage. Patients with HU may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, malaise, psychomotor agitation, nausea, or vomiting.

Up to 65 million Americans have hypertension; about 1% will have an episode of HU during their lives. The prevalence of HU in emergency room (ER) or office settings is estimated at 3–5%. In a recent cohort study, cardiovascular events were found to occur in less than 1% of patients within a 6-month period.

Guidance for immediate management of HU is unclear, since there is no consensus on the optimal target for acute blood pressure reduction or the time frame for achieving a normal blood pressure range. Most patients receive drug therapy for elevated blood pressure within the first 48 h of presentation. – Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of different medication choices and associated comorbidities is crucial for clinicians, especially generalists.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence of the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive medications used to treat HU in adults, either in the clinic or ER. This systematic review is intended for a broad audience, including clinicians — especially general internists — along with policymakers and funding agencies, professional societies developing clinical practice guidelines, patients and their care providers, and researchers.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^1174eenH]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) If primary aldosteronism screening is warranted, and the patient remains asymptomatic and without complications of hypertension, consider withholding a new antihypertensive regimen until blood samples can be obtained.
(2) For patients who are symptomatic (e.g. hypertensive emergency) or exhibit complications of hypertension, do not discontinue ongoing efforts to manage hypertension. Instead, interpret primary aldosterone screening results in the context of medication effects.
(3) Patients should be referred to endocrinology or hypertension specialists like nephrology or cardiology. However, which specialty should preferentially manage primary aldosteronism might differ based on the institution and available resources.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^11653L4U]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive urgency, ACEP 2013 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine medical intervention in the emergency department in patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP (HTN stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). Consider treating markedly elevated BP in the emergency department and/or initiate therapy for long-term control in selected patients, such as with poor follow-up. Refer patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP for outpatient follow-up.

### Clinical review: the management of hypertensive crises [^115W5WYC]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the United States and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

### Sex differences in long-term mortality of patients with hypertensive crisis visiting the emergency department [^112jhmZB]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: There are limited data on sex difference in patients with hypertensive crisis. We investigated sex differences in characteristics and long-term mortality in patients with hypertensive crisis visiting the emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study at a tertiary referral center included patients ≥ 18 years of age who were admitted to the ED between 2016 and 2019 with hypertensive crisis, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110mmHg. Results: Among the 6,467 patients who visited the ED with hypertensive crisis, 3,131(48.4%) were women. Women were older and less likely to have acute hypertension-mediated organ damage than men. The 3-year all-cause mortality did not differ between women and men (16.9% in women and 17.2% in men, p = 0.738). After adjusting for age and comorbidities, the 3-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in men than in women (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.29; p = 0.031). In particular, among patients ≥ 50 years of age, the 3-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in men than in women (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.29; p = 0.038); however, it was not different according to sex among patients 18–49 years of age. Moreover, the 3-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in men than in women among patients with hypertensive urgency (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.34–1.90; p < 0.001), which was reversed in patients with hypertensive emergency (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60–0.84; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Men ≥ 50 years of age with hypertensive crisis, men with hypertensive urgencies, and women with hypertensive emergencies have a high risk of all-cause mortality. Thus, it is necessary to consider sex differences when predicting subsequent prognosis and determining the appropriate treatment for patients with hypertensive crisis.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^111PpqVN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^114fmwks]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Broader Coverage of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects by Guidelines and Protocols Proposed for the Primary Clinical Conditions

The natural diagnosis sequence in patients with hypertensive emergencies is usually from the typical manifestations of the primary clinical diagnosis and not from the detection of high BP. The management of BP is one among several steps of care in such conditions, and frequently the intervention over BP is secondary or even not considered in guidelines for the primary diagnoses.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^113y9XRA]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, patients with hypertensive emergencies present a significantly higher cardiovascular event rate, possibly explained by their higher prevalence of previous cardiovascular disease, and to a lesser extent by differences in age or sex (being men at higher cardiovascular risk profile) or other risk factors, including the degree of BP increase during the acute episode. During follow-up, stroke was the leading cardiovascular event in our study population, followed by heart failure, renal failure and acute coronary syndromes, although the higher risk of subsequent events was confirmed in our patients with all different clinical presentation of hypertension-mediated organ damage.

BP control during the follow-up in our study was not different between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, reaching more than 70% among those receiving treatment. This finding is similar to the observation of Vleck et al. showing a prevalence of BP control of 56 and 50% and comparable SBP and DBP values measured during follow-up in patients admitted with a hypertensive urgency or in the control group of hypertensive patients (admitted to the emergency department for several reasons and with BP values > 140 and/or 90 mmHg). However, we cannot exclude the role of uncontrolled BP in favoring the occurrence of cardiovascular events as the achievement of BP control was reported in a lower percentage of patients who developed subsequent cardiovascular events during the follow-up. The lack of differences in noncardiovascular hospitalization and death (because of neoplastic diseases, trauma or severe infections) between patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies not only strongly reinforces the role of optimal control of BP but also of all other risk factors in cardiovascular secondary prevention.

### Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergencies in US emergency departments from 2006 to 2013 [^112qUzeQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies are defined by marked blood pressure (BP) elevations (typically > 180 mm Hg systolic or > 110 mm Hg diastolic, though this cutoff is arbitrary) that are associated with acute target organ damage. 1, 2, 3, 4 Target organs typically involved include those in the cardiovascular, renal, or central nervous systems. 5, 6 While not all patients with markedly elevated BP have a hypertensive emergency, initiation of appropriate treatment for those who do is critical as delays are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 7 However, caution is warranted as patients with chronically elevated BP have a rightward shift in cerebral blood flow autoregulation, placing them at risk of stroke and myocardial infarction when BP is lowered too rapidly.

Despite the importance of hypertensive emergency, the burden of this condition is not known, and there are conflicting views of the epidemiology in academic literature. Prior empirical evidence from claims data suggests that the annual hospitalization rate for hypertensive emergencies is 1 or 2 per million. 8 Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a multicenter database developed as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project to track hospital discharges, analyzed in the wake of the Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 9 place this figure higher, reporting an annual frequency of hospitalizations for a hypertensive emergency in US adults of 101 per 100 000 in 2000 and 111 per 100 000 in 2007. 10

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^1138gF2X]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Hypertensive urgency: an emergency department pipeline to primary care pilot study [^1168emp7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal triage of patients with hypertensive urgency (HU) in the emergency department (ED) is not well established. 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension (HTN) guidelines recommend treatment initiation and follow-up within 1 week. Objectives of our pilot study were to evaluate feasibility and impact of directly connecting ED patients with HU to outpatient HTN management on blood pressure (BP) control and ED utilization.

Methods

ED patients with HU and no primary care physician were scheduled by a referral coordinator for an initial appointment in a HTN clinic embedded within a primary care practice. BP control and ED utilization over the subsequent 90 days were tracked and compared with BP at time of the referral ED visit, and ED utilization in the 90 days preceding referral.

Results

Data are reported for the first 40 referred patients. Average time to first visit was 7.8 days. Mean age was 51 years (range 28–76), 75% were African-American, and mean pooled 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was 20.8%. Mean BP declined from 198/116 mm Hg at ED visit to 167/98 mm Hg at HTN clinic visit 1 to 136/83 by 6 weeks and was sustained at 90 days. Total ED visits for the group decreased from 61 in the 90 days prior to referral, to 18 in the 90 days after the first HTN clinic visit.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, coordinated referral between the ED and primary care provides safe, timely care for this high ASCVD risk population and leads to sustained reductions in BP and ED utilization.

### Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergencies in US emergency departments from 2006 to 2013 [^11579uPi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our primary finding is that ED visits for hypertensive emergency, that is, ED visits for patients who have markedly elevated BP with acute target organ damage and an acuity level high enough to necessitate hospital admission, are quite rare, accounting for less than 2 in 1000 adult ED visits and 6 in 1000 visits carrying any diagnosis of hypertension in 2013. Thus, while markedly elevated BP at presentation to the ED is quite common, 21, 22 occurring in nearly 20% of patients, 23 the likelihood that it represents a true hypertensive emergency may be lower than previously thought. 12

By definition, true hypertensive emergencies are an indication for rapid BP lowering. The management of hypertensive emergency is to limit and reverse target organ damage, but not to achieve a "normal" BP. 24 Treatment of a true hypertensive emergency invariably includes intravenous antihypertensive therapy, but in the wrong patient, their use can precipitate adverse events, including acute kidney injury, myocardial infarct, or stroke. A careful balance is therefore required in the management of patients with markedly elevated BP. By recalibrating the expected proportion of patients with elevated BP who have acute target organ damage, our data could help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment. Unfortunately, the NEDS cannot clarify whether ED visits qualifying as hypertensive emergencies according to our definition resulted in management that included rapid lowering of BP. As this is a hallmark of treatment for true hypertensive emergencies, addition of such data would be highly informative. In the context of our relatively expansive definition with respect to ICD‐9 codes, and given that adding treatment criteria would narrow the definition's scope, results of this analysis are more likely to be an upper bound. This supports our overall assertion that hypertensive emergencies are, on the whole, relatively rare in the ED setting. In addition, use of treatment status to define hypertensive emergency for the purpose of estimating incidence would require the assumption that every patient with true hypertensive emergency is indeed treated.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^117VpW3V]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is pervasive among patients that visit emergency departments (EDs) for their care.

METHODS

In this review article, we outline the current approach to the management of these individuals and highlight the crucial role emergency medicine clinicians play in reducing the morbidity associated with elevated BP.

RESULTS

We highlight the critical importance of immediate treatment when elevated BP contributes to new or worsening end-organ injury but emphasize that such hypertensive emergencies are rare. For the vast majority of patients with elevated BP in the ED who do not have new or worsening end-organ injury from elevated BP, immediate BP reduction within the ED is not recommended or safe. Nonetheless, within weeks after an ED visit, there is a pressing need to improve the care of patients with elevated or previously undiagnosed hypertension. For many, it may be their only regular point of engagement with the healthcare system. To address this, we present novel perspectives that envision a new role for emergency medicine in chronic hypertension management — one that acknowledges the significant population-level gaps in BP control that contribute to disparities in cardiovascular disease and sets the stage for future changes in systems-based practice.

CONCLUSIONS

Emergency medicine plays a key and evolving role in reducing morbidity associated with elevated BP.

### Thirty-day readmission rate among patients with hypertensive crisis: a nationwide analysis [^116bJsdb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive crisis is a life-threatening condition, further classified as hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency based on the presence or absence of acute or progressive end-organ damage, respectively. Readmissions in hypertensive emergency have been studied before. We aimed to analyze 30-day readmissions using recent data and more specific ICD-10-CM coding in patients with hypertensive crisis.

Methods

In a retrospective study using the National Readmission Database 2018, we collected data on 129,239 patients admitted with the principal diagnosis of hypertensive crisis. The primary outcome was the all-cause 30-day readmission rate. Secondary outcomes were common causes of readmission, in-hospital mortality, resource utilization, and independent predictors of readmission. We also compared outcomes between patients with hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency.

Results

Among 128,942 patients discharged alive, 13,768 (10.68%) were readmitted within 30 days; the most common cause of readmission was hypertensive crisis (19%). In-hospital mortality for readmissions (1.5%) was higher than for index admissions (0.2%, P < 0.01). Mean length of stay for readmissions was 4.5 days. The mean hospital cost associated with readmissions was $10,950, and total hospital costs were $151 million. Age < 65 years and female sex were independent predictors of higher readmission rates. Subgroup analysis revealed a higher readmission rate for hypertensive emergency than hypertensive urgency (11.7% vs. 10%, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

All-cause 30-day readmission rates are high in patients admitted with hypertensive crisis, especially patients with hypertensive emergency. Higher in-hospital mortality and resource utilization are associated with readmission in these patients.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rq61z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is one of the largest systematic review and meta‐analysis of patients with hypertensive emergency presenting to the ED and their clinical outcomes. Our study demonstrated that incidence of hypertensive emergency among patients presenting to ED was 0.5%, whereas 35.9% of patients presenting with hypertensive crisis in the ED were categorized as hypertensive emergency. Moreover, the most common complications of hypertensive emergencies are ischemic stroke and pulmonary edema/acute heart failure. Lastly, almost 10% of patients with hypertensive emergencies died during the hospitalization period.

According to our pooled analysis of 15 studies, which included 4370 patients with hypertensive emergency, the prevalence of hypertensive emergency was 0.5%, which is similar to the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies found in a smaller meta‐analysis that included 8 studies with 1970 patients with hypertensive emergency and indicated a prevalence of 0.3% among patients presenting to the ED. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that prevalence of hypertensive emergency among patients with hypertensive crisis in ED was 35.9%. Previous meta‐analysis corroborates these findings, as hypertensive urgency was considered to be significantly higher than hypertensive emergency (odds ratio, 2.5 [1.4%–4.3%]) in patients presenting to ED. Our findings are similarly consistent with the STAT (Studying the Treatment of Acute Hypertension) registry, the largest database of patients with hypertensive emergency in the United States, which reported a 0.2% prevalence of hypertensive emergencies. Loss of hypertension control is a major issue that can influence prevalence of hypertensive emergency. In a study to analyze the trend of hypertension between 2 study periods, analysis demonstrated that hypertension control rates increased from 2009 to 2014; however, after a temporary stationary period, a significant decline was observed from 2015 to 2018. Further analysis demonstrated that a significant reduction in initiation of antihypertensive therapy, from 75.3% to 70.7%, can be linked to declining hypertension control rates. Moreover, the impact of COVID‐19 on hypertension control has been undesirable. Analysis shows reduced outpatient visits for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, with a 20% elevated incidence of mortality during COVID‐19 compared with before the pandemic.

### Severely increased blood pressure in the emergency department [^111zKv7V]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

### Hypertensive emergencies in the emergency department [^114vP3Tr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects approximately one-third of Americans. An additional 30% are unaware that they harbor the disease. Significantly increased blood pressure constitutes a hypertensive emergency that could lead to end-organ damage. When organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney are affected, an intervention that will lower the blood pressure in several hours is indicated. Several pharmacologic options are available for treatment, with intravenous antihypertensive therapy being the cornerstone, but there is no standard of care. Careful consideration of each patient's specific complaint, history, and physical examination guides the emergency physician through the treatment algorithm.

### Comparing the clinical efficacy of resting and antihypertensive medication in patients of hypertensive urgency: a randomized, control trial [^115RBzMt]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypertensive urgency is defined as a severe elevation of blood pressure (BP) without target organ damage. In emergency room, hypertensive urgency has been conventionally managed by antihypertensive medication. However, there has been increasing concern for the safety of antihypertensive medication in hypertensive urgency. Thus, this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of resting and antihypertensive medication in managing hypertensive urgency.

Methods

For 138 hypertensive urgency patients admitting in emergency room of Veterans Health Service (VHS) medical center, a single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Hypertensive urgency patients were randomly allocated into one group out of resting group and antihypertensive medication (telmisartan) group at admission. We serially checked their BP every 30min for 2h, and evaluated change levels and decline of BP. Primary end point of the study was mean BP reduction from 10 to 35%. Additionally, change and decline of SBP and DBP were serially compared over 2h.

Result

The rate of individuals approaching primary end point was 68.5% in rest group and 69.1% in medication group (P = 0.775). The change levels of BP for 2h had no significant difference in SBP (P = 0.882) and DBP (P = 0.411) between resting group and medication group. The decline of BP after 2h also did not show any statistical difference in both SBP (P = 0.065) and DBP (P = 0.032) between both groups.

Conclusion

There was no significant difference between resting and antihypertensive medication in reducing BP of hypertensive urgency patients. This finding suggests the clinical efficacy of resting in managing hypertensive urgency.

### Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergencies in US emergency departments from 2006 to 2013 [^112gg5sg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of hypertensive emergency in US emergency departments (ED) is not well established.

Methods and Results

This study is a descriptive epidemiological analysis of nationally representative ED visit-level data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample for 2006–2013. Nationwide Emergency Department Sample is a publicly available database maintained by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. An ED visit was considered to be a hypertensive emergency if it met all the following criteria: diagnosis of acute hypertension, at least 1 diagnosis indicating acute target organ damage, and qualifying disposition (admission to the hospital, death, or transfer to another facility). The incidence of adult ED visits for acute hypertension increased monotonically in the period from 2006 through 2013, from 170 340 (1820 per million adult ED visits overall) to 496 894 (4610 per million). Hypertensive emergency was rare overall, accounting for 63 406 visits (677 per million adult ED visits overall) in 2006 to 176 769 visits (1670 per million) in 2013. Among adult ED visits that had any diagnosis of hypertension, hypertensive emergency accounted for 3309 per million in 2006 and 6178 per million in 2013.

Conclusions

The estimated number of visits for hypertensive emergency and the rate per million adult ED visits has more than doubled from 2006 to 2013. However, hypertensive emergencies are rare overall, occurring in about 2 in 1000 adult ED visits overall, and 6 in 1000 adult ED visits carrying any diagnosis of hypertension in 2013. This figure is far lower than what has been sometimes cited in previous literature.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^1156Ygj7]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Clinicians have to frequently manage acute BP reduction for a critically ill patient, with specific indications suggested by more recent guidelines or consensus papers. Conversely, a large number of patients admitted to the emergency department have longstanding hypertension and should be referred to outpatient care rather than receive acute interventions. The short-term and long-term effects of acute BP-lowering on cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality have been evaluated in few clinical trials or surveys. Data on the prevalence of patients referred to the emergency departments describing their clinical features have increased in more recent years, underlying the relevance of this topic from a public health perspective. At the same time, more data are needed in the everyday management and follow-up of these patients. In particular, it is not clear whether patients with very high BP values (usually > 180/110 mmHg) but absence of acute hypertension-mediated target organ damage should be considered as 'uncontrolled hypertension' or 'hypertensive urgency'. As recently proposed, 'hypertensive urgencies' should not be considered a separate entity as there is no evidence that treatment in patients who lack acute hypertension-mediated organ damage is different from patients with asymptomatic uncontrolled hypertension. Some data collected in an office setting have demonstrated that cardiovascular risk is not particularly high in these patients; in addition BP control and/or the incidence of major cardiovascular events was similar in those sent home or referred to the emergency department. Other studies have shown that even patients with hypertensive urgencies, in the absence of hypertension-mediated organ damage, compared with hypertensive patients with lower BP values in the office or at admission to the emergency department, have a poorer event-free survival.

On the basis of the above considerations, we considered worthwhile to investigate the occurrence of clinical events and blood pressure control during follow-up, in patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies referred to the emergency department of 'ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia' during a period of 12 months.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^117SdZQA]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe and rapid increase of the blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180/110 mmHg that often requires immediate but careful intervention to lower BP. This clinical condition often needs the access to the emergency department and can be further classified into hypertensive urgency or emergency based on the presence of acute target organ damage. Hypertensive urgencies are characterized by a rapid and severe BP elevation without organ injuries, whereas hypertension emergencies involve acute target organ damage, including the central nervous system (hypertensive encephalopathy and ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke), the cardiovascular system [myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), and aorta dissection or rupture], or the kidneys (acute renal failure).

Although there has been significant overall improvement in survival after hypertensive crises over the past fifty years, both hypertensive urgency and emergency are still associated with an increased short-term risks of adverse events. Relatively few studies on small populations have investigated the long-term risk of adverse events in patients who have survived hypertensive crises, and no data are available about the impact of the number and type of target organ damage and their associated risks of adverse clinical outcomes. Our aim was to assess the one-year risk of adverse events in patients presenting with hypertensive crises, using a large global federated healthcare dataset.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iR5qG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines defines hypertensive emergency as systolic blood pressure (BP) > 180 mm Hg and diastolic BP > 120 mm Hg, along with evidence of new or worsening hypertension‐mediated organ damage (HMOD). Hypertensive emergency is a life‐threatening condition and has been linked with increased admission rates. It has been estimated that emergency department (ED) visits for hypertensive emergency have increased by 2‐fold per million adults from 2006 to 2013. Although a 0.3% reduction in mortality rate over the period of 7 years was observed, 4.5% of ED visits for hypertensive emergency still resulted in death in 2013, either in the ED or during subsequent hospital admission. Despite the increased rate of hypertensive emergency presentations, subsequent morbidity and mortality data to support clinical decision making are still scarce. Hypertensive emergency may originate from poor management of essential hypertension or secondary hypertension, unrecognized hypertension, inadequately managed hypertension, reduced patient compliance, and reduced access to health care. Many people who present with hypertensive emergencies have chronic hypertension. Secondary hypertension can stem from several underlying causes, such as renal disease due to atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, endocrine disorders like pheochromocytoma, or medications such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents and hormonal contraceptives. Malignant hypertension is one of the several forms of hypertensive emergency and is characterized by severe BP spikes and abrupt microvascular injury to a variety of organs, including the retina, brain, and kidney. Analysis of a multiracial population in England reported essential hypertension to be the most common underlying cause of malignant hypertension, whereas secondary hypertension, mainly due to chronic kidney disease, was identified as the cause in about 40% of the patients. Moreover, the incidence rates of malignant hypertension have been documented as 2 new cases per 100 000 people per year, including up to 4 times greater rates (7.3 per 100 000 per year) recorded for self‐identified Black individuals. Concerns have been raised that although BP control is often acutely achieved in patients admitted with hypertensive emergencies, sufficient focus is not placed on control of chronic hypertension and prevention of organ damage in the long run. Moreover, hypertensive emergency cases are further challenging due to involvement of a variety of organ damages, each of which may complicate the prognosis of the patients. Although some studies have demonstrated prevalence of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED, the literature lacks robust estimates of the true prevalence of hypertensive emergencies. Moreover, the estimates available can substantially vary depending on the populations studied and the methods used. In addition, there is a lack of consensus‐based guidelines in the management strategies of hypertensive emergencies. In this study, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta‐analysis to assess the prevalence of hypertensive emergency, HMOD, and subsequent hospitalization and in‐hospital mortality among patients with hypertensive emergency visiting the ED. Therefore, we aim to provide a review of existing literature, highlight future avenues of research, and find high‐powered estimates to evaluate the prevalence of outcomes of interest. Our analysis synthesizes data on the incidence of hypertensive emergency and their related HMOD from multiple studies and reduces the gap in the literature due to a lack of well‐powered estimates on prevalence of hypertensive emergency. Hence, these findings will assist policymakers in providing more accurate recommendations about diagnosis, treatment, and management of hypertensive emergency and in developing evidence‐based guidelines to improve patient‐related outcomes. Moreover, we also highlight the limitations of existing studies and provide recommendations to improve future clinical studies on patients with hypertensive emergency.

ASSESSING AND TREATING HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive emergencies classically occur in patients with systolic BP (SBP) > 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 120 mm Hg. Nevertheless, lower thresholds can be associated with hypertensive emergencies in the setting of rapid elevations from low-to-normal baseline BP. Furthermore, BP elevations > 170/100 mm Hg can cause worsening target-organ injury in select patients. Elevated BP values in isolation, no matter how high they may be, do not by themselves define a hypertensive emergency unless the patient has concomitant acute organ injury for which immediate BP lowering will modify this injury. Thus, terms such as "hypertensive crisis", which have been historically assigned to all patients with markedly elevated BP have little utility in contemporary practice. New or worsening end-organ injury occurs in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, hematologic, and renovascular systems. The most common hypertensive emergencies are stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and acute heart failure leading to pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare and poorly understood condition that may reflect direct adverse acute effects of markedly elevated BP on the brain.

Most ED patients with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg have elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. These patients have no immediate indication for rapid BP lowering. Though a common concern among ED providers, hypertensive emergency is rare in patients with elevated BP in the ED. Thus, while all hypertensive emergencies should be managed with intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy to achieve immediate BP reduction, few patients require such intervention. Beyond hypertensive emergency, IV antihypertensive therapy is only indicated for select patients with strict oral medication restrictions and patients abruptly withdrawing from beta-blockade or sympatholytic therapy. These latter patients may benefit from IV labetalol. Given the aforementioned variability in clinical practice, it is not surprising that the majority of IV medications given to achieve immediate BP reduction in the ED are done so inappropriately to patients without new or worsening end-organ injury that can be modified by rapid treatment.

### Clinical significance of blood pressure ratios in hypertensive crisis in children [^116dXPzx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypertensive crisis is categorised into hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency. The present work aimed to determine the effect of different gradings of blood pressure (BP) ratios in predicting the severity of paediatric hypertensive crisis.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series, based in the paediatric emergency departments of the Changhua Christian Hospital and the Tzu-Chi General Hospital, Taiwan. From 1995 to 2010, the correlation between the severity of hypertension (HTN) and the difference in elevated systolic BP and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg (dSBP), the difference in elevated diastolic BP and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg (dDBP), dSBP ratio (dSBP/99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg) and dDBP ratio were analysed. A total of 110 children with a first attack of hypertensive crisis were recruited.

Results

Patients with hypertensive crisis caused by essential HTN had lower dDBP ratios than the other causes (p = 0.033), while those with an oncological aetiology had the highest dSBP and dDBP ratios among all the aetiologies. For clinical presentations, patients with nausea/vomiting and visual impairment presented with higher dSBP ratios than those without the symptoms (both p < 0.05), but patients with altered consciousness had higher dSBP and dDBP ratios than those who had clear consciousness (p < 0.05). Children with hypertensive urgency had lower dSBP and dDBP ratios than those with hypertensive emergency (both p < 0.05).

Conclusions

dDBP and dSBP ratios may serve as BP parameters in predicting the severity of paediatric hypertensive crisis. A dSBP ratio greater than 20% may indicate a critical point for severe hypertensive crisis in children.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^116aURC5]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Overall, we included 27 721 patients with hypertensive emergencies (mean age 62.4 ± 15.7 years, 46.3% females), and 23 478 patients with hypertensive urgencies (mean age 63.5 ± 17.2 years, 55.7% females). Patients with hypertensive emergencies were more likely men, Black or African American and had a higher prevalence of chronic hypertensive complications and cardiovascular risk factors (Table 1). After PSM, no significant differences were found between the two groups (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of patients with hypertensive emergency and urgency before and after the propensity score matching

The total number of events recorded in each group after one-year follow-up is reported in Table 2. After PSM, patients with hypertensive emergencies were associated with a higher one-year risk of all-cause death (HR, 1.33, 95% CI 1.24–1.44, Fig. 1, panel a) and MACE (HR 4.00, 95% CI 3.79–4.22, Fig. 1, panel b) compared to those with hypertensive urgencies. There was also increased risk of secondary outcomes. Hypertensive emergencies were associated with higher one-year risks of MI (HR 3.93, 95% CI 3.54–4.36), stroke (HR 4.57, 95% CI 4.20–4.98), cardiac arrest (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.12–1.65), aortic dissection or rupture (HR 5.83, 95% CI 4.20–8.10), and acute HF (HR 2.76, 95% CI 2.52–3.01), when compared to patients with hypertensive urgencies.

### Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergencies in US emergency departments from 2006 to 2013 [^111taduv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Among the strongest epidemiological studies of hypertensive emergency are 2 recent retrospective analyses using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 9, 15 a database similar to the NEDS that includes only hospitalized patients. These studies also use ICD‐9 codes but do not include explicit requirement for coding that indicated acute target organ damage or other evidence of acuity. In the more recent analysis, Polgreen et al explored the epidemiology of hypertensive emergencies using the following specific ICD‐9 codes: malignant hypertension (401.0), hypertensive encephalopathy (437.2), and essential hypertension (401.9). In particular, they found that malignant hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy made up an increasing proportion of hospitalizations associated with any 1 of these 3 diagnoses but that overall mortality actually decreased slightly. Unlike this work, our study required ICD‐9 CM codes to indicate target organ damage. Given existing confusion about the diagnosis, where clinical evidence of acute target organ damage should be the decision point for initiating rapid BP lowering, we feel our approach is more likely to yield a clinically meaningful estimate of the true incidence of hypertensive emergency in the ED.

In addition to implications for the ED, these data also have potential bearing on how patients with markedly elevated BP should be approached in non‐ED settings, suggesting that referral to the ED for fear of a hypertensive emergency may not be necessary in the vast majority of cases. Indeed, 1 retrospective study found that patients with hypertensive urgency treated in an office setting are not any more or less likely to have a major cardiovascular event compared to patients referred to the ED or hospital. 25 Even among those actually admitted to the hospital, like those patients we defined as hypertensive emergency in the present analysis, charges for ED visits we characterized as hypertensive emergency have risen in the period from 2006 to 2013. Clarifying the epidemiology of hypertensive emergencies in the ED thus has tangible clinical relevance, especially in the context of significant morbidity and mortality in the United States from hypertension‐sensitive conditions such as heart disease and stroke. 26

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^114troru]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The recognition of the risks of high blood pressure (BP) in the last century was highlighted by observing the acute association between very high BP and medical catastrophes in emergency settings, including stroke, acute left ventricular failure, and myocardial infarction. Edward Freis was among the first authors to propose the concept of "hypertensive crisis", which he characterized as a life‐threatening disorder caused by acute or severe elevation of BP and clinical manifestations secondary to hypertension. According to Freis, the clinical manifestations included encephalopathy, neuroretinitis, evidence of rapidly advancing renal impairment, and acute heart failure.

Hypertension guidelines incorporated the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report proposed the classification of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Hypertensive emergencies were characterized by hypertensive encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, acute left ventricular failure, dissecting aortic aneurysm, severe hypertension, toxemia, head trauma, extensive burns, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction, in which BP should be lowered within 1 hour. Urgencies were defined as situations in which BP should be controlled within 24 hours, including accelerated or malignant hypertension, perioperative hypertension, and patients requiring emergency surgeries.

With slight variations in the criteria for the definition of urgencies and emergencies, these recommendations have been repeatedly copied and pasted into the Joint National Committee guidelines and the guidelines from Europe and other countries. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertension guidelinesdefined hypertensive emergencies as severe BP elevations (> 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of hypertensive encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute renal failure, and eclampsia. The guideline defined hypertensive urgencies as situations associated with severe BP elevation in patients without an acute or impending change in target organ damage or dysfunction. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines of hypertensionincluded the diagnosis of malignant hypertension (characterized by funduscopic changes or disseminated intravascular coagulation), excluded any presentation of stroke from the criteria to characterize hypertensive emergencies, and proposed a similar definition for hypertensive urgencies.

Trends in the incidence of hypertensive emergency in US Emergency Departments, 2006–2013.indicates emergency department;, target organ damage; the right‐sided vertical axis is for number of totalvisits; the left‐sided vertical axis is forvisits meeting each of the criteria given.

Total hypertensive emergencies by our definition increased by 16.2% per year from 2006 to 2013, while the overall number of ED visits in that same period increased at an average rate of 2.0% year‐over‐year. Despite such a large increase, in terms of the rate per million adult ED visits, hypertensive emergencies remained a rare diagnosis, with an incidence of 677 per million adult ED visits in 2006 and 1640 per million adult ED visits in 2013, yielding an estimated rate increase of 13.9% per year (P < 0.0001). This year‐over‐year change in the incidence of hypertensive emergency remained statistically significant (P < 0.0001) even after adjustment for payer, income, age, and sex. In these estimates, the denominator is total number of adult ED visits, and this should not be interpreted as the raw number of ED visits for hypertensive emergency, which were given above. Table 1 summarizes these results and the distribution of diagnoses for target organ damage associated with hypertensive emergency, from 2006 through 2013. Table 2 depicts hypertensive emergency rate per million with varying denominator: among all ED visits, among ED visits resulting in admission, and among ED visits with any diagnosis of hypertension.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^115JoZtB]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent consensus document suggests the use of uncontrolled BP as a term in substitution of hypertensive urgency, since the management with oral antihypertensive drug administration and the outcome of these patients does not differ from those with poorly controlled BP. In fact, Patel et al. have observed that major cardiovascular events occurred after 6 months in 0.9% of patients with BP values greater than 180/110 mmHg in the office, despite they were sent home from the hospital. On the opposite, as demonstrated by other several studies the prognosis of patients admitted to an emergency department for an acute rise in BP, despite the absence of hypertension-mediated organ damage, may be associated with a high risk of a cardiovascular event. Vleck et al. have followed 384 hypertensive urgencies with a mean age of 56 years for a mean period of 5 years and have shown a cardiovascular fatal and nonfatal events rate of 23%, corresponding, roughly to an incidence of 4.6/100 patients per year. Guiga et al. report a 12-month mortality of 38.9% for hypertensive emergencies and 8.9% for hypertensive urgencies. Mancusi et al. observed that the excess cardiovascular event risk in patients with hypertensive urgencies could be mediated through higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and carotid plaques. In our study, the incidence of all cardiovascular events was 27.2 and 7.2/100 patients/year, respectively in hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, once again confirming the high cardiovascular risk of these patients, higher than that observed in clinical trials including patients at high cardiovascular risk, such as the LIFE or the VALUE studies (composite endpoint rate 3.2 and 2.5/100 patients/year, respectively).

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^116pScLf]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study provides a description of 1-year follow-up of consecutive patients referred in the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in northern Italy (Brescia) with hypertensive urgencies or hypertensive emergencies. We have shown a high 1-year cardiovascular event rate and high 1-year death rate for cardiovascular causes in both hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies.

These data expand our previous observation and other studies, providing an insight into this high-risk setting of acute hypertension increase.

We have previously reported the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients examined in two different period of time (2008 and 2015) showing a prevalence of clinical presentation, which is similar to other observational studies.

We observed slight differences between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies, with higher mean age and men prevalence for hypertensive emergencies. The difference in sex prevalence could be because of the absence of pregnant women with emergencies, whereas the older age of hypertensive emergencies could be the expression of more comorbidities like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus leading to higher degree of atherosclerosis and further increasing the cardiovascular risk profile of these patients.

### Drug nonadherence is a common but often overlooked cause of hypertensive urgency and emergency at the emergency department [^115Y38m8]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Over 70% of patients who visit the emergency department with a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency have previously been diagnosed with hypertension. Drug nonadherence is assumed to play an important role in development of hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency, but exact numbers are lacking. We aimed to retrospectively compare characteristics of patients with hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency and to prospectively quantify the attribution of drug nonadherence.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed clinical data including information on nonadherence obtained by treating physicians of patients with SBP at least 180mmHg and DBP at least 110mmHg visiting the emergency department between 2012 and 2015. We prospectively studied drug adherence among patients admitted to the emergency department with severely elevated BP by measuring plasma drug levels using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry from September 2016 to March 2017.

Results

Of the 1163 patients retrospectively analysed, 257 (22.0%) met the criteria for hypertensive urgency and 356 (30.6%) for hypertensive emergency. Mean SBP (SD) was 203 (19) mmHg and mean DBP 121 (12) mmHg. Mean age was 60.1 (14.6) years; 55.1% were men. In 6.3% of patients with hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency, nonadherence was recorded as an attributing factor. Of the 59 patients prospectively analysed, 18 (30.5%) were nonadherent for at least one of the prescribed antihypertensive drugs.

Conclusion

Hypertensive urgency and hypertensive emergency are common health problems resulting in frequent emergency department admissions. Workup of patients with a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency should include an assessment of drug adherence to optimize treatment strategy.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive emergency, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to reduce SBP in patients with a hypertensive emergency but without a compelling condition using oral or parenteral therapy by no more than 25% within the first hour. If stable, further reduce to < 160/100 mmHg within the next 2–6 hours, and then cautiously to 130–140 mmHg during the next 24–48 hours to limit target organ injury.

### The management of elevated blood pressure in the acute care setting: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112T6Vi2]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, a substantial body of high-quality evidence has guided the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the outpatient setting. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.

### Clinical features in the management of selected hypertensive emergencies [^112R8mrv]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A hypertensive emergency is a clinical diagnosis that is appropriate when marked hypertension is associated with acute target-organ damage; in this setting, lowering of blood pressure (BP) is typically begun within hours of diagnosis. For hypertensive urgency with no acute target-organ damage, BP lowering may occur over hours to days. A hypertensive emergency may present with cardiac, renal, neurologic, hemorrhagic, or obstetric manifestations, but prompt recognition of the condition and institution of rapidly acting parenteral therapy to lower BP (typically in an intensive care unit) are widely recommended. For aortic dissection, the systolic BP target is lower than 120 mm Hg, to be achieved during the first 20 minutes using a beta-blocker (typically esmolol) and a vasodilator to reduce both shear stress on the aortic tear and the BP, respectively. Otherwise, sodium nitroprusside is the agent with the lowest acquisition cost and longest record of successful use in hypertensive emergencies; however, it is metabolized to toxic thiocyanate and cyanide. Other attractive agents include fenoldopam mesylate, nicardipine, and labetalol; in pregnant women, magnesium and nifedipine are used commonly. Most authors suggest a reduction in mean arterial pressure of approximately 10% during the first hour and a further 10% to 15% during the next 2 to 4 hours; hypoperfusion can result if the BP is lowered too suddenly or too far (eg, into the range of < 140/90 mm Hg). Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6 to 12 hours of parenteral therapy, and the patient moved out of the intensive care unit, when consideration should be given to screening for secondary causes of hypertension. Long-term follow-up to ensure adequate control of hypertension is necessary to prevent further target-organ damage and recurrence of another hypertensive emergency.

### Malignant hypertension: current perspectives and challenges [^112ACdjv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

About 0.5% to 3% of all emergency department visits concern individuals who present with a suspected hypertensive emergency. One quarter of them have a hypertensive emergency that requires urgent treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) to safe levels. Hypertensive emergencies are potentially life‐threatening manifestations of hypertension, associated with acute impairment of ≥ 1 organs including the large arteries, heart, kidney, and brain. The Studying the Treatment of Acute Hypertension registry reported 6.9% hospital mortality and a 37% readmission rate 90 days after discharge for a hypertensive emergency in 25 US institutions, between January 2007 and April 2008. Of the different types of hypertensive emergencies, malignant hypertension (MHT) is characterized by extreme BP elevations and acute microvascular damage affecting various organs, in particular the retina, brain, and kidney (Table). Data on prevalence and incidence of MHT are sparse. In large multi‐ethnic urban communities in Birmingham (United Kingdom) and Amsterdam (Netherlands), overall incident rates of MHT have been 2 new cases per 100 000 individuals per year, with up to 4‐fold higher rates (7.3 per 100 000 per year) reported for self‐reported Black‐African/Afro‐Caribbean ethnicity. While survival after MHT has considerably improved, it is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Amraoui et al reported an all‐cause mortality of 10% at 5 years in patients with a mean age of 44 years, while 20% needed a kidney replacement. Yet MHT has received little attention from the medical and scientific community, and diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are mainly based on consensus rather than robust data, while definitions are not uniform (Table).

In this review, we summarize current viewpoints on MHT, highlight ongoing challenges in its management, and propose future investigations to improve patient care.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^114xTM2s]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

To improve the care of patients with elevated blood pressure (BP) in the emergency department (ED), we provide an overview of the management of hypertensive emergencies, followed by an overview of the management of markedly elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. Of equal, if not greater importance, we then deliberate on assessment of patients with nonmarkedly elevated BP and the evolving, essential role that emergency medicine has in population-level hypertension management and in reducing long-term cardiovascular disparities that remain particularly pervasive in urban environments where poor BP control is common. We highlight our experience in Detroit, where hypertension directly contributes to a 1.5-fold increase in years of potential life lost due to heart disease in African Americans compared with non-Hispanic Whites under age 75 years. We emphasize that reducing such disparities will require the entire house of medicine to work together to overcome the impact that elevated hypertension has on communities nationwide.

An estimated 33–50% of adults in the United States have hypertension, and approximately 41–50% of these adults do not have adequate BP control. More than 145 million ED visits take place each year in the United States, and the estimated prevalence of elevated BP among these patients is close to 45%. In an analysis of 7 years of data from the Nationwide ED Sample (2006–2012), 165.9 million hypertension-related visits (23.6% of all visits) occurred. During this same period, patients hospitalized declined while hypertension-related ED visits increased. Data from 2016 showed that approximately 1.2 million ED visits had a chief complaint of essential hypertension.

Based on their training, emergency medicine clinicians naturally focus on the identification and management of hypertensive emergencies for those patients with elevated BP. These critical conditions require rapid evaluation and treatment; however, such patients are rare overall, accounting for < 2% of ED visits where high BP is noted. Accordingly, nearly all patients that emergency clinicians see in the ED with elevated BP, including markedly elevated BP (i.e. ≥ 180/110 mm Hg), are not experiencing an emergency that requires immediate intervention. Despite this, there is often an expectation on the part of patients and other providers, who send their patients to the ED based on a perceived acute risk associated with markedly elevated BP, that something will (or should) be done. Such expectations lead to wide variation in practice patterns.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^113Lycfb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111EyfB8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — acute management and follow-up — are guided by identifying affected target organs and any precipitating cause, defining the recommended timescale and magnitude of blood pressure (BP) lowering, and selecting the type of BP-lowering treatment; in a hypertensive emergency, intravenous (i.v.) treatment with a drug with a short half-life is ideal with facilities for continuous haemodynamic monitoring. Rapid uncontrolled BP lowering is not recommended as this can lead to complications. Intravenous drug administration is recommended for most hypertension emergencies, but oral therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers is sometimes very effective in malignant hypertension; low initial doses should be used and treatment should take place in hospital. For prognosis and follow-up, we recommend frequent, at least monthly, visits in a specialized setting until the optimal target BP is achieved and long-term specialist follow-up thereafter.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD OF PRESUMPTIVELY TREATING HYPERTENSION AS ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION

To detect primary aldosteronism, providers must first consider it as a possibility. The 2016 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend screening for primary aldosteronism in hypertensive patients with any of the following:
(1) Spontaneous or diuretic‐induced hypokalemia.
(2) Hypertension resistant to three conventional antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic).
(3) Controlled blood pressure (< 140/90) on four or more antihypertensive drugs.
(4) Sustained blood pressure above 150/100 on three separate measurements on different days.
(5) A mass on the adrenal gland (i.e. adrenal incidentaloma).
(6) Sleep apnea.
(7) A family history positive for stroke or hypertension before age 40.
(8) First‐degree relatives with primary aldosteronism.

Definitions of elevated BP states

Various terminologies have been applied to describe severe elevation in BP, including acute severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency, malignant hypertension (MHT), accelerated phase hypertension and hypertensive crisis. It is important to distinguish between the key terms to guide appropriate management and minimise the potential for iatrogenic harm.

Acute severe hypertension

The definition of 'severe' has changed progressively in the last 70 years. Most experts would accept that a BP of > 200/120 mmHg is severe, and needs urgent attention, but the degree of urgency depends on the precise circumstances. For example, a BP of 180/100 mmHg in a poorly adherent, uncontrolled chronically hypertensive patient, would not usually be considered as acute severe HTN needing immediate treatment, whereas a BP of 160/100 mmHg would be a medical (hypertensive) emergency in the context of acute end organ damage (EOD), such as preeclampsia. We prefer the term 'acute severe hypertension' to indicate patients with severe elevation in BP without evidence of acute and/or life-threatening EOD. Most patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) belong to this category and it is difficult to distinguish whether the rise in BP is acute or chronic especially if BP has not been measured recently. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (NG 136) refer to this subgroup as severe hypertension {NICE, 2019 }. The term 'hypertensive urgency' in patients who are asymptomatic is not necessarily useful as this can lead to undue anxiety in patients and increased costs to healthcare with low associated morbidity; we prefer to avoid the use of this term.

Hypertensive emergency

Hypertensive emergency is elevated BP, which when sustained over the next few hours may lead to progressive life-threatening EOD. It primarily includes conditions such as acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, aortic dissection, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, pheochromocytoma crisis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In several of these diagnoses, BP may be severely elevated though not necessarily. Even a moderate elevation of BP can be potentially life-threatening in certain situations, particularly if the elevation of BP is rapid. Rise in BP may not be the immediate causal factor in some emergency states like acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) but may co-exist and complicate management.

Conclusions

Based on data from a valid, nationwide, representative sample, the estimated number of visits for hypertensive emergency and the rate per million adult ED visits has more than doubled from 2006 to 2013. However, hypertensive emergencies are rare, occurring in about 2 of every 1000 adult ED visits in the United States, and 6 in 1000 adult ED visits carrying any diagnosis of hypertension. This figure is far lower than what has been sometimes cited in previous literature.

Severely elevated blood pressure is a common clinical problem en-countered in the Emergency Department. It is often difficult for physicians to differentiate between patients who need emergent blood pressure reduction, requiring the use of intravenous agents and in-tensive monitoring, and those for whom careful, slow reduction in BP is more appropriate. The optimal assessment and management of these patients is reviewed here, with an emphasis on clinical strategies that will most efficiently identify those at greatest risk.

When evaluating treatment, we categorize for classes of drugs and did not record the exact doses of all drugs for management of all patients during the follow-up.

Thirdly the results cannot be generalized to other settings as these data were collected at a single department. However, several observational available studies have shown a high rate of cardiovascular events not only in patients with hypertensive emergencies but also with hypertensive urgencies.

In conclusion, we have underscored the importance of organizing comprehensive research efforts to improve current knowledge in this growing group of high-risk patients, hoping that in the future, we will be able to provide better overall care and improve cardiovascular outcome.

### Association between hypertensive urgencies and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension [^115NT33H]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with hypertensive urgency have a higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular events compared with hypertensive patients without this event.

Methods

Overall, 384 patients with hypertensive urgency and 295 control patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Hypertensive urgency was defined as a systolic blood pressure above 220 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg without any evidence of acute end-organ damage. The control group consisted of patients admitted to the emergency department with a systolic blood pressure between 135 to 180 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure between 85–110 mmHg. The number of cardiovascular events defined as acute coronary syndrome, acute stroke, atrial fibrillation, acute left ventricular failure and aortic aneurysm were consecutively analyzed during follow-up. The median follow-up time was 4.2 years (interquartile range 2.9–5.7 years). Twenty-six patients of the urgency group and 23 patients of the control group were lost for follow-up.

Results

Overall, 117 (17%) patients had nonfatal clinical cardiovascular events and 13 had (2%) fatal cardiovascular events. The frequency of cardiovascular events was significantly higher in patients with hypertensive urgencies (88 vs. 42; P = 0.005). The Cox regression analysis identified age (P < 0.001) and hypertensive urgencies (P = 0.035) as independent predictors for subsequent cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

Hypertensive urgencies are associated with an increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with arterial hypertension.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^112u7T4Y]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

At present, few data are available on the prognosis of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies admitted to emergency departments.

Aim:

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of total and cardiovascular events during follow-up in hypertensive patients admitted to the emergency departments of Brescia Hospital (Northern Italy) with hypertensive emergencies or urgencies from 1 January to 31 December 2015.

Methods:

Medical records of patients aged more than 18 years, admitted to the emergency department with SBP values at least 180 mmHg (SBP) and/or DBP values at least 120 mmHg (DBP) were collected and analysed (18% of patients were classified as 'hypertensive emergency' and 82% as 'hypertensive urgency'). Data in 895 patients (385 men and 510 women, mean age 70. 5 ± 15 years) were analysed; the mean duration of follow-up after admission to the emergency department was 12 ± 5 months.

Results:

During the follow-up, 96 cardiovascular events (28 fatal) occurred (20 cardiac events, 30 cerebrovascular events, 26 hospital admission for heart failure, 20 cases of new onset kidney disease). In 40 patients (4.5%), a new episode of acute blood pressure rise with referral to the emergency department was recorded. Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity were greater in patients with a previous hypertensive emergency (14.5 vs. 4.5% in patients with hypertensive emergency and urgency, respectively, chi-square, P < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained when the occurrence of cerebrovascular or renal events were considered separately.

Conclusion:

Admission to the emergency department for hypertensive emergencies and urgencies identifies hypertensive patients at increased risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Our findings add some new finding suggesting that further research in this field should be improved aiming to define, prevent, treat and follow hypertensive urgencies and emergencies.

Exploratory analysis of the risk of Progression to hypertensive emergency following hypertensive urgency

During the one-year postdischarge risk period, in the overall population of patients with hypertensive urgency before PSM, 960 patients (4.1%) progressed to hypertensive emergency.

On exploratory multivariable Cox regression analysis (Supplementary Figure 1), factors independently associated with an increased risk of progression to hypertensive emergency included female sex (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13–1.37), Black or African American ethnicity (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.32–1.80), Asian ethnicity (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03–1.70), smoking (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.47–1.80), secondary hypertension (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28–1.66), diabetes (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11–1.36), and CKD (HR 3.68, 95% CI 3.33–4.07). Conversely, factors associated with a significantly reduced risk of progression were advanced age (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.47–0.59) and obesity (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71–0.86).

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^114nCRpg]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

In 2015, out of 69 101 patients admitted to emergency department, 1214 (1.76%) (mean age 70 + 14 years, 41% men) had a hypertensive emergency (n = 187, 15.4%, 0.22% of all emergency department visits) or urgency (n = 1027, 84.5%, 1.1% of all emergency department visits).

Out of 1214 patients assessed in the emergency department during the 12 months period in 2015, 11 patients died shortly after hospitalization (nine patients with hypertensive emergency, seven with a cerebrovascular event, one with a coronary syndrome and one with an acute heart failure) and two patients with hypertensive urgency with an advanced neoplastic disease died from nosocomial infection.

Out of the remaining 1203 patients, 249 were not able to give information and 59 refused to answer to the interview; at the end 895 patients (43% men, mean age 70.5 + 15 years) were available for the telephone interview (Fig. 1). No significant differences in patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities and prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies were observed between the whole group of patients and those included in the follow-up (Supplemental Table 1).

FIGURE 1
Flow-chart showing the selection of the study population.

Prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 73 and 22%, respectively, 18% had a previous diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and 15% of cerebrovascular diseases; 737 patients (82%) presented as hypertensive urgency and 158 (18%) as hypertensive emergency.

Patients with hypertensive emergencies compared with hypertensive urgencies were older, more frequently men (56 vs. 40%), had higher prevalence of previous cardiovascular disease, and had slightly higher values of SBP and DBP at admission in the emergency department (Table 1).

Summary of international guidelines for hypertensive emergencies

The ESC/ESH and AHA/ACC guidelines (Table 14) state that the aim of treatment of markedly elevated BP is to intensify/reinstitute oral anti-hypertensive drug therapy and ensure adequate follow-up with acknowledgement of the lack of a robust evidence base. There is overall general agreement that a patient with acute EOD is managed as hypertensive emergency, usually treated with IV anti-hypertensive therapy, in a high dependency/intensive care environment. There is, however, heterogeneity in outlined management of patients with acute severe HTN and the pace of reduction in BP in various specific scenarios. The guidelines mostly adopt a threshold BP of 180/110–120 mmHg to define severely elevated BP. Our opinion differs in that regard, as there cannot be a single cut off value of BP that is too low to cause EOD and the corollary that not all patients with 'severely elevated BP' need immediate treatment and assessment should be directed to define and treat the EOD. It is important to treat the patient and not the numbers. The targets for BP reduction and the pace of reduction defined in several hypertensive emergency states are not based on robust evidence and are mostly based on expert opinion. It must be widely appreciated that anti-hypertensive therapy should be personalised to the patient's characteristics and the aim of treatment should be to reduce BP proportionally rather than to an arbitrary target value.

### Hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and postpartum period [^115JrM47]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects 10% of pregnancies, many with underlying chronic hypertension, and approximately 1–2% will undergo a hypertensive crisis at some point during their lives. Hypertensive crisis includes hypertensive urgency and emergency; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes a hypertensive emergency in pregnancy as persistent (lasting 15 min or more), acute-onset, severe hypertension, defined as systolic BP greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Pregnancy may be complicated by hypertensive crisis, with lower blood pressure threshold for end-organ damage than non-pregnant patients. Maternal assessment should include a thorough history. Fetal assessment should include heart rate tracing, ultrasound for growth and amniotic assessment, and Doppler evaluation if growth restriction is suspected. Initial management of hypertensive emergency (systolic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 110 mmHg in the setting of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) generally includes the rapid reduction of blood pressure through the use of intravenous antihypertensive medications, with goal systolic blood pressure between 140 mmHg and 150 mmHg and diastolic pressure between 90 mmHg and 100 mmHg. First-line intravenous drugs include labetalol and hydralazine, but other agents may be used, including esmolol, nicardipine, nifedipine, and, as a last resort, sodium nitroprusside. Among patients with hypertensive urgency, slower blood pressure reduction can be provided with oral agents. The objective of this article is to review the current understanding, diagnosis, and management of hypertensive crisis during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

### How important it is to determine the blood pressure in paediatric patients? [^116GYRtg]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of hypertension among the paediatric population is 1%-2%. The emergency physician should recognise potentially harmful blood pressure (BP) levels and ensure they are adequately treated, in order to avoid life-threatening complications. A hypertensive emergency is a severely elevated BP complicated by target organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and/or renal). Hypertensive urgency, however, is a severe elevation in BP without target organ dysfunction. This distinction is critical for the clinical approach. The authors present a case of a severe hypertension due to primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In this case, the lack of BP measurement in the infant surveillance and the devaluation of an albuminuria detected in a previous routine urine examination, have culminated in a late diagnosis of a severe hypertension, with subsequent effects on target organs.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZCRSs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis included single‐arm retrospective or prospective studies. These studies are not designed to establish a cause‐and‐effect relationship between variables, such as the relationship between severe hypertension and HMOD, due to the lack of a comparison group. To establish cause‐and‐effect relationships, controlled studies are optimal as they include a comparison group. However, for patients with hypertensive emergency, there is a lack of controlled studies. In the case of severe hypertension and HMOD, controlled studies are warranted that would compare the incidence of organ damage between patients with severe hypertension and prescribed a particular treatment, and a control group of patients with severe hypertension who received a different treatment or no treatment at all. Additionally, controlled studies should also use rigorous analysis to adjust for confounding factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, or any other variables that may influence HMOD. Furthermore, controlled studies should also evaluate and reduce bias due to conditions that can lead to certain organ damage in low BP conditions, such as aortic dissection. Controlled studies should also evaluate, and reduce bias, due to conditions that can lead to certain organ‐damage in low BP conditions, such as aortic dissection. Future studies should also provide analysis regarding the impact of conditions such as connective tissue disorders, congenital abnormalities of the aorta, or the trauma on incidence of hypertensive emergency, in order to reduce the heterogeneity in prevalence of hypertensive emergency. In addition to this, a lack of data in the existing literature limited our ability to conduct an analysis on the impact of severe hypertension with or without particular risk factors. Therefore, large‐scale, high‐powered controlled studies with comparators are crucial to assess the impact of coexistence of various comorbidities that can influence organ damage in patients with severe hypertension. Such studies also help in developing personalized treatment strategies that address multiple risk factors and improve hypertension control. Furthermore, data are limited regarding patients with hypertensive emergency who were admitted after presenting to the ED, with only 2 studies reporting this outcome. One study belonged to France (Europe), and another study was from Tanzania (Africa). Hence, more studies with rigorous analysis are warranted to further evaluate the reasons for not admitting patients with hypertensive emergency, such as differences in severity of condition, variation in health care systems and practices, and comorbidities or other factors that could make hospitalization challenging. Lastly, the included studies may have missed some patients with severe BP elevations but not quite high enough for inclusion BP thresholds who had new or worsening target‐organ injury that was likely attributable to their BP.

### Characteristics, practice patterns, and outcomes in patients with acute hypertension: European registry for studying the treatment of acute hyperTension (euro-STAT) [^114CMo7R]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to have hypertension, which increases their risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and organ injury. One percent of all hypertensive patients experience at least one episode of acute, severe hypertension, necessitating intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy and placing these patients at risk of overt, acute end-organ damage over their lifetime. The actual prevalence may in fact be much higher. One-fourth of patients who present to busy emergency departments (EDs) have acute, severe hypertension. In the present study, we defined this population by using a pragmatic approach according to whether the treating physicians decided to use IV antihypertensive therapy.

Multiple effective strategies are used for the management of chronic hypertension, but less is known about treating patients who present with acute, severe elevations in arterial blood pressure (BP). The optimal target for BP lowering has yet to be defined; the definitions of hypertensive urgencies, emergencies and outcome measures lack uniformity; evidence supporting the use of one drug over another is lacking; and whether certain treatments are better than others is unknown. As a consequence, treatment practices vary. The European registry for Studying the Treatment of Acute hyperTension (Euro-STAT) was conducted to evaluate 'real-life' management practices and outcomes in patients treated with IV antihypertensive therapy for an episode of acute hypertension.

Hypertensive emergency BP-lowering targets — compelling condition versus no compelling condition: For adults with a hypertensive emergency related to a compelling condition, systolic BP (SBP) should be reduced to < 140 mm Hg for most conditions and to < 120 mm Hg in acute aortic dissection during the first hour while monitoring for other target organ dysfunction (1 C-LD). For adults with a hypertensive emergency but without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than 25% within the first hour, then if stable to < 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours, and then cautiously to 130 to 140 mm Hg during the next 24 to 48 hours to limit target organ injury (1 C-LD). Hypertensive emergencies in patients with acute ICH or acute ischemic stroke and in pregnant adults are addressed in separate sections.

Classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings on each of 2 or more office visits. JNC 7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, and patients with prehypertension are at increased risk for progression to hypertension; those in the 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic range are at twice the risk to develop hypertension as those with lower values. The table applies to adults aged 18 years or older.

### Hypertensive emergencies and urgencies: a preliminary report of the ongoing Italian multicentric study ERIDANO [^114Bpvxq]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive urgencies (HU) and hypertensive emergencies (HE) are challenges for the Emergency Department (ED). A prospective multicentre study is ongoing to characterize patients with acute hypertensive disorders, prevalence of subclinical hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), short- and long-term prognosis; this is a preliminary report. Patients admitted to the ED with symptomatic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180/110mmHg were enrolled. They were managed by ED personnel according to their clinical presentations. Subsequently they underwent clinical evaluation and subclinical HMOD assessment at a Hypertension Centre within 72h from enrolment. 122 patients were included in this report. Mean age was 60.7 ± 13.9 years, 52.5% were females. 18 (14.8%) patients were diagnosed with HE, 108 (88.5%) with HU. There were no differences in gender, BMI, and cardiovascular comorbidities between groups. At ED discharge, 66.7% and 93.6% (p = 0.003) of HE and HU patients, respectively, had BP < 180/110mmHg. After 72h, 34.4% of patients resulted normotensive; 35.2%, 22.1%, and 8.2% had hypertension grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Patients with uncontrolled BP at office evaluation had higher vascular HMOD (49.1 vs. 25.9%, p = 0.045). Cardiac (60 vs. 34%, p = 0.049), renal (27.8 vs. 9.6%, p = 0.010) and cerebral (100 vs. 21%, p < 0.001) HMOD was more frequent in HE compared to HU group. HE showed greater cardiac, renal, and cerebral subclinical HMOD, compared to HU. 72-hours BP control is not associated with different HMOD, except for vascular HMOD; therefore, proper comprehensive examination after discharge from the ED could provide added value in cardiovascular risk stratification of such patients. One third of patients with acute blood pressure rise evaluated to the ED resulted normotensive at office evaluation (< 72hours after discharge). Patients with hypertensive emergency showed greater cardiac, renal, and cerebral subclinical HMOD, compared to the patients with hypertensive urgency.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vYXb8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has potential clinical implications. Patients who are discharged after adequate control of BP in the emergency setting may be considered "stable", but clearly these patients continue to carry a substantial risk of subsequent hospitalization. Thus, multidisciplinary evaluation before discharge and close follow‐up thereafter are essential. There is a need to develop treatment protocols that can allow not just management of severe hypertension in the acute phase but also ameliorate hypertension and organ damage in the chronic phase.

A potential limitation of our study is that specific clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease mortality or all‐cause mortality, were not evaluated due to a lack of studies providing such data. Similarly, any racial or ethnic minority groups were also not evaluated. This restricts our capacity to quantitatively assess the frequency of hypertensive emergencies and their clinical consequences in these populations quantitatively. Moreover, 1 study was from patients in the United States. It is necessary to conduct more studies in high‐risk patients and create a link between trends in the loss of hypertension control in these patients and hypertensive emergency. Moreover, the impact of COVID‐19 on the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies and HMOD could not be evaluated and warrants further exploration. Different assessment methodologies for subtypes of HMOD, as well as variance in the established criteria that categorize an individual as a patient with a hypertensive emergency, might explain the discrepancy across the included studies. Additional retrospective and prospective studies in patients with hypertensive emergency are required to ascertain other subtypes of organ damage, such as papilledema or hypotension, which were not included in the current analysis due to a lack of studies. The data on subsequent hospitalization were limited and obtained from patients surviving an acute severe hypertension event; however, time after discharge was not published in our included studies. Therefore, studies evaluating the incidence of hospitalization among various predefined durations such as 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year are required to understand the risk factors of hospitalization.

### Long-term risk of adverse events in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for hypertensive crisis [^114YZn43]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond the increased risk of all-cause death and MACE, patients with hypertensive emergencies also had an increased risk of incident AF compared to those with hypertensive urgencies. Chronic hypertension though hemodynamic changes, neuroendocrine factors, and cardiac remodelling create a favourable environment where AF can onset and perpetuate. Thus, the high prevalence of preexisting hypertension in patients with hypertensive emergencies, may help to explain the high risk of incident AF found in these patients. However, it cannot be excluded that an acute and severe BP increase may have similar effects, especially when additional well known risk factors for AF, such as the target organ damages, are present. Regardless of the origin, both incident and preexisting AF may contribute to the high risk of adverse events in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, the risk of MACE in patients with hypertensive emergencies could be even higher than reported in our study. The subgroup analysis suggests a competitive risk between the two primary outcomes in patients with preexisting AF, potentially leading to an underestimated risk of MACE due to their high risk of all-cause death.

Additionally, we found that the incidence of new dialysis treatments over the one-year period after hospital discharge was higher in patients with hypertensive emergencies than in those with hypertensive urgencies. This may represent another key factor contributing to the increased risk of cardiovascular events, as dialysis dependence not only raises the risk of AF but also predisposes patients to other cardiovascular events and complicates the clinical management of preexisting cardiovascular conditions.

Lastly, we observed that 4% of patients with hypertensive urgencies progressed to hypertensive emergencies within one-year after hospital discharge. No previous studies have specifically investigated this aspect. Thus, these incidence data and the associated clinical phenotypes – characterised by female sex, young age, Black or Asian ethnicity together with a high cardiovascular burden – needs to be confirmed in dedicated prospective studies.

In light of these results, future studies on the clinical course of patients with hypertensive crises should place greater emphasis on the impact of both incident and preexisting AF, as well as dialysis, on the risk of adverse events. There remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding the optimal screening and therapeutic strategies for detecting and managing AF in this setting. Moreover, further research is needed to identify the key risk factors for the progression from hypertensive urgency to hypertensive emergency, allowing for the characterization of clinical phenotypes with varying levels of risk.

### Cardiovascular prognosis in patients admitted to an emergency department with hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [^113s6Zyr]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

At present, few data are available on the prognosis of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies admitted to emergency departments.

Aim

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of total and cardiovascular events during follow-up in hypertensive patients admitted to the emergency departments of Brescia Hospital (Northern Italy) with hypertensive emergencies or urgencies from 1 January to 31 December 2015.

Methods

Medical records of patients aged more than 18 years, admitted to the emergency department with SBP values at least 180mmHg (SBP) and/or DBP values at least 120mmHg (DBP) were collected and analysed (18% of patients were classified as 'hypertensive emergency' and 82% as 'hypertensive urgency'). Data in 895 patients (385 men and 510 women, mean age 70. 5 ± 15years) were analysed; the mean duration of follow-up after admission to the emergency department was 12 ± 5months.

Results

During the follow-up, 96 cardiovascular events (28 fatal) occurred (20 cardiac events, 30 cerebrovascular events, 26 hospital admission for heart failure, 20 cases of new onset kidney disease). In 40 patients (4.5%), a new episode of acute blood pressure rise with referral to the emergency department was recorded. Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity were greater in patients with a previous hypertensive emergency (14.5 vs. 4.5% in patients with hypertensive emergency and urgency, respectively, chi-square, P < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained when the occurrence of cerebrovascular or renal events were considered separately.

Conclusion

Admission to the emergency department for hypertensive emergencies and urgencies identifies hypertensive patients at increased risk for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Our findings add some new finding suggesting that further research in this field should be improved aiming to define, prevent, treat and follow hypertensive urgencies and emergencies.

During the follow-up (mean duration 12 ± 5 months), 77% of patients with hypertensive urgency and 89% of patients with hypertensive emergency was treated with different antihypertensive drugs. Among patients with hypertensive urgencies and hypertensive emergencies, no treatment during the follow-up was reported in 14.5 and 2.5% of cases (P < 0.001), whereas withdrawal of prescribed treatment was recorded in 3.7 and 1.9% (P < 0.05), respectively (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Treatment with cardiovascular drugs during follow-up in patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies

Twenty patients with hypertensive urgencies reported normal BP values without any treatment after the discharge from the emergency department, and therefore, withdrew the prescribed treatment, remaining normotensive, other seven patients refused treatment. Among patients with hypertensive emergencies, three with a previous stroke reported normal BP values and were not anymore treated with antihypertensive drugs.

The use of beta-blockers, of ACE inhibitors, of dihydropiridinic calcium channel blockers, of clonidine and of diuretics was greater in the group with hypertensive emergencies, possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of comorbidities (Table 3).

TABLE 3
Characteristics of patients with and without cardiovascular events during the follow-up

Concerning the follow-up, BP measurements were available in 94% of patients and a similar prevalence of BP control (76%) was reported in patients with hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies; in few patients in both groups (6%) no data on BP measurement were recorded.

In 3 cases, a diagnosis of new-onset diabetes, and in 15, a new diagnosis of hypertension was reported. In 40 patients (4.5%), a new episode of acute BP rise with referral to the emergency department was recorded, without a significant difference between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies (3.9 vs. 3.3%, respectively, P = NS).

NONEMERGENT HYPERTENSION

While hypertensive emergencies are rare, ED encounters with elevated BP are common and represent valuable opportunities to recognize and address chronic hypertension, particularly among difficult-to-reach patient populations. ED visits related to hypertension rose more than 5% annually from 2006 to 2012. In 2012, just over 1 million ED visits had a primary diagnosis of hypertension, and almost 27 million ED visits were hypertension related. Thus, appropriate recognition and management of nonemergent BP elevations for patients with and without diagnosed hypertension should be a core function of emergency medicine clinicians.

One of the primary issues that affect the management of nonemergent BP elevations in the ED is uncertainty around measurement accuracy. BP measurements over minutes to hours using appropriate cuff size and patient positioning can provide valuable information regarding BP variability, range, and trajectory, which can supplement clinic and home BP measurements to guide hypertension diagnosis and medication titration. Multiple studies have shown that BP remains elevated after ED discharge for many patients, and even when BP decreases after ED visits, it does not reach normotension. Elevated SBP and DBP in the ED are both risk factors for incident cardiovascular disease, and the risk rises in a step-wise, dose-dependent fashion with increasing ED BP. The number needed to screen to prevent a single cardiovascular event was 151, but that decreases to 71 among patients with ED BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg in the ED. ED BP is particularly informative when measured more than an hour after ED arrival and when it remains elevated over repeated measures, but even triage BP provides important information despite the potential for measurement error due to cuff size and patient positioning. Among ED patients discharged with home BP monitors, more than 88% of patients with a single ED triage BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg had a mean home BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg. Another 46% of patients with elevated BP in the ED met criteria for hypertension in follow-up based on home BP monitor, and it is notable that ED physician gestalt was less accurate than mean ED BP for elevated post-ED BP.
