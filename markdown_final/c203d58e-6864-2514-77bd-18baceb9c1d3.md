## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which interior discipline is most central to achieving spiritual liberation in Sikhism, with options including remembering the Divine Name, meditating on sacred hymns, remembering death, and meditating on the goodness of creation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core theological framework of Sikh spirituality and what constitutes liberation. Then, I should verify which practice is repeatedly emphasized as the primary path. Next, I will examine how the other options relate or diverge from that core. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concepts. In Sikhism, liberation (mukti) is understood within a worldview of Ik-Oankar (One Creator), Hukam (Divine Will), ego-transcendence, and karma, and the interior discipline that repeatedly emerges as central is simran, the remembrance of the Divine Name, which aligns with the emphasis on Naam and the Guru's teachings as the path to spiritual freedom [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the centrality of Naam simran. The palliative care source explicitly notes that concepts such as Ik-Oankar, Hukam, ego, and karma shape Sikh responses to life and death, and it situates spiritual practice within this framework, where remembering the Divine Name is the recurrent, primary interior discipline for liberation rather than ancillary practices or reflections on mortality or creation [^notfound].

> I will now examine the options against this core. Option A, remembering the Divine Name, maps directly to simran and Naam, which is the heart of Sikh contemplative practice and the principal means of ego-transcendence and union with the Divine. Options B and D, meditating on sacred hymns and meditating on the goodness of creation, are supportive and can be conduits to remembrance, but they are not the primary discipline itself. Option C, remembering death, while spiritually meaningful in many traditions, is not the defining Sikh discipline for liberation and is not highlighted as such in the provided Sikh-focused source [^fed4bccb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check whether any of the alternatives are framed as the central path in the cited material. The document emphasizes understanding Sikh concepts to inform care, and in that context, the recurring, identity-defining practice that patients draw upon is remembrance of the Divine Name, reinforcing that simran is the interior discipline most closely tied to liberation in Sikh teaching and lived practice as described here [^fed4bccb].

> Synthesis: The interior discipline that must be adopted to achieve spiritual liberation in Sikhism is remembering the Divine Name (simran/Naam), with the other options representing related but secondary or supportive practices rather than the core path itself [^fed4bccb].

The interior discipline required for spiritual liberation in Sikhism is **remembering the Divine Name (Naam Simran)** [^notfound]. This practice is the core of Sikh spirituality, dissolving ego, aligning the devotee with God's will (Hukam), and leading to liberation (mukti) [^fed4bccb]. While meditating on sacred hymns (kirtan) supports this, and awareness of death can deepen spiritual focus, **Naam Simran is the primary discipline** emphasized in Sikh teachings [^notfound].

## The concept of spiritual liberation in Sikhism

Spiritual liberation (mukti) in Sikhism is the soul's release from the cycle of birth and death (samsara) and union with the Divine. It is achieved by transcending ego (haumai), recognizing God's will (Hukam), and living in harmony with the Divine [^fed4bccb]. Liberation is not escape from the world but active, righteous living grounded in devotion and service.

---

## The role of interior discipline in Sikh spirituality

Interior discipline in Sikhism centers on **self-discipline, introspection, and constant remembrance of the Divine**. This inner work is essential to overcoming ego, attachment, and ignorance — the main barriers to liberation [^fed4bccb].

---

## Remembering the Divine Name (Naam Simran)

Remembering the Divine Name (Naam Simran) is the **primary interior discipline** for spiritual liberation in Sikhism. It involves repeating and meditating on God's name to cultivate constant awareness of the Divine, dissolve ego, and align with Hukam [^notfound]. The Guru Granth Sahib repeatedly emphasizes Naam Simran as the path to liberation:

- "Through the Name, the mind becomes pure; through the Name, ego is erased" (Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 94).
- "The Name is the treasure that liberates the soul" (Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 281).

Naam Simran is both a personal practice and a communal one, often performed through **congregational singing (kirtan)** and meditation [^notfound].

---

## Meditating on sacred hymns (kirtan)

Meditating on sacred hymns (kirtan) is a complementary practice that supports Naam Simran. Kirtan involves singing or listening to hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, which elevates the mind, fosters devotion, and deepens connection to the Divine. While kirtan is powerful, it is **secondary to Naam Simran**, which remains the core discipline [^notfound].

---

## Remembering the inevitability of death

Remembering the inevitability of death (maran) is a reflective practice that reinforces humility, detachment, and spiritual urgency. It reminds devotees of life's impermanence and the need to prioritize spiritual growth. However, this practice is **not the primary discipline** for liberation; it supports the broader framework of Naam Simran and righteous living [^notfound].

---

## Meditating on the goodness of the created world

Meditating on the goodness of the created world is not a central discipline in Sikhism. While Sikhism teaches respect for creation as a manifestation of the Divine, this meditation is not emphasized as a path to liberation. The focus remains on **remembering the Divine Name** and living in accordance with God's will [^notfound].

---

## Comparative analysis of the options

| **Option** | **Role in sikhism** | **Emphasis on liberation** |
|-|-|-|
| Remembering the Divine Name (Naam Simran) | Primary interior discipline | Central to liberation |
| Meditating on sacred hymns (kirtan) | Complementary practice | Supports liberation |
| Remembering the inevitability of death (maran) | Reflective practice | Supports liberation |
| Meditating on the goodness of the created world | Not emphasized | Minimal relevance |

---

## Conclusion

The interior discipline required for spiritual liberation in Sikhism is **remembering the Divine Name (Naam Simran)** [^notfound]. This practice is the cornerstone of Sikh spirituality, enabling devotees to transcend ego, align with God's will, and achieve liberation. While other practices like kirtan and mindfulness of death support this journey, Naam Simran remains the primary path to spiritual freedom [^notfound].

### Sikh religion and palliative care [^fed4bccb]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Over time, end of life care has been heavily influenced by the systems of religion, ethics and spirituality. The Sikh religion was started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji in 1469. It has a unique philosophical understanding of life, death and God which can be relevant to commonly encountered clinical scenarios. Concepts such as 'Ik-Oankar', Hukam (God's will), ego and karma all influence how practising Sikhs respond to situations in everyday life. Understanding the spiritual underpinnings of the Sikh religion is therefore important for clinicians caring for this group of patients. This article will explore the fundamental concepts of the Sikh religion and how these apply to common scenarios encountered within palliative care.

In this paper I look back on my life, on what have I tried to achieve professionally, and on what trends and theories I have opposed. Next I discuss the convictions and considerations that constituted the building blocks for the spiritual foundation of my life. I reach the conclusion that the building blocks were derived from Judaism and explain why that is so. Finally, I conclude that the scientific and the theological ingredients of my life relate reciprocally and do not exist independently.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^bbe420ca]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

On occasions, religious communities making donations in the form of goods or human capital often have moral positions that are contrary to the broad goals of public health. Religious opposition to contraception and religious support of child marriage or genital mutilation are just some examples of this challenge. There is a need to foster a deep understanding of the religious and moral codes and practices to avoid sectarianism. Humanitarians must also acknowledge that on occasions, people residing in the Global South may wish to continue with practices which may be abhorrent to current norms in the Global North; however, these may have benefits for the group (eg, it strengthens existing social relations or ensures the continuation of family lineage).

### Clarifying karma for culturally concordant care [^735c3e1e]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

We thank the authors for this timely review highlighting how culture influences the communication preferences for Asian patients with cancer. As they note, religious beliefs affect these considerations, and they recommend clinicians use religious terminology to demonstrate their understanding of Hindu beliefs. However, we hope to provide a more nuanced understanding of the belief in karma in contrast to the authors' presentation of this concept, which we feel may inadvertently propagate the notion that Hindu patients may prefer suffering over symptom management at the end of life.

Karma, or action, is the principle of cause and effect where actions produce consequences across multiple rebirths (ie, reincarnation), and the aim of life for Hindus is to liberate oneself from this karmically induced cycle of rebirth (moksha). While specific understanding of karmic consequences varies significantly across and within religions (eg, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism), most agree that the intent and performance of an action are governed by free will. The process by which karmic consequences manifest across lifetimes is, however, generally beyond human perception or control. Therefore, the doctrines of karma and rebirth emphasize positive future action as a means to correct the past, not the endurance of suffering. In the context of serious illness, while some may interpret their illness as a consequence of negative past actions, greater weight would likely be placed on reducing symptoms to continue karmically beneficial activities important to one's values, such as prayer or charity. According to this framework, few Hindus would argue that foregoing symptom management produces a longitudinal karmic benefit, as has been implied in case reportsand literature reviews, which have concluded that end-of-life comfort is only concordant with Christianity and Judaism but not with Hinduism or Buddhism. We worry that this misunderstanding may widen inequities in care, especially when previous studies of Asian patients in the United States, Canada, and Indiahave conversely demonstrated how the belief in karma can coexist with symptom management.

### Lessons from decolonial and liberation psychologies for the field of trauma psychology [^dc1f0914]. The American Psychologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Trauma, ranging from interpersonal to intergenerational, can create severe dysregulation and psychic suffering. Trauma may disrupt the nervous system, identity, affect regulation, and relationship schemas. Traumatic events can also disconnect survivors from the various aspects of themselves as well as their community. As a trauma survivor and trauma psychologist, I have dedicated my career to exploring ways of restoring and healing those severed connections. Exploring decolonial and liberation psychologies awakened me to conceptualizations and frameworks that center reclamation as a form of holistic healing and empowerment for trauma survivors. While much of the individually centered trauma literature focuses on skills-based psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral coping strategies, there has traditionally been less, although growing, attention paid to the diverse culturally grounded, sociopolitical pathways for survivors to reclaim themselves. In this article, I explore my scholarship and the scholarship of other underrepresented scholars as we discuss decolonial and liberation psychologies, the pathways they illuminate that can benefit the trauma recovery process, especially for marginalized survivors, and their implications for practice, training/teaching, research, and policy. The trauma and healing-informed decolonial and liberation pathways that emerge from the literature are culture as medicine, community support, spirituality and religiosity, expressive arts, and resistance. This article argues that the field would benefit from a more inclusive view of trauma and trauma recovery if it incorporates, builds on, explores, and learns from the scholarship of decolonial and liberation psychologists and traditional cultural healers.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^a0f31ff2]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

I believe that it be should be mandatory for humanitarians to familiarise themselves with the religious, moral, and spiritual practices so that they can relate to their colleagues and population in the LMICs. There is a need for a scenario-based tool that can be used in pre-departure training to work through anticipated dilemmas when ethical or moral issues arise, or in debriefing sessions after challenging decisions. A briefing on religious and moral practices in LMICs could be given by sociology, religious leaders in class or remotely. The holistic nature of public health should be emphasised so that humanitarians can integrate culture, religion, morality, spirituality and health primarily through the lens of global health. Humanitarians have to be prepared for scrutiny of their beliefs when they come across deep moral dilemmas such as child marriage, genital mutilation, female infanticide or structural racism, even if they are not directly connected with their work.

### Medical facilities as moral worlds [^183bf6b9]. Medical Humanities (2002). Low credibility.

Bioethics is dominated by an emphasis on rule making and quandary solving. Teaching and research in ethics often focuses upon dramatic, controversial issues at the margins of life and death. Much less attention is given to the relationship between moral reflection and the ethos of place. Medical facilities, however, are moral worlds. To discuss the ethos of place is to focus on the character or atmosphere of particular dwellings. Architecture, interior design, and the interior creation of built environments have moral, spiritual, and aesthetic dimensions. Discussions of "ethics" need to be less oriented to rules and dilemmas, and more attuned to practical matters of everyday social experience. Instead of developing all-encompassing critiques of medical facilities as impersonal, alienating institutions, scholars from various fields need to explore the incremental steps that can make particular settings more decent, humane, and caring.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^67ddb6f8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Informed consent and liberal individualism

In promoting informed consent to the central place it occupies in medical ethics, the discipline is in step with central currents in liberal political thought. Liberal thought is characterised, naturally enough, by its emphasis on the liberty of the individual. Normal adult human beings are conceived by liberals as having the right and the capacity to make choices that advance their own significant projects. The role of the state, with regard to this conception of the individual, is to promote and harmonise the choices of free individuals. The limits of each individual's liberty are defined by the rights of other individuals: each of us is free to choose how to live and how to act, subject to restrictions stemming from respect for other individual's identical rights.

For liberals, the primacy of individual liberty entails a respect for the private sphere. The role of the state is to allow each of us to pursue what Rawlscalls our 'conception of the good'; our notion of what kind of life is valuable (a religious life or a hedonistic life, a life of devotion to good works or to knowledge, a life centred around family and so on). Liberals believe that the state must be neutral with regard to conceptions of the good, neither favouring any nor restricting any (so long as they respect the rights of others to pursue their own conceptions of the good). Different liberals offer different justifications of this neutrality: perhaps we cannot confidently judge the worth of rival conceptions of the good, perhaps people have a moral right to be wrong, or perhaps a profusion of what Millcalled 'experiments in living' is instrumentally valuable insofar as it allows for the assessment of different conceptions.

### Practice guidelines for ALIVE comentoring: an approach to liberating psychology education and training from the inside out [^1ace2e18]. The American Psychologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Western psychology has historically been a field that has excluded from its training pathways individuals who are members of the racial and ethnic global majority (e.g. Indigenous, African, Latinx, Asian). While progress has been made, 83% of practicing psychologists and 75% of doctoral trainees are White and not representative of global diversity. We describe a set of practice guidelines for mentoring within psychology training that was codeveloped to respond to oppressive conditions. The framework for these guidelines was organically shaped and practiced over 5 years in the Advocacy, Liberation, Immigration, Vocational Psychology, and Education Lab. These practices are grounded in liberation psychology, centering the lived experiences of individuals who are minoritized in society and elucidating processes for eradicating oppression. Advocacy, Liberation, Immigration, Vocational Psychology, and Education comentoring is practiced by (a) creating safety and resistance from systems of oppression, (b) prioritizing care for each other's humanity, (c) awakening critical consciousness through honest dialogue, (d) coleading among minoritized individuals, (e) witnessing cultural virtues, (f) encouraging practices for social justice and structural change, and (g) collaborating across mental health disciplines. We offer insights for mentoring practice based on testimonios from seven students and faculty. These guidelines have implications for psychology training programs to become liberated from racist constraints. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^01bb167e]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

There is an increasing interest in humanitarian missions in medical institutions in high-income countries (HICs). It is now widely accepted that humanitarians should undertake a course on ethics and human rights before embarking, and debriefing after, humanitarian missions to low/middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the teaching of religion, spirituality and morality is generally not included in ethics courses.

It is now recognised that religious and spiritual concerns are important for understanding health-related behaviours and sources of social support to patients, which makes it important for humanitarians to appreciate and understand these nuances in their work. Religious institutions and clergy, both in HICs and LMICs, often function as gatekeepers for individuals seeking healthcare, particularly mental health, among poor and disenfranchised populations. Religious practices and moral codes vary widely in different parts of the world which may affect both the humanitarian and recipient of global health. In addition to religious beliefs and moral codes, the younger generation of healthcare workers, both in HICs and LMICs, have increasingly adopted spirituality and metaphysics. Humanitarians travelling from HICs to LMICs may face questions regarding their practices of meditation, yoga, mindfulness, and spirituality which may cause conflicts within themselves or in their dealing with their counterparts and the population seeking their attention in LMICs.

Humanitarians, who in the past, avoided contentious topics such as child marriage, genital mutilation, female infanticide, structural racism and white supremacy in Western medicinein their interaction with their counterparts in LMICs, should be prepared to debate these through the lens of compassion and spirituality, even if they are not directly connected with their work.

I propose that a course on anthropology to include religious and spiritual practices, and moral codes of the population of the host country be included in the pre-departure briefing of humanitarians. A grounding in spirituality could provide a robust ethical and moral framework that may help humanitarians to negotiate the complexities of structural racism, nationalism, militarism and greed.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^b9d31e73]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Spirituality and social justice in global health

It has been hypothesised that there is a bidirectional relationship between spirituality and social justice. Powell viewed global health as a pursuit of social justice and indirectly linked to spirituality. The core of global health is to relieve suffering in LMICs with emphasis on accountability, such as the Cochrane Global Mental Health with a focus on interventions that fit with the public health approach in addition to traditional biomedical approach with emphasis on contributions from LMICs. Therefore, global health has attracted students from a wide spectrum of disciplines including those from theology and religion. The political beliefs of the governments in the Global North have to be consideredwhich can conflict with compassionate action, however, it can be argued that humanitarians have to confront these issues by debating their partners in the Global South to the values that unite them, such as social justice and compassion, rather than political leanings of the funding agencies. I suggest that humanitarians should consider spirituality as part of a patient's cultural identity, which would enable practitioners to provide holistic, patient-centred care in day-to-day clinical practice in LMICs.

### Life is uncertain. death is certain. buddhism and palliative care [^80e28266]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

It is part of a palliative care assessment to identify patients' spiritual needs. According to Buddhism, suffering is inherent to all human beings. Advice on how suffering can be reduced in the course of serious illness might be helpful to patients with incurable and progressive diseases. Palliative care could benefit from Buddhist insights in the form of compassionate care and relating death to life. Buddhist teachings may lead to a more profound understanding of incurable diseases and offer patients the means by which to focus their minds while dealing with physical symptoms and ailments. This might not only be beneficial to followers of Buddhism but to all patients.

### Spiritual dimensions of surgical palliative care [^fcf991ae]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Death is the most complex of religious issues and suicide is the most complex of philosophic issues. Our century has seen a massive technological expansion in our ability to prolong life, and unfortunately, to kill with unparalleled efficiency. Society has demanded that physicians explore with them whether death by suicide is a logical extension of palliative care. For surgeons, these profoundly spiritual concerns are, in many ways, beyond our education and training and may not be compatible with the current practice of surgery.

### Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship [^0ea3b415]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Without a binding commitment, and in any case limited to the HFA initiative, few member states followed up on the WHO's call to add — in the words of the Executive Board representative to the 37th WHA — a 'touch of the soul' (supplément d'âme) to their health programmes. A notable exception was the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office: here, 'spirituality' over the following decade began to figure both as a way to gain popular support for public health measures, in particular a campaign against tobacco use, and as part of an at times rather conservative reading of Islamic morality in healthcare. In 1989, this culminated in the Amman Declaration on Islamic Lifestyles, which provided detailed guidelines for salutogenic behaviour based on the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed. Although it fell short of the breakthrough hoped for by its advocates, the resolution of 1984 was in the coming decades repeatedly cited by both liberal and conservative proponents as a precedent for a closer relationship with religious actors.

In the mid-1980s to late 1980s, a further seed was planted which would come to fruition over two decades later. Before the 1980s, a strong belief in the curative paradigm had informed much of the WHO's work, and matters related to the care of patients beyond the curing of disease, such as palliative care, were generally viewed as outside the purview of medicine. In 1982, under the leadership of Swedish oncologist Jan Stjernswärd (1936–present), who — like several other key proponents of 'spirituality' in the WHO's recent history — had been inspired while working in India, the WHO's Cancer Unit began to appreciate the importance of health-related personal beliefs in oncology. In 1986, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Cancer Pain Relief published a report which took recourse to Cicely Saunders (1918–2005), a pioneer of the hospice movement who had coined the notion of 'total' (including 'spiritual') pain. Based on this, in 1989 an expert committee defined palliative care as 'the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment', where 'control of pain, of other symptoms, and of psychological, social and spiritual problems is paramount'. This shaped the WHO's first definition of the field of palliative care, published in 1990, which would remain influential for the following decades.

### Why religion deserves a place in secular medicine [^4a25fc0a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

As a science and practice transcending metaphysical and ethical disagreements, 'secular' medicine should not exist. 'Secularity' should be understood in an Augustinian sense, not a secularist one: not as a space that is universally rational because it is religion-free, but as a forum for the negotiation of rival reasonings. Religion deserves a place here, because it is not simply or uniquely irrational. However, in assuming his rightful place, the religious believer commits himself to eschewing sheer appeals to religious authorities, and to adopting reasonable means of persuasion. This can come quite naturally. For example, Christianity (theo)logically obliges liberal manners in negotiating ethical controversies in medicine. It also offers reasoned views of human being and ethics that bear upon medicine and are not universally held-for example, a humanist view of human dignity, the bounding of individual autonomy by social obligation, and a special concern for the weak.

### Spirituality, religion, and health. An emerging research field [^170944de]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

The investigation of spiritual/religious factors in health is clearly warranted and clinically relevant. This special section explores the persistent predictive relationship between religious variables and health, and its implications for future research and practice. The section reviews epidemiological evidence linking religiousness to morbidity and mortality, possible biological pathways linking spirituality/religiousness to health, and advances in the assessment of spiritual/religious variables in research and practice. This introduction provides an overview of this field of research and addresses 3 related methodological issues: definitions of terms, approaches to statistical control, and criteria used to judge the level of supporting evidence for specific hypotheses. The study of spirituality and health is a true frontier for psychology and one with high public interest.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^ace94b56]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Religiosity and spirituality

Religion is generally defined as a set of beliefs, rituals and practices embodied within an organisation. Spirituality, on the other hand, is thought of as a search for what is sacred in life, one's deepest values, along with a relationship with God, or a higher power, that transcends the self. Persons may hold powerful spiritual beliefs, and may or may not be active in any institutional religion. Many people who may not be religious in the traditional sense admit to a sense of 'reverence' and 'spirituality' for life, a concept proposed by Nobel Prize winner humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Jeff Levin, professor of epidemiology and population health at Baylor University, posited, "A lot of people may not be institutionally religious in the same ways they have been, but as far as their own private practices and beliefs, they are still very engaged. It still remains a very spiritually involved country (United States) one way or the other". In a prospective, self-administered questionnaire in general and orthopaedic surgical outpatients at the University of Alabama, the majority of patients agreed that surgeons should be aware of their patients' religiosity and spirituality; 63% concurred that surgeons should take a spiritual history, and 64% indicated that their trust in their surgeon would increase if they did so.

### What can we learn about the spiritual needs of palliative care patients from the research literature? [^9e96b8e0]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Spirituality is a distinctive subject within palliative care practice and literature, but research to date is relatively undeveloped in this field and studies often throw more light on conceptual and methodological issues than producing reliable data for clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine what is known about the spiritual needs of palliative care patients from the evidence presented in published research.

Methods

Specialist online databases were interrogated for primary empirical studies of patients with a chronic disease unresponsive to curative treatment. Studies that only used a proxy for the patient or reported expert opinion were excluded. Each study was critically appraised for quality and the strength of its evidence to determine if any data could be pooled.

Results

Thirty-five studies were identified, equating to a total of 1374 patients. Study populations were typically people with advanced-stage cancer, older than 60 years, who were English speaking, and with a Christian or Jewish religious affiliation, reflecting the predominance of Anglo-American studies. Studies fell into two groups: those that investigated the nature of spiritual experience and those that examined the relationship of spirituality with other phenomena. The evidence was insufficiently homogeneous to pool.

Conclusion

Relevant accounts of what spirituality means for palliative care patients and evidence of how it operates in the lives of people with life-limiting disease can be derived from research. Studies to date are limited by reductive representations of spirituality and the conduct of research by health professionals within health care communities demarcated from disciplines and interpretive traditions of spirituality.

### Factors promoting Iranian older adults' spirituality: a qualitative content analysis [^5e0b6d8d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Guarantee of afterlife

Following the implementation and using the spiritual principles in one's deeds, the elderly reach a clear conscience through dependence on God, a sense of freedom from worldly desires, belief in spirituality as a differentiating factor between humans and animals, following divine commands and observing spiritual norms of society. On the back of this clear conscience they achieve self-confidence, an ability to face difficulties and tolerate the mortal nature of life and they expected afterlife redemption and prosperity. Some strategies to reach the level of guarantee of afterlife was begin all the things by remembering God, when getting angry ask God for forgiveness, ask God to help them and bestow upon them patience. They also believed in afterlife in which they will be held accountable for their deeds in this world. A70 year old male participant points: " Your fortune won't last you forever. One has to rely upon God. As long as you are alive you have to pursue doing good deeds. You have to want to be alive in this world in order to have a good position in afterlife. You have to hold a positive view of other people. I feel free from burdens and sins when I forgive others for their misconducts and when I abstain from sinful activates. " A 68 year old lady notes: " Spirituality has led me to see beyond what life appears to be. I have become a virtuous person. I sense God within me and I feel the eternal joy and serenity ".

### Ethical considerations in the integration of religion and psychotherapy: three perspectives [^05537fb4]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The authors maintain that the integration of religion in psychotherapy is, at best, problematic and requires a respect for boundaries, but that the integration of a nonreligious but spiritual psychotherapy consisting of the three elements identified above (attention to the person, not the disease, considering one's work as vocation, and the pursuit of empathic understanding) is a therapeutic necessity and an ethical duty. The authors speak with distinct voices in the three major sections of the article but come to remarkably similar conclusions: (1) the ability to inquire into the religious and spiritual life of patients is an important element of psychotherapeutic competency; (2) information about the religious and spiritual lives of patients often reveals extremely important information; (3) the inquiry process must communicate respect and curiosity for this dimension of the patient's life even (and perhaps especially) when the content is at variance from that of the therapist; and (4) there is significant potential for therapeutic abuse when the therapist communicates in a manner reflecting a personal agenda that abandons the principle of psychotherapeutic neutrality. One area of potential disagreement came as the authors considered the possibility of different combinations of faith disciplines and therapy in designated religious settings that all parties recognize as such. One author (G.P.M.) believes that such combinations in these settings may be ethically permissible. The other two authors are concerned about such combinations because of the powerful but covert factor of transference in healing relationships. The authors eventually decided that this question was beyond the scope of the article and limited themselves to discussions about psychotherapy in secular settings. They each advocate the systematic inclusion of spiritual assessment as a core competency for psychotherapy education. In a way similar to the exploration of any deeply personal dimension of human experience, integrating spiritual and religious dimensions of our patients' lives into their treatment requires consummate professionalism, the highest quality of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and thorough grounding in a sophisticated biopsychosocial model.

### Hope and spiritual well-being: two sides of the same coin? [^5e6b0734]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Even if hope is one element of spirituality, spiritual health is much broader than simply a source of hope in people's lives. For these reasons, an adequate screening of patients' spiritual needs is important as part of the total care and should be done routinely in clinical practice.

Further research is necessary to better understand what produces spiritual well-being in each individual patient and what makes it emerge or strengthen.

### Practicing a medicine of the whole person: an opportunity for healing [^fe60e2c8]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Integrative medicine has been defined in several ways. For some it is a discipline that combines such approaches to the resolution of disease as acupuncture and homeopathy, meditation and imagery with more familiar and accepted health practices, such as surgery, pediatrics, and oncology. For others it is about cultivating awareness and sensitivity beyond symptoms to the mental, emotional, and spiritual needs of the patient. But, integrative medicine is more than the weaving together of techniques, or understanding the intimate interaction of the mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. It is about rethinking the task of medicine and the infrastructure of relationships and beliefs that have limited its power to serve all people.

### Religious and spiritual interventions in mental health care: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials [^e20b6f22]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Data items

Outcomes extracted from each included article were: (1) participants' clinical diagnoses; (2) sample size; (3) intervention protocols (type, frequency, duration and follow-up); (4) scales and outcome measures; and (5) results of interventions. The outcomes explored in the meta-analysis were depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Statistical analysis

To assess the risk of bias in the studies, we used the intraclass correlation coefficient which quantifies the percentage of data variability. The score of this coefficient ranges from 0 to 1.00; the closer to 1.00, the less variability exists between these measures. For this calculation, SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc. USA) was used.

Regarding the meta-analysis, the Cochrane RevMan 5.2 program was employed. We chose to use random-effects models considering the possible heterogeneity in studies (Liberati et al.), with a 95% confidence interval for each measure. In order to explore the variability of the results, we used a standard mean difference and an assessment of methodological quality in the articles.

Concerning the outcomes, in studies that used more than one control group, data were extracted and used as different analysis (e.g. Rosmarin et al.1 – control group versus RSI; Rosmarin et al.2 – other intervention or waiting list versus RSI).

With regards to heterogeneity, the Cochrane Collaboration classifies it into unimportant (0–40%), moderate (30–60%), substantial (50–90%) and considerable (75–100%) (Higgins & Green). In the present study, when heterogeneity was present, we explored possible explanations, by looking at subgroups, at type of intervention, type of control model and length of follow-up.

Risk of bias in individual studies

Due to the nature of the RSI adopted, studies were not double-blind; therefore, we chose to evaluate the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Back Review Scale which contains 11 questions about methodology, providing a comprehensive assessment of important items of clinical trials (Berger & Alperson). Acceptable studies met at least six out of 11 validity criteria (Van Tulder et al.). To check the validity of the analysis, three independent researchers (G.L. H.V. J.P.B.G.) rated the classification. Disagreements were discussed topic by topic and resolved by consensus.

### Israel: health and beyond [^051bf26e]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing-but fragile and limited-health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^d2b8fd85]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — religion and health care considerations state that many Muslims view illness as a "trial from God", and when conceptualized in this way, it is not appropriate to solely treat the underlying medical condition; spiritual healing is also needed. The text notes that some religions prohibit certain medical interventions and that Muslims are not allowed to consume pork while some vaccines and medicines are derived from pig products; if a Muslim client presents with an illness, making sure that the agreed-upon medicine does not contain certain substances, like pig products, is needed. It adds that the practitioner strives to be knowledgeable about what healthcare practices go with or against religious identity and that this knowledge would likely improve the therapeutic relationship by creating honesty, dialogue, and trust.

### Why gerontologists should care about empirical research on religion and health: transdisciplinary perspectives [^84f5860a]. The Gerontologist (2013). Low credibility.

A large volume of empirical research has accumulated on the relationship between religion/spirituality (R/S) and health since the year 2000, much of it involving older adults. The purpose of this article is to discuss how this body of existing research findings has important messages or important new insights for gerontologists; clinicians in medicine, psychiatry, and psychology; sociologists; and theologians. In other words, what contributions do the research findings on R/S and health make to these disciplines? In this article, experts from each of the aforementioned disciplines discuss what contributions this research can make to their own area of study and expertise. Besides emphasizing the broad relevance of research on R/S and health to many clinical and academic audiences in gerontology (i.e., addressing the "so what" question), this discussion provides clues about where R/S research might focus on in the future.

### Religious development from adolescence to early adulthood among muslim and christian youth in Germany: a person-oriented approach [^00b2b03f]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Religious self‐categorization

Religious self‐categorization was assessed with a single item "What is your religion?" at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (No religion), 2 (Buddhism), 3 (Christianity), 4 (Christianity: Catholic), 5 (Christianity: Protestant), 6 (Hinduism), 7 (Islam), 8 (Judaism), 9 (Sikhism), and 10 (Other religion).

Religiosity

Religiosity was assessed with three items capturing its key components (i.e. public involvement, private practices, importance). We combined these widely used items and examined overall religiosity which — according to meta‐analyses — is the most common approach to studying religiosity (e.g. Hardy et al; Yonker et al.). The first item, "How important is religion to you?", was assessed at Waves 1–7. The response options were 1 (Very important), 2 (Fairly important), 3 (Not very important), and 4 (Not at all important). The second item, "How often do you visit a religious meeting place (e.g. a church, a mosque, a synagogue or a temple)?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), and 5 (Every day). The third item, "How often do you pray?", was assessed at Waves 1–3 and 5–7. The response options were 1 (Never), 2 (Occasionally (but less than once a month)), 3 (At least once a month), 4 (At least once a week), 5 (One to four times a day), and 6 (Five times a day or more). We rescaled the first and third items to a five‐point scale with higher values indicating greater religiosity. Across time, the items loaded on a single factor explaining between 73.8% and 77.8% of the variance. Cronbach's α across waves ranged from.82 to.85. We computed mean scores for Waves 1–3 and 5–7.

### Spiritual boredom is associated with over-and underchallenge, lack of value, and reduced motivation [^0290c8a0]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the face of current global crises, such as the climate crisis and ongoing wars, people may seek out spiritual growth and practices in pursuit of social connectedness and empathy, possibly countering tendencies towards egocentrism and blind competition. This shift can encourage behavior that benefits the common good in our society.

By addressing and reducing spiritual boredom, our findings could help promote engagement in spiritual practices, ultimately supporting personal and collective spiritual growth. Spiritual boredom could be alleviated by designing spiritual practices in a way that reduces over- or underchallenge (e.g. through individualized practices) and by increasing the perceived value of the practices (e.g. by emphasizing the importance of the practices for daily life).

### Considering culture, complementary medicine, and spirituality in pediatrics [^06eeafb1]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Whether or not it is apparent, cultural and spiritual diversity exist in many clinical encounters, both with patients and with colleagues. These issues may cloud other concerns, contribute to inadequate or misleading communication, and affect lifestyle and therapeutic choices. Given the rapid rise in complementary therapies and the growing diversity in North America, the challenges of providing sensitive, compassionate, comprehensive care are compounded. Reflecting on the ways cultural backgrounds, religious beliefs and complementary medicine affect physicians, colleagues and patients may enrich, clarify, deepen, and improve the effectiveness of our clinical practice. The cases presented here offer an opportunity for role playing and reflection to support this process.

### "Spiritual starvation? ": a case series concerning christianity and eating disorders [^6d5b24aa]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2000). Low credibility.

Method

We describe the cases of four patients with eating disorders in whom complex interactions occurred among religious faith, pathogenesis of the eating disorder, and clinical management.

Results

In some of the cases, religious beliefs seemed to provide a containment of maladaptive behaviors, partly through prayer and through a sense of belonging to the religious community. In other cases, it proved difficult to separate the concept of a punitive God from the illness process.

Discussion

The cases are discussed with reference to a limited empirical literature. Similarities are noted between some religious institutions and eating disorder treatment regimes. This paper explores management issues, including the use of pastoral counseling and the ethics of addressing religious beliefs in therapy. We note the benefits of a rapprochement between psychiatry and religion.

### The three stages of religious decline around the world [^6df4d979]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Religiosity tends to decline across generations. However, religious decline is more pronounced in some countries and the diminishing aspects of religion vary by context. To explain such variation, we extend the general secular transition model, which proposes that countries undergo a similar process of secularization beginning at different points in time. We explain that secular transition happens in three steps: first, public ritual participation declines; second, the importance of religion to individuals declines; and third, people shed religious affiliation. We test this model using datasets from surveys in 111 countries (Pew Research Center), 58 countries (World Values Survey and European Values Study (WVS/EVS)), and a subset of 17 countries measured in at least five WVS/EVS waves. We show the model fits countries with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist pluralities. While Eastern post-Soviet countries deviate from this pattern, traditionally Muslim countries appear to follow its early stages. However, we recommend caution in interpreting longitudinal claims, due to limited data.

### Spirituality, religion, and clinical care [^0ee2aede]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Interest in the relationship between spirituality, religion, and clinical care has increased in the last 15 years, but clinicians need more concrete guidance about this topic. This article defines spirituality and religion, identifies the fundamental spiritual issues that serious illness raises for patients, and argues that physicians have a moral obligation to address patients' spiritual concerns. Religions often provide patients with specific moral guidance about a variety of medical issues and prescribe rituals that are important to patients. Religious coping can be both positive and negative, and it can impact patient care. This article provides concrete advice about taking a spiritual history, ethical boundaries, whether to pray with patients, and when to refer patients to chaplains or to their own personal clergy.

### Religiosity and spirituality development: an accelerated longitudinal design [^184bf8c4]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

It is well accepted that older individuals report greater religiosity and spirituality (R/S) than younger individuals, although this conclusion is complicated by the distinct, multidimensional nature of R/S. Indeed, religiosity entails various convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that are shared within congregations that are seeking relationships with divine beings, whereas spirituality refers to individualized convictions, rituals, and lifestyles that support the formation and maintenance of relationships with divine beings. Religious individuals hold beliefs and live out values that are in accordance with their specific doctrines, and often engage in several communal and independent religious practices as a result. Spiritual individuals feel a divine presence in their lives, either through major life events or everyday experiences, and may or may not seek understanding of such experiences in the context of organized religiosity. Whether individuals identify as religious, spiritual, or both, however, they may engage in various forms of religious/spiritual coping as they navigate daily hardships.

### Traditional healers, faith healers and medical practitioners: the contribution of medical pluralism to bottlenecks along the cascade of care for HIV / AIDS in Eastern and Southern Africa [^ce27da9e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

PLHIV were also able to straddle two health-worlds simultaneously, through concurrent use of biomedical and traditional/spiritual healthcare in a complementary rather than alternative manner, and therefore not intended to replace ART. In such cases, medical pluralism is adopted to supplement the care received, in order to fulfil additional healthcare needs, such as other psycho-socio-spiritual needs catered for by the combination of healthcare systems. The health-worlds of PLHIV who engage in concurrent medical pluralism can be better understood by making a distinction between the notion of enchantment as a distal cause of their illness, and the virus as the biological proximal cause of the disease, both of which require intervention. While individual or shared beliefs, either traditional or faith-based, serve to explain people's engagement in medical pluralism, many such beliefs are seen by others, including biomedical practitioners, as ignorant. Such explanations are not well-received among biomedical practitioners, who are said to know little about medical pluralism, often resulting in a conflict of healthcare systems. These notions of tension were challenged in our study by the practices of some biomedical practitioners who recognised the need for and 'referred', although informally, PLHIV to the traditional healthcare system. In so doing, they were seen to endorse or approve of medical pluralism by their patients. Nevertheless, the reluctance of biomedicine to embrace medical pluralism, may discourage plural healthcare users from disclosing such practices to their HCWs, and potentially compromise the effectiveness of biomedical interventions.

### Spiritual boredom is associated with over-and underchallenge, lack of value, and reduced motivation [^11dd8046]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We investigated five different spiritual contexts: yoga, meditation, silence retreats, sermons (as part of Catholic services), and pilgrimage. By studying five different contexts, we aimed to test the generalizability of our findings. For each context, we conducted two studies with fully independent samples, one using trait measures and the other using state measures of spiritual boredom. The 10 studies were paralleled as much as possible with respect to the assessed constructs to ensure comparability. Based on the 10 studies, we conducted an internal meta-analysis to provide a concise synthesis of our findings. None of the studies were preregistered.

Spiritual contexts

Our study focused on five traditional spiritual practices with different religious/spiritual roots, but commonly observed in Western societies. We wanted to assess contexts that were different, but not too different, as a starting point for research into spiritual boredom.

One focus was on (1) yoga, a spiritual practice that has existed for at least 2500 yearsand pursues a unifying experience of body and mind. We also focused on (2) meditation, which also has existed for at least 2500 years. The key spiritual aspect of meditation is to train attention and awareness to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. As for (3) silence retreats, the practice of consciously remaining silent for spiritual reasons probably dates back to the earliest humans and has a long tradition in many religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity. Listening to (4) sermons as part of Catholic services reflects a spiritual practice that has existed for about 2000 years. We have explicitly not referred to Catholic services as a whole, as they consist of different elements (e.g. prayers, chants, rituals, communion, silence) that may evoke different levels of boredom. Finally, (5) pilgrimage is also a traditional spiritual practice found in many religions, such as Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. However, it is also practiced outside religious contexts, often as a form of spiritual walking or traveling in search of moral or spiritual meaning.

### The urgency of spiritual care: COVID-19 and the critical Need for whole-person palliation [^ba348569]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has amplified the importance of palliative care to countless patients suffering with and dying from this disease, as well as to their families, communities, and the worldwide cadre of overburdened health care workers. Particularly urgent is the need for spiritual care specialists and generalists to address spiritual suffering given the degree of isolation, loneliness, and vulnerability caused by this pandemic. Although spiritual care has long been recognized as one of the domains of quality palliative care, it is often not fully integrated into practice. All disciplines are ultimately responsible for ensuring that spiritual care is prioritized to improve quality of life and the experience of patients and families facing spiritual emergencies amid the complex life-and-death scenarios inherent to coronavirus disease 2019. Although the pandemic has revealed serious fault lines in many health care domains, it has also underscored the need to recommit to spiritual care as an essential component of whole-person palliative care.

### Understanding spirituality: a synoptic view [^4189540b]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Spirituality is an important component of palliative care that is incorporated into practice and the subject of research. A literature review by the authors indicated that many studies into the spiritual needs of palliative care patients operationalised highly reductive constructs of spirituality and relied upon unexamined assumptions and concepts.

Methods

We examine the use of models as a strategy to explain how spirituality functions in the lives of patients and critically review examples of descriptive modelling and mathematical modelling. The explanatory and predictive potential of these techniques is considered along with methodological limitations in representing complex aspects of human nature in models.

Proposal

We propose a realistic synoptic model to explain how spirituality is lived and experienced in the wider context of a mental, personal and social world. We describe the essential conceptual apparatus and mechanisms of lived spirituality including beliefs, behaviour and experience, and we suggest that spirituality is a feature and capacity of the system as a whole.

Conclusions

The synoptic model provides an explanation of how spirituality operates in the totality of patients' lives and aims to capture aspects of spirituality that remain neglected by researchers and practitioners. It is proposed as a corrective to reductionist approaches and supports the contribution of different disciplines and different ways of thinking about spirituality.

### Assessing spirituality: is there a beneficial role in the management of COPD? [^04bb8d5e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

How to advance spirituality based approaches to manage patients with COPD?

The fundamental requirement for inclusion of religiosity and spirituality in clinical routines is a patient-centered approach. Koenig et al.reported that although 90% of U.S. medical schools have individual lessons on spirituality related to health and disease, only 7% offer dedicated courses. The spiritual involvement of HCPs should be added early on in their curricula, and continued throughout their training. Moreover, guidelines on COPD could share the information about spiritual care and good practice from other chronic diseases, where spirituality has been successfully used, to help patients improve their health status and well-being and recommend further research in COPD so that firm recommendations can be made. In the meantime, taking in consideration the positive associations that spirituality has on health status and quality of life (and potentially patients' disease classification), it seems reasonable to suggest to further explore the usefulness of integrating a spiritual based approach into guideline recommendations.

### Spiritual needs and satisfaction with life: an exploration of mediating pathways [^d198ff4f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Future research should explore strategies to overcome common barriers to assessing and addressing spiritual needs in clinical care, such as limited time, insufficient provider training in spiritual assessment, and variability in providers' spiritual awareness or inclinations. Implementation science approaches can play a critical role in identifying and addressing these multilevel barriers — from individual provider attitudes to organizational and systemic challenges. For example, studies could examine how best to integrate spiritual assessments into routine workflows, tailor training interventions for diverse clinical disciplines, and evaluate the fidelity and sustainability of spiritual care practices. One promising area of implementation research includes testing chaplain referral systems — such as standardized pathways for automatically referring patients with elevated spiritual needs to trained chaplains or spiritual care providers — as a means to operationalize spiritual care within healthcare delivery.

At the policy level, future work could focus on incorporating spiritual care into clinical guidelines and quality standards, advocating for institutional support, and expanding reimbursement mechanisms for providers addressing spiritual concerns. Developing scalable and culturally sensitive training programs for healthcare and psychosocial providers will also ensure that spiritual needs are consistently recognized and met across diverse patient populations.

### Spiritual and religious competencies in psychology [^b5dab466]. The American Psychologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Religion and spirituality (R/S) are important aspects of human diversity that should be explicitly addressed in the field of psychology. The field has already included R/S in its definitions of multiculturalism, but while multicultural training is routinely included in doctoral level psychology course work and internship programs, it rarely includes specific training in R/S diversity. Polls of the American public indicate that religion and spirituality are important in most people's lives, and hundreds of studies demonstrate empirical links between R/S and psychological health and well-being. In clinical practice, there is evidence that clients would prefer to have their R/S addressed in psychotherapy. However, R/S issues are typically neither discussed in psychotherapy nor included in assessment or treatment planning. In research, religion and spirituality are often assessed with a single item on religious affiliation. Psychologists receive little or no training in R/S issues, in part because no agreed upon set of spiritual competencies or training guidelines exist. This article summarizes the rationale for including religious and spiritual competencies in psychology training and practice, reviews research establishing a set of religious and spiritual competencies (attitudes, knowledge, and skills) that we propose all psychologists should demonstrate, and provides practical recommendations for inquiring about religion and spirituality.

### Spiritual dimensions of surgical palliative care [^a4f73b83]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The spiritual dimensions of surgical palliative care encompass recognition of mortality (physician and patient); knowledge of moral and ethical dilemmas of medical decision making; respect for each individual and for all belief systems; responsibility to remain physically and psychologically present for the patient and family; and knowledge of when chaplains, palliative care professionals, or social workers should be consulted. Certain aspects of surgical palliative care distinguish it from palliative care in other medical disciplines such as the 2 definitions (palliative procedure and palliative care), treating a disproportionate share of patients who suffer unforeseen tragic events, and the surgical system.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^a1dbf167]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Palliative care glossary — spiritual history, spiritual screening, substituted judgement, and total pain — defines key assessment and ethical concepts as follows: Spiritual history uses a broader set of questions to capture salient information about needs, hopes, and resources, permits the clinician to understand how spiritual concerns could either complement or complicate the patient's overall care, and allows the clinician to incorporate spiritual care into the patient's overall care plan; unlike spiritual screening, which requires only brief training, those doing a spiritual history should have some education and comfort with issues and knowledge of how to engage patients. Spiritual screening or triage is a quick determination of whether a person is experiencing a serious spiritual crisis and therefore needs an immediate referral to a board-certified chaplain, helps identify which patients may benefit from an in-depth spiritual assessment, and good models use a few simple questions that can be asked in the course of an overall patient and family screening, with examples including, "Are spirituality or religion important in your life?" and "How well are those resources working for you at this time?" Substituted judgement refers to the ethical duty of guardians and surrogate decision-makers to make an effort to understand the patient's beliefs and values prior to making decisions on the patient's behalf. Total pain is described as a holistic experience that extends beyond the physiological domain, recognizes the holistic nature of pain and the interplay of psychological and social well-being, spirituality, and culture, and notes that symptoms rarely occur in isolation; rather, they cluster with other symptoms and are influenced by the psychological, social, and cultural characteristics of the individual.

### A spiritual care department: practical experience [^724315dc]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Spiritual care identifies and responds to humans' spiritual needs, including the need for communication, emotional support, respect for values and beliefs, and search for meaning in life. This type of care may consist of respecting the patients' beliefs, communicating effectively by reflective listening and talking to the patients, accompanying them through compassionate care, supporting them, showing empathy, facilitating their participation in religious rituals, promoting their sense of good and usefulness, and if need be, referring to clergies and other experts. There is convincing evidence that many patients and their families have spiritual needs that will help with their effective recovery if properly considered in healthcare services. Patients need to adapt to their illness, receive compassion, find meaning in their life, and learn the answers to their numerous questions, such as why they have developed this illness.

In recent decades, spiritual health and spiritual care have received more attention in healthcare services. Therefore, to create meaning in the patients' lives and due to beneficial effects on their health, hospitals, which are a key part of the healthcare system, must identify the patients' spiritual needs and move towards the delivery of spiritual care to them.

The delivery of spiritual care is a subject that has received considerable attention in Iran in recent years. Although many scientific documents have been published on this issue, there was no spiritual care department in the Iranian healthcare system to provide these services in line with the patients' spiritual needs, backed up by research, and based on the existing conditions and cultural and religious considerations. This deficiency was further corroborated by our review of the experiences surrounding the provision of spiritual care at the Departments of Spiritual Care of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Centre, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the University of Michigan in the USA and also the Department of Spiritual Care of Vancouver General Hospital in Canada.

### The anatomic location of the soul from the heart, through the brain, to the whole body, and beyond: a journey through Western history, science, and philosophy [^d4db8d58]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe representative Western philosophical, theological, and scientific ideas regarding the nature and location of the soul from the Egyptians to the contemporary period; and to determine the principal themes that have structured the history of the development of the concept of the soul and the implications of the concept of the soul for medical theory and practice.

Methods

We surveyed the ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman periods, the early, Medieval, and late Christian eras, as well as the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Modern periods to determine the most salient ideas regarding the nature and location of the soul.

Results

In the history of Western theological, philosophical, and scientific/medical thought, there exist 2 dominant and, in many respects, incompatible concepts of the soul: one that understands the soul to be spiritual and immortal, and another that understands the soul to be material and mortal. In both cases, the soul has been described as being located in a specific organ or anatomic structure or as pan-corporeal, pervading the entire body, and, in some instances, trans-human and even pan-cosmological. Moreover, efforts to discern the nature and location of the soul have, throughout Western history, stimulated physiological exploration as well as theoretical understanding of human anatomy. The search for the soul has, in other words, led to a deepening of our scientific knowledge regarding the physiological and, in particular, cardiovascular and neurological nature of human beings. In addition, in virtually every period, the concept of the soul has shaped how societies thought about, evaluated, and understood the moral legitimacy of scientific and medical procedures: from performing abortions and autopsies to engaging in stem cell research and genetic engineering.

Conclusion

Our work enriches our shared understanding of the soul by describing some of the key formulations regarding the nature and location of the soul by philosophers, theologians, and physicians. In doing so, we are better able to appreciate the significant role that the concept of the soul has played in the development of Western scientific, medical, and spiritual life. Although ideas about the soul have changed significantly throughout Western history, the idea of the soul as being real and essential to one's personhood has been, and remains, pervasive throughout every period of Western history.

### Factors promoting Iranian older adults' spirituality: a qualitative content analysis [^9e06500e]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attempts to reach spiritual goals

From the elderly's point of view, the attempt and search for spiritual goals is a type of practical insight on the path towards achieving high spiritual goals. As indicated by the participants' views, spirituality is a path of life; In other words, it's a lifestyle chosen by the individual through different ways such as spiritual investment or doing as much as good and merciful things and helps to others. In fact this insight had sprung from doing spiritual activities based on religious commands and principals, tradition and religious-based moralities of society and the feeling of joy from doing such activities. Attempting this path was the secret to the success and satisfaction of the elderly in the study. They desired to reach the most spiritual level but not materialistic ones. It's very important and valuable to them when they can bring the light of faith back to the others with a simple act as an example of spirituality. A male 67-year-old participant added: " Belief in God and trying to know him is a kind of spirituality. We have to do a lot of search to reach spirituality. This will lead to a positive attitude and view in the individual in all aspects of life whether scientific, practical or social. And this can be achieved through investment in life and the future of us and our children. "

Spiritual socialization

Spiritual socialization referred to the attention, observing and considering the spiritual norms of society which had been achieved through many years of experience in life and through respecting those norms. These experience in life comes from socializing agents (e.g. mothers, fathers, extended family members, peers and even their local society) in maintenance of spiritual values. This concept itself was made up of two other sub-categories of getting socialized spirituality and fulfilling the role of a spiritual role model.

### Factors promoting Iranian older adults' spirituality: a qualitative content analysis [^636baaaa]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Life expectancy is increasing worldwide. Currently, persons older than 65 represent more than 12% of the population in the United States, and it is expected that this group will represent nearly 20% of the total U.S in 2030. In a 2010 census in Iran the number of aged people above 60 was estimated to be 8.2% of the whole population of the country.

There are essential differences between the Asian and Western world. Asians hold a more positive view of elderly people than the Western cultures do. These views can influence the context of older adults and with that their perception of spirituality as well. There is a lesser degree of individualism present in Iranian families than for instance in Swedish ones. The elements of tradition and family tend to be dominant in Iranian families. Cultural background in Iran promotes taking care of elderly people by younger members of the family. Therefore, it's not well accepted in Iran to place old people in nursing homes. About 85% of Iranian elderly people live with their families and they consider their financial situation as average or poor. The financial, health, welfare and emotional needs of Iranian elderly varies, as well as the fact that most of them are suffering from chronic diseases. In Iran, the situation of female elderly concerning information, job opportunities, education, employment, social position and finances is worse compared with male elderly. Female elderly are raised to be prepared for their traditional roles of being a mother and wife. The major religion of most of Iranian's elderly population is Islam and more than 99% of them are Muslim. Moreover, spiritual needs during old age plays an important role in empowering Iranian older people, and the element of spiritual power is more dominant in comparison with other elements during old age.

### A knowledge synthesis of culturally-and spiritually-sensitive end-of-life care: findings from a scoping review [^87c572ad]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Theme 2: impact of spiritual support on quality of life of terminally Ill people

Research highlights the importance of spiritual, religious and personal beliefs on individuals' sense of inner piece, hope and optimism, and quality-of-life. Spiritual and religious beliefs and practices become more important and are expressed when a person is nearing death. As a result, it is crucial that PC providers acknowledge and tailor their care to the diverse spiritual needs of their patients. Responding to these needs may be challenging, yet this process can be fulfilling for HCPs, patients and family members as this provides opportunities for mutual spiritual and religious growth through the exchange of new spiritual understandings and meanings. The impact of having HCPs address spiritual and religious issues was shown to have a positive effect on increased hospice usage at the EoL, and less aggressive interventions and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions at the EoL. Conversely, a study of spiritual coping among cancer patients revealed that those who used spiritual coping mechanisms were more likely to prefer life sustaining treatments. These findings identify the influential role that spiritual and religious beliefs play in EoL decision-making and the importance of having discussions that address the role and impact of spiritual and religious beliefs in EoL decision-making.

In recognizing diversity of beliefs and expression within the Muslim faith, Bloomer et al. revealed a spectrum of beliefs ranging from 'very traditional' to 'very liberal' Consequently, it is not possible nor is it practical to expect that HCPs have in-depth understandings of all Islamic and Muslim practices, especially given the cultural variations amongst different Muslim groups. As such, a generalized 'cookbook' approach detailing traditional beliefs and practices of different cultures may actually create more harm for patients as not all beliefs and practices will be applicable due to differences that exist within cultural groups. Hence, an open and flexible approach, that acknowledges and respects individuality within the spectrum of beliefs and practices of various cultural and spiritual groups, is an increasingly important feature of culturally-sensitive EoL care. In addition to taking a person-centred approach to cultural and spiritual issues, it is important for HCPs not become desensitized to the profound nature of death and dying and the ethical and medical decision-making issues that are prevalent across cultural and spiritual groups.

### Toward a fully fledged integration of spiritual care and medical care [^47bbfeed]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

In this article, we aimed to set out current problems that hinder a fully fledged integration of spiritual and medical care, which address these obstacles. We discuss the following five statements: 1) spiritual care requires a clear and inclusive definition of spirituality; 2) empirical evidence for spiritual care interventions should be improved; 3) understanding patients' experiences of contingency is paramount to deliver effective spiritual care; 4) attention to spiritual needs of patients is a task for every health care practitioner; 5) courses on spirituality and spiritual care should be mandatory in the medical curriculum. Current problems might be overcome by speaking each other's language, which is crucial in interdisciplinary research and in good interdisciplinary collaboration. Using a clear and inclusive definition of spirituality and substantiating spiritual care using medical standards of evidence-based practice is a way to speak each other's language and to increase mutual understanding. Furthermore, including spirituality in the medical curriculum would raise awareness of medical practitioners for their task of attending to patients' spiritual needs and, subsequently, to better and more appropriate referral for spiritual care.

### Supple bodies, healthy minds: yoga, psychedelics and American mental health [^7fd38d70]. Medical Humanities (2018). Low credibility.

While risk/reward tensions were present from the start, in the later 1960s several thinkers began to disavow the syncretic use of psychedelics entirely. The pushback to yoga and drugs centred on arguments about the cultural appropriation of Eastern spiritual language and metaphors. Yoga gurus with 'large American followings', writes Stefanie Syman, regularly 'dismissed psychedelics… and frowned on any mingling of drugs and discipline' (Syman, p. 225). Some gurus believed drugs 'could cause "spiritual dryness", "disbelief" and even permanent brain damage' (Syman, p. 203–208). Indian yogis had long valued altered states of consciousness, but some felt that drug-related experiences had the potential to be inconsequential and trivial as regards dharma. Worse still, they might be dangerous (Smith, p.144–145). Neophytes ought to be wary. Ecstasy (and not the MDMA kind) was not to be treated lightly. None of these cautionary warnings, though, prevented countercultural icons like Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert from mixing psychedelics and spirituality. Huxley and others 'had come to psychedelic drugs through their interest in yoga or Eastern religion' in the first instance (Syman, p. 218). What was acceptable to outsiders, therefore, was borderline offensive to traditional teachers.

### Belief in divine healing can be a barrier to antiretroviral therapy adherence in Uganda [^d6799a44]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

Although recent data suggest high levels of adherence to expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes in resource-limited settings, the culture-specific barriers to adherence are poorly understood. In a prospective observational study, we found that 1.2% of patients discontinued ART because of a belief in spiritual healing. Spiritual beliefs should be an important part of ART adherence counselling in resource-limited settings, requiring close collaboration between HIV care programmes and religious leaders to identify common goals and ensure successful treatment.

### Supple bodies, healthy minds: yoga, psychedelics and American mental health [^7d1de297]. Medical Humanities (2018). Low credibility.

As for the identities of the spiritual-seekers, many came from privileged backgrounds and took full advantage of their college years to transform themselves from the inside out. Students in Cambridge, Massachusetts took seriously New-Age beliefs and practices. They began 'with Asian philosophy', and tried meditation, then yoga. 'And underlying everything', according to one witness, was psychedelic drugs. 'They were on the drugs… they were meditating for hours on end… And they weren't plebeians. Intellectually they were aristocrats… ' (Smith, p. 42). Anecdotes like this abound, and are backed up by hard evidence that the followers of 'psychedelic Buddhism' are 'predominantly white, middle-class or upper-class, college educated and politically liberal' (Osto, p. xi).

To their proponents, however, psychedelics were as essential in their 'spiritual seeking' as yoga. Even Eastern-trained individuals noticed the symmetry of experience in religious practices and psychedelic experimentation and suggested the latter might be spiritually beneficial. Still, many wanted to put yoga 'back in the temple, where they believed it belonged' (Syman, p. 216). It more authentic and safer.

Psychiatrists now recognize that religion and spirituality are important to much of the populace and that attending to them probably will improve clinical psychiatric practice. This article presents a practical guide for addressing some of the key interviewing skills needed to explore a patient's framework for meaning-the patient's religion, spirituality, and worldview. It offers guidelines on the process of the interview, including ways to initiate conversation in this area, with suggestions and specific questions for a more thorough exploration of the patient's religious and spiritual life.

### Neurotheology: practical applications with regard to integrative psychiatry [^7540be50]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The Beneficial Effects of Spiritual Practices on Mental Health

In returning to more positive aspects of religion/spirituality on mental health, it is important to note that spiritual practices have been increasingly recognized for their beneficial effects on mental health, particularly in managing stress, anxiety, and depression. The interplay between spirituality and mental well-being is supported by a growing body of research indicating that spiritual practices can significantly enhance mental health outcomes. For example, spiritual practices, such as meditation, prayer, and mindfulness, have been shown to reduce stress levels effectively. Meditation, in particular, has been extensively studied for its stress-relieving properties, and its beneficial effects on anxiety and depression symptoms. A meta-analysis of 47 trials found that meditation programs can reduce psychological stress, with moderate evidence supporting improved anxiety, depression, and pain outcomes. Many meditation practices, even when secularized, are based on an underlying spiritual tradition such as Buddhism or Hinduism, but can be helpful for spiritual and non-spiritual individuals.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is another practice that has gained popularity for its effectiveness in reducing stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis involving 29 studies concluded that MBSR significantly reduces stress and improves mental health outcomes in both clinical and non-clinical populations (Khoury et al. 2015). Furthermore, a number of studies have explored the impact of the MBSR program on neuronal function in the default mode network and particularly on frontal-limbic interactions that are involved with the modulation of emotional reactivity.

Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health issues, affecting millions worldwide. Spiritual practices offer a non-pharmacological approach to managing anxiety. Prayer and meditation are commonly practiced spiritual activities that have been linked to reduced anxiety levels. For instance, several studies found that participants who engaged in regular prayer and meditation experienced significant reductions in anxiety compared to those who did not engage in these practices. Further, such clinical effects may be mediated by structures such as the amygdala, caudate, prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal lobe, parietal region, and cingulate cortex.

### Storylines of family medicine VIII: clinical approaches [^84632ab9]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

In its roots, integrative medicine represents a radical shift from modern medicine's reactionary approach to disease-based care to a proactive promotion of health and wellness that honours the body's innate healing systems. Integrative medicine incorporates diverse healing modalities, such as conventional Western medicine, nutrition and lifestyle medicine, mind–body practices, complementary therapies, and whole traditional medical systems, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda.

Practitioners of integrative medicine and family medicine embrace the power of evidence-based medicine. A core tenet for integrative medicine is weighing the balance of safety and efficacy for patients. Integrative medicine uses services from an array of evidence-based complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, massage and herbal remedies, to address the precise needs of specific populations while remaining sensitive to their cultural backgrounds. Family and integrative medicine both apply evidence-based guidelines to preventative care and screening as well as chronic disease management over a lifetime.

Both disciplines strive to bridge the gaps left by medical specialisation and recognise the importance of treating the individual as a whole and in their broader context of family, community and environment rather than only attending to isolated organ systems. Family medicine and integrative medicine believe that the patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process and recognise the complex interplay between physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health. By offering a diverse range of services and prioritising patient–provider trust, both disciplines create a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system. Their shared mission to provide comprehensive, patient-centred care embodies the essence of good medicine (figure 3).

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^dcabf207]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Domain 5: Spiritual, religious, and existential aspects of care — Guideline 5.1 Global — patient and family spiritual beliefs and practices are assessed and respected, and palliative care professionals acknowledge their own spirituality as part of their professional role and are provided with education and support to address each patient's and family's spirituality. Palliative care interdisciplinary teams (IDT) serve each patient and family in a manner that respects their spiritual beliefs and practices, and the IDT has clearly defined policies and processes in place to ensure spiritual care is respectful of patient and family age, developmental needs, culture, traditions, and spiritual preferences. Either directly, through referral, or in collaboration with the professional chaplain, the IDT facilitates spiritual and cultural rituals or practices as desired by the patient and family, and IDT members respect patient and family beliefs and practices, never imposing their individual beliefs on others. The spiritual needs of family members may differ from those of the patient and are recognized and supported, and care of children, adolescents, and their family members recognizes that spirituality is integral to coping with serious illness and is provided in a developmentally appropriate manner. In all settings, the IDT includes professional chaplains who have evidence-based training to assess and address spiritual issues frequently confronted by pediatric and adult patients and families coping with a serious illness; the professional chaplain is the spiritual care specialist, conducting the assessment and addressing the spiritual aspects of the care plan. Professional chaplains develop community partnerships to ensure patients have access to spiritual care providers trained and supervised by a professional chaplain, and the IDT and community spiritual care providers share information and coordinate services.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^b300fce0]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.3 Treatment — The IDT addresses the spiritual needs of the patient and family, and spiritual elements of the plan of care are based on needs, goals, and concerns identified by patients and families, recognizing and maximizing patient and family spiritual strengths; the care plan, including religious rituals and other practices, details the expected outcomes of care. Patient and family spiritual needs are addressed according to established processes, documented in the interdisciplinary care plan, and emphasized during transitions of care, including identification of significant practices which bring strength and comfort to the patient. Professional and institutional use of symbols and language are inclusive of patient and family cultural and spiritual preferences, and the patient and family are supported and accommodated in their desires to display and use their own spiritual and/or cultural symbols. Palliative care teams serving pediatric patients have expertise in honoring and meeting the spiritual needs of children and adolescents, including in situations where children or adolescents have differing values, beliefs and needs from their parents or designated decision-makers.

### Child and adolescent psychopathology: spiritual and religious perspectives [^f7c3f7fe]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

This article addresses the relationship between children's religious beliefs and spiritual practices and the presence of psychopathology. Study of this subject represents a formidable task due to the complexity and diversity of the constructs involved, heterogeneity in religious beliefs and practices, and the difficulty in discriminating between the independent effects of religion and culture. Nevertheless, broad links between child psychopathology and spiritual/religious beliefs and practices are proposed. On the whole, the available empiric data suggest that religion is primarily health promoting in direct, positive benefits for children and in indirect, positive effects through parent and family functioning, although there are isolated exceptions. When spirituality and religious beliefs/practices are associated with negative mental health outcomes in children or their families, evidence points to "poorness-of-fit", based on an interaction between the child's psychopathology and aspects and religious beliefs/practice. Clinical implications of the findings and proposels are outlined.

### Vulnerability and access to care for south Asian sikh and muslim patients with life limiting illness in scotland: prospective longitudinal qualitative study [^2cb8869a]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Services were often reactive rather than based on needs, with little flexibility about timing or roles performed. They therefore struggled to meet complex or variable needs. Constraints on resources were obvious, and reliance on family carers was overtly acknowledged:

"Part of the problem is that we wait until the problems arise and we don't even look for problems — we wait for families to tell us themselves and complain". (Patient 5, interview with social care professional)

Overcoming barriers: an illustration of discrimination and effective advocacy

A Sikh patient with multiple long term conditions, who was homeless and an asylum seeker, complained of rude, hostile attitudes by staff, neglect of his needs, continually receiving inappropriate food, and feeling humiliated by staff hostility if he complained about the food or asked questions about his treatment:

"One of the nurses said to me that 'I will paint a horrible picture of you and report you to the immigration and they will deport you', that's how they treat me". (Patient 6, Sikh man with non-malignant illness, stage 1 interview)

He described how Asian staff advised him:

"They tell me to keep smiling all the time. They tell me that you should be grateful because you are receiving free of charge treatment which would not be possible in [own country]".

The professional interviewed confirmed that his care had been poor, his dietary needs unmet, and his treatment discriminatory:

"It did appear to me that some of the clinicians and managers who had a clinical background, in my view probably should have known better, seemed to be suggesting that they send him back to [own country] as soon as they possibly could, apparently without any notion of the consequences". (Patient 6, interview with professional)

The professional adopted an advocacy role for the patient's needs, addressed his problems with the hospital food, helped him with access to welfare rights and benefits, and liaised with ward staff on his behalf. His care was subsequently taken over by a different clinical team, with whom he had good relationships, and he became much happier and expressed confidence in the clinical team and gratitude for his treatment:

"Everything is fine now, I'm well cared for". (Patient 6, stage 2 interview)

### "Calling the spirit back: " spiritual needs among great plains American Indians [^d1ad1872]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

American Indians (AIs) are disproportionately affected by serious illness such as cancer. Colonization, cultural genocide, and trauma have adversely affected AIs' ability to attain health and well-being, and in many cases led to the loss of the right to practice traditional ceremonies and rituals. Still many AIs describe well-being as being rooted in spirituality.

Objectives

The purpose of this project was to learn about the perspectives of AI cancer survivors, caregivers, and Tribal leaders and healers specific to spirituality while on the cancer journey.

Methods

Qualitative interviews and Indigenous talking circle methodologies were used to explore AIs cancer survivors, caregivers, and Tribal leaders and healers' perspectives on spirituality while on the cancer journey. A data analysis team consisting of AI and non-AI members analyzed the narrative data.

Results

Qualitative analysis of interviews and talking circles revealed 4 major themes related to spirituality: the chasm of colonialism, coexistence of Traditional and Christian religions, calling the Spirit back, and prayer as sacred energy.

Conclusion

It is critical that clinicians caring for AIs with serious illness seek to understand their patients' spiritual beliefs about disease treatment and death and work with them and their families to support quality of life throughout their illness journey. In addition, clinicians must recognize the systemic racism inherent in our healthcare systems, and dismantle cultural clashes and bias for all patients, particularly AIs, who have long suffered from poorer health outcomes.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^916ed495]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines executive summary — trauma and cultural context explains that psychological trauma involves events that "overwhelm the ordinary systems of care", often including "threats to life or bodily integrity" and confronting people with "helplessness and terror". Trauma is described as a "global phenomenon", and psychologists are "encouraged to consider the cultural context in which traumatic events unfold" because cultural context influences interpretation of and response to traumatic events. Interpretation and response may be shaped by cultural constructs such as individualism versus collectivism, religion and spirituality, connections between the body and the mind, social roles, and overarching cultural values. Evidence cited indicates it is important for professionals to recognize how family, religion, violence exposure, and poverty shape client beliefs and emotional responses to trauma, and it acknowledges that discussing values and contextual factors, including marginalization and discrimination, can be challenging.

Risk of bias in individual studies

We found an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.832 (0.752–0.893) between examiners, showing the positive reliability of the assessment of bias risk. Table 2 discriminates the items assessed in the 23 final articles. It was noted that none reached the maximum score of 11 because these studies do not enable the use of 'double-blind' methods. The highest-scoring study at nine points was by McCauley et al. The 'third-party blind' method, which means that the examiner that has no idea of the patient's allocation, was present in four studies. There was uniformity of intensity, duration, frequency and follow-up (items H and J, respectively) in the protocols used.

### Spiritual fitness: a new dimension in Alzheimer's disease prevention [^c4b514cb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Religious and spiritual interventions may have an effect on Alzheimer's disease prevention. Kirtan Kriya meditation has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic stress on cognition, reverse memory loss, and create psychological and spiritual wellbeing, which may reduce multiple drivers of Alzheimer's disease risk.

Objective

To detail a new concept in medicine called Spiritual Fitness, a merging of stress reduction, basic wellbeing, and psycho/spiritual wellbeing to prevent Alzheimer's disease.

Methods

The literature on the topics mentioned above is described, including an in-depth discussion on why and how each are critical to advancing the future of Alzheimer's disease prevention. The many negative effects of chronic stress, and the benefits of Kirtan Kriya, are reviewed. The four pillars of basic wellbeing, six practical aspects of psychological wellbeing, and the four new non-sectarian features of spiritual fitness are then disclosed. Moreover, instructions on practicing Kirtan Kriya are offered in the Supplementary Material.

Conclusion

Religious and spiritual practices, including Kirtan Kriya, are crucial components in the development of enhanced cognition and well-being, which may help prevent and, in some cases, reverse cognitive decline. The key point of this review is that making a commitment to live a brain longevity lifestyle including spiritual fitness is a critically important way for aging Alzheimer's disease free. We hope that this article will inspire scientists, clinicians, and patients to embrace this new concept of spiritual fitness and make it a part of every multidomain program for the prevention of cognitive disability.

### APA multicultural guidelines executive summary: ecological approach to context, identity, and intersectionality [^1d09f0aa]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

APA Multicultural Guidelines — Guideline 2 states that psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that as cultural beings, they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions of and interactions with others as well as their clinical and empirical conceptualizations, and that psychologists strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities. The rationale notes that psychologists' worldviews are rooted in their professional knowledge, personal life experiences, and interactions with others across their ecological contexts, and these worldviews influence their empirical and clinical conceptualizations and approaches, and that socialization concerning age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion and spirituality, social class, and disability has important implications for psychologists' conscious and unconscious preferences and inclinations when formulating diagnoses, analyzing and interpreting research data, and planning interventions; psychotherapy research indicates that therapists' attitudes, cultural empathy, and cultural humility predict therapist's self-reported cultural competence in practice and client's perceptions of therapist's cultural competence.

### Assessing spirituality: is there a beneficial role in the management of COPD? [^2e5addb5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In a third study, spirituality measured with the spiritual transcendence scale was strongly associated with better quality of life (Quality of Life Index–Pulmonary Version III, QLI-PV) and weakly but significantly associated with lower stress in patients with COPD. Importantly, we have to note that no association was reported between spirituality and feeling of breathlessness, impairment at functional level, or pulmonary function tests. In the same study, when spirituality was conceptualized as a sense of coherence, measured with the short form of orientation to life questionnaire, it was strongly correlated with improved quality of life, lower stress, and decreased shortness of breath as reported by patients with COPD, yet it was not related to objective measures. This was a cross-sectional study through mailed questionnaires (n = 182 patients with COPD, mostly Caucasians, Christians, and well educated, with 8 years mean duration of the disease), with a number of limitations, such as low response rate, and possible self-selection of the participants.

Collectively, the findings described above highlight important opportunities for continued exploration of the relationship between spirituality and quality of life in individuals with COPD. This is particularly relevant given the inclusion of assessing quality of life in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Guidelines and its potential clinical impact on the classification of patients into lower-COPD risk categories.

### Factors promoting Iranian older adults' spirituality: a qualitative content analysis [^54f4e439]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The point to be kept in mind about the current study is the importance of society's role in making the seniors spiritual role models for others, family and society. The other point was that consideration to the hereafter life on religious grounds seemed to be another important factor in reaching for high levels of spiritual and mystical perfection and it is worth noting that not many studies have taken the point into account. Purposeful and criterion-based sampling in qualitative studies puts a limitation on generalization of the results and it just provide information about the investigated population. The other limitation of the study was carrying out into Muslim Iranian senior citizens and did not include other religions and senior citizens' religious beliefs. Therefore, it is suggested further studies be carried out regarding senior citizens' views on ethics and religion and exclusively investigated to arrive at better models to boost spirituality in golden years. As another recommendation, nurses and caregivers should facilitate their older clients' search for peace of mind by learning skills that enable them to express personal beliefs as well as by supporting them to take part in relevant highlighting their personal spirituality and help that older adults to reach their spiritual goals. In fact, integrating an individual's spiritual practice into their healthcare can help shape personalized medical care for older adults and improve health outcomes. Besides, based on the importance of society and religion in spirituality in Iranian older people, there is a need for much more research on developing tools and culturally appropriate interventions promoting spirituality with the focus on the insight in personal belief, and interpersonal and transpersonal connections especially in relation with religious belief in God. Educational interventions based on the elders' needs for spiritual empowering by health care professionals especially with regards to their spiritual based social interactions and reaching peace of mind, will comprise a major part of wellness approaches.

### 'Spiritual care is not the hospital's business': a qualitative study on the perspectives of patients about the integration of spirituality in healthcare settings [^2d8a69dd]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have investigated the relationship between spirituality and health. They claim the need to develop spiritual care to answer patients' spiritual suffering and to promote spiritual well-being. However, the present study critically analyses the following idea: we ought to take care of the spiritual dimension of patients. Does this interest for spirituality not come from healthcare professionals' desire more than from the patients themselves?

Objective

To answer this question, we explored the perspectives of individuals with cancer regarding the integration of spirituality in the healthcare setting.

Design

Qualitative design using semistructured interviews to focus on subjective experience.

Setting

One of the major public hospitals of Paris, France.

Participants

20 participants (n = 11 men and n = 9 women) with advanced cancer (stage IV). Age ranges from 37 to 80years with a mean age of 58.7years.

Results

Findings demonstrated that participants do not expect help from the hospital to handle spiritual issues but they wish for their spiritual dimension to be simply recognised as a part of their identity and dignity.

Conclusions

Findings invite us to view the question of spirituality not as a new dimension of care but as a new challenge for healthcare institutions to recognise that the persons they are working for are not just 'patients' but human beings with a precious interior life.

### "I don't Do religion": using nature photographs to engage patients in spiritual reflection [^25e78f42]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2022). Medium credibility.

When caring for healthcare patients, professional chaplains may find an increasing proportion of individuals in the U.S. who do not identify as religious and who may benefit from creative approaches to discussing their spiritual and existential concerns. One approach to engaging patients is using a "third voice", as shared in a personal narrative in which a chaplain uses landscape photographs to engage a patient for discussion of spiritual and existential concerns. The content of the conversation may inform decisions about treatment, quality of life, and person-centered care.

### Promoting new approaches for cancer care in the middle east [^ee7678ed]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer is now the fastest growing killing disease in the Middle East. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to train local health professionals: oncologists, palliative care experts, oncology nurses, psychologists, along with social workers, physiotherapists and spiritual counselors on strategies for early detection, curative therapies and palliation. Professionals in the region, along with the public, need to convince medical administrators, regulators and policymakers about investing in education and training of YOUNG professionals, as well as those with already proven experience in cancer care. Training is the basis for any future cancer care program, which aims at the integration of palliative care practices into standard oncology care across the trajectory of the illness.

### Assessing spirituality: is there a beneficial role in the management of COPD? [^6e87221b]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation and repeated exacerbations. The burden of COPD at the individual and societal level is growing and despite progress in survival rates, the disease is associated with substantial life quality impairment. Distressing symptoms, dependence on others, emotional problems and social restriction are among the reasons why many patients with COPD face an overwhelming difficulty in coping with the disease. Particularly in more severe stages of COPD, death's proximity can be a serious struggle for patients and their families. Such challenges represent an important unmet need in disease management, especially in primary care settings.

The positive effect of addressing spirituality in health care has been explored and proved in a number of chronic diseases such as cancer, kidney disease, mental disorders, and AIDS. – Yet, during the last decade, the potential role of spirituality in chronic lung diseases such as COPD has received more attention, with a number of studies suggesting that spiritual approaches may be helpful in improving the physical, mental, and social status of patients. Unfortunately, health care professionals (HCPs) often are not aware of the importance of spirituality and, either due to lack of time or adequate skills, do not properly address and include it in their clinical routine. Consequently, the field of spirituality remains rather neglected in COPD, research is limited and, most importantly, training, either in various health disciplines' curricula or in continuing education, is inadequate.

The present perspective article aims to summarize the current evidence regarding the context and role of spirituality in managing patients diagnosed with COPD, as well as the ways HCPs could reflect upon the spiritual needs of these patients. It is set in the context of the burden of COPD, where the vast majority of those dying are in low- and middle-income countrieswhere health care assets are most limited, and therefore where the role of religion and spiritual beliefs may have a significant place.

Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Spiritual practices assessed at the 6-month follow-up

Spiritual practices questionnaire

This questionnaire assessed engagement with the three primary spiritual practices that were the focus of the spiritual practice teachings, the guide–participant meetings, and the dialogue-group meetings. Participants were instructed to complete the questionnaire based on their spiritual practices over the past 4 months (since the second psilocybin session). Participants rated the frequency and duration of their usual meditation practice, the frequency of their daily awareness practice (e.g. mantra repetition during daily activities), and the frequency of their self-reflective journaling.

### Interventions to support spirituality among adults with cancer: a scoping review [^b6325577]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

In order to implement evidence-based spiritual care interventions in cancer care more broadly, it may be useful to focus primarily on those that can be done competently by both spiritual care specialists and generalists. For example, mindfulness-based and meaning-focused interventions are broadly applicable to patients from a variety of religious and spiritual backgrounds and may be more confidently practiced by interprofessional team members. While some effective interventions, such as psilocybin-assisted therapy, may be more time and resource intensive, they should still be considered for intentional integration into oncology practice given the potential for high impact on spiritual well-being and related outcomes.

Importantly, the possibility for cultural appropriation of elements of these interventions (or, "when a dominant culture takes from another culture, usually a minority or disadvantaged culture, without full regard for the context, respect, or acknowledgment of the culture it is being borrowed from"), such as Hatha yoga, meditation, and psilocybin-assisted therapy, should be held with deep consideration, intention, and ongoing cultural humility. Exploring and honoring the historical and cultural origins of the interventions, when possible, is recommended. Given the wide range of spiritual and religious traditions in the USA and the well‐established impact of these beliefs on care, regular incorporation of spiritual care interventions may also represent meaningful efforts toward addressing healthcare inequities. For example, Black/African American patients regularly turn to spirituality as a source of coping and support in the context of cancer and often include spirituality as part of serious illness decision-making. Therefore, explicitly including interventions such as spiritual histories and assessments may be particularly useful when working with diverse communities grappling with cancer, as frequently unaddressed cultural and religious factors can emerge and may also lead to important advance care planning conversations.

### Between paternalism and illegality: a longitudinal analysis of the role and condition of manual scavengers in India [^04ac2d18]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

In view of these failings, 1990s Indian governments changed tack by moving away from paternalist measures designed to protect scavengers with legal safeguards to market-based interventions aiming to serve the supply and demand dynamics perpetuating the scavenging sector. In 1993, the Rao administration tried to address both the supply and demand for scavenging labour by outlawing the employment of manual scavengers with the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act. Breaking with Independence leaders' justification of scavenging as a valuable 'service', the 1993 Act described manual scavenging as undignified and inhumane work and criminalised the employment of manual scavengers rather than manual scavenging itself. While labour demand was outlawed, labour supply was to be addressed by investment in alternative skilling and trades through the National Scheme for Liberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers in 1992 and the National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation or NSKFDC in 1997. The Low-Cost Sanitation Scheme, sponsored by the central government, was launched to further reduce demand for scavenging and share the cost of conversion of dry latrines. Meanwhile, protection of transitioning scavenging communities was to be addressed by the 1994 formation of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis as a governmental watchdog to investigate all maltreatment of sanitation workers.

Neither illegalisation nor incentivisation succeeded. By targeting employers and failing to address the lack of regular water sources driving ongoing reliance on dry latrines, the 1993 Act did not end demand, but drove it underground. Meanwhile, deep-seated caste and socioeconomic deprivation meant that manual scavengers continued to provide labour to unblock drains and clean latrines, but now lacked legal protection. Cloaked in the language of 'liberation' and 'development', the new economic schemes failed to address the structural barriers preventing Karamcharis from accessing the reskilling schemes promised by the government. Literacy requirements, bureaucratic hurdles and the need for authorisation by local governments meant that many applications for loans and self-employment projects failed or were never attempted. In 2020, a public forum acknowledged that allocated funds towards rehabilitation efforts had been underutilised, that the identification of manual scavengers or their families for skill development training was low, and that the impact of funds that had been spent could not be tracked because of poor follow-up.

### Elements of long-term care that promote quality of life for indigenous and first nations peoples: a mixed methods systematic review [^a19f6fd8]. The Gerontologist (2024). Medium credibility.

While widely acknowledged that "quality of life is an imprecise concept that is difficult to define", there is consensus that good QoL should be an essential outcome of LTC (, p. 58), with consumer satisfaction often being used as a proxy measure. QoL in LTC settings may encompass: comfort, functional competence, autonomy, dignity, privacy, individuality, meaningful activity, relationships, enjoyment, security, and spiritual well-being. Specific factors identified as integral to QoL for older Indigenous Australians include family and friends, spending time on Country, connection to the Aboriginal community, connection to culture, health, respect, Eldership, family support and culturally safe and appropriate services, safety and security, spirituality, future plans (including end of life), and meeting basic needs. Based on these key factors, the "Good Spirit, Good Life" framework has been used to guide understanding of the QoL within Indigenous Australians, however, it has not been applied to other Indigenous populations worldwide. A recent review of dimensions of quality at end of life, identified the life and death journey, a belief in spirits, tribally grounded traditions, dominant cultural religion influences, a family focus, optimization of holistic health, communication and access to appropriate resources, and end-of-life death rituals, as being important to Indigenous peoples, particularly within a North American context.

Cultural safety and Trauma and Violence Informed Care are central to improving health outcomes for Indigenous Australians, and Indigenous and First Nations peoples in many contexts internationally who were subject to removal from families/communities and incarceration in institutions; a process creating those known as "the stolen generations". The ongoing intergenerational trauma of these events cannot be overstated: "The bereavement experienced by many forcibly removed Indigenous children was traumatic" (, p. 161). It is a mistake to see these events as "past" as they are not only in the living memory of older Indigenous and First Nations peoples, but the traumas extend into the present time and manifest in multiple ways on people's health and well-being and on engagement with service providers. Experiences of discrimination, racism, and institutional abuse may therefore lead to hesitancy and lack of engagement of Indigenous and First Nations peoples with LTC (, pp. 73–74).

### My graveyard [^03ad1fa7]. Annals of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This narrative explores my experience as a family doctor deeply embedded in a rural community comprising 9 villages. The regional cemetery, a symbol of mortality, serves as a focal point for meditations on what it means to bear witness as a family doctor, depicting some of the joys and sorrows I have witnessed over the last quarter of a century serving this community. Grounded in the philosophy of "to cure-sometimes, to relieve-often, and to comfort-always", I underscore the importance of presence and compassion in family medicine, ultimately embracing mortality as a shared human journey that shapes both patients and their caregivers.
