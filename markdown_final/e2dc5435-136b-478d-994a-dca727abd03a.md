## Question

amount of fluid we can aspirate in ascitis paracentesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much fluid can be safely aspirated during ascitic paracentesis and what thresholds, albumin dosing, and special considerations apply across clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis. Then, I should define what constitutes large-volume paracentesis and why that matters for albumin. Next, I will review guideline-based volume thresholds and albumin dosing, including any exceptions. After that, I should consider special populations and contexts, such as pediatrics, ACLF, and malignant ascites. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with monitoring and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the procedural categories, because the volume implications differ substantially. Diagnostic paracentesis typically involves removing 50–100 mL of ascitic fluid for laboratory analysis, whereas therapeutic paracentesis aims to relieve symptoms by removing larger volumes, and the latter is where volume thresholds and albumin become critical [^112mecDQ].

> Now, I should define large-volume paracentesis (LVP). Wait, let me verify the cutoffs. Major guidelines converge on defining LVP as removal of more than 5 liters of ascitic fluid in a single session, and this threshold is used to trigger albumin administration to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) [^112TSw1H] [^112mecDQ] [^113snnRy].

> Next, I will examine the standard recommendation for therapeutic volumes. I need to ensure I'm precise here. For patients with tense, grade 3 ascites, guidelines recommend complete evacuation in a single session when feasible, which commonly results in removal of 6–10 liters or more, followed by albumin replacement to mitigate PPCD risk [^11123Wo4] [^112vWWff] [^111Yb1bd].

> Hold on, I should verify the albumin dosing tied to volume removed. The recommended dose is 6–8 grams of albumin per liter of ascites removed, typically administered as 20–25% human albumin solution after the paracentesis is completed; for example, about 40 g after 5 liters and about 64 g after 8 liters, with some expert guidance allowing lower doses (e.g., 4 g/L) in select contexts while acknowledging the evidence base is limited [^112mecDQ] [^113snnRy] [^117RUmXt].

> But wait, what if less than 5 liters are removed — do we still need albumin? I should double-check this nuance. For volumes under 5 liters, routine albumin is not required in stable patients; however, in high-risk settings such as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, or hemodynamic instability, albumin should be considered even for smaller volumes, and some guidelines suggest 8 g/L regardless of the exact volume in ACLF or high-risk patients [^114nWnrU] [^113snnRy] [^117RUmXt].

> I will now examine special populations. In children, I need to check the dosing approach. Pediatric guidance recommends albumin at 0.5–1.0 g/kg or 6–8 g per liter of ascites removed for large-volume paracentesis, reflecting weight-based physiology and smaller absolute volumes in pediatric patients [^117KrrGv].

> Let me consider malignant ascites, because the pathophysiology differs. For palliative symptom relief in malignant ascites, small to moderate volumes (commonly 1–3 liters) are often sufficient to improve comfort, and while albumin is not routinely required, clinicians should individualize based on symptoms, hemodynamics, and reaccumulation rate; observational data suggest even small-volume taps can meaningfully reduce abdominal distension without clear dose–response beyond modest volumes [^116U4hNf].

> Next, I should review safety thresholds and practical limits. Although many centers routinely drain 6–10 liters in a single session, the risk of PPCD appears to rise when more than 8 liters are removed at once, reinforcing the importance of albumin and careful monitoring; procedure duration is commonly 1–4 hours for large volumes, and ultrasound guidance improves safety and success, particularly in patients with loculated fluid or challenging body habitus [^112mecDQ] [^112vWWff] [^116ghThQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about repeated daily low-volume drainage with indwelling devices. I should confirm the emerging data. Recent cohorts suggest that daily drainage volumes of 1.5 liters/day or more are associated with higher rates of hyponatremia, AKI, and inflammatory markers, implying a PPCD-like physiology over time; this does not negate the 5-liter single-session threshold, but it cautions that cumulative daily losses can be harmful without albumin support or volume-sparing strategies [^115c255x] [^114N5JdH] [^116aJH1i].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer clearly. For diagnostic paracentesis, remove 50–100 mL for testing. For therapeutic paracentesis, there is no absolute upper limit in a single session, but standard practice is to drain completely for symptom relief, commonly 6–10 liters, with mandatory albumin at 6–8 g per liter removed when more than 5 liters are evacuated; for less than 5 liters, albumin is optional in stable patients but should be considered in ACLF, renal dysfunction, hyponatremia, or hemodynamic instability; in pediatrics, use 0.5–1.0 g/kg or 6–8 g/L; in malignant ascites, smaller volumes often suffice and albumin is individualized [^112TSw1H] [^112mecDQ] [^113snnRy] [^117KrrGv] [^116U4hNf].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety steps are explicit. Use ultrasound to select a safe site and confirm adequate fluid, monitor vital signs during and after large-volume procedures, and watch for hypotension, dizziness, or oliguria that could signal PPCD; after drainage, consider lying the patient on the opposite side and closing the site to minimize leakage, and reassess electrolytes and renal function within 24 hours when large volumes are removed [^116ghThQ] [^112vWWff].

---

The amount of fluid that can be aspirated during ascitic paracentesis depends on the indication and patient factors: **diagnostic taps are typically 50–100 mL** for analysis, whereas **therapeutic taps can safely remove 4–6 L in one session** [^112vWWff], with up to 8–10 L if needed and if albumin is given for volumes > 5 L [^112TSw1H] [^112mecDQ]. For large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), **albumin 8 g/L removed** [^112TSw1H] is recommended to prevent circulatory dysfunction [^113snnRy]; for smaller volumes, albumin is not routinely required unless the patient is high risk [^114nWnrU]. Ultrasound guidance improves safety and success [^116ghThQ], and the total volume should be individualized to symptoms, hemodynamics, and renal function [^112mecDQ].

---

## Indications for ascitic paracentesis

Ascitic paracentesis is performed for **diagnostic or therapeutic** reasons:

- **Diagnostic paracentesis**: Essential for new-onset ascites [^1135CgdZ] or worsening ascites to determine etiology and exclude infection [^114fDbhH] [^114Qadwe].

- **Therapeutic paracentesis**: Used for symptomatic relief in large or refractory ascites, particularly when medical therapy is ineffective or contraindicated [^111NwMJZ] [^112Ng1wK].

---

## Recommended volumes for diagnostic paracentesis

For diagnostic paracentesis, the **recommended volume** is 50–100 mL — typically sufficient for comprehensive laboratory analysis, including cell count, albumin, total protein, culture, and other tests as indicated [^1177Wn5b].

---

## Recommended volumes for therapeutic paracentesis

Therapeutic paracentesis aims to relieve symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, dyspnea, and early satiety. The **volume removed** varies with patient tolerance, ascites severity, and clinical context:

- **Standard therapeutic volume**: 4–6 liters per session is commonly recommended for symptomatic relief [^notfound].

- **Large-volume paracentesis (LVP)**: Removal of > 5 liters in a single session is considered LVP and requires careful monitoring and albumin supplementation to prevent circulatory dysfunction [^112TSw1H] [^112mecDQ].

- **Maximum volume**: Up to 8–10 liters may be removed in a single session if clinically indicated, provided appropriate precautions are taken, including albumin administration and close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters [^112mecDQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Several **guidelines provide clear recommendations** on the volume of fluid removal and the need for albumin supplementation:

| **Guideline** | **Recommended volume for therapeutic paracentesis** | **Albumin supplementation** |
|-|-|-|
| EASL (2018) | - 4–6 liters standard <br/> - > 5 liters considered large-volume | - 8 g/L of ascites removed for > 5 liters [^112TSw1H] [^1132h2bd] |
| AASLD (2021) | - 4–6 liters standard <br/> - > 5 liters considered large-volume | - 6–8 g/L of ascites removed for > 5 liters [^112mecDQ] |
| BASL/BSG (2021) | - 4–6 liters standard <br/> - > 5 liters considered large-volume | - 8 g/L of ascites removed for > 5 liters [^113snnRy] |

---

## Risks and complications associated with large-volume paracentesis

Large-volume paracentesis (> 5 liters) carries **potential risks**, including:

- **Post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD)**: Characterized by effective hypovolemia, hyponatremia, renal impairment, and increased morbidity and mortality [^114N5JdH].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or hemodynamic instability [^112mecDQ].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Such as hyponatremia and hypokalemia [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Risk of peritonitis or other infectious complications, though rare [^112hGuS1].

---

## Role of albumin supplementation

Albumin supplementation is **critical during large-volume paracentesis** to prevent PPCD and associated complications. Recommended dosing is 8 g per liter of ascites removed (typically 40 g for 5 liters) administered intravenously during or immediately after the procedure [^112TSw1H] [^113snnRy]. For smaller volumes (< 5 liters), routine albumin supplementation is not generally required unless the patient is at high risk for circulatory dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, or hemodynamic instability) [^114nWnrU] [^112mecDQ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing fluid removal volume

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the safe volume of fluid removal:

- **Severity of ascites**: Grade 3 ascites may require larger volume removal for symptomatic relief [^111NwMJZ].

- **Comorbidities**: Presence of renal impairment, cardiovascular instability, or electrolyte disturbances may necessitate more conservative fluid removal [^112mecDQ].

- **Body weight and composition**: Larger patients may tolerate greater fluid removal volumes.

- **Clinical tolerance**: Patient comfort and hemodynamic stability during the procedure guide the volume removed [^112mecDQ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During and after therapeutic paracentesis, **careful monitoring** is essential:

- **Vital signs**: Regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum electrolytes, renal function tests, and hematological parameters should be monitored [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Watch for signs of PPCD, electrolyte disturbances, or infection [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Diagnostic paracentesis**: 50–100 mL [^notfound].

- **Therapeutic paracentesis**: 4–6 liters per session; up to 8–10 liters if clinically indicated with appropriate precautions [^112q425k].

- **Large-volume paracentesis (> 5 liters)**: Albumin supplementation at 8 g/L of ascites removed [^112TSw1H] [^113snnRy].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider severity of ascites, comorbidities, and clinical tolerance [^114fLvXr].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical status [^notfound].

---

The volume of fluid aspirated during ascitic paracentesis varies by indication and patient factors: **diagnostic taps are typically 50–100 mL**, whereas therapeutic taps commonly remove 4–6 L, with up to 8–10 L if needed and if albumin is given for volumes > 5 L [^112TSw1H]. Albumin supplementation is recommended for large-volume paracentesis to prevent circulatory dysfunction, and careful monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety [^113snnRy].

Background

Ascites is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, malignancy, cardiac failure, pancreatitis, and tuberculosis, with cirrhosis of the liver being the most common cause. Onset of ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is associated with worsened quality of life, increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and renal failure. Management of ascites caused by cirrhosis requires sodium restriction in diet, sodium excretion with diuretics and, in refractory cases, large volume paracentesis.

Technique

We describe a simple adjustment to the standard paracentesis technique that does not require additional equipment or manpower.

Conclusion

Removing over 5 L of ascitic fluid can become a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. We describe a setup that makes this commonly performed procedure fast, convenient, and safe.

Large volume (therapeutic) paracentesis

Large volume paracentesis (LVP) is the standard of care for managing large volume ascites both in conjunction with diuresis to relieve symptoms of a tense abdomen, as well as in the management of refractory ascites, when diuretics become ineffective or the side effects preclude their continued use. Development of refractory ascites is of prognostic significance, therefore, at its onset, suitability of liver transplantation should be considered and assessed as a priority.

Performance standards

An efficient LVP service can be provided safely in a day case or outpatient setting and non-physician healthcare providers such as GI endoscopy assistantsand specialist nursescan be trained to perform therapeutic paracentesis and lead the service effectively. Exemplar training programmes indicate that 10 supervised procedures would be optimal for training to achieve competence in performing therapeutic paracentesis; mean duration of LVP was 97 ± 24 min, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 L.

Patients should provide informed consent before the procedure. In 52 patients (15% obese) with ascites due to cirrhosis, ultrasound demonstrated that the left lower quadrant abdominal wall was thinner and depth of ascites greater, therefore, a suitable site for drain insertion. To minimise the risk of injury to the inferior epigastric artery (and avoid the liver and spleen) during paracentesis, point of puncture should be at least 8 cm from the midline and 5 cm above the symphysis(figure 4). All ascitic fluid should be drained to dryness in a single session as rapidly as possible over 1–4 hours assisted by gentle mobilisation of the cannula or turning the patient onto their side, if necessary. After the paracentesis, the patient should lie on the opposite side for 2 hours if there is leakage of any remaining ascitic fluid, and/or a suture (ideally purse-string) inserted around the site of drainage. These steps help to minimise the risk of ascitic fluid leakage.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) in refractory ascites — definition, role, and albumin dosing are as follows: LVP, arbitrarily defined as a paracentesis of > 5 L, has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of RA, and LVP is the first-line treatment for RA. Albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate the risk of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD); the recommended dose of albumin replacement, based on expert opinion, is 6–8 g for every liter of ascites removed, with practical examples that after the fifth liter, approximately 40 g of albumin should be infused, and after 8 L removed, the amount of albumin given should be approximately 64 g. The risk of PPCD may increase with > 8 L of fluid evacuated in one single session, and a recent study showed that by limiting the LVP volume to < 8 L per session and providing a higher than recommended dose of albumin (9.0 ± 2.5 g per liter of ascites removed), renal function and survival may be better preserved over a mean period of 2 years despite the development of PPCD in 40% of patients. In patients with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmol/L), and/or the presence of AKI, albumin infusion should be strongly considered for paracenteses of a smaller volume.

### Management of drainage for malignant ascites in gynaecological cancer [^116Pu2co]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer and some patients with advanced endometrial cancer need repeated drainage for malignant ascites. Guidelines to advise those involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally not evidence-based but mainly based on clinicians' anecdotal evidence and experience. To discover whether there are ways of managing drains that have been demonstrated to improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure is key in making recommendations which could improve the quality of life (QOL) for women at this critical period of their lives.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit and harms of different practices in the management of drains for malignant ascites in the care of women with advanced or recurrent gynaecological cancer. The review aimed to evaluate the evidence regarding the following questions; How long should the drain stay in place? Should the volume of fluid drained be replaced intravenously? Should the drain be clamped to regulate the drainage of fluid? Should any particular vital observations be regularly recorded?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 1, 2009, Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE1950 to February Week 3 2009, Embase 1980 to 2009 Week 8 2009. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-randomised studies that compared a range of interventions for management of multiple paracentesis in women with malignant ascites who had a confirmed histological diagnosis of gynaecological cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found and therefore no data were analysed.

Main Results

The search strategy identified 1664 unique references of which 1646 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. The remaining 18 articles were retrieved in full, but none satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Since no relevant studies were identified, we are unable to make recommendations regarding the management of drains for malignant ascites in women with gynaecological cancer. Large, multi-centre RCTs are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the management of ascitic drains when in situ and their impact on QOL.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^115awXT1]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Cardiac index in cirrhotic patients with hepato-renal syndrome may be fluid-responsive despite normal central venous pressure and global end-diastolic volume.

- Intra-abdominal hypertension, caused by ascites, can be reduced by paracentesis, resulting in a net increase in renal perfusion pressure.

- After paracentesis, fluid substitution can be titrated to keep global end-diastolic volume constant, and creatinine clearance and fractional excretion of sodium may increase.

- In cirrhotic intensive care patients with intra-abdominal hypertension caused by ascites resulting from fluid therapy, paracentesis is a safe procedure.

### Management of drainage for malignant ascites in gynaecological cancer [^114Rj761]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the abdominal cavity. Most women with advanced ovarian cancer and some women with advanced endometrial cancer need repeated drainage for ascites. Guidelines to advise those involved in the drainage of ascites are usually produced locally and are generally not evidence-based. Managing drains that improve the efficacy and quality of the procedure is key in making recommendations that could improve the quality of life (QoL) for women at this critical period of their lives.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of different interventions for the management of malignant ascites drainage in the palliative care of women with gynaecological cancer.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 4 November 2019. We checked clinical trial registries, grey literature, reports of conferences, citation lists of included studies, and key textbooks for potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with malignant ascites with gynaecological cancer. If studies also included women with non-gynaecological cancer, we planned to extract data specifically for women with gynaecological cancers or request the data from trial authors. If this was not possible, we planned to include the study only if at least 50% of participants were diagnosed with gynaecological cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, evaluated the quality of the included studies, compared results, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

In the original 2010 review, we identified no relevant studies. This updated review included one RCT involving 245 participants that compared abdominal paracentesis and intraperitoneal infusion of catumaxomab versus abdominal paracentesis alone. The study was at high risk of bias in almost all domains. The data were not suitable for analysis. The median time to the first deterioration of QoL ranged from 19 to 26 days in participants receiving paracentesis alone compared to 47 to 49 days among participants receiving paracentesis with catumaxomab infusion (very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were only reported among participants receiving catumaxomab infusion. The most common severe adverse events were abdominal pain and lymphopenia (157 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on the improvement of symptoms, satisfaction of participants and caregivers, and cost-effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the most appropriate management of drainage for malignant ascites among women with gynaecological cancer, as there was only very low-certainty evidence from one small RCT at overall high risk of bias.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, therapeutic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to perform large-volume paracentesis, removing ascites completely in a single session, as first-line therapy in patients with large ascites (grade 3 ascites), followed by plasma volume expansion to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.

### Optimal paracentesis volume for terminally ill cancer patients with ascites [^116U4hNf]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Patients with malignant ascites often suffer from distressing symptoms, especially in their end-of-life stage. Although paracentesis is the most common treatment modality to alleviate such symptoms, the optimal volume of paracentesis is not known.

Objectives

To explore the efficacy and safety of paracentesis by the drainage volume for terminally ill cancer patients with malignant ascites.

Methods

This was part of a multicenter prospective observational study (EASED study). Consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer admitted to 23 participating palliative care units were eligible. We analyzed patients with malignant ascites who received paracentesis. We compared paracentesis-free survival (PFS) using Cox regression among three groups with different paracentesis volumes: minimum: ≤ 1500 mL, small: 1500–2500 mL, and moderate: > 2500 mL. Trends of the difference in the numerical rating scale of abdominal distension (0–10) and adverse events were compared among the 3 groups.

Results

Of the 1926 patients enrolled, 673 developed ascites (symptomatic, n = 374 and asymptomatic, n = 299). Finally, we analyzed 87 patients with paracentesis. Median PFS was 7 days. Compared with a moderate volume, small-volume paracentesis was not a significant risk for shorter PFS (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.69–1.93), while a minimum volume was a significant risk (HR: 2.34). The abdominal distension intensity significantly decreased after paracentesis (median: 7.5 to 4.0), while the difference did not significantly increase as the volume of paracentesis rose (P = 0.61). No severe adverse event was observed.

Conclusion

Even small-volume paracentesis could alleviate abdominal distension of terminally ill cancer patients with malignant ascites without shortening the paracentesis interval compared with moderate-volume paracentesis. Small-volume paracentesis was a well-balanced treatment for these patients.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

Use of human albumin solution (HAS)

Plasma expansion after paracentesis

One study evaluating haemodynamic and neurohumoral responses in 12 patients after a single, 5 L total paracentesis concluded that it was safe to omit albumin in these patients. However, a subsequent study including 80 patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) found that albumin significantly reduced complications (renal impairment, hyponatraemia and death) following < 5 L paracentesis compared with no administration of fluid. Thus in < 5 L paracentesis we recommend that plasma expansion is not necessary, unless there is evidence of ACLF. This recommendation is based on consensus rather than evidence and is consistent with other international guidance.

Plasma volume expansion should always be used for LVP with > 5 L of ascites removed. Serial paracenteses with and without albumin replacement have been evaluated in patients with tense ascites. There was a higher rate of renal impairment, fall in serum sodium levels, and a marked activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in those not treated with albumin. However, the pooled risk ratio from these studies, which are more than 25 years old, showed only a tendency toward benefit of albumin (pooled RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.64) (online supplemental table 5). The consensus is that volume expansion should be used with LVP. We recommend large volume paracentesis in one session and discourage repeated low volume paracentesis, which offers no additional benefits and carries a higher risk of procedure-related complications.

### Automated low-flow ascites pump for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites [^112qXhts]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites (RA) can be treated with repeated large volume paracentesis (LVP), with the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or with liver transplantation. However, side effects and complications of these therapeutic options, as well as organ shortage, warrant the development of novel treatments. The automated low-flow ascites pump (alfapump ®) is a subcutaneously-implanted novel battery-driven device that pumps ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the urinary bladder. Ascites can therefore be aspirated in a time- and volume-controlled mode and evacuated by urination. Here we review the currently available data about patient selection, efficacy and safety of the alfapump and provide recommendations for the management of patients treated with this new method.

### Better with ultrasound: paracentesis [^114ho7ij]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure and generally considered to be low risk. Despite its overall favorable safety profile, use of ultrasound has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of complications, especially in higher risk patients. Many individual ultrasound techniques have been described in the literature, each with the goal of making paracentesis safer. This article presents a systematic approach for incorporating many of these tools into bedside practice and includes a series of illustrative figures and narrated video presentations to demonstrate the techniques described.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10 9 /L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult abdominal paracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^116ghThQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used for paracentesis to reduce the risk of serious complications, the most common being bleeding. 2. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to avoid attempting paracentesis in patients with an insufficient volume of intraperitoneal free fluid to drain. 3. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used with paracentesis to improve the success rates of the overall procedure. 4. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to assess the volume and location of intraperitoneal free fluid to guide clinical decision making of where paracentesis can be safely performed. 5. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify a needle insertion site based on size of the fluid collection, thickness of the abdominal wall, and proximity to abdominal organs. 6. We recommend that the needle insertion site should be evaluated using color flow Doppler ultrasound to identify and avoid abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 7. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be evaluated in multiple planes to ensure clearance from underlying abdominal organs and detect any abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 8. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be marked with ultrasound immediately before performing the procedure, and the patient should remain in the same position between marking the site and performing the procedure. 9. We recommend that using real-time ultrasound guidance for paracentesis should be considered when the fluid collection is small or difficult to access. 10. We recommend that dedicated training sessions, including didactics, supervised practice on patients, and simulation-based practice, should be used to teach novices how to perform ultrasound-guided paracentesis. 11. We recommend that simulation-based practice should be used, when available, to facilitate acquisition of the required knowledge and skills to perform ultrasoundguided paracentesis. 12. We recommend that competence in performing ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be demonstrated prior to independently performing the procedure on patients.

### Oncolytic adenovirus in treating malignant ascites: a phase II trial and longitudinal single-cell study [^1129wxtG]. Molecular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed median TTRP, defined as the number of days between the paracentesis at baseline and the first post-treatment therapeutic paracentesis or death, whichever occurred first. Therapeutic paracentesis was performed only as clinically indicated, with criteria including (1) development of ascites-related symptoms (nausea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal swelling, etc.) and signs (abdominal distension, shifting dullness, dull to percussion, and fluid thrill, etc.) as evaluated by the investigators, and (2) more than 1 L ascites volume determined by a radiologist based on CT. This was subsequently confirmed by evaluating collected ascites volume. The goal of therapeutic paracentesis was to remove as much fluid as possible (maximum paracentesis effort) to achieve maximum symptomatic improvement.

The secondary endpoints were safety, investigator-assessed PaFS, 60-day frequency of paracentesis, and OS. PaFS was defined as the time from the date of baseline paracentesis to the first post-treatment therapeutic paracentesis or the date of death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Sixty-day frequency of paracentesis was defined as frequency of therapeutic paracentesis during the first 60 days. OS was the time from the date of patient enrollment until the date of death from any cause. Patients were evaluated until repeat paracentesis, study withdrawal, death, or 6 months of follow-up, whichever occurred first.

All AEs and serious AEs occurring within 30 days after the last dose were reported following the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.

### Treatment for ascites in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^1173NWrF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 20% of people with cirrhosis develop ascites. Several different treatments are available; including, among others, paracentesis plus fluid replacement, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, aldosterone antagonists, and loop diuretics. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for ascites according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until May 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and ascites.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 49 randomised clinical trials (3521 participants) in the review. Forty-two trials (2870 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, without other features of decompensation, having mainly grade 3 (severe), recurrent, or refractory ascites. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 0.1 to 84 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Approximately 36.8% of participants who received paracentesis plus fluid replacement (reference group, the current standard treatment) died within 11 months. There was no evidence of differences in mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation in people receiving different interventions compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ascites at maximal follow-up was higher with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (HR 9.44; 95% CrI 1.93 to 62.68) and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (HR 30.63; 95% CrI 5.06 to 692.98) compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (very low-certainty evidence). Aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics had a higher rate of other decompensation events such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and variceal bleeding compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement (rate ratio 2.04; 95% CrI 1.37 to 3.10) (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials using paracentesis plus fluid replacement reported health-related quality of life or symptomatic recovery from ascites.

Funding

the source of funding for four trials were industries which would benefit from the results of the study; 24 trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 21 trials was unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low-certainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether interventions for ascites in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis decrease mortality, adverse events, or liver transplantation compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis and ascites. Based on very low-certainty evidence, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and adding aldosterone antagonists to paracentesis plus fluid replacement may increase the resolution of ascites compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement. Based on very low-certainty evidence, aldosterone antagonists plus loop diuretics may increase the decompensation rate compared to paracentesis plus fluid replacement.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^115c255x]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data indicate that the risk of clinical complications in those performing repeated low-volume paracentesis without albumin substitution is associated with the volume drained per day. Drainage of 1.5 L/d or more associates with a higher risk for hyponatremia, AKI, and increasing inflammation while those with drainage of less than 1.5 L/d show comparable complication rates with those receiving SOC.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute-on-chronic liver failure, more specifically with respect to large-volume paracentesis, SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to perform large-volume paracentesis with measurement of intra-abdominal pressure in critically ill patients with ACLF with tense ascites and intra-abdominal hypertension or hemodynamic, renal, or respiratory compromise.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) — albumin use and dosing are specified as follows: albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, with a suggested dose of 6–8 g/L of ascites removed and acknowledgement that lower doses (4 g/L) may be sufficient; in ACLF, albumin should be administered during paracentesis at a dose of 6–8 g/L regardless of amount of ascites removed.

### Palliation of malignant ascites [^116TjvfG]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The management of recurrent, symptomatic malignant ascites can be problematic for physicians and patients. The most common, low-risk method is large-volume paracentesis. Patient disease progression often leads to rapid reaccumulation of ascites, which requires frequent return visits to the hospital for symptom management. Other techniques have been developed to achieve palliation of symptoms, including tunneled external drainage catheters, peritoneal ports, and peritoneovenous

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^114MB2np]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — perioperative management of ascites in cirrhosis — states that ascites should be managed aggressively before surgical procedures and that, in patients with symptomatic ascites, large-volume total abdominal paracentesis should be performed preoperatively with intravenous albumin in a dose of 6–8 g for each liter of ascites fluid removed; once oral medications are tolerated, daily antibiotic prophylaxis can be resumed in patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or low ascites total protein; although preoperative antibiotics are of uncertain efficacy, an antibiotic such as ceftriaxone can be administered prophylactically in a dose of 1 g of every 24 hours intravenously until oral intake is possible again; preoperative thoracentesis is only recommended for moderate to large pleural effusions that compromise respiratory function, and administration of intravenous fluid and blood products should be limited perioperatively to avoid increasing extracellular volume, ascites, and portal venous pressure.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/microL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/microL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/microL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

### Does point-of-care ultrasound change the needle insertion location during routine bedside paracentesis? [^1148k3o4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Paracentesis is a bedside procedure to obtain ascitic fluid from the peritoneum. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) improves the safety of some medical procedures. However, the evidence supporting its utility in paracentesis is limited.

Objective

We aimed to assess if POCUS would yield a user-preferred site for needle insertion compared to conventional landmarking, defined as a ≥ 5 cm change in location.

Design

This was a prospective non-randomized trial comparing a POCUS-guided site to the conventional anatomic site in the same patient.

Participants

Adult patients at Kingston Health Sciences Centre undergoing paracentesis were included.

Interventions

Physicians landmarked using conventional technique and compared this to a POCUS-guided site. The paracentesis was performed at whatever site was deemed optimal, if safe to do so.

Main Measures

Data collected included the distance from the two sites, depth of fluid pockets, and anatomic considerations.

Key Results

Forty-five procedures were performed among 30 patients and by 24 physicians, who were primarily in their PGY 1 and 2 years of training (33% and 31% respectively). Patients' ascites was mostly due to cirrhosis (84%) predominantly due to alcohol (47%) and NAFLD (34%). Users preferred the POCUS-guided site which resulted in a change in needle insertion ≥ 5 cm from the conventional anatomic site in 69% of cases. The average depth of fluid was greater at the POCUS site vs. the anatomic site (5.4 ± 2.8 cm vs. 3.0 ± 2.5 cm, p < 0.005). POCUS deflected the needle insertion site superiorly and laterally to the anatomic site. The POCUS site was chosen (1) to avoid adjacent organs, (2) to optimize the fluid pocket, and (3) due to abdominal wall considerations, such as pannus. Six cases landmarked anatomically were aborted when POCUS revealed inadequate ascites.

Conclusions

POCUS changes the needle insertion site from the conventional anatomic site for most procedures, due to optimizing the fluid pocket and safety concerns, and helped avoid cases where an unsafe volume of ascites was present.

### Performance standards for therapeutic abdominal paracentesis [^112q425k]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis, the preferred treatment for patients with symptomatic tense ascites due to cirrhosis, has traditionally been performed by physicians as an inpatient procedure. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether large-volume paracentesis could be performed safely and effectively by gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants and as an outpatient procedure, (2) whether the risk of bleeding was associated with either thrombocytopenia or prolongation of the prothrombin time, and (3) the resources used for large-volume paracentesis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants performed 1,100 large-volume paracenteses in 628 patients, 513 of whom had cirrhosis of the liver. The preprocedure mean international normalized ratio for prothrombin time was 1.7 ± 0.46 (range, 0.9–8.7; interquartile range, 1.4–2.2), and the mean platelet count was 50.4 x 10(3)/microL, (range, 19 x 10(3)/microL - 341 x 10(3)/microL; interquartile range, 42–56 x 10(3)/microL). Performance of 3 to 7 supervised paracenteses was required before competence was achieved. There were no significant procedure-related complications, even in patients with marked thrombocytopenia or prolongation in the prothrombin time. The mean duration of large-volume paracentesis was 97 ± 24 minutes, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 L. In conclusion, large-volume paracentesis can be performed safely as an outpatient procedure by trained gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants. Ten supervised paracenteses would be optimal for training the operators carrying out the procedure. The practice guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases which states that routine correction of prolonged prothrombin time or thrombocytopenia is not required is appropriate when experienced personnel carry out paracentesis.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^115PJ6BY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander. Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^114qbwPX]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology in collaboration with British Association for the Study of the Liver has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the evidence that guides clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007. These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and comprise systematic reviews in the key areas, including the diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis are available, these have been updated with additional studies. In addition, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included. Where possible, judgement has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines and the specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practising clinicians, and it is expected that these guidelines will be revised in 3 years' time.

### Safety, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of daycase paracentesis in the management of malignant ascites with a focus on ovarian cancer [^114B2ayz]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Clinical and resource impact of paracentesis for malignant ascites

There were 67 admissions for 597 bed-days, for ovarian cancer, over the 4-month audit period (Stage 1). In all, 22% of admissions and 18% of bed-days were for ascitic drainage (Figure 1), with a median LoS for paracentesis of 4 days (range 1–26). Patients requiring ascitic drainage only, without any other procedures or investigations, had a median LoS of 3 days.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111Yb1bd]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Treatment of grade 3 ascites — initial management states that for patients presenting with tense ascites, large-volume paracentesis (LVP) combined with hyperoncotic human albumin is the initial treatment of choice, even in the presence of hyponatremia. Patients with massive peripheral edema may require a second paracentesis shortly after the first because a rapid shift of fluid may occur from interstitial to ascitic cavity. After LVP and a significant reduction in the intra-abdominal pressure, diuretics can be instituted, which may eliminate or reduce the frequency of paracentesis.

### Large-volume paracentesis in the management of ascites in children [^113tv8jY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Large-volume paracentesis has been evaluated for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in the management of ascites in cirrhotic adults. There are no published data relating to the safety, efficacy, or methods of this procedure in children. The objective of this study was to characterize the authors' initial experience with large-volume paracentesis (> 50 ml/kg of ascites) for removal of tense abdominal ascites in the pediatric population.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed of 21 large-volume paracentesis sessions in seven children (ages 6 months-18 years) with tense ascites that did not respond to other measures.

Results

Mean volume removed was 3,129 ± 2,966 mL (mean ± standard deviation) or 118 ± 56 ml/kg over 2.9 ± 3.7 hours by a 16-gauge intravascular catheter in 6 sessions, by an 18-gauge intravascular catheter in three sessions, and by a 15-gauge fenestrated, stainless-steel paracentesis needle in 12 sessions. Large-volume paracenteses performed with the paracentesis needle had significantly shorter duration of drainage and faster flow rates than those performed with the intravascular catheter. The only complication encountered was decreased urine output in one session.

Conclusions

Large-volume paracentesis is a safe and effective therapeutic method for managing tense abdominal ascites in children. The use of the paracentesis needle significantly improved the speed and efficiency of large-volume paracentesis compared with the intravascular catheter.

### Assessment of the 2021 AASLD practice guidance for albumin infusion in elective therapeutic paracentesis: a regression discontinuity design [^113A1nxM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2021 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Practice Guidance recommends albumin infusion when removing ≥ 5 L of ascites to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction. However, the optimal criteria and scenarios for initiating albumin infusion subsequent to therapeutic paracentesis (TP) have been subject to limited scientific inquiry.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a US academic healthcare center. Participants received elective, outpatient TP between July 2019 and December 2022. Patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, post-TP clinical adjustments, and/or hospitalization were excluded. The institution strictly followed the AASLD Guidance. We used a sharp regression discontinuity (RD) design to estimate the effect of albumin infusion at the AASLD Guidance-recommended cutoff of 5 L on serum creatinine and sodium trajectory after TP.

Results

Over the study period, 1,457 elective TPs were performed on 235 unique patients. Albumin infusion at the threshold of 5 L of ascites removal reduced serum creatinine levels by 0.046 mg/dL/d (95% confidence interval 0.003–0.116, P = 0.037) and increased serum sodium levels by 0.35 mEq/L/d (95% confidence interval 0.15–0.55, P = 0.001) compared with those who did not receive albumin infusion. The RD plots indicated worsened serum creatine/sodium levels after draining 3 L of fluid, approaching levels similar to or worse than with albumin infusion at 5 L or more.

Discussion

Our RD models supported the 2021 AASLD Guidance with robust estimation of causal effect sizes at the cutoff level of 5 L. Nevertheless, the findings also highlight the need to further evaluate the efficacy of albumin infusion in patients who undergo elective TP and have 3–5 L of ascites removed.

### Safety and effectiveness of transient ascites drainage in hospitalized patients with large ascites [^1162ygy4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Single paracentesis is the standard treatment for large ascites. An alternative is the placement of a transient ascites drainage. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transient ascites drainage in patients with large ascites.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic ascites who underwent transient ascites drainage between January 2017 and February 2022 were enrolled in this study. The amount of drained ascites and the duration of the drainage stay were recorded. Drainage-associated acute complications have been documented. Risk factors for complications were analyzed.

Results

A total of 224 ascites drains were inserted into 177 patients. The mean cumulative volume of drained ascites was 14 284ml (± 9987). The duration of drainage varied between 0 and 42 days and averaged 8.57 days (± 6.51). The technical success rate of drain placement was 98.21% (220/224). The most common drainage-associated complications were acute kidney injury in 31/224 (13.84%), bacterial peritonitis 16/185 (8.65%), and drainage-associated fistula [21/224 (9.38%)]. There were significant differences between the groups with and without drainage-associated peritonitis in the duration of drainage stay [13.63 (± 8.13) vs. 8.06 (± 6.20) days; P = 0.001). The frequency of peritonitis with a length of drainage stay of up to 7 days was 1.92%, with a length of stay greater than 7 days 17.28% (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Transient ascites catheters are effective for the drainage of large-volume ascites. The technical success rate was high, and the procedure itself was safe; however, owing to the high rate of drainage-associated peritonitis, a longer duration of drainage should be avoided.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^116pU2DZ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is the result of chronic liver disease and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cirrhosis can be further divided into different stages according to the presence or absence of clinical significant portal hypertension and the occurrence of complications, such as variceal bleeding or ascites. Development of refractory ascites (RA) is a hallmark in end-stage liver cirrhosis, and treatment options are limited. When liver transplantation is not available, implantation of a transjugular-intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) remains the therapy of choice. Unfortunately, there can be contraindications, such as recurrent hepatic encephalopathy or heart failure, that prohibit TIPS implantation in some patients. To date, repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin infusion is widely considered as standard of care (SOC) in this population that can be difficult to treat, but it is time-consuming, often poorly accepted by patients, and linked to an ongoing risk of paracentesis-associated complications, such as bleeding or infections.

Recently, different devices like the Alfapump or tunneled-intraperitoneal catheters (PeCa) have been introduced to enable a home-based treatment for patients with RA. Studies showed that these devices decrease the need for paracentesis and can even improve quality of life. However, other studies report a higher incidence of adverse events, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or hyponatremia. Hence, rehospitalization rates were increased compared with SOC. Besides presence of a device in the peritoneal cavity, daily low-volume taps without albumin substitution is the most eminent difference in contrast to patients receiving SOC. Prior studies, demonstrated that LVP without albumin substitution leads to AKI or hyponatremia. However, if this is the case in those undergoing low-volume paracentesis (ie, less than 5 L per drain) remains a matter of debate.,

Importantly, patients using devices to perform daily low-volume drainage pose a completely new entity of patients with end-stage cirrhosis, and data about modifiable factors on the clinical course of this group are scarce. Previous studies documented large differences regarding the volume of ascites removed per day in patients with devices, ranging from 0.5 L/d to 2.5 L/d in some cases. Hence, the total volume drained over time differs drastically. It is currently unknown if this is associated with a different clinical course. This study investigated the association between daily low-volume drainage and clinical complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and RA with a particular focus on the amount of ascites removed per day.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1148hJci]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound guidance

Use of ultrasound guidance may reduce the adverse events related to LVP. In a study involving 1297 procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound guidance and 574 (44%) without where the indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound-guided procedures. In another retrospective cohort study, 0.8% of 565 patients undergoing paracentesis experienced bleeding complications. After adjustment, ultrasound guidance was associated with lower risk of bleeding complications by 68%.

Recommendations

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112ahicX]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, therapeutic paracentesis, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider using ultrasound guidance when available during large-volume paracentesis to reduce the risk of adverse events.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113igVB6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

### Improvement in quality of life and decrease in large-volume paracentesis requirements with the automated low-flow ascites pump [^111seGMv]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint was safety, reported as the incidence and severity of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device and/or the catheters, the implantation procedure, and/or the alfapump therapy. Secondary endpoints included the efficacy of the alfapump system as assessed by the reduction in percutaneous paracentesis frequency, including percutaneous paracenteses of all volumes and the reduction in the cumulative volume of ascites removed through all such paracentesis events; patient QoL using the CLDQ 11 and the ascites‐specific Ascites Q 12; and survival. A higher CLDQ score means a better QoL, and a higher Ascites Q score denotes more symptoms from abdominal distension.

Statistical Analysis and Sample Size

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics, version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY). A descriptive analysis was performed for all primary and secondary variables. Continuous variables were described using means, medians, standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence intervals, and minimum and maximum values of each distribution. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages of each category.

Changes from the baseline of the primary and secondary endpoint variables used the Student t test for paired data. The Wilcoxon signed‐rank test was used to analyze all nonparametric data.

The safety of the alfapump system was evaluated by SAEs occurring during the study.

No formal sample size calculation was done for this feasibility study. A sample size of 30 patients was selected, assuming an underlying event rate of 5% for these SAEs, in order to provide nearly an 80% chance of identifying such an event.

### Palliative long-term abdominal drains for the management of refractory ascites due to cirrhosis: a consensus document [^114KCJq7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palliative care remains suboptimal in advanced cirrhosis, in part relating to a lack of evidence-based interventions. Ascites remains the most common cirrhosis complication resulting in hospitalisation. Many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates for liver transplantation or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and therefore, require recurrent palliative large volume paracentesis in hospital. We review the available evidence on use of palliative long-term abdominal drains in cirrhosis. Pending results of a national trial (REDUCe 2) and consistent with recently published national and American guidance, long-term abdominal drains cannot be regarded as standard of care in advanced cirrhosis. They should instead be considered only on a case-by-case basis, pending definitive evidence. This manuscript provides consensus to help standardise use of long-term abdominal drains in cirrhosis including patient selection and community management. Our ultimate aim remains to improve palliative care for this under researched and vulnerable cohort.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^114kodmm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Postoperative issues

Much of the resuscitative and therapeutic effort initiated preoperatively, including volume resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and coagulopathy, must be continued in the postoperative period. The surgical team should also maintain a high degree of vigilance for evidence of hepatic decompensation. Hepatic failure might simply result from the inflammatory response to surgery and underlying emergency condition, but the possibility of precipitating factors (e.g. constipation, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) should always be considered.

Ascites

Large-volume ascites after abdominal surgery increases the risk of abdominal wall dehiscence and herniation. It also predisposes the patient to atelectasis, aspiration, and pneumonia. Associated fluid shifts might precipitate electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury. Management is based on sodium restriction and judicious use of diuretics, with close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. Therapeutic paracentesis should be reserved for refractory cases and limited to symptomatic relief. A high index of suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is also required.

### Peritoneal catheter for massive cardiac ascites [^1161HeTV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cardiac ascites represents 5% of all causes of ascites. Diuretics and salt restriction remain the cornerstone of management. Large volume paracentesis is needed among patients who do not respond to conservative management. The use of peritoneal catheters to continuously drain steady amounts of ascitic fluid has been generally used in malignant ascites. When the ascites of any other origin is massive and requires many consecutive days of large-volume paracentesis, the use of a catheter may represent a more convenient strategy. We present a patient with cardiac ascites that was successfully managed with a peritoneal catheter.

### Contemporary management of malignant ascites [^1117NdAR]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant ascites (MA) develops when malignant disease of the peritoneum causes excess fluid to accumulate in the abdominal cavity. It portends a poor prognosis and is associated with debilitating symptoms. While several palliative therapies exist, none have proven curative or free from side effects and complications. This review article describes experimental therapies on the horizon and the contemporary management of MA.

Materials and Methods

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, in which studies of emerging or experimental therapies under investigation for the management of MA were reviewed. Current therapies were also reviewed to provide important context. Data, including study design, sample size, primary and secondary outcomes, and side effects were recorded and described. Studies were then categorized into distinct sections and subsections, with tables corresponding to each section.

Results

Five current therapies, including paracentesis, diuretics, peritoneovenous shunting, permanent catheters, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, are described. Their limitations in effectively managing MA are highlighted. The "Experimental therapies" section is subsectioned into several categories, with the major studies corresponding to each section thoroughly described regarding methods, results, and validity. A final section describes treatments for mucinous ascites, which has distinct characteristics.

Conclusions

While each of the experimental therapies described offers unique benefits and has demonstrated some promise in managing MA, they all have limitations that have thus far prevented any one of them from being routinely used in practice. MA remains a challenging condition to treat, warranting further research into novel therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of reinfusion of concentrated ascitic fluid for malignant ascites: a concept-proof study [^115SDEK1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Malignant ascites is one of the symptoms causing discomfort in advanced cancer patients. Cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART) is one treatment modality, but controlled trials are limited. The primary aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of CART, as well as their predictors, to obtain data for planning a further controlled trial.

Methods

This was a single center retrospective cohort study in patients with refractory malignant ascites. Consecutive adult patients who underwent CART were enrolled. The primary endpoints were the time to next paracentesis and seven patient-reported symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain and distension). The secondary endpoints were adverse events, laboratory findings, and physical findings.

Results

A total of 104 CART procedures for 51 patients were analyzed. The median time to next paracentesis was 27 days (95% CI, 21–35). Intensities of all seven symptoms were significantly improved after CART (p < 0.0001 for all symptoms). Grade 3 hypotension occurred during one procedure, and mild fever occurred in 5%. Total protein, albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were significantly increased. Hemorrhagic ascites, ascites white blood cell count, serum total protein, and lymphocyte percentages were the independent predictors of the time to next paracentesis.

Conclusion

The effects of reinfusion of concentrated ascitic fluid may be maintained for 1 month, being potentially longer than that of total paracentesis alone. This study had no comparison groups and examined the short-term effect. A randomized controlled study to compare the long-term effects of total paracentesis alone vs. CART is necessary.

### Safety, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of daycase paracentesis in the management of malignant ascites with a focus on ovarian cancer [^113vVZza]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The Hospital Episode Statistics suggest an average length of in-patient stay (LoS) for paracentesis of 4 days. This is due to the common practice of intermittent clamping of drains, because of a perceived risk of hypotension with free drainage, based on historical experience with paracentesis for transudative ascites due to hypo-albuminaemia and portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. These patients frequently require intravenous fluid replacement, and many gastroenterology units routinely co-administer human albumin solution. Malignant ascites develops as a consequence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, portal vein compression and lymphatic invasion. Recent preclinical and clinical data have also identified a key role of VEGF and increased vascular permeability in the development of ascites, as also demonstrated by the efficacy of bevacizumab and aflibercept in some patients. In view of the difference in the pathophysiology of malignant ascites, a recent study of 18 women (23 episodes of paracentesis) with ovarian cancer suggested that free drainage of malignant ascites was safe and did not cause significant hypotension. Similarly, have previously shown that free drainage is associated with only modest (6 mm Hg) fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP), but no changes in diastolic BP, and is safe. Because in-patient admissions limit the quality of life of patients with advanced disease; daycase paracentesis if possible is a potentially preferable alternative. However, the attempts ofto perform paracentesis as a daycase procedure was associated with a 44% admission rate due to incomplete drainage of ascites, whereas in another study in a hospice setting, daycase paracentesis achieved only partial fluid drainage.

Concerns over the risk of hypotension, the small size of the Decruze study, the lack of independent validation of their results and high admission or partial drainage rates continue to limit the adoption of daycase paracentesis clinically.

To address these issues, we audited our in-patient bed utilisation for paracentesis, and re-assessed the safety of free drainage of ascites. Reasons for high admission rates owing to partial drainage in the previous study related to delays in drain insertion and slow fluid drainage. To eliminate the need for in-patient admission while retaining high rates of complete drainage, we evaluated the feasibility of daycase paracentesis, with radiological insertion of drains instead of junior doctors. We also determined the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy relative to in-patient paracentesis.

### Ultrasound-assisted paracentesis performed by emergency physicians vs the traditional technique: a prospective, randomized study [^114FqKKe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine if emergency center ultrasound (ECUS) can be of value to emergency physicians in the evaluation of possible ascites and accompanying decisions to perform emergent paracentesis.

Methods

During a 7-month period, patients suspected of having ascites and potentially requiring paracentesis were prospectively entered into a randomized study in an urban public hospital emergency center (> 140 000 annual visits). Patients were randomized to receive paracentesis using the traditional or the bedside ECUS-assisted technique. Indications for paracentesis included known liver disease and obvious ascites as well as suspected ascites or suspected subacute bacterial peritonitis. Participating physicians had received a minimum of 1 hour of formal didactic ultrasound training that included gallbladder, renal, vascular, and bladder studies as well as the focused abdominal sonography for trauma examination for trauma and the detection of ascites. A portable Terason 2000 laptop ultrasound machine with a 5-MHz probe was used to scan the patients. Data collected included the patients' characteristics, estimation of ascitic fluid volume, number of attempts made to obtain fluid, speed of paracentesis, and the operator's overall evaluation of the ECUS-assisted technique, if used.

Results

Of 100 enrolled patients, 56 received the ECUS-assisted technique. Of 42 patients with ascites, 40 (95%) were successfully aspirated and 14 (25%) did not receive paracentesis because no ascites or insignificant amount of ascites was visualized. One patient was noted to have a large cystic mass in the left lower quadrant and another patient had a ventral hernia. Of the 44 patients randomized to the traditional technique, 27 (61%) were successfully aspirated. In 17 (39%) of these patients, fluid could not be obtained using traditional methods. Of these 17 failed attempts by traditional methods, 15 patients received ECUS in a "break" from the study protocol. Ascitic fluid was obtained in 13 of these 15 patients; of the 2 remaining patients, 1 did not have enough fluid to be sampled and the other had no fluid visualized.

Conclusion

Ninety-five percent (P = 0.0003) of the patients who were randomized in the ECUS group and in whom a needle paracentesis was performed had ascitic fluid successfully obtained, as compared with the traditional method group.

### Effects of plasma expansion with albumin and paracentesis on haemodynamics and kidney function in critically ill cirrhotic patients with tense ascites and hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective uncontrolled trial [^1116PF4i]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study indicates that the expansion of central blood volume is possible even in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The ensuing circulatory changes are small, however, and renal effects were not visible with the amount of albumin solution used in our study. After paracentesis there was a marked decrease in IAP and RPP. Under substitution of albumin and fluids to maintain central blood volume, there was a simultaneous improvement of renal function that may be relevant in patients with end-stage liver disease.

### TIPS versus paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites [^11327JZX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ten per cent of cirrhotic patients develop refractory ascites, which carries substantial morbidity and has a one-year survival of less than 50 per cent. Patients with refractory ascites may benefit from transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunts (TIPS).

Objectives

To compare TIPS versus paracentesis standard treatment in patients with refractory ascites due to cirrhosis with regard to overall short- and long-term mortality, treatment efficacy, and complications.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2003), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (1980 to July 2003), and CINAHL (1982 to July 2003). We supplemented the searches with reading through scientific citations, review of citations in relevant primary articles, and hand-searched abstracts from national meetings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing TIPS and paracentesis with or without volume expanders for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.

Data Collection and Analysis

We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials by the generation of the allocation section, allocation concealment, and follow-up. Two independent observers extracted data from each trial. We contacted trial authors for additional information. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Four randomised clinical trials, including 264 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was moderate. Thirty-day mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 10.06, P = 1.0) and 24-month mortality (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.66, P = 0.70) did not differ significantly between TIPS and paracentesis treatment. TIPS significantly reduced ascites re-accumulation at three months (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.18, P < 0.00001) and at 12 months follow-up (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28, P < 0.00001). Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.66, P = 0.008). Gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.84, P = 0.63), acute renal failure (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.72, P = 0.55), septicemia/infection (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.94, P = 0.96), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.84, P = 0.63) did not differ significantly between groups.

Reviewers' Conclusions

TIPS removed ascites more effectively than paracentesis. After 12 months, the beneficial effects of TIPS on ascites was still present. Mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, septicemia/infection, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation did not differ significantly between the two groups. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred significantly more often in the TIPS group.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^116aJH1i]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the long-term association between ascites volume drained per day and clinical outcome in patients treated with devices. Higher quantities of ascites removed per day were associated with AKI and hyponatremia. Compared with patients receiving SOC, those with daily taps of 1.5 L/d or more showed higher rates of AKI, hyponatremia, and rehospitalization, while this was not the case in individuals with daily drainage of less than 1.5 L/d.

Patients with end-stage liver disease, RA, and contraindications for TIPS are difficult to treat and have frequent complications. To enable a more self-determined life and to save costs from repeated LVP in combination with albumin infusion, devices like PeCa or Alfapump have been introduced. However, little is known about the association of daily low-volume ascites taps, and this distinct group represents a new entity of patients. Previous studies, indicated higher rates of kidney impairment or rehospitalization, while others did not find such an association in those treated with devices compared with SOC. In addition, the potential effect of taps with volumes less than 5 L without albumin infusion is currently insufficiently studied. Of note, Macken et alinvestigated a small cohort of patients with PeCa, who drained a limited volume of up to 6 L per week and did not observe higher rates of kidney failure and hyponatremia compared with SOC. Hence, daily drainage of low volumes (ie, drainage of less than 1 to 1.5 L/d) may not lead to more complications than SOC.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^114N5JdH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Besides the increased incidence of clinical end points in patients with drainage of 1.5 L/d or more, we observed a significant decrease of serum sodium while leucocyte count and C-reactive protein increased in patients with taps of 1.5 L/d or more after 28 days, similar to patients undergoing LVP without albumin infusion. Interestingly, this was not the case in patients with daily drainage of 1.5 L/d or less. In the setting of LVP without albumin substitution, postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD) occurs frequently and is most likely the result of effective blood volume reduction.PPCD is associated with AKI, hyponatremia, and decreased survival. Repeated low-volume paracentesis of 1.5 L/d or more might have led to a PPCD-like state over time and could explain the clinical observations in our cohort. Data about the potential associations of repeated low-volume drainage regarding an altered clinical course and the occurrence of PPCD are scarce, and it has been suggested that removal of less than 5 L ascites per drain does rarely lead to PPCD, at least in the setting of a single paracentesis. Thus, albumin infusion in these patients remains a matter of debate. However, PPCD has already been reported in patients with Alfapump, and our data indicate that complications occur with increasing drainage volumes, even in the setting of low-volume paracentesis. In our cohort, none of the patients received regular albumin infusion after drainage and albumin was only administered for other indications like SBP, AKI, or hyponatremia. Strikingly, albumin infusion can effectively prevent PPCD and is recommended after paracentesis of more than 5 L. Thus, it is tempting to estimate that albumin infusion could decrease complications in individuals with daily drains of 1.5 L/d or more. Treatment could be adapted in those who are in need of taps of 1.5 L/d or more. One could only drain less than 1.5 L/d and perform LVP every few weeks (via the device) with albumin infusion in an outpatient unit. However, this would contradict the idea of home-based therapy. Another potential option could be drainage of 1.5 L/d or more and infusion of albumin with the help of a dedicated care service, in the same manner as palliative patients receive infusions in a home-based care. Future studies might therefore investigate the association of albumin infusions, especially in those with higher daily drainage volumes.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111y2Y7Z]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Bedside paracentesis still remains a relatively low‐risk procedure when utilizing ultrasound. However, when complications do occur, it is often associated with high morbidity. We found that post‐paracentesis AKI risk is not affected by the volume of ascites removed, but it is heightened in patients with higher MELD‐Na scores and when performed in patients already experiencing clinical deterioration. Additionally, the risk of hemorrhagic complications remained low in our cohort, but interestingly higher rates were seen in patients with elevated AST levels and those that had larger pockets of ascites pre‐procedure and larger volumes removed.

Adverse events

A systematic review of adverse events that can result from a paracentesis reported an overall rate of significant bleeding ranging from 0% to 2.7%, ascitic fluid leak in 0% to 2.35%, perforation in 0.83%, residual catheter tip fragment in 0.41% and death in 0% to 17% among studies that were heterogeneous. In a retrospective study published in abstract form, of consecutive 3116 ultrasound guided LVPs, the mean international normalised ratio (INR) was 2.1 (range 1.0–7.0) and MELD score 24 (range 6–40) for inpatients, and 1.5 (range 1‐5–5) and 16 (range 5–40) for outpatients, respectively. With no patients receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) before the procedure, a total of six patients (0.19%) had post‐LVP bleeding requiring blood transfusion (one inpatient, five outpatients) and one required angiography with embolisation of a bleeding abdominal wall vessel. No patient died. In another study where GI endoscopy assistants performed 1100 large volume paracenteses, with a preprocedure mean INR of 1.7 (range 0.9–8.7) and the mean platelet count was 50.4×10 9 /L (range, 19–341×10 9 /L), there were no significant procedure-related complications.

Risk factors for haemorrhagic complications after paracentesis in three studies (which included patients with acute on chronic liver failure) were high MELD and Child-Pugh scores and renal impairment. In a study by Hung et al, acute kidney injury at he time of paracentesis was the only independent predictor of post-paracentesis haemoperitoneum, independent of MELD score, large volume paracentesis, sepsis, platelets, INR and haemoglobin levels. While some patients with bleeding complications after paracentesis have low platelet counts, elevated INR and low fibrinogen levels, this is invariably accompanied with high MELD scores (> 25) and/or renal impairment.

### Alfapump® system vs. large volume paracentesis for refractory ascites: a multicenter randomized controlled study [^113n9Xj3]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Patients with refractory ascites (RA) require repeated large volume paracenteses (LVP), which involves frequent hospital visits and is associated with a poor quality-of-life. This study assessed safety and efficacy of an automated, low-flow pump (alfapump® [AP]) compared with LVP standard of care [SoC].

Methods

A randomized controlled trial, in seven centers, with six month patient observation was conducted. Primary outcome was time to first LVP. Secondary outcomes included paracentesis requirement, safety, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), and survival. Nutrition, hemodynamics, and renal injury biomarkers were assessed in a sub-study at three months.

Results

Sixty patients were randomized and 58 were analyzed (27 AP, 31 SoC, mean age 61.9years, mean MELD 11.7). Eighteen patients were included in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, median time to first LVP was not reached after six months in the AP group, meaning a significant reduction in LVP requirement for the AP patients (AP, median not reached; SoC, 15.0days (HR 0.13; 95%CI 13.0–22.0; p < 0.001), and AP patients also showed significantly improved Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) scores compared with SoC patients (p < 0.05 between treatment arms). Improvements in nutritional parameters were observed for hand-grip strength (p = 0.044) and body mass index (p < 0.001) in the sub-study. Compared with SoC, more AP patients reported adverse events (AEs; 96.3% vs. 77.4%, p = 0.057) and serious AEs (85.2 vs. 45.2%, p = 0.002). AEs consisted predominantly of acute kidney injury in the immediate post-operative period, and re-intervention for pump related issues, and were treatable in most cases. Survival was similar in AP and SoC.

Conclusions

The AP system is effective for reducing the need for paracentesis and improving quality of life in cirrhotic patients with RA. Although the frequency of SAEs (and by inference hospitalizations) was significantly higher in the AP group, they were generally limited and did not impact survival. Lay summary: The alfapump® moves abdominal fluid into the bladder from where it is then removed by urination. Compared with standard treatment, the alfapump reduces the need for large volume paracentesis (manual fluid removal by needle) in patients with medically untreatable ascites. This can improve life quality for these patients. www.clinicaltrials.gov#NCT01528410.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^115pcqDQ]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin administration after large-volume paracentesis (LVP) (> 5 L) and in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) has been recommended by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, as is the use of albumin together with vasoconstrictors in the management of HRS-AKI. Other uses of albumin are controversial and require further research before they can be widely recommended. –

In a recent European surveycompleted by 101 hepatologists practicing at 86 centers (75% academic hospitals), the vast majority (93%–97%) of participants used i.v. albumin for guideline-recommended settings, specifically, after LVP for the prevention of post–paracentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), prevention of renal failure after SBP, and diagnosis and management of HRS-AKI. However, up to a third of practitioners from tertiary and university hospitals admitted to using albumin in settings where albumin use is not recommended, specifically non-SBP infections, severe hyponatremia, HE, and long-term use for the treatment of ascites. Interestingly and inexplicably, half of the respondents would recommend i.v. albumin solely for hypoalbuminemia. In addition, even for recommended indications, doses used were not the ones recommended based on clinical trials. This mirrors the reality of clinical medicine when the label of the medication is broad and where costs and perceived benefits of a drug have an influence on practice, even in the absence of supportive evidence.

### Comparison of percutaneous management techniques for recurrent malignant ascites [^114fHPvU]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Pleurx subcutaneous tunneled catheter is approved for repeated, long-term drainage of malignant pleural effusions; however, there is limited literature describing its use in malignant ascites. The authors compared the safety and efficacy of two percutaneous drainage methods: large volume paracentesis and Pleurx catheter placement over a 41-month period. The Pleurx catheter provided effective palliation with a complication rate similar to that for large volume paracentesis, while preventing the need for frequent trips to the hospital for repeated percutaneous drainage.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, therapeutic paracentesis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to administer albumin (8 g/L of ascites removed) for plasma volume expansion in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis of > 5 L of ascites.

1216. doi: 10.1001/jama.299.10.1216 Ascites is an abnormal increase in fluid within the peritoneal cavity. The normal abdominal cavity has a small amount of fluid. Cirrhosis with associated portal hypertension. is the most common cause of ascites. Other causes of ascites include cancer, heart failure, kidney failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. An abdominal paracentesis involves the surgical puncture of the abdominal cavity with a needle and placement of a catheter line for the removal of excess fluid. The procedure can be diagnostic in helping identify the cause of ascites or may be used as a therapeutic measure if a large volume of fluid can be removed to lessen discomfort and improve breathing. The March 12.

2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about paracentesis techniques. It identifies ways to decrease the risk of complications and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Patients with new-onset ascites Patients with chronic ascites and at least one of the following symptoms: Fever Abdominal pain Increasing ascites volume — increasing abdominal girth. Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid Circulatory problems, such as lowered blood pressure Localized infection at the puncture site Abdominal wall blood clots or bruises Bleeding Injury to organs in the abdomen Tests of the removed fluid help to establish the cause of the ascites and to rule out infection. These tests include counts of the numbers and types of cells in the fluid. Testing for albumin should be done in cases of new ascites. Additional tests may be done depending on the patient's history and physical examination.

### Paracentesis of ascitic fluid… [^112hGuS1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Runyon BA. Paracentesis of Ascitic Fluid: A Safe Procedure. Arch Intern Med. 1986; 146: 2259–2261. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1986.00360230201029
- A prospective study of 229 abdominal paracenteses performed on 125 patients with ascites revealed only two major complications in a single patient, and two minor complications in two patients. No paracentesis resulted in bacterial peritonitis or death. Abdominal paracentesis in patients with ascites is a safe procedure. Fear of complications of the procedure should not preclude performing a paracentesis, provided certain precautions are taken.

### Intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid… [^111jEEqP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The medical management of cirrhotic ascites has improved greatly during the past few years. There remains, however, a group of patients who either respond slowly or not at all to the most active medical program. In these individuals it is frequently advisable and necessary to remove fluid from the abdomen by paracentesis. Unfortunately, such treatment has been far from satisfactory. If small amounts of fluid are withdrawn, relief is only partial and often of short duration. On the other hand, if the abdomen is emptied, large amounts of body protein are wasted in individuals who can ill afford the loss. In addition, this procedure is frequently followed by reformation of ascites, hyponatremia, hypovolemia, and occasionally hepatic coma. 8 The present report describes the results obtained following the simultaneous withdrawal and continuous intravenous administration of unmodified autogenous ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhotic ascites. It is our impression that this method.
