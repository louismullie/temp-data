## Question

Pincer grasp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pincer grasp, specifically its definition, developmental timeline, neural and motor prerequisites, assessment tools, clinical significance, and implications for early intervention and atypical development. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the pincer grasp and distinguishing it from other grasps. Then, I should verify the typical developmental timeline and variability. Next, I will examine the neural and motor prerequisites that enable emergence. After that, I need to review validated assessment tools and screening milestones. Then, I will consider clinical significance, including red flags and prognostic value. Finally, I will integrate implications for early intervention and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. The pincer grasp is a precision grip using the pad of the thumb opposed to the pad of the index finger to pick up small objects, contrasting with a power grip that clamps objects against the palm; this distinction is consistently described in developmental motor literature and infant assessment frameworks.

> I should double-check the typical developmental timeline. Most authoritative sources indicate a neat pincer grasp emerges by about 12 months, with precursor thumb–finger opposition appearing earlier; the AAP-endorsed preterm follow-up framework states a neat pincer and finger manipulation should be present by 12 months, while observational and experimental work shows precision grip use increasing from roughly 7–11 months, with some infants demonstrating the capability earlier but becoming reliable after 8–9 months [^113CSAfp] [^113px4QR] [^115nApr7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity. I need to check variability and the role of experience. Infants show a range of onset for precision grips between about 7 and 11 months, and emerging evidence suggests infants' own motor experience with precision grasping influences how they perceive and attend to others' grasping actions, indicating a bidirectional link between action production and action perception that may modulate the apparent "age of emergence" in observational paradigms [^113px4QR] [^115nApr7] [^112AL6PM].

> Next, I should review the neural and motor prerequisites. Let me think about the corticospinal system and somatosensory maturation. The corticospinal tract undergoes rapid maturation in the first year, with activity-dependent reorganization that supports independent digit control; functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network strengthens across the perinatal period, providing the substrate for precision grip emergence, and experimental work links infants' own precision grip ability to enhanced processing of congruent versus incongruent grasping actions, reinforcing the role of motor experience in shaping perception [^112Dexhj] [^1117qoQo] [^115nApr7].

> I will now examine assessment tools and milestones so I can verify what clinicians should use. The Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) is a validated, Rasch-based tool for 3–12 months that quantifies unimanual and bimanual hand use and detects asymmetry; normative reference values exist and help identify atypical trajectories, while the Bayley Scales' fine motor subtest includes grasping items and is widely used in research and follow-up; primary care guidance also flags the absence of a neat pincer by 12 months as a red flag warranting referral [^114YCzuZ] [^111oVENK] [^112hV6FG] [^113CSAfp].

> But wait, what if the infant is preterm or at risk for unilateral cerebral palsy? I should confirm prognostic markers. In infants with unilateral CP, the ability to grasp by 6 months is a strong predictor of long-term hand function trajectories, and HAI-derived trajectories identify low-, moderate-, and high-functioning groups with distinct developmental courses; similarly, in high-risk preterm cohorts, achieving a bilateral pincer grasp by 12 months is used as a marker of normal neurologic outcome in some studies, underscoring its clinical salience [^111U78z2] [^111xm4qh] [^111z6iTV].

> Let me consider clinical significance and red flags. Absence of a neat pincer by 12 months should prompt evaluation for developmental delay or neuromotor impairment; persistent hand asymmetry before 18 months is atypical and warrants further assessment; in infants exposed to opioids, the implausibility of self-administration given immature pincer grasp has been used to highlight safeguarding concerns, illustrating how this milestone can inform clinical reasoning beyond pure motor diagnosis [^113CSAfp] [^115zmHhL].

> I need to ensure I address early intervention implications. The first year is a period of high neuroplasticity, and targeted, task-specific practice can enhance hand function; constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) adapted for infants and family-centered, goal-directed programs like the Small Step Program emphasize self-initiated hand use and object exploration to promote precision grips; environmental enrichment and parent coaching are reasonable strategies, though evidence for fine motor gains is less robust than for gross motor outcomes, reinforcing the need for intensity and specificity when targeting pincer grasp [^112Dexhj] [^1136qpSV] [^111tkyWa].

> Hold on, I should verify the link between motor and cognitive development so I don't overstate motor-only benefits. Motor experience, including precision grasping, supports object exploration and problem-solving, and delays in fine motor skills can constrain cognitive learning; thus, fostering pincer grasp and manipulation is not only about hand function but also about scaffolding broader developmental gains through enriched, self-directed play [^117HUeUQ] [^113kfdh9].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary. The pincer grasp is a precision thumb–index finger grip that typically emerges by 12 months, with a normal range of about 7–11 months and strong dependence on corticospinal maturation and motor experience; clinicians should screen at the 9–12 month visits, use validated tools like HAI or Bayley when concerns arise, and refer if a neat pincer is absent by 12 months or if asymmetric hand use is present before 18 months; early, task-specific intervention leveraging neuroplasticity can improve outcomes, especially in infants at risk for unilateral CP or developmental delay [^113CSAfp] [^114YCzuZ] [^111U78z2] [^112Dexhj].

The pincer grasp is a **fine motor milestone** [^113px4QR] that emerges around 9–12 months, enabling infants to pick up small objects using the thumb and index finger [^113CSAfp]. It reflects maturation of corticospinal pathways and is essential for **self-feeding**, tool use, and academic skills [^112Dexhj] [^113kgERD] [^113BbSyb]. Delays or abnormalities (e.g. thumb-in-palm, asymmetric use) may signal neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy or developmental delay and should prompt early assessment and intervention [^116TXyE7] [^113CSAfp]. Early, targeted therapy — including CIMT and parent-mediated practice — can improve pincer grasp and overall hand function [^1136qpSV].

---

## Developmental timeline and stages

- **Initial emergence**: The pincer grasp typically emerges between 9 and 12 months of age [^113CSAfp], with some infants demonstrating precursors (e.g. thumb-finger opposition) as early as 6–8 months [^113px4QR].

- **Refinement**: By 12 months, most infants can reliably use a neat pincer grasp to pick up small objects, such as raisins or beads, demonstrating precise thumb-index finger coordination [^113CSAfp].

- **Continued development**: Beyond 12 months, the pincer grasp continues to refine, integrating with other fine motor skills such as in-hand manipulation, tool use, and bilateral coordination [^113kfdh9].

---

## Neurological and physiological basis

- **Corticospinal tract maturation**: The emergence of the pincer grasp coincides with maturation of the corticospinal tract, enabling precise motor control of individual digits [^112Dexhj].

- **Sensorimotor integration**: The pincer grasp requires integration of sensory feedback (tactile, proprioceptive) with motor output, reflecting the development of sensorimotor networks [^114scTDC].

- **Brain plasticity**: Early motor experiences and environmental enrichment enhance neural plasticity, facilitating the development of pincer grasp and related fine motor skills [^111tkyWa].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Indicator of development**: The pincer grasp is a key developmental milestone, reflecting normal neurological and musculoskeletal development [^113CSAfp].

- **Functional independence**: Mastery of the pincer grasp is essential for self-feeding, dressing, and academic tasks such as writing and drawing [^notfound].

- **Early marker of impairment**: Delays or abnormalities in pincer grasp development may indicate underlying neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delay, or neuromuscular conditions [^113CSAfp].

---

## Assessment and evaluation

Standardized tools such as the **Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III)** [^112hV6FG] and the **Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS-2)** [^116F8yoE] assess pincer grasp development. Observational methods include structured observation of **infants manipulating small objects** to evaluate the quality and symmetry of pincer grasp [^111oVENK]. Normative data provide age-referenced benchmarks to identify **atypical development** and guide intervention planning [^114YCzbu].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with impaired pincer grasp

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cerebral palsy | - Motor impairment affecting hand function <br/> - Often presenting with asymmetric or delayed pincer grasp [^111xm4qh] |
| Developmental delay | - Generalized delay in motor milestones <br/> - Including pincer grasp [^113CSAfp] |
| Neuromuscular disorders | Conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy or peripheral neuropathy affecting hand strength and coordination [^notfound] |
| Congenital anomalies | - Structural abnormalities of the hand or thumb (e.g. thumb hypoplasia) impairing pincer grasp [^116jSvaW] |

---

## Interventions and therapies

- **Early intervention**: Early, targeted interventions, including constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and parent-mediated home programs, have been shown to improve pincer grasp and overall hand function in infants at risk of developmental delays [^113AYYfZ] [^114yna6D].

- **Occupational therapy**: Occupational therapists use task-specific training, adaptive devices, and environmental modifications to enhance pincer grasp development and functional independence [^notfound].

- **Family involvement**: Parent education and coaching are critical components of intervention, promoting consistent practice and reinforcement of pincer grasp skills in daily activities [^112jkSbL].

---

## Conclusion

The pincer grasp is a **critical fine motor milestone** that emerges around 9–12 months, reflecting corticospinal maturation and sensorimotor integration. Its development is essential for functional independence, and delays or abnormalities warrant early assessment and intervention. Targeted therapies, including CIMT and occupational therapy, can significantly improve pincer grasp and overall hand function, enhancing quality of life and developmental outcomes.

### Infants' visual recognition of pincer grip emerges between 9 and 12 Months of age [^111QmGfm]. Infancy (2017). Low credibility.

The development of the ability to recognize the whole human body shape has long been investigated in infants, while less is known about their ability to recognize the shape of single body parts, and in particular their biomechanical constraints. This study aimed to explore whether 9- and 12-month-old infants have knowledge of a hand-grasping movement (i.e., pincer grip), being able to recognize violations of the hand's anatomical constraints during the observation of that movement. Using a preferential looking paradigm, we showed that 12-month-olds discriminate between biomechanically possible and impossible pincer grips, preferring the former over the latter (Experiment 1). This capacity begins to emerge by 9 months of age, modulated by infants' own sensorimotor experience with pincer grip (Experiment 2). Our findings indicate that the ability to visually discriminate between pincer grasps differing in their biomechanical properties develops between 9 and 12 months of age, and that experience with self-produced hand movements might help infants in building a representation of the hand that encompasses knowledge of the physical constraints of this body part.

### Primary care framework to monitor preterm infants for neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood [^113CSAfp]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Preterm infants — motor development surveillance and screening — include attention to atypical early milestones and tone that may suggest CP, such as "rolling by arching back at the age of 1 month" and "asymmetry in sitting or crawling without reciprocal movement of all 4 limbs". At the 9-month visit, "recommended screening should ensure that children are able to roll to both sides, sit well without support, demonstrate motor symmetry, and grasp and transfer", and "handedness is unusual before 18 months of age", while "a neat pincer and finger manipulation should be present by 12 months". "Atypical or delayed motor skills should prompt referral to EI services", and at the 18-month well-child visit, screening "identifies typical motor skills that should be achieved, including ability to sit, stand, walk independently, grasp, and manipulate small objects".

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^113px4QR]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

Precision and power grips are superordinate categories. Analysis of grasping behavior has often been more granular. For example, Halverson described infant grasping behavior according to 10 categories, from touching (or not touching) a target object, through using the hand to squeeze or rake the object toward oneself, to grasping it with the palm and eventually with the forefinger and thumb. Touwen used five sub‐categories including palmar grips, radial palmar grips (which include thumb opposition), scissor grips, scissor‐pincer grips, and pincer grips, with the latter three covering the transition from using the inner surfaces of the digits to hold an object, to using the tips of index finger and thumb. Butterworth et al. drew on these earlier works in identifying four sub‐categories each of power and precision grips.

Before precision grasping emerges, the infant first learns to use active thumb opposition, with Halverson noting a "simultaneous budding into prominence" (p. 217) of the forefinger alongside the thumb. This in turn leads to more advanced prehension, like precision grasping. Halverson identified that this ability emerges between approximately six and 8 months of age. Touwen reported a range of five to 9 months for the onset of the radial palmar grip. Butterworth et al. found that the power grip most favored by six‐to eight‐month‐olds was the hand grasp, which does not require thumb opposition. By 12–14 months, the radial palm grasp was the most frequently‐used power grip.

For Halverson, the subsequent transition from using the palm to using the digits independently was a key juncture, signaling the emergence of the precision grip. While some infants in his sample showed this ability at 32 weeks of age (approximately 7.5 months), only at 36 weeks (8.5 months) were precision grips used more than power grips. Touwen reports precision grip emergence from as early as 7 months to as late as 11 months Butterworth et al. found a decrease in power grip use and a yoked increase in precision grip use with age, particularly between the six‐to eight‐ and nine‐to 11‐month‐old age groups. These results suggest that infants begin to use precision grips in the latter half, and typically the latter third, of the first year.

### Mortality by opioid poisoning in children and teenagers and opioid prescriptions [^115zmHhL]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most deaths due to opioid poisoning in children and teenagers were observed in those aged between 15 and 19 years old (Table 1). The seventeen deaths in the 15 to 19 year old group are the lift-off to the rising curve of deaths by opioids, and deaths in the 10 to 14 year old age group also increased over the study period. This may indicate that the upswing of deaths due to opioid poisoning starts in these younger age groups and justifies the need for early recognition, support, and dedicated services for teenagers. The 15 to 19-year-old age group includes young adults, given that a child is defined as a person under the age of 16 years by the Children Acts of Scotland and England. Young adults are a particularly vulnerable group meriting specific care as they transition across from paediatric to adult services. There is a decreasing rate of deaths due to opioid poisoning in children aged one to nine years old, which could be the result of various factors such as: like prescription patterns; support programmes for parents; child protection processes; and primary schools' roles; and education about drug safety.

After adjustment per capita, another small peak was revealed involving children under one year old. Although there were only three deaths in the study period in this age group, this finding merits specific discussion. Infants develop fine motor skills during the first year of life: at five months old, an infant develops a palmar grasp, with a neat pincer grip developing by about at ten months old. Gross motor milestones see the development of crawling and pulling to standing at nine months old and independent walking from nine to 18 months old. These very limited developmental abilities of infants under the age of one year old raise questions as to how they reached, picked up, and ingested opioid preparations, particularly as these are dispensed in childproof containers. The recommendation arising from this study is that all deaths in under one-year olds warrant comprehensive investigation with emphasis on safeguarding issues.

### The development of prospective grasping control between 5 and 7 months: a longitudinal study [^1142ffzf]. Infancy (2005). Low credibility.

By 7 months, infants, when reaching for an object, visually guide their grasp by preorienting their hands to match the object's orientation. Evidence at earlier ages, however, for prospective grasp control via anticipatory hand orientation is mixed. This study examined longitudinally the development of anticipatory hand orientation in 15 infants, seen every 3 weeks between 5 and 7.5 months. On each visit, infants were given 8 trials of reaching for an object oriented vertically and horizontally. Hand orientation at the first point of contact, prior to any tactile feedback, indexed infant prospective grasp. Between 5 and 7 months, infants showed evidence for qualitative transition in prospective control of grasp, supporting the contention that control of grasp shifts from being based on tactual feedback to being visually and therefore prospectively based. Implications for how prospective grasp emerges developmen-tally are discussed.

### Interacting socially with human hands at 24 months of age [^115cfizP]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

This experiment explored whether or not 2-year-olds would engage in synchronic imitation with human hands. Sixty-four 24-month-old infants participated. In a test of synchronic imitation, infants were given a toy while a model simultaneously performed novel actions on an identical toy. Infants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 model conditions: a familiar person, an unfamiliar person, disembodied human hands, and disembodied robotic pincers. Infants were as likely to synchronically imitate disembodied hands as a person. Imitation of the pincers was significantly lower. This pattern suggests that 2-year-olds will engage socially with human hands in the absence of the rest of the body.

### Benefits of newborn screening and hematopoietic cell transplant in infantile Krabbe disease [^112RbRBC]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurologic outcomes

The children (30–58 months old) have varying degrees of developmental delay (supplemental Table 1). All take some nutrition by mouth, and 3 receive supplemental gastrostomy tube feeding. Five independently drink from cups, 4 feed themselves crackers using a pincer grasp, and 2 use utensils. Each can hold, transfer, and manipulate objects, including playing games on tablets/smartphones. One child has > 75 words and uses 1- to 2-word phrases. Another child has 15 to 20 words and > 75 signs; the remaining children use single words or approximations along with signs/gestures. Two children use an augmentative and alternative communication device. All have varying degrees of lower extremity spasticity and weakness that limit ambulation and impact adaptive functioning. One walks independently and can climb, and the other 5 children have some form of locomotion (limited walking with gait trainer, cruising, or crawl/roll for locomotion). All can sit unsupported. Four use self-propelling wheelchairs. Generally, upper body motor function is less impaired than that of the lower body. Anecdotally, the 2 infants enrolled in the experimental protocol (as described in Methods) did not appear to derive any additional clinical benefit from the treatment.

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^113kgERD]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The emergence of functional object use in infancy signals a convergence of motor and cognitive skills. Appropriate use of an object requires that multiple mental representations are accessed — the object must be associated with a specific target or category of targets; there must be a representation of what the object does to that target (its function); and there must be a representation of how to manipulate the object to achieve that function (van Elk et al.). Infants by the end of the first post‐natal year associate functional objects with targets (Hunnius and Bekkering) and mentally represent the effects of using specific tools (Hernik and Csibra; Träuble and Pauen). One step toward learning how to manipulate objects is representing their motor affordances. Around 6 months of age, infants begin to do this, for example forming expectations about how to grasp objects of different shapes (Daum et al.). The ability to form and use thumb‐to‐finger (or precision) grips has been positively related to the ability to predict how another person will grasp an object (Daum et al; Loucks and Sommerville). The aim of the present study was to examine the neural correlates of the perception of others' grasping behavior, with a secondary focus on the effect of infants' own grasping ability.

1.1 The Emergence of Precision Grasping

Grasping is an early‐developing, object‐directed action with a clear goal or end‐state, which makes it ideal as an exemplar for action perception research. The nature of grasping changes throughout infancy, which means that different types of grasping actions can be used to examine how infants' own motor abilities affect their perception of other people's actions (e.g. Daum et al; Daum et al; Loucks and Sommerville). One key transition in grasping behavior is learning to pick things up using the index finger and thumb, a motor milestone typically reached by 12 months of age according to multiple health authorities. 1 This ability is known as the precision grip, and is contrasted with the power grip in which an object is "forcefully clamped between the under‐surface of the fingers and the palm of the hand" (Butterworth et al. 223).

### Beyond the homozygous paradigm: symptomatic partial biotinidase deficiency in a heterozygous child-first case report from Nepal [^113dzwoS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Clinical presentation

An 18-month-old male, born at term via normal vaginal delivery to non-consanguineous parents, with an unremarkable neonatal period, presented to Kanti Children's Hospital with a three-month history of multiple abnormal body movements and developmental regression. The child was exclusively breastfed until six months of age, followed by the gradual introduction of complementary feeding. There was no known family history (Supplementary file S1) of genetic or neurological disorders. Developmental milestones were appropriate until 12 months of age, at which point he was able to stand with support, walk with occasional falls, and attempt independent standing. He demonstrated a mature pincer grasp, responded to his name, engaged in simple ball games, vocalized 1–2 meaningful words, recognized sounds, and oriented toward their source, reflecting a Development Quotient (DQ) of approximately 100, consistent with normal developmental progress at that age.

The first seizure episode occurred at seven months of age and was associated with fever. By 13 months, he had experienced three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). At 12 months, he had an episode of status epilepticus requiring intervention at another center. At 15 months, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at our center due to a lower respiratory tract infection and GTCS. Following this admission, he exhibited significant developmental regression, losing previously acquired motor, cognitive, and social milestones. He was unable to walk independently, creep upstairs, initiate scribbling, speak words, or imitate parental activities. His mother reported that he only adjusted his head position to follow objects instead of actively tracking them. This regression corresponds to a DQ of 50–55, indicating moderate to severe developmental delay.

### The role of motor experience in understanding action function: the case of the precision grasp [^112AL6PM]. Child Development (2012). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests adults and infants selectively attend to features of action, such as how a hand contacts an object. The current research investigated whether this bias stems from infants' processing of the functional consequences of grasps: understanding that different grasps afford different future actions. A habituation paradigm assessed 10-month-old infants' (N = 62) understanding of the functional consequences of precision and whole-hand grasps in others' actions, and infants' own precision grasping abilities were also assessed. The results indicate infants understood the functional consequences of another's grasp only if they could perform precision grasps themselves. These results highlight a previously unknown aspect of early action understanding, and deepen our understanding of the relation between motor experience and cognition.

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^117U745x]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

Grasping is a fundamental skill that enables people to interface with and explore objects around them. The emergence of precision (thumb-to-forefinger) grasping during infancy represents a developmental shift in this skill and has been linked to more advanced action perception, particularly in detecting action incongruencies. In this study, ERPs known to be elicited in response to action were studied in 9- and 11.5-month-old infants as they watched whole-hand and precision grasping actions congruent or incongruent with a target object. Components related to attentional (Nc, P400) and semantic (N400) processes were examined to determine whether infants' perception of grasp is based on attention and recognition, on higher-level representations of action, or a mix of these two levels of processing. Effects of congruence were found for the P400 and the N400. The P400 effect was greater among the older age group. Infants' ability to produce a precision grip did not significantly affect their ERPs in response to actors' incongruent versus congruent grasps, which would have been expected if recognition of incongruous grasping actions were based on motor experience. Results indicate that infant ERPs differ between grasps that are congruent or incongruent with the form of a target object via multiple cognitive processes.

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^116BHN1F]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

The investigation of these components was the primary aim of this work, as they each relate to different aspects of early action processing. However, based on related work, we investigated two additional questions. The first was the effect of age. The previous work showed that the P400 response is present at six months of age (Bakker et al.), and the goal‐related Nc response is present at seven months (Reid et al.). The N400 for actions emerges later, from nine months (Reid et al; Kaduk et al.). However, the effects in these studies were found in response to a familiar action goal (putting food in the mouth). This kind of direct goal perception develops early, e.g. Woodward showed that infants anticipate an actor's goal by 5 months, and Hunnius and Bekkering showed that six‐month‐olds will make anticipatory looks to the target areas of common actions (e.g. looking to the mouth when an actor is holding a cup).

Conversely, encoding and responding to the affordances of how an object is grasped are later‐developing abilities (some but not all infants can do these things by 6 months, Daum et al.), and consequently we might expect ERP responses differentiating actions on the basis of grasp type (vs. grasp direction, Bakker et al.) to emerge later. A nine‐month‐old target age group was selected on the basis that all three of these components are present, at least for goal perception. An 11.5‐month‐old comparison group was selected to find if the components changed over a period in which infants become more experienced with precision grasping (Butterworth et al; Halverson). Reid et al. found a developmental shift in their investigated components over a 2‐month period, with the Nc being present at first and the N400 emerging later. We examined the same, shifting the target ages slightly older on the assumption that the ability to distinguish actions on the basis of means, or the type of grasp used, would be a later emerging ability than distinguishing actions on the basis of goals, or target location.

Toy selection for training dependent on infant's ability

Toy selection is vital for the ability to practise various hand actions. Importantly, toys can be any play objects of interest. When choosing a toy, the infant's age, cognitive level, and motor ability must be taken into consideration. It is important to choose toys and expect motor actions to the appropriate ability level. Young infants or infants with limited motor ability need at first to learn to initiate reaching toward objects. Toys needs to be within their reaching distance to stimulate touching and moving the objects and certain pre-grasping behaviors. To stimulate grasping, easily grasped toys must be presented near the hand that is expected to grasp. When the manual ability of infants become more advanced, they will develop their grasping ability and become interested in exploring objects. At this ability level, infants like to have a lot of toys to explore and numerous grasping actions can easily be promoted. Infants typically explore and manipulate toys and other play objects by banging, fingering, mouthing, slapping, and dropping them. Thereafter, the infants have to refine the quality of grasping and object manipulation. This means that one must give infants a series of small objects to pick up to stimulate precise grasping, well-adapted to the objects' properties. Importantly, the infants have to continue to practice on their ability level. The challenge for therapists is to choose toys and play situation on an appropriate ability level, not to difficult not to easy. Result on the HAI can guide the decisions.

Families are advised to collect toys and play objects for the training sessions in a special basket; these toys should be used only during the training sessions. It is known that new things are more attractive than familiar things and that even young infants are more likely to look at and manipulate novel toys than familiar toys. There should be many toys in the basket in order to promote repetition. To elicit the different motor actions the toys also needs to have different characteristics. Play objects must be of appropriate size and weight according to the infant's grasping ability. Likewise, the toys have to be made of various materials ensuring the infant interest in object exploration. Many objects in the environment are interesting to infants, including necklaces, kitchen utensils, Christmas decorations, soft packages, and natural items such as stones and pinecones. As the infants become older, they must be presented with new toys matching their cognitive level.

### Cord blood haptoglobin, cerebral palsy and death in infants of women at risk for preterm birth: a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^111z6iTV]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Population

We performed a secondary analysis of all the available cord blood samples of babies delivered by mothers enrolled in the multicentre randomised clinical trial of magnesium sulphate for prevention of CP conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD MFMU Network (Identifier:). Inclusion criteria for the original clinical trial, were singletons or twins, GA 24–31 weeks, high risk for spontaneous preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes or advanced cervical dilatation of 4 to 8 cm in the setting of intact membranes, and delivery anticipated within 2–24 h. Exclusion criteria included: birth anticipated within < 2 h, cervical dilatation > 8 cm, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes at < 22 weeks, foetal congenital anomalies or death, hypertension or preeclampsia, contraindications to magnesium sulphate and receipt of intravenous magnesium sulphate within the previous 12 h. Surviving infants underwent neurologic evaluation by an annually certified paediatrician or paediatric neurologist at 6, 12, and 24 months of age (corrected for GA). Infants with a normal neurologic examination at 1 year and who could walk 10 steps independently and had a bilateral pincer grasp were considered normal and did not undergo further physical examinations, although the scheduled neurodevelopmental examination was performed. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^117JbKMm]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

The second additional question, as highlighted earlier, relates to the infants' own action production. Bakker and colleagues found that proficient five‐month‐old graspers showed a difference in their P400 response to grasping actions relative to their less proficient peers. They also found that when presented with hands in a precision grip posture rather than a power grip posture, six‐month‐olds did not show a difference in the P400 response, suggesting that experience is necessary to encode functional differences in hand shape. Consequently, as well as studying infants' responses to precision and whole‐hand grasps that were congruent or incongruent with a target object, we also measured infants' grasping ability to examine its effects on their encoding of others' grasping actions. We anticipated that infants who performed precision grips would show a greater difference in their ERPs to others' congruent and incongruent grasping actions. Although we measured grasping via multiple items, ultimately we narrowed these down to execution of a precision grip as a predictor of action encoding via ERP measures. This reflects the key difference between the grasping actions displayed to the infants, and thus the effects of motor experience on action encoding should be reflected in their ability to perform this grip.

Translation of learning-induced brain plasticity into clinical practice

Early intervention is expected to be important, as neural networks and pathways that remain intact after brain injury can be strengthened through learning-induced plasticity. After Hubel and Wiesel's ground-breaking discoveries of visual system plasticity in the 1970s, Nudo et al. demonstrated that neural activity induces synaptic changes in the sensory and motor cortex. The corticospinal system also experiences ongoing structural change. More recent animal studies have demonstrated that there is a critical period of motor system plasticity, and that activity-dependent reorganisation of the motor-projection pattern to the hand occurs before about 1 year of age. Activity-based training using a model of CIMT synchronised with the development of the corticospinal tract in an animal model of CP restored motor function and induced structural changes in the corticospinal system; this restoration was not found if the intervention was implemented at a higher age. Increased knowledge of early brain plasticity supports increased interest in early intervention and its impact on the development of the hand motor system. In this project, we would like to exploit the great plasticity of the young brain, hypothesising that treatment at an early age will influence the future level of development. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that there are critical periods during human brain development in which treatments are more effective than they would be later on.

Object exploration and manipulation in the first year of life

To evaluate any hand training programme for infants, it is important to have a good understanding of the natural history of hand development in young children. Voluntary action starts to emerge at birth, and von Hofsten has demonstrated that reaching and grasping actions can be detected even in newborns, though it takes some months before grasping actions are obvious and frequent. In the first year of life, infants gradually gain remarkable control over their hands, exploring and manipulating objects with increasing skill. Infants consciously explore objects, typically using the hand nearest an object or both hands together. There is typically no asymmetry or hand preference before about 9 months of age in typically developing children, nor is coordinated bimanual hand use seen until about 8 months of age, when infants start performing more complex sequences, such as removing a lid to grasp a toy. Typically developing infants use both hands equally.

### Caregiver-reported meaningful change in functional domains for individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy: a convergent mixed-methods design [^111ddFRS]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The larger survey included 20 questions on demographics and diagnoses, and 58 questions on development, health, priority domains, and meaningful change, 18 of which requested open‐text responses. Levels of impairment for communication and eating were derived from classification scales used for cerebral palsyand adapted for use in DEEs. These included the Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS). Gross motor function was classified using the Functional Mobility Scale adapted for Rett syndrome. Level of hand function was classified as able to use a pincer grasp, reach and grasp hand‐sized objects, grasp an object if placed in the hand, or unable to grasp objects. Because the CFCS and Functional Mobility Scale are intended for children 2 years and older, parents' descriptions of severe communication or gross motor delay indicated severe impairment for these children. Parents identified the top three of 17 functional, behavioural, or health domains in which they would most like to see improvement, with the option to add additional domains. For each top domain, they described in open text the smallest improvement or step forward in that area that would be important to them or their child (i.e. a 'wish') and explained why that improvement would be important.

### Neural representations of grasp congruence during the emergence of precision grasping [^116BygoZ]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

Within each sequence, the first two images were displayed for pseudo‐randomly determined durations of 0.8–1.2 s (in steps of 100 ms). The final image was displayed for 1 s. A white fixation cross appeared between sequences, in the same location as the cup. Sequences were pseudorandomly selected within Matlab with the rule that the same congruence, the same grasp, and the same actor and cup color could not be shown more than twice in a row. The experiment ended when the infant became inattentive, fussy, or upset. Nine‐month‐olds were shown an average of 61.9 trials (SD = 11.8) and 11.5‐month‐olds were shown 50.7 trials (SD = 21).

Grasping ability has been measured in related work in various ways, including binary classification of a thumb‐opposite or power grasp (Daum et al.), ability to functionally use a precision grasp (Loucks and Sommerville), or a three‐point scale indicating non‐attempts, non‐successful attempts and successful grasps (Bakker et al.). For this study, we include a binary measure of whether the infant used the pads of their fingertips to grasp a small pellet. This task was presented as part of a larger battery of tasks adapted from a developmental scale that was institutionally available (the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, BSID‐II; Bayley). These tasks were performed in a separate room, after the EEG experiment had ended and the EEG cap was removed. Infants sat on their parent's lap at a small table opposite the experimenter who presented the items to be grasped (see Supporting Information S1 for further details). Videos from 10 randomly selected infants were coded by a second scorer naïve to the purpose of the study, for a total of 60 double‐coded items reflecting the entire battery of items including precision grip production. Agreement between scorers was 90%, with a Cohen's kappa score indicating substantial agreement, κ = 0.77.

1.2 Effects of Precision Grasping on Action Perception

Although the distinction between types of grasping in this literature has been granular, comparing infants' action perception on the basis of grasping ability has often required a binary distinction between precision graspers and non‐precision graspers. For example, Daum et al. examined infants' preference for looking at a grasping outcome that matched or didn't match the hand shape used in the preceding action. Specifically, a hand was shown reaching behind an occluder with the thumb held opposite the fingers, with either a wide or narrow gap between the thumb and fingers. Subsequently, they compared infants' looking to images with the occluder removed and either the wide‐shaped hand holding the side of a mug, or the narrow‐shaped hand holding its handle. They found longer looking times to the mismatched, or unexpected, action end‐state in both six‐ and nine‐month‐old infants (Daum et al.).

They also examined whether six‐month‐olds could grasp a small object with thumb opposition, using the four precision grip subcategories from Butterworth et al. as well as one of the power grip subcategories (radial palm grasp) in which the thumb is used in opposition to the index finger (Daum et al.). Six‐month‐olds who used thumb opposition looked longer at the unexpected outcome; those who did not use thumb opposition looked equally long at each outcome. While not a perfect reflection of the motor distinction in the stimuli, in which thumb opposition was always present, these results show how the progression of infants' grasping ability alters how they encode other people's object‐related actions.

Another example comes from Loucks and Sommerville who found that 10‐month‐olds who used a precision grip to retrieve a toy from a small container were sensitive to both the type of grip (whole‐hand 2 vs. precision) used by another person, and to whether that grip was functional for picking up a target object. Those who did not engage in precision grasping were sensitive only to the type of grip. This body of work indicates how infants' ability to physically manipulate objects affects their perception of others' actions. In the present study, we employed event‐related potentials (ERPs) to investigate infants' encoding of other people's grasping actions, and the relation to infants' own precision grasping ability.

Focus areas for training

Hand use is based on the assumption that grasping abilities help the infants to explore their environment Development of manual dexterity and different aspects of hand-eye coordination in infants are essential elements of cognitive development. Motor skills and mental processing are developed in conjunction with each other, and both processes are essential for exploring toys. Exciting toys chosen to suit the child's developmental level and level of hand function will stimulate the child to perform self-initiated actions. Activities on the right level for the child will be important, and for the youngest children and children at the lowest ability level, actions as simple as reaching out to touch their mother's nose could be meaningful. With the child's increasing awareness and fine motor development, grasping becomes possible to practice. This provides the opportunity for object exploration, and objects with different properties trigger different hand actions. By using objects with different properties like shape, size, density, and texture, mental processing will be stimulated and will increase the child's ability to perform repetitions of various actions. With development, children will be stimulated to perform more goal-directed play including simple sequences, like pulling things out of boxes and putting them back in and using both hands in a coordinated manner, for example, to pull things apart. The experience of activities and repetition promotes motor skills as well as higher-order problem-solving skills and leads to more advanced actions. To facilitate hand use, a position that is as upright as possible should be used, and if needed adjustable baby seats and chairs should be used. Most importantly, posture and hand use should not be trained at the same time because insecure posture will influence object exploration. Practice will be centred on the child's major problems, and this might be motor problems for some children while it might be a lack of interest in object exploration that is the limitation for others. For all children, there is a need to continuously increase variation in object exploration to promote cognitive development.

### What assessments evaluate use of hands in infants? A literature review [^111JnVWH]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify assessments, applicable to infants aged 3 months to 12 months, measuring hand function, and to discuss their usefulness in assessing infants at risk of developing unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).

Method

Instruments described in two previous systematic reviews were scrutinized for inclusion of fine motor components. Additionally, a new literature search was performed in Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, and Cinahl (2007–2013) to identify newly developed assessments of infant motor functioning.

Results

Five assessments from the two previous systematic reviews included fine motor components but only three provided separate measures of fine motor performance: the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales — version 2 (PDMS-2), the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development — version III, and the Posture and Fine Motor Assessment of Infants, each of which provided measures of the preferred hand only. From 531 papers retrieved, 10 new assessments were found, three of which met our inclusion criteria: the Infant Motor Profile (IMP), the Grasping and Reaching Assessment of Brisbane (GRAB), and the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI). Only the GRAB and the HAI provide measures relevant for assessing infants at risk of developing unilateral cerebral palsy; however, both measures are still under construction.

Interpretation

No currently available assessment for infants aged 3 to 12 months old measures aspects of hand function suitable for quantifying asymmetry between hands or quality of bimanual performance.

Primitive reflexes are typically present in childhood, suppressed during normal development, and may reappear with diseases of the brain, particularly those affecting the frontal lobes. In this review we discuss some historical aspects surrounding these reflexes, how they might be elicited and interpreted, and their potential clinical utility in modern neurological practice.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^111mYvS8]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The rationale for dividing the intervention program into the three focus areas of hand use, mobility, and communication is to facilitate the learning process within each area. Typically, a child learns a lot within each area during the first year of life, and each focus area includes a huge amount of competence for parents as the training providers to capture. There is a limited amount of time during the day when a small child can attend to practice because caring and sleeping usually predominate their days. By introducing specific foci, we intend to help the family to optimize the training and to use their time as efficiently as possible. The hand-use focus will be used to help the child explore their external world through object manipulation, and this creates an important link to the child's cognitive development. Knowledge about fine motor development and object exploration will guide the introduction of new activities. Voluntary action starts to emerge at birth, and von Hofsten and Lindhagen have demonstrated that reaching and grasping actions can be detected even in new-borns, though it takes some months before grasping actions are obvious and frequent. In the first year of life, infants gradually gain remarkable control over their hands, and they begin exploring and manipulating objects with increasing skill. The mobility focus will be used to reach new gross motor ability goals with the overall aim that children should be able to move about and explore their external world on their own. This includes activities like maintaining and changing body position, sitting and standing, and any other form of mobility. The principles for reaching goals will be based on matching the child's present capacity and environment with the target actions. As a consequence, motor learning will not be expected to occur in the same order as in children with typical development. However, we do expect accelerated motor development to occur because there is a rapid pace during the first year of life during typical development. The communication focus will be used to enhance sensitive parental communication strategies that support child-centred interactions and child initiatives. The infants' early communication skills will cover a wide range of behaviours such as crying, body movements, gestures, and directed gaze. These communication signals are the foundation for later linguistic skills and cognitive development. An important landmark to develop is shared focus or joint attention, i.e. the mutual attention between the infant and the parent. A particularly important form of joint attention is triadic engagement in which the infant can alternate his/her gaze between the parent and an outside object or event. Joint attention forms both a cognitive as well as a socio-emotional foundation for the child's learning during activities and for their inter-personal engagement. Raising awareness of the child's communicative attempts and learning to respond and maintain communication will guide the training.

### A pre-registered sticky mittens study: active training does not increase reaching and grasping in a Swedish context [^113T5onQ]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

With these inconsistencies in mind we believe it is important to replicate the sticky mittens paradigm. There is also a need to assess how infants respond to this training procedure in a non‐US sample. The current study aims to re‐examine the effects on infant motor development following two weeks of sticky mittens training in a Swedish sample. Previously, van den Berg and Gredebäck recommended more replications of the training and that future sticky mittens studies should be pre‐registered and analyze detailed motion tracking data (e.g. movement units, grasp aperture, and grasp preparation) in order to find clearer and more robust effects. This study follows all of these recommendations. In a pre‐registered, intent‐to‐treat, study, 3‐month‐old infants were assigned to one of three conditions: sticky mittens, observational, or no training. Although we only report on the motor effects of sticky mittens training, it is important to note that this study was a conceptual replication of the entire sticky mittens work. This includes the work on motor development, attention abilities, and social perception. Consequently, the ages in the current study were not matched to the ages in one specific sticky mittens study but to the age of the combined sticky mittens studies (i.e. 3 months of age). Whereas prior work has relied on video coding of reach and grasp proficiency, this is the first pre‐registered sticky mittens study to analyze detailed reach and grasp kinematics using high precision motion tracking technology in order to assess the detailed development of reaching and grasping prior to and following sticky mittens training. Our hypothesis, at the time of pre‐registration, was that infants in the sticky mittens condition (but not the other conditions) would show increased motor performance following training. Specifically, we predicted a decrease in movement units (von Hofsten& Lindhagen, 1979), an increase in grasp aperture, and an earlier grasp initiation before object contact from pre‐test to post‐test (von Hofsten & Rönnqvist). Grasping abilities typically emerge 4 weeks after reaching abilities emerge (von Hofsten & Lindhagen). However, if the training were found to be successful, we would expect that grasping abilities emerge sooner than would be expected in typical development. This study was planned, pre‐registered, and conducted, but not analyzed, prior to the review by van den Berg and Gredebäck that expresses concern about the presence of a sticky mittens effect in the motor domain.

### Early developmental trajectories of the impaired hand in infants with unilateral cerebral palsy [^111U78z2]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical profile of infants in each trajectory group mirrors our previous findings. The ability to grasp by 6 months of age is a clinical feature distinguishing the three groups, with the low‐functioning group demonstrating early small movements of the impaired upper limb developing to the inconsistent ability to contact, but not grasp, toys/objects. This suggests that very early intervention should focus on training the acquisition of grasp, since grasp by 6 months is strongly predictive of long‐term outcomes. In addition, the acquisition of grasp by 6 months could be a potentially important biomarker and outcome indicator for very early intervention studies. By 5 months of age, the profile of the moderate‐functioning group was distinctly different to the low‐functioning group, with the moderate group starting to develop active grasping of toys/objects, at a similar age as the previous study. It is possible that the low‐functioning group requires a different approach to early intervention. This might include different ways to help infants learn strategies to enhance successful experiences with their affected hand. Although the high‐functioning group had the ability to grasp by 6 months of age, upper limb function in this high‐functioning group remained greater than two standard deviations below the normative sample throughout infancy. We have now extended on these findings to evaluate later bimanual performance and cognitive functioning at 24 months corrected age. Our findings still demonstrate that there are still significant differences between trajectory groups at 12 to 15 months and 24 months corrected age. The significantly poorer performance on the Bayley‐III cognitive domain at 12 to 15 months was not evident at 24 months. This requires further exploration, as it is unclear if and how cognition impacts an infant's ability to use two hands together in early play.

### Early developmental trajectories of the impaired hand in infants with unilateral cerebral palsy [^112L1q91]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
There are three distinct trajectories of impaired hand development for infants with unilateral cerebral palsy.
Infants born closer to term age and males are at greater risk of being in a low‐functioning group.
A low‐functioning group demonstrated little improvement in hand function over time, despite receiving early upper limb therapy.

Infants with early asymmetric brain lesions or malformation are at risk of developing unilateral cerebral palsy (CP), where motor impairment is most apparent on the side contralateral to the brain lesion. Upper limb function is typically more affected than gross motor function. Deviation in early reaching, grasp, later manipulation, and bimanual skills are evident from 4 to 5 months post term age. Hand function and manual ability are strongly associated with later independence in activities of daily living.

An international clinical practice guideline recommended the use of a suite of evidence‐based assessments to enable an accurate and early diagnosis of CP between 3 months and 12 months of age. In high‐income countries, adoption of these recommendations has seen the timing of diagnosis of high risk of CP reduce to between 4.4 to 9.5 months from 19 months of age. Earlier diagnosis has enabled evaluation of early interventions targeting hand function in the first year of life.,

Few studies have explored development of hand function of infants with unilateral CP. A number of studies in older children have investigated the trajectory of development of bimanual performance using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), and found improvements in spontaneous use of the impaired hand between 18 months and 18 years. All studies show that children with the poorest hand function at 18 months of age demonstrate a slower rate of development, peaking between 5 to 8 years, while the highest functioning children peak earlier, at 2 years 6 months to 3 years. These results collectively highlight the importance of early intervention to promote hand skill development for infants at high risk of unilateral CP.

We have previously described three trajectories of development of hand function based on repeated measurement on the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) between 3 to 12 months of age for 97 infants with unilateral CP. The largest trajectory group was a 'low functioning' group comprising 46% of the cohort. No associations between type of brain lesion, gestational age, or participation in motor interventions with trajectory group membership were found. One limitation of that study was that not all included infants received early targeted upper limb therapy and we were unable to determine how trajectory group membership impacted 2‐year upper limb and cognitive outcomes.

### Study protocol: an early intervention program to improve motor outcome in preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial and a qualitative study of physiotherapy performance and parental experiences [^116F8yoE]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Alberta Infant Motor Scale

The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) examines delayed and abnormal motor development in infants over time and is valid for assessment from term until 18 months of age. The test, selected because of good psychometric properties, is quick to administer with limited handling and focuses on both achievement of motor milestones and quality of posture and movement outcomes. The age of testing is done at approximately the same time within the one-month normative window for all children at three, six and 12 months CA, i.e. the test is performed as close to the middle of the age window as possible. Pin and colleagues demonstrated the sensitivity of the AIMS items to differences in preterm infant motor development that typically result in lower scores for preterm than for full term infants.

Peabody Developmental Motor Scales

The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS-2) assesses both fine and gross motor function. The test is valid from term through five years of age. PDMS-2 consists of six subtests e.g. Reflexes, Stationary, Locomotion, Object Manipulation, Grasping and Visual-Motor Integration. The results of the subtests may be used to generate three global indices of motor performance. These composites are Gross Motor Quotient, Fine Motor Quotient and Total Motor Quotient. The three composites of the PDMS-2 exhibit high test-retest reliability and acceptable responsiveness to intervention effects. The test is suitable to use as a motor measure for children with CP at two years of age.

Data collection

Both the intervention group and the control group receive standard medical and nursing care while hospitalized. The Newborn Individualized Development Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) forms the principal approach in the NICU. In addition the intervention group receives the handling and facilitation program. The nurses are not blinded for the group assignment because it is impossible to prevent them from observing the parents providing the intervention protocol. However, we discussed prior to the initiation of the study the need to refrain from applying the intervention to any infants in the NICU.

After discharged from the hospitals, infants from both groups return for the follow up at the Hospitals' outpatient clinics. If the pediatrician and the physiotherapist assessing the infant judge additional physiotherapy to be needed after discharge, individuals will be referred to therapy independent of group assignment. The physiotherapist in the outpatient clinic records information if infants receive physiotherapy after discharge from the Hospital.

### Typical and atypical development of reaching and postural control in infancy [^116aZPuG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Successful reaching requires postural control, either by active regulation or by postural support. The present paper reviews literature on typical and atypical development of reaching and postural control during infancy. Typically, reaching movements end in grasping around 4 months of age. Initially, reaches are characterized by large variation, including many trajectory corrections. During the first year, the movements get increasingly straight and smooth. Reaching in low-risk preterm infants is initially characterized by advanced development, but minor impairments may emerge in the second half of infancy. In high-risk preterm infants, development of reaching is characterized by delay and non-optimal reaching performance. Typical development of postural adjustments is characterized by variation and an increasing ability to adapt the variable repertoire to the specifics of the situation. The latter is facilitated by an increasing role of anticipatory mechanisms in the second half of infancy. Atypically developing infants may have a reduced repertoire and usually have difficulties in adapting postural adjustments. In infancy, most reaching movements are performed during sitting. The postural challenge of sitting may interfere in particular with the development of reaching in atypically developing infants. The practical implications of this suggestion are discussed.

### Ribonuclease inhibitor 1 (RNH1) deficiency cause congenital cataracts and global developmental delay with infection-induced psychomotor regression and anemia [^1139DEco]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient II:8

This 17-month-old female was the younger sibling of patient II:7. Pregnancy and delivery were normal. She was born after 41 + 2 weeks of gestation. The birth weight was 3370 g (−0.5 SD), length 48 cm (−1 SD), head circumference 36 cm (+0.8 SD) and APGAR scores 9-10-10. Ophthalmological investigations at an age of 2 weeks revealed bilateral exophoria and bilateral cataracts, the latter was operated at 5 weeks of age. Growth was normal and she had no malformations.

The global development was delayed. At 1 and 3 months of age, clinical examinations revealed a suspicious neck hypotonia. At 5 months of age, she had multi-syllable babbling while clinical examination showed a tent-shaped mouth, a small chin and bilateral exophoria. The patellar tendon reflexes were normal. There was muscular hypotonia with head lag and extended arms on a traction test and she was unable to fully balance her head in an upright position. She could partially take support on her legs in the standing position, lift her head with weight on her forearms in prone position and roll over from prone to supine position. She could grasp with both hands and move objects to her mouth. She had an increased CSF-level of NFL to 1530 ng/L (ref < 380). A brain MRI at 8 months of age showed symmetrically increased T2 signal in thalamus, globus pallidus and in patchy cortical/subcortical fronto-parietal, paramedian and occipital areas (Fig. 1G–I). Proton spectroscopy in basal ganglia and cerebral white matter was normal. At 1 year of age, she could laugh and say single words in Somali. She could sit for short periods without support and roll to one side but not ambulate. She was weak in her shoulders and arms and unable to extend her arms against gravity. She had bilateral pincer grasp and pulled herself actively to sitting on the traction test. At 17 months of age, she could walk with manual support, but developmental levels and neurological examinations were otherwise unchanged without signs of catch-up compared to her 1-year examination indicating developmental stagnation.

### Growth diagrams for individual finger strength in children measured with the RIHM [^113cCo3v]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Power grip and pinch grip are important and functionally relevant motor skills of the hand. Generally, motor skills of the hand are regulated using intrinsic and extrinsic muscle groups. In the case of grip or pinch, a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic hand muscle strength is used and a large number of joints are involved. As a result, regular instruments for measuring hand function, such as grip and pinch dynamometers, measure a combination of muscle groups and joints. However, in some situations, it can be important to measure strength of specific thumb and finger movements to determine improvements after hand-related interventions. For example, direct measurement of opposition strength of a hypoplastic thumb after applying a specific tendon transfer to this thumb may provide more specific information than when measuring grip strength.

The Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM) can measure the strength of the individual fingers or thumb at a specific joint. Although grip and pinch measurements provide more general information, the RIHM reliably measures individual finger and thumb strength more directly. Generally, when treating children whose hand function is affected, accurately monitoring their hand strength development with time provides insight regarding whether the treatment is effective. At present, no normative values for the strength measurement of the individual fingers and thumb have been presented for children. Because normative values presented in a classic table format are difficult to use, an alternative would be to use a growth diagram in which strength is plotted against age. This approach to reference values in children would allow for easier discrimination between the effects of growth, neuromuscular maturation, and the intervention. Using growth diagrams where an increase or decrease of strength can be plotted easily with time facilitates an intuitive and easily interpretable way of using reference values, whereas variation in strength can be accounted for using the correct percentiles. Similar growth diagrams for length and weight are widely used at infant welfare centers across the world. We recently developed these same diagrams for grip strength. These strength development diagrams provide an immediate indication of the strength that can be expected at the child's age using a continuous age scale, in contrast to reference tables with 1-year or 2-year intervals.

We therefore (1) present reference values of individual finger and thumb strengths and (2) present them in the form of growth diagrams, providing an easy way to distinguish between the effects of growth and intervention on strength development.

### AAV gene therapy for hereditary spastic paraplegia type 50: a phase 1 trial in a single patient [^111uF9oJ]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

SPG50 is an ideal candidate disease for gene therapy. The coding sequence is small (1,359 base pairs) and fits within a self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) vector. Causative mutations result in loss of expression/function, so gene re-expression is anticipated to be effective, and the nature of the AP-4 complex as an obligate heterotetramer may protect against overexpression-related toxicity. There is a relatively large therapeutic window, as disease progression occurs over years, with potential for functional benefit likely before irreversible disability. However, the disorder's rarity precludes typical drug development pathways.

We present a case wherein gene therapy was developed for a single male patient with SPG50 (Fig. 1a). The disease was diagnosed at age 18 months by whole-exome sequencing (AP4M1 c.916 C > T, p.R306X; c.696dupG, p.E232GfsX21) based on a presentation of developmental delay (unable to stand or walk independently, no word production) and microcephaly. At diagnosis, based on our international registry, the proband was the only Canadian individual with SPG50. Shortly after diagnosis, the family created the CureSPG50 Foundation with the goal of developing SPG50 gene therapy. At the predosing baseline, the patient could crawl 5 feet, pull himself up to stand momentarily at a table and walk a few steps with assistance. He had a pincer grasp and could feed himself with his hands, stack two blocks and scribble. He was nonverbal and had limited communication with gestures and nonword sounds. Physical examination was most notable for diffuse spasticity (lower extremity more affected than upper extremity) and hyperreflexia.

### A pre-registered sticky mittens study: active training does not increase reaching and grasping in a Swedish context [^114QmEYV]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

With our kinematic reaching data, we can safely conclude that sticky mittens training does not improve the ability to reach or the microstructure of reaching. This is further confirmed by the 4‐step reaching task that has been used in many sticky mittens studies. The mittens allow infants to observe the outcome of a reach, which would make them more interested in reproducing this grasping outcome. Even in the absence of a positive effect on manual reaching and grasping behavior, infants may be developing new manual strategies that cannot be measured with the current tasks. While our results lead us to conclude that reaching and grasping skills (i.e. motor control) are not impacted by sticky mittens training, other developmental changes are possible and cannot be excluded based on the current results.

Another possibility is that the infants in this study were too mature to benefit from the training. On average, infants in this study were 2 weeks older (13 weeks at pre‐test) than infants in some prior sticky‐mittens studies that used the same parent‐implemented reaching training over a period of 2 weeks. These infants might have had more advanced reaching abilities, which would limit their learning process. However, from the first week of life until the age of 13 weeks, infants already show some reaching behaviors. Although there is within‐infant variability in reaching in this period, the average number of reaches does not increase in this period. A large increase in average reaching is observed when infants are 16 weeks old (von Hofsten). These typical abilities were also present at pre‐test in Libertus and Needham. Moreover, other studies have successfully demonstrated sticky mittens effects with infants older than 13 weeks (Bakker et al; Gerson & Woodward; Skerry et al.). Thus, it is unlikely that the infants' age could have negatively influenced training effects. This interpretation is supported by the current results. Adding age in days as a covariate did not alter the results in any way. However, we acknowledge that this study cannot rule out the effect of age on the effectiveness of the sticky mittens training.

### Homozygous deletion of tenascin-R in a patient with intellectual disability [^115QtrRJ]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

The patient demonstrated opisthotonic posturing several times a day beginning at 4–6 weeks of age. Episodes were more frequent and pronounced during crying and sometimes associated with breath-holding spells. They seldom occurred during sleep, and there were no other abnormal movements or episodes of altered consciousness to suggest seizures. General examination was unremarkable except for a mild synophrys, low-set ears and a right parietal hair whorl. Neurological examination revealed diffuse hyperreflexia. Clonazepam was given, resulting in modest improvement of the opisthotonic posturing. Treatment with levodopa and diphenhydramine did not resolve episodes.

The patient's opisthotonic posturing subsided between 9 and 16 months of age. She then developed choreoathetoid movements in the hands and legs, which resolved by age 4 years. The patient had global developmental delay. She crawled at 30 months, walked at 36 months, used a pincer grasp just before 2 years and started making 2–3-word sentences at 4 years. Examination consistently revealed axial hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis and hyperreflexia. She developed scoliosis, which was treated with nightly use of braces. She acquired microcephaly with a head circumference just below the 2nd percentile.

Head and cervical spine MRI at 3 months of age revealed mild hypoplasia of the inferior cerebellar vermis, but otherwise normal structure and myelination. A comprehensive workup for metabolic disorders including urine purines and pyrimidines, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amino-acids, urine organic acids and orotic acid, and a white blood cell enzymatic screen for β-galactocerebrosidase, β-galactosidase, β-mannosidase, α-L-fucisidase, β-hexosaminidaseA, arylsulfataseA and glucocerebrosidase was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitter profile and karyotype were unremarkable. Auditory brainstem responses, visual evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and initial EEG were normal. Electromyography was unremarkable except for signs of chronic muscle disuse. An EEG at 2 years showed spike and wave complexes over the right centrotemporal area, though the patient never developed clinical seizures.

5 Tourette's Disorder Pediatric Patients The recommended dosage range for Tourette's Disorder is 5 to 20 mg/day. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day with a target dose of 5 mg/day after 2 days. The dose can be increased to 10 mg/day in patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually at intervals of no less than 1 week. For patients weighing 50 kg or more, dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day for 2 days, and then increased to 5 mg/day for 5 days, with a target dose of 10 mg/day on day 8. The dose can be increased up to 20 mg/day for patients who do not achieve optimal control of tics. Dosage adjustments should occur gradually in increments of 5 mg/day at intervals of no less than 1 week. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

### Infants in control-evidence for agency in 6-to 10-months-old infants in a gaze-contingent eye tracking paradigm [^112vJKAF]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

In sum, contingency paradigms, like the mobile paradigm, have produced evidence that infants from very early in life are able to learn multisensory contingencies, which affect their movements. However, these studies do not allow conclusions about infants' control over their bodily movement and thus cannot answer the question of what extent infants are agents.

To test the development of infants' motor control, a different line of research investigated infants' reaching and grasping abilities, and the extent to which they adapt these motions to changing difficulty levels (Adolph and Robinson; Gottwald; von Hofsten). For example, Gottwald measured infants' arm velocity when picking up an object and moving it to a container. By changing the distances to and size of the container, they showed that 14‐month‐olds adjust the velocity of their motion depending on the task difficulty. To encourage infants to perform the grasping movements, their caregiver demonstrated the exact same movement to them multiple times. These findings leave open the question to what extent infants can flexibly adapt and control actions, beyond movements anchored in their motor repertoire (such as grasping) and, independently of imitating another agent.

Furthermore, infants in the above studies on motor control were 14 months or older. Indeed, the development of reaching and grasping is protracted compared to other modalities, like vision. While infants first begin to reach for and grasp stationary objects between 4 and 6 months (Adolph and Robinson; von Hofsten), these movements remain fairly clumsy until their second year of life when infants begin to prospectively control their limb movements (Gottwald et al.). This protracted development of prospective limb motion control is preceded by prospective shifts of eye movements which already emerge by 3–4 months of age (Canfield and Kirkham). By 9–10 months of age, infants show developing degrees of inhibitory control over their eye movements (Oakes et al.). Therefore, to study the earliest development of agentic control, a shift from gross motor development to an earlier developing modality such as eye movement is warranted.

### A pre-registered sticky mittens study: active training does not increase reaching and grasping in a Swedish context [^113v7n2R]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

Participants

Ninety‐six participants (51 females) from the Uppsala, Sweden, region visited the lab at the age of 3 months (see Table 1 for demographics). Infants were selected via the Uppsala university infant database, which infants entered through a letter that was sent out to parents at 2 months. This was followed‐up by a phone call at 3 months in which information about the study was provided and parents were asked to participate. Data were collected in a university city (February–October 2019) with high levels of education. Infants came from households with a medium to high socio‐economic status and most parents visiting the lab typically had academic backgrounds. Although there was no official record of ethnicity, the participants were predominantly White, with only a few exceptions (African, South Asian, and Middle Eastern). The exact number of non‐White families (and other details) is unknown as the Uppsala Child and Baby Lab does not allow an official examination of these type of data. Parents received 480 days of parental leave per child, which were to be taken out by both parents. The pre‐registered sample size rationale was based on Libertus and Needham, but was confirmed by a power analysis prior to data collection but outside of the pre‐registration. An a priori power analysis was conducted in G*Power (Faul et al.). The power analysis (assuming two‐tailed alpha = .05, an F ‐statistic, and an effect size of d = 0.40) indicated that a total sample of 57 infants, with three equally sized groups of 19 infants in each condition, would yield sufficient power of.80. The sample size was set to 96 infants in order to increase power and maintain sufficient power to account for potential dropouts. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three training conditions: sticky mittens, observational, and no training. In total, two participants (one in sticky mittens and another in the no training condition) were born prematurely. Exclusion of these participants did not change the results. One participant did not complete the training (observational condition) but returned for a second visit. Two participants did not return for a second visit (one sticky mittens condition, one observational condition). The data of two participants (one sticky mittens condition, one observational condition) were lost due to technical difficulties. Following our pre‐registered intent‐to‐treat protocol, no infants were excluded from the study and analyses were conducted without replacing missing observations. Parents gave their written consent before participation and received gift vouchers worth approximately €10 for each visit to the lab. In accordance with the 1964 declaration of Helsinki, the study obtained ethics approval from the local ethics review committee.

### The relation of unimanual and bimanual reaching to crossing the midline [^114tmK6u]. Child Development (2002). Low credibility.

The present study assessed the development of reaching for objects positioned in front of the contralateral shoulder. In particular, it examined how the development of crossing the midline is related to the development of bimanual reaching. Twenty infants were observed longitudinally at 12, 18, and 26 weeks of age while reaching for two balls (3 cm and 8 cm in diameter) located at three positions (ispsilateral, midline, and contralateral). The reaches were analyzed from video recordings. With age, the infants increasingly adapted the number of hands used to the size of the object. The number of reaches crossing the body midline increased with age. Furthermore, the majority of the midline crossings were part of two-handed reaches for the large ball and occurred at or after onset of bimanual reaching. Together, these findings strongly suggest that the development of crossing the body midline emerges in the context of bimanual reaching. It was concluded that the need to grasp a large ball positioned contralaterally with two hands induces midline crossing. Hence, the development of midline crossings is not exclusively dependent on organismic constraints (e.g., the maturation of hemispheric connections), but rather on their interaction with environmental constraints (e.g., object size).

Assessments for general development

PDMS-2 is a standard measurement that assesses gross and fine motor skills in young children from birth through age 5. The PDMS-2 is composed of six subtests that assess related motor abilities that develop early in life. In this study, the Object Manipulation, Grasping, and Visual-Motor Integration subtests will used. The scores on these subtests are presented as percentiles, standard scores, and age equivalents, and the results are used to generate a composite score – the Fine Motor Quotient.

Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) is a standard measurement to assess the fine and gross motor development, the receptive and expressive language development, and the cognitive development of infants and toddlers ages 0–3 years. This measure consists of a series of developmental play tasks and takes between 45 and 60 min to administer. Raw scores of successfully completed items are converted to scale scores and to composite scores. These scores are used to determine the child's performance compared with norms taken from typically developing children of the same age in months.

Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) is a method to estimate the neurological development of infants aged 2–24 months. It includes three sections: 1) Neurological Exam – tone and movements, 2) Development of Motor Function – head control, sitting, walking, crawling, rolling, and grasping, and 3) State of Behavior – consciousness, social orientation, and emotional state. An optimality score is obtained by calculating the distribution of the frequency of the scores in the normal population. The overall score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 78. At 9 or 12 months, scores of 73 and greater are regarded as optimal and below 73 as suboptimal, while at 3 and 6 months healthy term infants have median scores equal to or greater than 67 and 70, respectively.

Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) identifies infants aged 0–18 months who are delayed or deviant in motor development. It is an observational assessment that identifies the gross motor performance of an infant compared to a norm-referenced sample. There are 58 items related to prone, supine, sitting, and standing positions, and the results are reported in a composite score. AIMS has good psychometric properties and has been specially investigated for use with preterm infants.

### Efficacy of baby-CIMT: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial on infants below age 12 months, with clinical signs of unilateral CP [^111HgAXU]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Participants

Infants are eligible to enter the study based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) 3–8 months of age, corrected age (CA) being used for preterm infants, and 2) clinical signs of asymmetric hand use, confirmed by the asymmetry score on the primary outcome measure HAI. Exclusion criteria will be severe visual impairment, seizures not controlled by antiepileptic drugs, and children with clinical signs of bilateral involvement.

Inclusion at 3–4 months of age is based on typical infant development of self-initiated actions. Before this age, self-initiated actions are difficult to measure and hand asymmetries difficult to detect using HAI. Information from HAI video-recordings indicates that, at this age, infants begin to be interested in the test toys; at 3–4 months, the children's grasping ability is still limited but their interest in handling toys is increasing, making it possible to initiate baby-CIMT. Children will be included no later than at 8 months of age because the protocol lasts 18 weeks and the intervention is intended to finish before the children are 1 year old.

At 1 year of age, or 1 year CA, the children will be examined by a paediatric neurologist. Children who meet the Surveillance for Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) criteria at this time will be diagnosed as likely having unilateral CP. The diagnosis will be based on a neurological examination and thorough history, including aspects of fine and gross motor development and information regarding neonatal events. Preterm birth, neonatal stroke, asphyxia, or other incidents such as meningitis or insults after early heart surgery will be considered. If known, we will also consider brain imaging results indicating conditions such as predominantly unilateral haemorrhage or early signs of white matter damage of immaturity (WMDI), neonatal stroke, and malformations. The CP diagnosis and subtype will be updated as other symptoms may appear later.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^112sMSVo]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Therapy

The aim of treatment is to create a deep, first web, to treat and prevent nail bed infections, to correct the position and length of the thumb and to divide the fingers to improve the pincer grip.

Upton advises early treatment of macerations and nail bed infections, approximately at the age of 1 to 6 months. Experience has shown that this is an important problem for very young Apert patients, but specific numbers cannot be found in the literature.

Literature is conclusive about the necessity for an early initial web release in type 3 hands. Fereshetianperforms web release in between 3 and 6 months in type 3 hands, Zuckerand Fearonat 6 months, and Gueroin between 6 and 9 months. Gueroadvocates a bilateral correction as well.

In general, it is advised to separate the remaining fingers between the ages of 6 and 18 months.–

Corrective osteotomy of the thumbs is recommended at the age of 2 to 2.5 years by Chang, at 4 to 6 years by Fereshetian, at 6 to 9 years by Fearon, and at 4 to 6 years by Upton.

Corrective osteotomy of the fingers is recommended at between ages 4 and 7 years,6 and 9 years, and from 7 years.

In Mathes's textbook entitled Plastic Surgery, Uptonprovides a general overview of the treatment and timing of Apert hands (Table 18):

Regarding the outcome of the hand functions at a later age, Upton reports that in general the first web is shallow, the fingers short and stiff, but that the strength of the pincer grip is almost normal. Strength of the grip function is 30% of the normal value as a result of the lack of IP movement of the second, third, and fourth finger and distal IP movement of the fifth finger. For type 3 hands the release of the MC synostosis provides the most important functional improvement by enabling the thumb-pink pincer grip.

Literature about the treatment of feet deformities in Apert syndrome is considerably rarer than that about hand deformities. Fearon sometimes recommends corrective osteotomy to the head of MC 2 when this is prominent at the plantar side of the foot. The aim is to have a smooth underside. Usually specially adapted footwear is sufficient for adequate function, without surgical treatment. In case of problems, a combination of specially adapted footwear and surgical correction of prominent MC heads and/or excessive callus formation is indicated to obtain maximum functionality.

### The effects of environmental enrichment in infants with or at high risk of cerebral palsy: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tkyWa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

EE interventions appear to have a beneficial effect on motor development, although the magnitude of improvement may vary across studies. This positive impact is likely attributable to the way enriched environments support key physiological and behavioral processes. Motor development is closely linked to both the maturation of the nervous system and the development of the musculoskeletal system. An enriched environment offers infants increased opportunities for environmental exploration, balance and coordination activities, social interaction, voluntary movements, and sensory integration. These experiences collectively stimulate neuromuscular activity and promote the practice and enhancement of muscle strength and coordination. Notably, our findings suggest that infants between 6 and 18 months of age exhibited the most pronounced improvements in response to EE interventions, indicating that this developmental window may represent a particularly sensitive period for environmental stimulation. This effect may be because motor development is inherently age-related. The period from 6 to 18 months of age is critical for the development of key motor skills, including reaching and grasping, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking independently. This finding also aligns well with the observed benefits of EE interventions on gross motor function, as many of these skills fall under the category of gross motor development. However, no significant improvement in fine motor function was observed following EE interventions. Several potential explanations may account for this finding. First, fine motor function often matures later than gross motor function and may require more targeted, repetitive, and task-specific training to yield measurable improvements. Second, some of the assessment tools used may not have been sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in fine motor performance within the limited intervention periods. Finally, the developmental trajectory of fine motor skills is closely intertwined with cognitive and perceptual development, which may require longer interventions to show clear effects.

### Hand assessment for infants: normative reference values [^114YCzuZ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To create normative reference values for unilateral and bilateral use of the hands, using the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI), a newly developed criterion-referenced assessment measuring hand use in infants aged 3 months to 12 months at risk of cerebral palsy (CP).

Method

In total, 489 HAI assessments of typically developing infants (243 females, 246 males), aged 3 months to 10 months (mean 6mo 14d [SD 2mo 5d]), were collected in Italy and Sweden. Normative growth curves based on mean and SDs were created, as well as skill acquisition curves for each test item. Correlation to age and differences between groups based on sex and nationality, as well as differences between the right and the left hand, were investigated.

Results

The growth curves showed a steady increase in mean value and a decrease in SD over age. There were no differences between groups based on sex or nationality. There was a negligible mean difference (0.1 raw score) between the right and left hands.

Interpretation

HAI normative reference values are now available, which can assist in identifying deviating hand use for each month of age, as well as a side difference between hands in infants at risk of CP.

What This Paper Adds

A Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) result greater than 2SD below the mean indicates atypical hand use. Skill acquisition curves describe the age at which typically developing infants master the HAI items. Most typically developing infants do not demonstrate asymmetry in hand use.

### Efficacy of baby-CIMT: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial on infants below age 12 months, with clinical signs of unilateral CP [^115B5Xai]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Early hand motor function in children with unilateral CP

The development of hand use below the age of 12 months in infants with unilateral CP has not been described. It is not known when deviation from normal development can first be detected nor what the typical signs of unilateral CP might be. Textbooks usually describe unilateral CP as characterized by a flexed elbow, pronated forearm, and thumb in the palm without applying a developmental perspective. We have recently started to monitor infants from early ages who are likely to develop unilateral CP and it is clear that the amount and quality of hand use develops differently in the two hands at an early age. Asymmetric hand use can already be seen at the age of 3–5 months. Using our newly developed instrument, HAI for infants aged 3–12 months, we can for the first time describe and measure this difference from typical early motor development (Krumlinde-Sundholm et al. in preparation). HAI measures each hand separately in uni- and bimanual play-tasks. This means that HAI will fill an important gap, because no currently available outcome measure can quantify the development of asymmetric hand function at such a young age, and available norm-referenced tests do not reflect the deviant development seen in children with unilateral CP. Based on our ongoing research, we know that variation among infants is considerable and that developmental differences range from negligible to dramatic during the first year of life.

Theoretical assumption for intervention

Two types of interventions based on different theoretical assumptions will be tested in this project. Briefly stated, the CIMT programme for infants (baby-CIMT) is based on self-initiated action and assumes that one must practice the motor action one intends to learn. The baby-massage intervention is based on the assumption that general tactile stimulation is important for development. Both interventions assume that early stimulation is important; by using baby-massage as a comparison group, we can control for the placebo effect of increased attention and time spent with the child. The theoretical assumptions and evidence supporting both methods will be described in greater depth.

### Infant motor development in rural Vietnam and intrauterine exposures to anaemia, iron deficiency and common mental disorders: a prospective community-based study [^1137zHhD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Infant motor development (collected at W4)

Infant motor development was assessed by direct administration of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Ed, Fine and Gross Motor Scales (BSID-M) to the infants when they were six months old. The BSID Fine Motor Scale consists of 66 items and Gross Motor Scale 72 items for infants and young children aged from 1 to 42 months. Fine motor items include capacity to gaze at and follow an object, control hand movements, including keeping hands open, reaching for an object with one hand, grasping a block, holding a small piece of food, transferring an object from hand to hand, lifting a cup by the handle, turning the pages of a book, and grasping a crayon or pencil using a palmar grasp (whole hand, fisted). The 35 gross-motor items include being able to control the head, rolling from side to side and from lying on the back to lying on the front, elevating trunk while prone, sitting either with or without support, moving from sitting to hands and knees, crawling, standing with support, and raising self from sitting to a standing position. The administration of each sub-scale is stopped when the infant is unable to do five consecutive items of that sub-scale.

The BSID-M was translated from English into Vietnamese and back translated by a group of bilingual psychologists and health researchers. There are as yet no data available on the validation of the BSID in Vietnam. However, our group has pilot-tested the scale and found it to be comprehensible and meaningful in rural Vietnam. BSID-M scores were highly correlated with BSID cognitive scores (Pearson's r = 0.64), but not with BISD social-emotional scores (r = 0.12). In the original validation studies conducted in USA, the correlation coefficient of BSID-M scores with BSID cognitive score for infants at 6 months was 0.62 and with BSID social-emotional scores was 0.29, the internal reliability coefficient of BSID for infants at 6 months was 0.90, and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.83.

The total raw scores of the BSID-M were converted to composite scores based on the infant's age in weeks following the guidelines of the BSID Manual.

### FDA patient-focused drug development guidances: considerations for trial readiness in rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathies [^115PSkCr]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Combine COAs to Cover the Outcome Spectrum

The 2019 Rare Disease draft guidance emphasizes the importance of a single COA to cover the full range of possible scores in the concept of interest for the disease. This assures the same COA is used for all patients for a given outcome in a trial, thus optimizing statistical power and streamlining analyses. Most COAs are applicable for a restricted ability or age range. The original Hammersmith Function Motor Measure assessed nonambulatory patients with SMA types 2 and 3. To reduce floor effects, it was modified to incorporate aspects of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia-Infant Test of NeuroDevelopment (CHOP-INTEND) developed for SMA type-1. To reduce ceiling effects, it incorporated parts of the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) developed for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This resulted in the "Revised Hammersmith Scale for SMA".

As COAs move from the neonatal-infant period to childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, they shift from assessing (1) the most basic neurologic functions dependent on muscle tone and strength (e.g. grasping object placed in the hand) to (2) simple developmental skills or milestones (purposefully picking up an object) to (3) more complex skills (manipulating a fork to pick up food and place in the mouth) to (4) adaptive behavior (using utensils and eating appropriately at the table). Measures such as the Vineland (age 0–90 years) include each of these levels but are insufficiently granular at the youngest age range and are always framed as adaptive behaviors (i.e. does vs can). Supplementing and possibly combining COAs to ensure that the full range of the COI — from supportive neurologic functions to adaptive behavior — is meaningfully included could provide a significant resource for clinical trials.

### Investigating the link between temperamental and motor development: a longitudinal study of infants aged 6–42 months [^117FmeFG]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent key issue in motor development is Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), which impairs the development of coordinated muscle functions associated with various motor activities such as dexterity, posture retention, and force coordination, and is reported to have a prevalence of 5 to 8% among school-age children. Such children are at risk of lower self-esteem due to their poor ability to perform tasks, which may lead to various maladjustments in school life and in friendships and may cause them to become withdrawn. Additionally, DCD may convey early signs of developmental disorders, including autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), even high rates of comorbidity. Despite growing recognition of the clinical importance of DCD, the pathogenesis of DCD is still unknown, nor is anything known about its neurological basis, exacerbating factors, or protective factors. Accordingly, early intervention in the motor development of children with DCD is desirable, and the importance of motivating target children is widely recognized [for a review, see].

Motor development is usually divided into "gross" and "fine" motor development. Gross motor development involves major movements of the whole body, primarily the trunk and legs, and culminates in independent walking, climbing, and running during toddlerhood. In contrast, fine motor development focuses on the use of the shoulders, arms, and hands, and is refined into small hand and arm movements such as grasping in late infancy and throwing in toddlers and preschoolers. It primarily relies on attentional rather than motor skill, and Effortful Control abilities may make a contribution to achievement. Early motor delays in crawling or walking are often danger signals of the presence of other disruptions and may affect the development of skills in other domains. Yet only one longitudinal study has directly examined motivation in relation to motor development. In that study, the developmental trajectory of motor motivation in infancy was investigated longitudinally by observing infants every 3 weeks from 7 to 12 months to describe the nature of motivation to move during locomotor transitions. Results showed that motivation to move continued to increase as motor milestones were reached, and infants perceived to have stronger motivation to move showed earlier achievement of four milestones: independent sitting, pulling to stand, hands-and-knees crawling, and cruising.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^1136qpSV]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Theoretical background for the small step program – the child's perspective

The Small Step Program is an individualized, goal directed, and intensive intervention that focuses on hand use, mobility, and communication. The program is intended to be carried out in the child's home environment and be conducted by their parents who are trained and coached by therapists. The program is designed be used from about 4 months of age and seeks to take advantage of the theoretically plastic period of brain development at this age. The program is designed to include and combine components that are known to be of importance in evidence-based intervention approaches for older children. The challenge in the Small Step Program is to adapt this knowledge and apply it within an intervention for very young children.

The goal-directed approach has been successfully used in older children. However, for families in a very vulnerable time period of life, with a young infant with high risk of developing CP, it is not easy to define goals in either the short or long-term perspective. In a goal-setting approach, the person's own individual wishes are a strong ingredient, and it is suggested that the goals should be functional and meaningful for daily life. Such a goal-centred approach is taken in the Small Step Program, and collaboration between the parents and therapists will help the family to determine and focus on what their infant will likely be able to learn as a next step within the different foci and to define goals that are closely related to the child's ability and cognitive level.

Within the Small Step Program, great emphasis is put on children's self-initiated actions, which are stimulated by meaningful and motivating activities and toys. The stimuli should be clear and understandable for the child and should be related to the child's developmental stage. It is assumed that development is driven by children's unique characteristics and capacity to explore a situation through which they discover new and more advanced activities. Therefore, the training should be conducted at a level that is challenging, but not too demanding, i.e. the training should fall within the zone of proximal development, ZPD. The scaffolding and shared attentional focus provided by the ZPD aims to ensure that the child's interest is maintained for as long as possible, which will promote the internalisation of independent developmental achievements. This concept is commonly applied within motor learning programs. The challenge here lies in helping parents understand how self-initiated actions can be promoted for infants with a very low ability level.

### Growth diagrams for individual finger strength in children measured with the RIHM [^1165QxjB]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using only grip strength and pinch strength measurements to assess a person's hand function does not provide information regarding the strength at the level of the fingers and thumb. When intervention is aimed specifically at an individual finger or thumb, measuring the strength of individual fingers and thumb can provide more detailed information regarding how strength is affected by the treatment. We therefore (1) present reference values of individual finger and thumb strengths and (2) present them in the form of growth diagrams, providing an easy way to distinguish between the effects of growth and intervention on strength development.

We bring several limitations to the reader's attention. First, we chose to omit variables such as length and weight from our model and only use age to predict strength. This approach resulted in five diagrams for each measurement. These diagrams combine both hands and genders and therefore do not acknowledge the effect of gender and hand dominance. Even though omitting weight, length, gender, and hand dominance from the model resulted in a less accurate model, the goodness of fit of the model decreased only marginally (Table 7): the five diagrams presented only differ on average 4% with models that do distinguish between gender and hand dominance. We believe the benefit of using one diagram for each measurement outweighs the small reduction in predictability of the model. Second, we examined only individual strength measurements at one specific moment in time. Therefore, the model we provide is not calculated on longitudinal data, an approach that would be more suitable but more difficult with respect to gathering the data. Third, our population consisted of healthy, mostly Caucasian, children in the near vicinity of our research facility and they might not be representative of the children who might benefit from using such growth diagrams at followup.

(D) Distribution of PDMS-2 raw scores for grasping and visual motor integration over time across 21 individuals. The PDMS-2 is a norm referenced assessment, with a range of 0 to 100 for each subset raw score. PDMS-2 scores in STXBP1 map to an age equivalent of less than 14 months, even in individuals after 2 years of life (Supplementary Fig. 4). Raw scores for the GMFM-66-IS and PDMS-2 are shown to delineate the range of outcomes that would not be captured from standard scores due to floor effects. GMFM-66-IS = Gross Motor Function Measure; PDMS-2 = Peabody Developmental Motor Scales.

### NGLY1 deficiency: a prospective natural history study [^114PhLBB]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Peabody Developmental Motor Scales — 2nd Edition

Participants assessed for the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales — 2nd Edition (PDMS-2) had clinically significant impairments in all subscales of gross and fine motor function. The PDMS-2 provides a more detailed analysis of gross and fine motor skills in children from birth to 71 months of age. All participants who could be assessed with PDMS-2 showed marked impairment in DQ for gross motor (Fig. 4A) and fine motor (Fig. 4B) function and had clinically significant impairments in all subscales of gross and fine motor function. For example, grasping age equivalence was at or below 8 months and object manipulation age equivalence was below or at 20 months (data on file), even though chronologic age was as high as 260 months (~21 years old). These data illustrate a profound impairment in upper extremity function in study participants. Profound motor impairment was also observed in all other PDMS-2 domains (data on file). While there were small changes over time for many participants, the profound motor impairments were generally stable or worsening over time.

### Supporting play exploration and early developmental intervention versus usual care to enhance development outcomes during the transition from the neonatal intensive care unit to home: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^117HUeUQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States 1 in 8 infants are born prematurely (< 37 weeks gestation), placing the infants at increased risk for learning difficulties, lower quality of life, and motor disabilities with up to 50% of infant born very preterm requiring special education. Infants born preterm with neonatal white matter injury are also at higher risk of having cerebral palsy (CP), cognitive impairments, requiring more teacher attention, and having an increased need for special education support. While survival of infants born preterm is more certain than ever, developmental services typically use a "wait and see" approach to start intervention and once enrolled provides low intensity intervention resulting in little to no lasting effects on motor and cognitive development. Basic science and clinical evidence suggest early and intense intervention is more effective than a long-term low intensity approach at promoting neural recovery in adults and children as well as in animal models of cerebral palsy. Evidence-based, effective early intervention programs are needed to target early motor abilities that support motor and cognitive development in infants at high risk of having cerebral palsy or minor neurological dysfunctions.

Motor and cognitive development are tightly coupled, suggesting that delays in one domain could contribute to delays in other domains. Motor experience provides infants an opportunity to learn about objects and interaction supports development in multiple domains. The action perception model of development is governed by the theory that motor activity contributes to the infants attempts to attend to the environment, allowing the infant to receive and interpret important information, and solve problems by linking the mind and body in a cycle that supports development. Children with motor impairments or delays have limited ability to interact with and interpret the environment, restricting their opportunities to learn through action. Atypical postural control and impaired reaching abilities are common in infants born preterm and infants later diagnosed with development deficits such as CP, developmental coordination disorder, and minor neurological dysfunction. Children born preterm with motor coordination disorders or CP score lower on problem-solving tasks than those without motor disabilities at school age. The relationship between motor and cognitive outcomes in infants born preterm supports the need for interventions that incorporate both the motor and cognitive domains and the interaction between these domains to maximize outcomes.

### Growth diagrams for individual finger strength in children measured with the RIHM [^116LzPPg]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although grip and pinch strength provide a more global measure of a large number of digits and muscles, measuring strength of individual fingers or the thumb can provide additional and more detailed information regarding hand strength.

Questions/purposes

We developed growth diagrams for individual finger strength in children.

Patients and Methods

We measured thumb palmar abduction, thumb opposition, and thumb flexion in the metacarpophalangeal joint, and abduction of the index and little fingers in 101 children (4–12 years old) using a myometer. We recorded hand dominance, gender, height, and weight. All measurements were performed in a randomized order by the same researcher. We developed statistical models for drawing growth diagrams using estimated percentiles for each strength measurement. Separate models for dominant and nondominant hands of boys and girls were developed, in addition to a combined model.

Results

Because there was no difference in strength between boys and girls and between dominant and nondominant hands, both hands and genders were combined in one growth diagram for each measurement. The normative data were presented in a table format and in growth diagrams for each myometer measurement.

Conclusions

These diagrams can be used for pediatric patients such as patients with congenital malformations or neuromuscular disorders who receive interventions or therapy aimed at function of the hand, fingers, or thumb. The growth diagrams facilitate distinguishing between the effects of growth and intervention on strength development.

### The pull-to-sit task: examining infant postural development in autism spectrum disorder [^114bH5qk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the predictive relationship between early trajectories of postural and head control during a pull-to-sit task and later autism diagnostic and developmental outcomes.

Study Design

Using a prospective longitudinal design, postural skills of 100 infants at elevated and low familial likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were evaluated using a pull-to-sit task monthly from age 1 month to 6 months. At age 24 months, infants were seen for a developmental and diagnostic evaluation completed by examiners masked to participant group. Latent growth curve models were used to compare early trajectories of pull-to-sit performance in infants later diagnosed with ASD and typically developing infants and to predict developmental outcomes.

Results

Pull-to-sit trajectories did not differ in infants with an elevated likelihood of ASD or infants with ASD compared with low-likelihood and typically developing infants, but infants with ASD were more likely to exhibit a head lag by age 4 months. In addition, pull-to-sit trajectories were predictive of social and speech skills 2 years later.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the link between very early pull-to-sit skills and later social and language outcomes. Atypical postural development and persistent presence of head lag may be important early indicators of social and language vulnerabilities, including ASD.

### Change in hand function and dexterity with age after index pollicization for congenital thumb hypoplasia [^116jSvaW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about how performance on strength, range of motion, and dexterity measures changes as children with index finger pollicization mature. The authors reviewed performance in range of motion, strength, and dexterity over a 7-year period and report outcomes over time.

Methods

Data from children treated with index finger pollicization for congenital thumb hypoplasia from 2007 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Children were followed for an average of 3.9 years (range, 1 to 7 years) during the study period. Standardized assessments included range of motion, grip, key pinch and tripod pinch strength, the Box and Block Test, the Nine Hole Peg Test, and the Functional Dexterity Test. Average score by age and average yearly change were calculated for each assessment, and scores were plotted against published age-matched scores of normal children when available.

Results

Twenty-three patients with 29 affected thumbs were included. Distal grasp span increased 0.17 inch and Kapandji opposition improved 0.26 point with each year of age; however, proximal web-space size did not increase over time. Grip strength improved an average of 2.69 kg/year, and tripod and key pinch improved 0.58 kg and 0.67 kg with each year of age. Box and Block Test scores improved an average of 4.11 blocks/year. Scores on the Nine Hole Peg Test improved 3.83 seconds/year, and scores on the Functional Dexterity Test improved 0.026 peg/second each year.

Conclusions

Children with pollicized thumbs improve in dexterity and strength with growth. Web-space size did not change with age; therefore, the thumb should be carefully positioned at the time of surgery.

### A unilateral cervical spinal cord contusion injury model in non-human primates (macaca mulatta) [^111LTJux]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here, and in the companion articlewe describe the development of a unilateral cervical contusion injury device and its use in the macaque monkey. The device and procedure allows the production of graded contusion lesions and varying degrees of recovery depending upon pre-set impact parameters. As we progressed through this initial series, we incorporated new protocols and the use of pre-operative MRI to increase the predictability of the outcomes by matching impact protocols to individual features of each animal's spinal canal, spinal cord, and CSF space. Post-operative MRI provided confirmation of lesion placement, as well as information on lesion volume and extent. We produced a series of animals with lesions varying from small to large, were able to evaluate the relationships between impact parameters, lesion measures, and behavioral outcomes, and were able to confirm that these relationships were consistent with our previous studies in the rat. Multiple univariate outcome measures are provided, as well as an integrated metric characterizing the multivariate cervical SCI syndrome. Impacts at the higher ranges of peak force produced highly lateralized and enduring deficits in multiple measures of forelimb and hand function, while lower energy impacts produced early paralysis followed by substantial recovery with enduring deficits in fine digital control (e.g. pincer grasp).

### Which hand position in breastfeeding is better for milk intake: palmar grasp or scissor grasp? A pilot study [^112onCF5]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives: During breastfeeding, there are two natural hand positions used most often by the mother to introduce her breast to the baby (palmar grasp [C-hold position] and scissor grasp). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the milk intake is affected by the hand position. Materials and Methods: Both healthy term breastfed infants and their mothers were included in the study. Each mother-baby dyad was monitored during two feeding periods (100 mother-baby dyads, 200 breastfeeding sessions). Mothers were asked to grasp their breasts differently (palmar or scissor grasp) in each breastfeeding session. Milk intake was determined by test weighing. Results: One hundred mother-baby dyads were included in the study. There was no statistically significant difference between scissor grasp (34.60 ± 22.16mL) and palmar grasp (38.30 ± 27.37mL) positions when evaluated in terms of milk intake (p = 0.13). When asked what position they prefer to breastfeed at home, the majority of them (56%) stated that they preferred scissor grasp positions. In terms of breastfeeding by hand position, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003) between the mothers who received breastfeeding training during pregnancy (59.2% palmar grasp position, 40.8% scissor grasp position) and the mothers who had not (29.4% palmar grasp position, 70.6% scissor grasp position). Conclusions: Our study showed that there was no difference in milk intake between palmar grasp position and scissor grasp position. The mothers should be encouraged to use the hand position that is most natural and comfortable.

### Evidence of validity in a new method for measurement of dexterity in children and adolescents [^116SaxBL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

many everyday activities involve manipulation of objects with the fingertips. Impaired performance in manipulative tasks is common in neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus accurate assessment of an individual's ability to coordinate fingertip forces is important for planning treatment. We evaluated a recently developed assessment tool (the Strength-Dexterity Test), which is based on manipulation of unstable objects, in a paediatric population.

Method

a Rasch model was used to examine the validity and reliability of the Strength-Dexterity Test in a sample of 56 typically developing children and adolescents (30 males, 26 females; age range 4y 10mo-17y 3mo; mean age 9y 8mo, SD 3y 8mo). In addition, we examined how performance on this test relates to widely used tests for assessment of gross manual dexterity (assessed with the Box and Blocks Test) and finger strength measured with a pinch meter.

Results

the constructs measured with the 78-item Strength-Dexterity Test include dexterity and strength, and form a unique unidimensional latent trait, named fingertip force coordination, that improves with age. The test has internal scale validity when applied to a typical paediatric population. Positive correlations (significant at p < 0.001) were found among all three tests.

Interpretation

we provide preliminary evidence of construct validity in the Strength-Dexterity Test. Our findings suggest that this test has the potential to be developed into a promising tool for assessing dexterity in children.

### Cutting It too fine? The factor structure of fine motor skills from ages 5 to 10 Years [^113BbSyb]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

Turning to tasks used to measure FMS, these, ranked according to approximate level of popularity, include pegboard, maze tracing, tapping, copying, threading and weaving, sorting and building/stacking, and object construction tasks (Carlson et al; Fleishman and Hempel). Most tasks involve both a speed and accuracy component, for instance copying as many forms as possible correctly within a minute, with some researchers arguing that repetitive, speed‐driven tasks are qualitatively different from tasks requiring more spatially sophisticated movements (Martzog et al.), which in turn differ from those with a direct link to academic skills because they lie close to writing (Suggate et al.). Therefore, we tentatively define three subdomains of FMS more closely, as these appear in much of the literature and can be seen as subskills of FMS based on coherent theoretical approaches outlined below. Dexterity is performance at skillfully manipulating small objects (Backman et al.). Graphomotor skill refers to integrating input from visual and motor modalities to create forms and symbols using writing tools (Bo et al; Pitchford et al.) to perform small‐scale and precise movements, such as drawing and writing activities (Berninger et al.). Finally, speed‐dominated FMS involve rapid but simple, often repetitive, movements of the fingers and/or hands (Fleishman), such as key‐tapping tasks.

Because FMS are used to perform a nearly infinite range of tasks (e.g. tying shoelaces, gesturing, tool use), it is possible to identify and categorize countless further aspects of FMS. For instance, beginning with the broader concept of hand skills, which is conceptually close to dexterity, Chien et al. identified 22 different subdomains (e.g. grasping, gesture, holding, calibration, pace, transferring). Focusing on one aspect of manual dexterity, namely in‐hand manipulation of objects, for this subdomain alone, Pont et al. identified six additional subdomains (e.g. stabilization finger‐to‐palm translation, simple shift, complex shift, simple rotation, complex rotation). Such a detailed conceptualization of FMS has undoubted value, for instance, in occupational therapy settings, but is also conceptually very complex (Hands et al.), perhaps first requiring a series of simpler studies with a broader conceptualization of FMS as a starting point.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the hammersmith neonatal neurological examination in predicting motor outcome at 12 months for infants born very preterm [^112hV6FG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition

A physiotherapist blinded to each infant's history conducted the Bayley‐III assessment. The Bayley‐III assesses cognitive, language, and motor function in children aged 1 to 42 months. The motor scale consists of 72 items on gross motor skills (sitting, standing, locomotion, and balance) and 66 items on fine motor skills (grasping, perceptual motor integration, motor planning, and speed). The composite scores for the motor subscale were established using a normative sample of 1700 US infants with a mean of 100, SD of 15, and range of 40 to 160. The cut‐off chosen for the Bayley‐III was 1 SD below the mean (≤ 85). This conservative cut‐off was used because the Bayley‐III underestimates motor deficits; typically developing infants born at term assessed with the Bayley‐III score substantially higher than the published mean.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^114P7eHD]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A plausible reason for the lack of effective early intervention programs for children at risk of developing CP is the common "wait and see" approach due to the uncertainty of early diagnostic criteria. There is a wide range of factors, very often in combination, that can be the cause of the early insult to the developing brain that will result in the diagnosis of CP. Highly individual developmental trajectories of postural control, motor function, and muscle tone that vary considerably during the first years are frequently seen in children at risk of developing CP. In addition, risk factors and signs of CP might be visible at a very early age but might not necessarily lead to CP. A child with delayed development might recover and atypical signs might disappear, and the opposite can occur in which a child develops CP without obvious early signs. Thus, there is the dilemma in that the potential effect of early intervention might be lost if we wait with intervention until the CP diagnosis has been confirmed. Although the ability to predict the risk of developing CP at an early age has increased when using a combination of general movement assessments, neurological examinations, and brain imaging techniques. Different brain structures are more susceptible to injury during certain time periods during pregnancy. An early insult during the first trimester can lead to a maldevelopment of the brain, while the white matter, particularly in areas close to the ventricles, is more vulnerable to injury in the late second to early third trimester. An insult close to term causes predominantly cortical and subcortical grey matter lesions (e.g. injuries involving the thalamus and basal ganglia). The timing of the brain disturbance, in addition to its size and location, has been reported to be closely related to the severity of motor impairments. The effects of specific disturbance characteristics on motor development are understood to some extent; however, very little is known about the relationship between the timing and extent of the lesion and the effects of early interventions.

### Efficacy of baby-CIMT: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial on infants below age 12 months, with clinical signs of unilateral CP [^114iuyS6]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Primary outcome measure is the Hand Assessment for Infants, HAI

HAI, which is currently being developed by Krumlinde-Sundholm et al. is intended to evaluate the quality of goal-directed manual actions in infants, 3–12 months of age, at risk of developing unilateral CP. The test procedure comprises a semi-structured video-recorded 10–15-min play session. The child is seated in a baby seat/bouncer or a high chair depending on his or her age. The chair should not restrict arm movements and as upright a position as possible should be striven for. A test kit of carefully selected toys will be presented to the infant to encourage and elicit exploration, making a wide range of motor actions observable. The set-up and administration of the play session are crucial for the possibility of observing and scoring the infant's manual abilities. Scoring is performed from the video-recording. HAI is intended to detect and quantify possible asymmetry between hands by providing scores for each hand separately, and to provide a measure of bilateral hand use. Both criterion- and norm-referenced outcome measures will be provided. HAI is still under development, but the preliminary scale consists of 18 items (13 unimanual and 5 bimanual) each scored using a 3-point rating scale. Preliminary Rasch analysis indicates promising results in terms of internal construct validity and unidimensionality.

Secondary assessment

Questionnaire about parent's experience of treatment

The parents will be asked about their experience of the interventions. These questions will address the feasibility of the intervention programme and the family's impression of its effects; the responses will be recorded using a 4-point scale.

Parenting sense of competence scale, PSOC

The PSOC scale measures parents' sense of confidence and satisfaction using a self-reported questionnaire. Both mothers and fathers will be asked to complete the questionnaire. PSOC contains 16 statements to which the parents can respond in a six level Likert type scale, ranging from agreement to disagreement. The questionnaire yields two subscales: skills captures parental self-perceptions of skill and knowledge regarding parental functions, while valuing captures feelings of satisfaction, frustration, and interest associated with parenting. Satisfactory psychometric properties were reported by the original authors and more recently by Gilmore and Cuskelly.

### Brain plasticity following early life brain injury: insights from neuroimaging [^114GynKd]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The developing human brain possesses a superior capacity to reorganize after focal lesions. This review describes mechanisms of reorganization following pre- and perinatally-acquired, unilateral brain lesions for motor, somatosensory, and language functions. In the motor system, unilateral damage to the corticospinal tract can lead to the maintenance of normally-transient ipsilateral corticospinal projections from the contralesional hemisphere. In some patients, this type of corticospinal (re)organization can achieve an active grasp function of the paretic hand, while in others no useful hand function develops although such projections exist. In the somatosensory system, periventricular lesions can be compensated by outgrowing thalamocortical projections forming "bypasses" around the defective white matter to reach the postcentral gyrus. By contrast, lesions in the postcentral gyrus often lead to marked somatosensory deficits. Finally, language functions can be taken over by the right hemisphere in cases of left hemispheric damage, often with excellent functional outcome. Knowledge of these mechanisms is necessary for establishing a "prognostic corridor" of development derived from neuroimaging in newborns with brain lesions.

### A unilateral cervical spinal cord contusion injury model in non-human primates (macaca mulatta) [^111HbHxr]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

FIG. 6.
Behavioral recovery during open field and chair testing shows that subjects exhibit a range of deficits early after injury that recover in some animals but persist in others. (A) Overall performance in the open field. Animals are awarded points (total = 72 points) for approximations to normal behavior on (B) general locomotion (limb use, placement, weight support, stepping and gait asymmetry; 34 points), (C) climbing (limb use during climbing, grip strength and retrieval of food items from cups at various heights; 16 points), and (D) object manipulation (posture, forelimb and finger movements while eating an apple or an orange, or during retrieval of food items from a Kong toy; 22 points). The overall score was derived by summing the subscore points for performance on all three activities (Table 3). A subset of animals (subjects #5, 6, 7, and 8) also were trained to perform four tasks with their impaired forelimb while seated in a standard primate-restraining chair; performance is shown as the proportion of trials where the reinforcer was successfully transferred to the mouth. These tasks involved retrieval of food rewards (e.g. grape, raisin, apple piece, etc.) from a platform (E), from the top of a vertical post/stick (F), from a 7-slot Brinkman board (H), or for pulling and holding a U-shaped handle attached to springs of varying stiffness (G). Two of the four subjects tested were able to successfully transfer food rewards to their mouth when performing all of these tasks (subjects #5 and #8). Sustained residual deficits in pincer grasp were evident on the Brinkman board task for all subjects. Red asterisk indicates pre-operative baseline performance.

Multivariate Linear Regression Analyses of 9 Early Motor Developmental Milestones and Schizotypal Scales by Gender

Early Motor Developmental Milestones

Data on 9 early motor developmental milestones were collected from visits to Finnish child welfare centers. These milestones included walking unsupported, standing unsupported, walking with support, capable to stand up (lift themselves), touching thumb with index finger, sitting unsupported, turning from back to tummy, make a grip on an object (grab object), holding the head up. The achievement of milestones was assessed by medical personnel at approximately monthly intervalsand recorded on a separate welfare card as a standard practice in Finland. The data on milestones were collected at an age of at least 11.5 month or later in 96% of cases. The mean number of appointments during the first year was 10. If a participant missed an appointment, then information on milestones were recorded during the next visit retrospectively.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^112jkSbL]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The infant's self-initiated actions form an important basis in all focus areas. This means that the initiative to move, to use the hands, and to communicate should be the result of the infant's desire to explore the world as facilitated and stimulated by the training provider. The environment should contain stimuli that capture and drive the child's actions, and the training provider's task is to attract and help the child to maintain their attention. To outside observers it should be possible to understand what the child is intended to do, i.e. the training provider has to make sure that the child understands what is expected of them. It is important to support the parent to follow the child's lead. Thus, the treatment provider should follow and support the child's actions and not disturb or change the direction of the actions. To stimulate the child's self-initiated activities, parents are encouraged to use their knowledge of their child's favourite playtime activities and interests and to use the familiar context and environment at home to support the child's development. Increased responsiveness to the child's actions, communicative attempts, and environmental cues will form the key principles of the parent coaching and education that is included in the program. The aim is to help the parents to adapt their responses to the child's initiative and ability as they develop. Key advice can be: Wait for the child's initiation, maintain their attention, tempt and encourage the child to act, do not try to force actions, and reinforce and respond positively to the child's action. The parent should help and guide the child, i.e. be hands-on when necessary and hands-off when not necessary. The home environment for training is chosen because it is important to teach families to use the available possibilities in the child's daily environment to promote the child's development. The use and enrichment of the home environment is part of all focus areas. This includes careful toy selection and adaptations of the physical set up, including the positioning and use of conventional baby equipment, to help the parents use their environment in an optimal way.

### Development of the hand assessment for infants: evidence of internal scale validity [^111oVENK]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study was to develop a descriptive and evaluative assessment of upper limb function for infants aged 3 to 12 months and to investigate its internal scale validity for use with infants at risk of unilateral cerebral palsy.

Method

The concepts of the test items and scoring criteria were developed. Internal scale validity and aspects of reliability were investigated on the basis of 156 assessments of infants at 3 to 12 months corrected age (mean 7.2mo, SD 2.5) with signs of asymmetric hand use. Rasch measurement model analysis and non-parametric statistics were used.

Results

The new test, the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI), consists of 12 unimanual and five bimanual items, each scored on a 3-point rating scale. It demonstrated a unidimensional construct and good fit to the Rasch model requirements. The excellent person reliability enabled person separation to six significant ability strata. The HAI produced an interval-level measure of bilateral hand use as well as unimanual scores of each hand, allowing a quantification of possible asymmetry expressed as an asymmetry index.

Interpretation

The HAI can be considered a valid assessment tool for measuring bilateral hand use and quantifying side difference between hands among infants at risk of developing unilateral cerebral palsy.

What This Paper Adds

The Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) measures the use of both hands and quantifies a possible asymmetry of hand use. HAI is valid for infants at 3 to 12 months corrected age at risk of unilateral cerebral palsy.

### Normative values for grip and pinch strength for 6-to 19-year-olds [^111Sr1PD]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide current normative data for grip and pinch strength in children and young adults aged 6 to 19 years as well as to examine the effect of age, sex, and hand dominance on grip and pinch strength.

Design

Descriptive cross-sectional.

Setting

Two grade schools, 2 high schools, and 1 university.

Participants

Participants (N = 1508; 741 male students and 767 female students) aged 6 to 19 years.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Means and SDs were calculated for each strength measurement (grip, tip pinch, lateral pinch, palmar pinch) and stratified by age and sex. Analysis of covariance and 2-sample t tests were used to analyze the data.

Results

The analyses demonstrated that age and sex had a significant effect on hand strength values, as evidenced by increasing hand strength with age as well as greater hand strength in males than in females. Hand dominance was not shown to have a significant effect on hand strength. The results of this study were statistically significantly different from previously published normative values, with most hand strength values being lower than those published 28 years ago.

Conclusions

Having updated normative data are paramount for rehabilitation practitioners to compare the grip and pinch strength of their clients with the average values to objectively assess impairment and tracking progress. The statistical significance observed for most data collected in this study as compared with those previously published supports the need for continually updating normative data.

### Challenges and limitations in early intervention [^113Z5FWG]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Research over the past three decades has shown that early intervention in infants biologically at risk of developmental disorders, irrespective of the presence of a brain lesion, is associated with improved cognitive development in early childhood without affecting motor development. However, at present it is unknown whether early intervention is also able to improve developmental outcome in infants with a serious lesion of the brain. This paper discusses factors that might play a role in the effect of early intervention. The following picture emerged from the limited evidence available: (1) coaching of parents seems an effective means of intervention; (2) our understanding of the plasticity of the developing human brain is currently too limited to allow a direct practical implementation in early intervention; (3) intervention before term age should primarily focus on stress reduction, intervention after term age on stimulation of infant development; and (4) our knowledge of the best ways to stimulate infant development is scant. Nevertheless, preliminary data suggest that offering the infant ample opportunities to explore by self-produced motor activities the borders of their own abilities might be a good strategy for promoting developmental outcome, including functional mobility.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^113AYYfZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence for the efficacy of early intervention

Early intervention, carried out during the first year in life when the brain is under rapid development and most plastic, is assumed to be more effective than intervention later during development or in adulthood. This assumption is based on the knowledge that neural networks and pathways that remain intact after brain injury can be strengthened through learning-induced plasticity. Recent animal studies have suggested that there is a critical period of motor system plasticity and that activity-dependent reorganisation of the corticospinal motor-projection pattern to the hand occurs before 1 year of age.

The potential of early interventions is well founded in experimental research, while clinical studies on physiotherapy for infants with CP, or children with high risk for CP, have not been able to show positive changes on motor development that exceed the expected developmental trajectory. It seems that the concept of enriched environments based on great developmental effects in animal research can be transformed to children. A recent pilot study using enriched environments to elicit self-initiated motor behaviours; including parent training and task analysis for frequent practice – has shown promising results. Another recent early intervention study – COPing with and CAring for Infants with Special Needs (COPCA) – although vague results, is also of interest. COPCA is built of modern theories of brain development and uses the neuronal group selection theories framework in a family-centred approach. There is some evidence indicating that more specific training might lead to a more favourable outcome when compared to general training. For example, training approaches targeting other areas than overall motor development, such as cognition, seem to have positive results, at least in a short-term perspective, in preterm children. Early intervention directed towards communication is also known to have a positive influence on cognitive and pre-linguistic development and to result in more advanced communication in preterm children in a short term perspective. When it comes to interventions targeting hand function, there is no specific intervention program developed for children with a high risk of developing CP. However, for children with unilateral CP, there are studies indicating that Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) can be adapted and used for infants and that this can increase the odds of having a higher functional level when the training is introduced within the first year of life. From a family perspective, it is also of interest to highlight that early interventions have been shown to facilitate bonding and to reduce parental stress. These positive changes following intervention within the areas of cognition, communication, and attachment provide an interesting and promising contrast to the absence of improvements in overall motor development following intervention for infants. This is especially the case because there are high levels of evidence for several different treatment approaches aiming to improve motor function in older children. Thus, there is a great need to develop new methods to improve models for early interventions in younger children and infants at high risk of developing CP.

### Development of hand function and precision grip control in individuals with cerebral palsy: a 13-year follow-up study [^117ETYYh]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Although children with cerebral palsy display large developmental differences in hand function from that of typically developing children by the age of 6 to 10 years, little is known about the developmental processes underlying hand function during subsequent development. In this study we investigated the development of manual dexterity in a timed motor task, the timing and amplitude of fingertip-force application during a precision grasping task, and the relationship between changes in these measures. We applied highly quantitative analytical approaches to determine if the fingertip-force application pattern and trial-to-trial variation of fingertip-force application change during development.

Methods

Twelve subjects with cerebral palsy (aged 6–8 years) participated in the first data-collection session conducted between 1989 and 1990. Ten of these subjects (5 with hemiplegia and 5 with diplegia, aged 19–21 years) returned between 2002 and 2003. Manual dexterity was measured by using timed tasks of the Jebsen-Taylor test of hand function. Subjects also lifted an object instrumented with force transducers while we measured the temporal coordination of fingertip coordination and the path ratio between the grip and vertical load-force trajectory (straightness). We used generalized procrustes analysis to determine if there were changes in shape of the force trajectory and intertrial variability.

Results

The Jebsen-Taylor test times decreased 45% from the first to the second data session. The overall time to complete the grip-lift task decreased 22%, mainly because of a faster transition from grasp to lift. The grip-force/load-force path ratios decreased from 1.7 to 1.35 (1 = straight line). Generalized procrustes analysis indicated a change in the shape and a decrease in variability in shape of the force-ratio path.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that the efficiency in grasping had developed during a 13-year period for this small group of participants with cerebral palsy, which suggests that improvement in hand function occurs over a longer time frame than commonly would be expected.

### Delineating clinical and developmental outcomes in STXBP1-related disorders [^115PZvSM]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Next, we assessed developmental trajectories using standardized outcome measures and classification scales (Fig. 3C and D and Table 2). For gross motor classification, five individuals were Level I on the GMFCS-ER, 16 individuals Level II, four individuals Level III, 12 individuals Level IV and five individuals had a Level V classification. Only nine individuals were assessed for MACS to characterize ability to navigate and perform in daily life, for which no individuals had a Level I classification, four were Level II, two Level III, two Level IV and one individual was Level V. Classification of language skills using the CFCS revealed that no individuals had a Level I classification, one was Level II, three Level III, five Level IV and 14 were Level V. Stratification of GMFM-66-IS scores by age ranges revealed a wide range of outcomes, with the greatest variability between the second and fifth year of life (median score of 35.8, IQR 25.75–46.05) and an observed plateau of gross motor function outcome on the GMFM-66-IS in late childhood (median score of 58.9, IQR 54.9–61.2). When quantifying fine motor development using the PDMS-2 measure, we found that individuals with STXBP1 had a range of scores for grasping and visual motor integration that mapped to an age equivalent of < 14 months, even after 2 years of life (Supplementary Fig. 4). PDMS-2 percentiles demonstrated a floor effect after the first year of life, when visual motor integration dropped below the first percentile and the range for grasping remained less than the 20th percentile.

### A unilateral cervical spinal cord contusion injury model in non-human primates (macaca mulatta) [^117Dkygu]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

The development of a non-human primate (NHP) model of spinal cord injury (SCI) based on mechanical and computational modeling is described. We scaled up from a rodent model to a larger primate model using a highly controllable, friction-free, electronically-driven actuator to generate unilateral C6-C7 spinal cord injuries. Graded contusion lesions with varying degrees of functional recovery, depending upon pre-set impact parameters, were produced in nine NHPs. Protocols and pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to optimize the predictability of outcomes by matching impact protocols to the size of each animal's spinal canal, cord, and cerebrospinal fluid space. Post-operative MRI confirmed lesion placement and provided information on lesion volume and spread for comparison with histological measures. We evaluated the relationships between impact parameters, lesion measures, and behavioral outcomes, and confirmed that these relationships were consistent with our previous studies in the rat. In addition to providing multiple univariate outcome measures, we also developed an integrated outcome metric describing the multivariate cervical SCI syndrome. Impacts at the higher ranges of peak force produced highly lateralized and enduring deficits in multiple measures of forelimb and hand function, while lower energy impacts produced early weakness followed by substantial recovery but enduring deficits in fine digital control (e.g. pincer grasp). This model provides a clinically relevant system in which to evaluate the safety and, potentially, the efficacy of candidate translational therapies.

### A unilateral cervical spinal cord contusion injury model in non-human primates (macaca mulatta) [^113cfMvC]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

To provide more detail on forelimb and digit function, a subset of animals (subjects #5, #6, #7, and #8) was tested while seated in a standard primate-restraining chair. All four subjects demonstrated an initial inability to successfully retrieve and transfer food items to their mouth. The two subjects that recovered function by 4–5 weeks post-lesion, as assessed in the open field exercise cage (subjects #5 and #8) also were able to successfully perform the platform task by 5 weeks after lesion, the stick task by 6 weeks, and the handle pull task by 9 weeks (Fig. 6E-G). Consistent with the results in the exercise cage, subjects #6 and #7 performed poorly in the chair tasks, particularly in the handle pull, followed by stick and platform tasks. While subjects #5 and #8 recovered an equal ability to complete these three tasks, their Brinkman board performance highlighted a notable and continuing deficit in the ability to use a pincer grasp. Subject #8 gradually improved in this task and subject #5 was more successful, especially later in the recovery period (Fig. 6H). Nevertheless, both of these animals showed a deficit in this task at post-operative times when they were totally successful at the other tasks. This suggests that the Brinkman board provided a more sensitive measure of digit recovery than the other chair tests.

### Stockholm preterm interaction-based intervention (SPIBI)-study protocol for an RCT of a 12-month parallel-group post-discharge program for extremely preterm infants and their parents [^116372CU]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Children's motor development will be measured using Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS) at 12 months corrected age. It is hypothesized that higher scores will be observed for the intervention group. The ranges for each subscale are as follows: stationary, 0–42; locomotion, 0–138; object manipulation, 0–30; grasping, 0–44; and visual-motor integration, 0–113. It is hypothesized that higher scores will be observed for the intervention group.

Children's neurological development will be measured using the General Movement Assessment (GMA) scale (normal-absent fidgety) at 3 months corrected age.

Children's general development will be measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-R) at 12, 24, and 36 months corrected age. It is hypothesized that the parents of the children in the intervention group will score their children higher. All five subscales (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, personal-social) will be used, with an overall score ranging from 0 to 300. It is hypothesized that higher scores will be observed for the intervention group.

Children's strengths and difficulties will be measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at 24 and 36 months corrected age, with the hypothesis that fewer difficulties and more strengths will be scored by parents in the intervention group. The SDQ consists of 25 items on a 3-point scale: 5 items on prosocial behaviour and 20 questions about various difficulties. It is hypothesized that higher scores will be observed for the intervention group for prosocial behaviour and that lower scores will be observed for the intervention group on the problematic subscales.

Child's autistic symptoms will be measured using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at 24 months corrected age. The scale ranges from 0 to 20 points, and it is hypothesized that lower scores will be observed for the intervention group.

Infant temperament is measured using the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ-R) at 12 months corrected age. The IBQ-R consists of 37 items on a 7-point scale, and it is hypothesized that less problematic behaviour will be observed for the intervention group, i.e. the intervention group will have higher scores on smiling, laughter and soothability subscales and lower scores on the fear and distress to limitations subscales.

### Precision grip function after free toe transfer in children with hypoplastic digits [^113gNSfo]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Although toe-to-hand transfer has a defined role in the management of congenital hand deformities, it remains unclear how well children integrate the transferred digits into physiological grasping. We analysed fingertip forces in the precision grip of 13 patients when lifting a test object more than three years after free toe transfer for absent or hypoplastic digits. Clinically, most patients showed normal sensibility of transferred digits, but active motion and pinch strength were limited as compared to the normal hand. For the control of fingertip forces, two key features of the normal two-digit opposition grip were seen in all operated hands: adaptation of grip force to object weight and parallel coordination of lift and grip forces. These physiological grasping strategies developed independently of the patients' age at the time of operation, which ranged from one to 13 years. In four patients, we observed increased tangential load forces with the operated hand due to misalignments in the application of fingertips on the grasp surfaces. Such forces lead to increased grip force requirements on both fingers that may overload transferred digits with limited motor function. The need for optimal alignment of the grip axis during toe-transfer surgery is emphasised.

### Surgical treatment for the thumb-in-palm deformity in patients with cerebral palsy [^116JUDyn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Thumb-in-palm deformity in patients with spastic cerebral palsy is a deformity that impairs the ability to use the thumb and thus severely limits hand function. From the variety of operative procedures that have been described, it may be clear that there is no consensus on the surgical treatment of thumb-in-palm deformity.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of surgical interventions for the thumb-in-palm deformity in patients with spastic cerebral palsy; to review the selection criteria to surgically treat thumb-in-palm deformity in these patients; and to review the outcome assessment used in these studies.

Search Strategy

We identified studies for inclusion from searches of several electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (1980 to December 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2004). We also cross-checked the reference lists of these studies to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered a trial eligible for inclusion when it met the following criteria. 1) It was described as a randomized clinical trial, clinical controlled trial or prospective study that compared pre-operative- with post-operative outcome assessment. 2) It concerned patients with thumb-in-palm deformity affected by spastic cerebral palsy. There was no restriction in age. 3) It compared or described any surgical intervention to the thumb. 4) It followed subjects for at least six months. 5) Outcomes described included one or more of the following items: rate of success; functional improvement; active and passive range of motion of the thumb; grasp and release; pinch grip; complications and side effects; and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed each study using a scoring system. Meta-analysis was not possible because the selected studies were poorly designed, and the results were presented in an incompatible form. Therefore, we compiled a descriptive summary of the results of the individual studies. We did not attempt to acquire the raw data for re-analysis.

Main Results

We identified 14 prospective studies that compared preoperative and postoperative outcomes as eligible for inclusion in this review. We found no randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials. The studies with the best available evidence were prospective studies that compared pre- with post-operative assessment. After assessment, we ultimately included nine studies. Participants In all the included studies the participants were more or less homogeneous regarding the most important prognostic indications. The nine included studies treated 234 patients. Age at operation ranged from 4–48 years (Median approximately 11 years). Interventions Twenty-four different specific interventions were performed, or combined, aiming to 1) stabilize the first metacarpophalangeal joint, 2) weaken the spastic thumb adductors, and 3) augment thumb abduction and extension. Outcome measures All of the included studies assessed whether the thumb had stayed out of the palm at follow-up. Additional outcome measures varied among studies. Selection criteria There was no consensus on the selection criteria for eligibility for surgical treatment. There was also considerable variety in the use of methods of assessment among the studies. There is no standardized method to evaluate the pre- and post-operative data, and most of the assessment methods were not validated. It was impossible to compare the outcomes among studies. Judgement about the effectiveness of one particular surgical intervention was not possible, because different surgical interventions and co-interventions were used within most studies. Nonetheless, generally, the outcome of surgical treatment of thumb-in-palm deformity was considered satisfactory to both patients and to surgeons in all studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Because the methodological quality of the studies is poor, it is impossible to provide a reliable judgement of the role of surgery for thumb-in-palm deformity. This review has demonstrated the need for randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials on the surgical treatment of thumb-in-palm deformity. Surgical reconstruction appears to improve hand function, to facilitate hygiene, and to improve the appearance and quality of life. For patient selection, a validated classification system should be developed to determine the type and extent of the cerebral palsied hand. The influence of age, intelligence, and voluntary muscle control still needs to be investigated. Investigators should focus on one particular surgical intervention or a specific group of interventions to find out which procedures produce the best functional improvement.

### Development of functional organization within the sensorimotor network across the perinatal period [^114scTDC]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is increasingly appreciated that complex voluntary motor behavior is encoded in the human brain through a highly organized network of neural connectivity. A key component of this network is the sensorimotor cortex (primary somatosensory and motor cortices), which is organized in a somatotopic fashion such that the processing relating to different body parts are mapped to specific locations within the cortex (Penfield & Boldrey). Connectivity patterns between these cortical territories reflect motor experiences and are stronger between those territories related to body parts that usually cooperate during everyday functions (Ejaz, Hamada, & Diedrichsen). Specifically, homolog areas are the most connected (van den Heuvel & Pol; Stark et al.) and neighboring cortical areas are also strongly connected (Long, Goltz, Margulies, Nierhaus, & Villringer; Thomas Yeo et al.). This topographical specialization constitutes the backbone underlying motor skills both ontogenetically and phylogenetically (Kuehn et al.).

While it is known that a crude somatotopy is already present in the sensorimotor cortex before the normal time of birth (Dall'Orso et al.), it is likely that the aforementioned specific patterns of connectivity must also arise in early life to provide a substrate for the rapid development of essential motor skills in early childhood. However, detailed spatial and temporal knowledge about the early evolution of functional organization within the human sensorimotor network is currently missing, mainly because of the challenges inherent to studying the brain across the perinatal period. This limitation has been addressed through recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods via the Developing Human Connectome Project [dHCP:(Fitzgibbon et al.)] which allow precise characterization of these maturational process across a large population of infants in the period corresponding to the third trimester of human gestation. Studying preterm infants in this cohort also provides an opportunity to directly test the potentially contrasting developmental roles of intrinsic genetic factors and environmental influences. Furthermore, understanding typical sensorimotor network development will help provide mechanistic insight into how early deviations may result in specific patterns of adverse motor outcome later in life and enable early identification of affected children when this development is atypical. Although it has been shown that disruption of neonatal functional connectivity in children with perinatal brain injury predicts later developmental outcome more reliably than structural MRI (Linke et al.), current functional connectivity measures are coarse and lack specificity. A detailed analysis of the spatial organization of functional connectivity in the immature sensorimotor cortex is missing.

### Neurodevelopmental outcome of extremely low birth weight infants at 24 months corrected age: a comparison between griffiths and bayley scales [^111aPxG4]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Bayley scales

The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition yields two single age-standardized composite scores (range 50–150): a Mental Development Index (MDI), which measures cognition through sensory perception, knowledge, memory, problem solving and early language abilities, and a Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), which assesses fine and gross motor skills.

The third revision of the scales (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition) produces three composite scores: the Cognitive scale (range 55–145), which assesses sensorimotor development, exploration and manipulation, object relatedness, concept formation, memory and simple problem solving; the Language scale (range 45–155), which consists of Receptive Communication (verbal comprehension, vocabulary) and Expressive Communication (babbling, gesturing and utterances) subtests; and the Motor scale (range 45–155), which consists of Fine Motor (grasping, perceptual-motor integration, motor planning and speed) and Gross Motor (sitting, standing, locomotion and balance) subtests.

Both editions of the Bayley Scales have index mean scores of 100 (SD ± 15). In the present study, an index composite score of < 70 (> 2 SD below the mean) is defined to indicate severe impairment, while an index composite score of 70–84 (> 1 SD below the mean) is defined to indicate mild impairment. Index composite scores ≥ 85 are defined here to indicate normal development.

Because neither the Bayley-II nor the Bayley-III has been normed in Italy, the USA norms of the scales were used in this study. The Bayley-II administration manual was translated into Italian through the back-translation method. Before starting the study, the Italian version of the Bayley-II administration manual was tested with a group of infants to clarify any doubts on item comprehension. For the Bayley-III, the Italian validated translation of the administration manual was used.

### Motor development interventions for preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Kefsd]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Contexts

Preterm infants are at an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay. Some studies report positive intervention effects on motor outcomes, but it is currently unclear which motor activities are most effective in the short and longer term.

Objective

The aim of the study was to identify interventions that improve the motor development of preterm infants.

Data Sources

An a priori protocol was agreed upon. Seventeen electronic databases from 1980 to April 2015 and gray literature sources were searched.

Study Selection

Three reviewers screened the articles.

Data Extraction

The outcome of interest was motor skills assessment scores. All data collection and risk of bias assessments were agreed upon by the 3 reviewers.

Results

Forty-two publications, which reported results from 36 trials (25 randomized controlled trials and 11 nonrandomized studies) with a total of 3484 infants, met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted by using standardized mean differences on 21 studies, with positive effects found at 3 months (mean 1.37; confidence interval 0.48–2.27), 6 months (0.34; 0.11–0.57), 12 months (0.73; 0.20–1.26), and 24 months (0.28; 0.07–0.49). At 3 months, there was a large and significant effect size for motor-specific interventions (2.00; 0.28–3.72) but not generic interventions (0.33; -0.03 to -0.69). Studies were not excluded on the basis of quality; therefore, heterogeneity was significant and the random-effects model was used.

Limitations

Incomplete or inconsistent reporting of outcome measures limited the data available for meta-analysis beyond 24 months.

Conclusions

A positive intervention effect on motor skills appears to be present up to 24 months' corrected age. There is some evidence at 3 months that interventions with specific motor components are most effective.

### Learning of grasp control in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy [^114znR19]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

This study examined whether children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) have anticipatory control of fingertip forces during lifts of familiar objects, and what type of practice (blocked or random) best enhances the retention of anticipatory control during lifts of novel objects. Eighteen children with hemiplegic CP (7 females, 11 males; 7 to 14 years of age, mean age 10 years, SD 1.8) and 18 age-matched typically developing children (8 males, 10 females; mean age 10.4 years, SD 1.7) participated in the study. In the first experiment the children lifted familiar objects of various weights and sizes five times each, while the vertical lifting (load) force was measured. Most participants demonstrated higher rates of load force increase for heavier (and larger) objects already during the first lift, indicating anticipatory control. Furthermore, the load force rates generally were similar across the five lifts for each object, suggesting that they had stable representations of the objects' properties. In the second experiment children lifted three novel objects varying in weight (but identical in volume) 27 times each, in either a blocked or a random order, followed by nine immediate and nine delayed (24 hours) retention trials. Blocked practice resulted in greater differentiation of the force rates between objects during acquisition than did random practice. Both practice schedules resulted in similar retention. These findings suggest that children with hemiplegic CP have a priori internal representations used for anticipatory force scaling with familiar objects. Furthermore, the results indicate that these children can form and retain internal representations of novel objects for anticipatory control, irrespective of the type of practice schedule employed. Thus, clinically based practice sessions that incorporate lifts with novel objects may enhance anticipatory force scaling and related prehensile function in children with hemiplegic CP.

### Movement planning reflects skill level and age changes in toddlers [^113hPktt]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

Kinematic measures of children's reaching were found to reflect stable differences in skill level for planning for future actions. Thirty-five toddlers (18–21 months) were engaged in building block towers (precise task) and in placing blocks into an open container (imprecise task). Sixteen children were retested on the same tasks a year later. Longer deceleration as the hand approached the block for pickup was found in the tower task compared with the imprecise task, indicating planning for the second movement. More skillful toddlers who could build high towers had a longer deceleration phase when placing blocks on the tower than toddlers who built low towers. Kinematic differences between the groups remained a year later when all children could build high towers.

### Growth diagrams for grip strength in children [^115P318r]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Some limitations must be mentioned regarding our study. First, the growth diagrams apply only to a healthy population of children and do not represent the development of the grip strength of a child with hand disorders such as neuromuscular diseases or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our data apply only to the age range of 4 to 12 years and no reliable predictions can be made for children older than 12 years. In a previous study, we quantified the measurement error of this instrument in children. The Lode dynamometer was found to be reliable in healthy children from 4 to 12 years old. Reliability increased with age and children 12 years old had reliability similar to that of adults. In addition, based on our clinical experience when measuring children, it is generally too difficult to reliably measure children as young as 3 years. For these reasons, we used the lower age limit of 4 years. We studied the group from 4 to 12 years old, as this age group is relevant in our work with patients with congenital hand malformations. During the period from 4 to 12 years, these children often are treated multiple times for their specific congenital malformations. Intervention and intensive therapy are very important to their development, dexterity, and growth.

### Development of functional organization within the sensorimotor network across the perinatal period [^1117qoQo]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

In the mature human brain, the neural processing related to different body parts is reflected in patterns of functional connectivity, which is strongest between functional homologs in opposite cortical hemispheres. To understand how this organization is first established, we investigated functional connectivity between limb regions in the sensorimotor cortex in 400 preterm and term infants aged across the equivalent period to the third trimester of gestation (32-45weeks postmenstrual age). Masks were obtained from empirically derived functional responses in neonates from an independent data set. We demonstrate the early presence of a crude but spatially organized functional connectivity, that rapidly matures across the preterm period to achieve an adult-like configuration by the normal time of birth. Specifically, connectivity was strongest between homolog regions, followed by connectivity between adjacent regions (different limbs but same hemisphere) already in the preterm brain, and increased with age. These changes were specific to the sensorimotor network. Crucially, these trajectories were strongly dependent on age more than age of birth. This demonstrates that during the perinatal period the sensorimotor cortex undergoes preprogrammed changes determining the functional movement organization that are not altered by preterm birth in absence of brain injury.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^116FzuBZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a result of a spectrum of early acquired disturbance to the developing brain. The brain abnormalities or insults that cause CP can appear at different time points during pregnancy and in the neonatal period. To date, there are no biological or pharmacological treatments. However, neurobiological research suggests that the effectiveness of the neural networks and pathways can be strengthened by early interventions. Despite the rather large population of individuals with CP world-wide, there is still a lack of evidence-based early intervention programs that make it possible to utilize the therapeutic window that the rapid brain development and adaptability of the central nervous system during the first year of life represents. This paper describes the rationale, contents, and structure of the Small Step Program, an early intervention program for children at risk of developing CP. The Small Step Program was designed to provide individualized, goal directed, and intensive intervention within three distinct foci (hand use, mobility, and communication) in the child's own home environment and carried out by their parents who have been educated and coached by therapists.

### Upper limb impairments, process skills, and outcome in children with unilateral cerebral palsy [^114WwpHc]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The finding that sensory function directly influences manual ability significantly, with its indirect effect on ISC through manual ability and process skills, is novel. Disturbed sensory input from the affected hand of children with unilateral CP leads to reduced internal representation of the properties of objects, producing a reduction in anticipatory control 17, 60 and thus the ability to manipulate objects in the hand and to grasp effectively. 9 As sensation improves, so does manual ability, but only because sensation facilitates control as information is processed. This interplay between sensory function, manual ability, and process skills leading to changes in anticipatory control and influencing functional outcome is consistent with the model presented. Demonstrated in the model is that sensory function is critical to functional outcome, and overall a greater emphasis needs to be developed in clinical practice to record and potentially treat sensory function 61 and process skills in children with unilateral CP.

Age was a factor that was strongly and indirectly related to ISC through its direct effect on process skills, but it impacted function negatively through manual ability. Functional improvement in explicit motor learning was found to be correlated with age. 59, 62 Proposed here is a model supporting this hypothesis through the process skills component. Studies also revealed age effects, with improvements in grip strength, 5 spontaneous hand use, 13 and grasping efficiency 20 over time. As children grow and develop, tasks generally increase in complexity and differences in ability compared with typically developing peers may become more apparent in the presence of processing difficulties. This provides further credibility to the model presented, with the inclusion of processing skills allowing better adaptation for more efficient movement of the upper limb. In contrast, the negative effect of age on manual ability is also explained in the literature. Manual ability as defined in the model relied on assessments of symmetry of movement, supination ability and range, and muscle power generation. With age, contractures across the elbow, wrist, and pronators of the upper limb can lead to a reduction in function, with surgical release procedures allowing for improvements. 6

### Shoulder shrug maneuver to facilitate delivery during shoulder dystocia [^1171v8pe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

TECHNIQUE

The shoulder shrug technique is a modification of previously described maneuvers that attempt to resolve a shoulder dystocia. The technique is shown in Video 1, available online at. The technique requires the obstetrician to follow certain steps (Fig. 1 A–F) to resolve the dystocia:
Grasp the posterior shoulder at the axilla using the obstetrician's thumb and index finger in a pincer grip so that the tips of the thumb and index finger come together in the axillary fossa.
Pull the axilla out toward the head of the neonate to shrug the shoulder and retract the shoulder toward the vaginal opening.
Maintain the pincer grip of the shrugged shoulder and, using the opposite hand, hold the head and retracted shoulder together as a unit
Rotate this unit toward the neonate's face 180 degrees (this will allow the impacted anterior shoulder to roll toward neonate's chest as it moves toward the posterior position). If unable to rotate toward the face, the opposite direction may be attempted.
As long as the shrugged shoulder remains inferior to the symphysis pubis, it will be deliverable anteriorly.
Now proceed with delivery of the remaining shoulder posteriorly. On rotation, the trapped anterior shoulder should be deliverable posteriorly.

Fig. 1.
Failure of progression due to shoulder dystocia. Flex the neck toward the anterior shoulder, then slide hand behind the posterior shoulder (A). Clamp the thumb and index finger around the posterior shoulder (B). With the thumb and index finger, form a pincer grip through the axilla, resembling an "OK" sign (C). Retract the posterior shoulder toward the shrug position (elevation of the shoulder). Arrow represents movement of the posterior shoulder to the shrug position (D). Restore the head toward the body's axis to form the head–shoulder unit and rotate this unit 180 degrees in the direction of the chest. Arrow represents counterclockwise rotation of the head and shoulder unit (E). On rotation, the anterior shoulder is now posterior and has advanced from the dystocia; normal delivery now proceeds with minimal forward traction. Arrow represents delivery of the neonate (F).

### Mirror movements in healthy humans across the lifespan: effects of development and ageing [^114a9yqL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

mirror movements are a transient phenomenon during childhood, which decrease in intensity with motor development. An increasing inhibitory competence resulting in the ability of movement lateralization is thought to be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to quantify unintended mirror movements systematically across the lifespan and to investigate the influences of age, sex, handedness, and task frequency.

Method

a total of 236 participants (127 females, 109 males; 216 right-handed, 20 left-handed; age range 3-96y, median 25y 8mo) first performed four clinical routine tests while mirror movements were rated by the observer. They were then asked to hold a force transducer in each hand between the thumb and index finger and to perform oscillatory grip force changes in one hand, while the other hand had to prevent the force transducer from dropping.

Results

age showed a strong nonlinear effect on the mirror-movement ratio (the amplitude ratio of the mirror and active hand, adjusted by the respective maximum grip force). Initially, there was a steep decline in the mirror-movement ratio during childhood and adolescence, followed by a gradual rise during adulthood. Males had lower mirror-movement ratios than females. The high-frequency condition triggered lower mirror-movement ratios. No significant differences of mirror movements between dominant and non-dominant hand, or left- and right-handed participants, were found.

Interpretation

this study provides, for the first time to our knowledge, normative values of mirror movements across the lifespan that can aid differentiation between physiological and pathological mirror movements.

### Efficacy of the small step program in a randomised controlled trial for infants below age 12 months with clinical signs of CP; a study protocol [^111dx9qS]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Mobility is based on the assumption that children have an inner drive to move and to explore their environment. The overall objective of the intensive practice of new functional goals of gross motor function will optimize the infant's possibilities to perform meaningful activities in daily life as they grow older. The training aims to increase postural control and mobility. Training will be tailored in relation to each child with respect to individual strengths and interests. Manual management will be provided to increase the child's own stability when intending to move and when introducing new functional activities. The manual management is withdrawn gradually as the child demonstrates improved ability to manage and control a sequence of the activity. Less "hands on" assistance will be required, and the children will experience enjoyment with increasing competence in their own body and by learning from trial and error. The manual management is aimed to reduce the degrees of freedom in different joints rather than to facilitate activities as is the case in most previous neurodevelopmental approaches. Once a motor skill is learned, variability of practice is introduced to increase the complexity and generalizability of the skill. To stimulate the child's gross motor activity and intention to move, parents are encouraged to interact with the child and help them to keep their attention on the tasks being practiced. The environment (different rooms, furniture, and toys) in the child's home will be arranged to motivate and challenge the child to repeatedly practice towards the expected goals with gradually increasing levels of ability. Parents will also be encouraged to use everyday situations, for example, when the child has to turn around or sit up after changing diapers. Using familiar situations like placing the child in front of a parent's drawer, which parents often open and pick objects from, will motivate the child to stand up to attempt to reach the objects in the drawer. For children with pronounced motor delays, parents will be encouraged to bring them up into a standing position to promote physical activity and to provide stimulation and experiences of changing positions. Parents will be encouraged to use baby-walkers and other equipment to give the child the opportunity to stand and move around and explore their environment independently.

### Detection of pediatric upper extremity motor activity and deficits with accelerometry [^117DkVao]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Developmental delays affect approximately 1 in 6 children in the United States and are a common medical issue seen by pediatric primary care professionals. The costs associated with disability are substantial and continue throughout life. To improve long-term outcomes, standard care has incorporated early developmental screening of infants and young children, leading to increased identification of delays and subsequent referral to appropriate services. Developmental delays in the first years of life can be subtle, difficult to detect by parents, and not immediately obvious in brief clinical encounters. Improving methods for the early detection of deficits would allow for earlier intervention during critical periods of rapid development and thus could reduce disability and associated costs.

Motor development is the earliest observable benchmark of developmental progress because of its rapid, predictable advancement in young children. Developmental milestones in other domains are not as easily tracked and are difficult to measure at young ages. Arguably, then, motor development is the best target for early identification of more widespread disability. Yet accurate measurements of real-world motor behavior have been challenging. Hence, simple, affordable, and quantitative measurements of movement using wearable biosensors, such as accelerometers, during childhood could improve pediatric screenings for developmental delays.

### Development of hand function during the first year of life in children with unilateral cerebral palsy [^111xm4qh]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To identify developmental trajectories of hand function in infants aged 3 months to 12 months with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP).

Method

Infants at high risk of unilateral CP were recruited from 3 months of age from follow-up programmes and clinics in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, and Australia. Measurements on the Hand Assessment for Infants (HAI) were completed until 12 months of age. Group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify subgroups of infants with similar trajectories of development. Multinomial logistic regression determined associations between demographic variables and trajectory membership.

Results

Ninety-seven infants (52 males, 45 females; median gestational age 38wks [interquartile range 30-40wks]) were included. Infants were assessed between two and seven times (mean 4, SD 1.2) with a total of 387 observations. A three-group trajectory model identified a 'low-functioning group' (n = 45: 46%), 'moderate-functioning group' (n = 30: 31%), and 'high-functioning group' (n = 22: 23%). Mean posterior probabilities (0.91–0.96) and odds of correct classification (26.3–33.2) indicated good model fit. Type of brain lesion, sex, side of hemiplegia, country, gestational age, and access to intensive intervention were not associated with group membership.

Interpretation

Three trajectories of hand function development for infants with unilateral CP were identified and indicate some greater distinctions between groups with increasing age. The HAI is a valuable measure, capturing development of hand function of infants with unilateral CP over time.

What This Paper Adds

Three distinct developmental trajectories of hand function in infants with unilateral cerebral palsy were identified. A low-functioning group made little progress in development of hand function in the first year of life. The degree of impairment on the impaired hand at 6 months of age is highly associated with trajectory membership. Infants with all types of brain lesion were represented across each trajectory group.

### The parietal architecture binding cognition to sensorimotor integration: a multimodal causal study [^117MgTYT]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Prehension assessment

The visually guided reaching-to-grasping abilities were assessed using the ARAT scale, which is composed of 19 items divided in four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch and gross movements. For the specific purpose of the study, the items were performed with the right upper limb (contralateral to the affected hemisphere). The ARAT was performed following standardized protocol and scoring. Instructions were read aloud and a visual demonstration for each item was provided. A time limit of 60 s was set to complete each task. The performance of each task was scored from 0 to 3: score = 3 was given when the task was performed correctly in < 5 s (behavioural criteria outlined by Yozbatiran et al.); score = 2 when the task was completed with overt abnormal hand and/or arm movements or with delay (from 6 to 60 s); score = 1 when the task was partially performed within the 60 s; score = 0 when none of the hand or arm movements required by the task were performed in 60 s. Relevant parameters adopted for the evaluation of the hand-arm performance of all sub-items were: (i) smoothness and precision of the reaching movement toward the object-space; and (ii) stability and congruency of the grip for each specific target. Since the focus of the ARAT, in the present study, was the clinical assessment of the visually guided reaching-to-grasping movements, the score obtained with gross movements was not included in the analysis, thus the maximum ARAT score (ARAT global score) was 48.

### Pirfenidone vs. nintedanib for fibrotic lung disease after… [^113Jj1cX]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Pirfenidone vs. Nintedanib for Fibrotic Lung Disease After Coronavirus Disease-19 Pneumonia ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Since the early part of 2020, the entire world has been affected by a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The disease has a short incubation period and is highly transmissible. Clinically, most patients make a complete recovery after COVID pneumonia. Other patients may demonstrate some signs of recovery from the acute illness with resolution of fever and recovery of organ functions, however they continue to have some degree of breathlessness, persistent infiltrates on radiologic studies, and/or hypoxemia. The CT abnormalities in these patients are commonly characterized by patchy, multifocal consolidation and ground-glass opacities suggestive of the OP pattern. Coarse reticulation and parenchymal bands may also be present.

Patients with such diffuse lung disease after COVID-19, herein referred to as post-COVID diffuse lung disease are often treated with glucocorticoids. Although most patients with a predominant OP pattern of injury would have a resolution of lung parenchymal abnormalities either spontaneously or with glucocorticoids, some of them might develop signs of lung fibrosis, in the form of traction bronchiectasis and/or honeycombing. Some subjects have ongoing respiratory symptoms despite treatment with steroids, and they may be found to have persistent reticulation or non-resolving consolidation on chest imaging that may represent early fibrosis. Contacts and Locations This section provides contact details for people who can answer questions about joining this study, and information on where this study is taking place. To learn more, please see the Chandigarh, India.
- Persistent respiratory symptoms
- Having post-COVID parenchymal involvement > 10% of the lung parenchyma on visual inspection of the scans with the presence of radiologic signs of fibrosis, or having persistent reticulation or persistent consolidation despite a trial of glucocorticoids for a minimum period of 4 weeks after discharge for the acute COVID-19 illness.

### Promoting optimal development: identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through developmental surveillance and screening [^111HCqoP]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Additional screening at other ages — If concerns about a child's development are raised at other times, it is appropriate to perform additional developmental screening using validated tests; this screening may require a separate visit and should be conducted as soon as possible, and if a child has missed a 9-, 18-, or 30-month visit, a developmental screen should be administered at the next opportunity.
