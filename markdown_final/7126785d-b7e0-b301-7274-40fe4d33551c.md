## Question

Umbilical hernia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about umbilical hernia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how adult and pediatric cases differ. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and extract PICO elements. Next, I will appraise the highest-quality evidence for adults, followed by pediatric data. After that, I need to consider special populations like cirrhosis, pregnancy, and obesity. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations and highlight controversies and knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Umbilical hernias are common midline defects with different natural history and risks in adults versus children, so management must be age-specific and symptom-driven. In adults, most are acquired and carry nontrivial recurrence risk, whereas in children, most congenital defects close spontaneously and complications are rare, which justifies watchful waiting in asymptomatic cases [^e7c8bc4e] [^7c96ad82] [^a1449be0].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and frame the PICO questions. The strongest evidence for adults is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing mesh versus suture repair in 1–4 cm defects, with recurrence as the primary outcome. For pediatrics, the best available evidence consists of systematic reviews and large cohort studies on spontaneous closure and complication rates. Special populations such as cirrhosis with ascites and pregnancy require guideline synthesis and observational data due to limited RCTs [^a16da483] [^7c96ad82] [^f4141d2d] [^56002710].

> Now, let me appraise the adult evidence. The Lancet RCT in 300 adults with 1–4 cm primary umbilical hernias showed significantly fewer recurrences with mesh repair at 24 months (4% vs 12%; HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.80; NNT ≈ 13), with no significant difference in serious complications, supporting routine mesh use in this size range. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and confidence intervals; yes, the hazard ratio and absolute difference are consistent across sensitivity analyses, strengthening the recommendation for mesh in small-to-moderate defects [^a16da483]. Observational long-term data reinforce that mesh reduces recurrence compared with suture repair, with ascites and obesity as major recurrence drivers, and mesh conferring an approximate 72% reduction in recurrence risk in multivariable models [^6c2c2659].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about approach. I initially thought laparoscopic repair universally reduces wound complications, but I should double-check head-to-head data. Nationwide Danish registry data show lower superficial SSI with laparoscopic repair yet higher rates of severe complications and similar long-term recurrence, so approach should be individualized rather than assumed superior for laparoscopy. Similarly, ACS NSQIP analyses suggest lower wound morbidity with laparoscopy but longer operative times and more cardiopulmonary complications, underscoring the need to match technique to patient risk and anatomy [^b4083990] [^af2e2bc3]. For very small defects under 1–2 cm, primary suture may still be reasonable, but I should confirm that even small defects have meaningful recurrence with suture alone; indeed, contemporary series report 4.9–27% recurrence with primary suture, supporting a low threshold for mesh even in small hernias when risk factors are present [^2ac9d67d].

> Next, I should review pediatric evidence. Systematic reviews and large cohorts consistently support expectant management until 4–5 years because roughly 85–90% close spontaneously and complications are uncommon. Incarceration and strangulation occur in about 0.16–0.81%, and larger defect size and prematurity reduce the likelihood of spontaneous closure, which should guide counseling and follow-up intervals [^7c96ad82] [^b2280882] [^c5e515e6]. But wait, what if practice patterns contradict this? Population-based studies show substantial early surgery rates and persistent variation across hospitals, indicating overtreatment and potential harm from unnecessary anesthesia and procedures, reinforcing guideline-concordant observation in asymptomatic children [^2e6cebb0] [^84523cde] [^1207c2f0].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with cirrhosis and ascites. Cirrhotic patients have a high prevalence of umbilical hernias and face markedly increased morbidity and mortality with emergency repair, whereas elective repair after optimization of ascites and nutrition is safer. Nonoperative management of complicated hernias carries 60–88% mortality, so early elective repair with ascites control is favored when feasible. TIPS can be considered for refractory ascites to facilitate repair and reduce recurrence, and multidisciplinary planning is essential [^f4141d2d] [^8923bee9] [^31b8a6c7]. I should confirm that even in decompensated cirrhosis, outcomes vary by Child-Pugh and MELD; indeed, Child-Pugh C and MELD ≥ 20 are associated with very high risk, and surgery should generally be deferred unless life-threatening complications mandate intervention [^8923bee9] [^de580b5b].

> Let me consider pregnancy. Data are limited to small series, but watchful waiting through pregnancy with postpartum repair is reasonable because incarceration is rare and postpartum repair yields outcomes comparable to nonpregnant patients. I should note that this is based on low-quality evidence, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are key, especially if the hernia becomes symptomatic or incarcerated [^56002710].

> For obesity, I need to ensure we address recurrence and wound risk. Higher BMI is associated with increased recurrence and wound complications; mesh repair mitigates recurrence, and laparoscopic approaches may reduce wound morbidity, though operative times are longer and patient selection matters. In super-super obesity, emergency repair carries high mortality, arguing for elective, risk-stratified management whenever possible [^6c2c2659] [^b4083990] [^d1f82f3a].

> Now, I should synthesize practical recommendations. For adults with defects 1–4 cm, mesh repair reduces recurrence and should be standard; for defects under 1–2 cm, mesh remains reasonable when risk factors are present given the 5–27% recurrence with suture alone. Approach should be individualized: open preperitoneal mesh is straightforward and widely applicable, while laparoscopy may benefit patients with high wound risk or concomitant procedures, acknowledging longer operative times and different complication profiles. In all cases, optimize modifiable risks such as obesity, diabetes, and smoking to reduce recurrence and complications [^a16da483] [^2ac9d67d] [^b4083990] [^6c2c2659]. For children, observe asymptomatic hernias until 4–5 years unless the defect is very large, fails to regress, or complications arise; earlier repair is reasonable for symptomatic hernias, skin changes, or parental preference after counseling. I should confirm that families are counseled on red flags and when to seek urgent care, which is standard in pediatric guidance [^7c96ad82] [^a1449be0].

> But wait, what about controversies and uncertainties? The optimal mesh type and fixation method remain debated, with limited high-quality comparative data. Biologic versus synthetic mesh in contaminated fields, lightweight versus heavyweight polypropylene, and suture versus tacker fixation are areas where practice varies and evidence is evolving, so surgeon experience and patient factors should guide choices. Similarly, the exact size threshold below which mesh offers no benefit in adults is unsettled, and ongoing trials may refine this boundary [^notfound]. In pediatrics, while most guidelines endorse observation to 4–5 years, some centers still repair earlier, reflecting persistent practice variation and the need for broader dissemination of evidence-based recommendations [^2e6cebb0] [^84523cde].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. For adult umbilical hernias, mesh repair reduces recurrence and should be favored in defects 1–4 cm and considered in smaller defects with risk factors, with approach tailored to anatomy and comorbidity. For pediatric umbilical hernias, observation to 4–5 years is safe and preferred in asymptomatic children, reserving surgery for persistent defects, symptoms, or complications. Across all scenarios, elective repair after optimization yields better outcomes than emergency surgery, particularly in cirrhosis and other high-risk states [^a16da483] [^7c96ad82] [^f4141d2d].

---

Umbilical hernia management is **individualized by age, size, and symptoms**. In adults, **mesh repair is preferred** for defects > 1 cm or with risk factors (obesity, chronic cough, ascites) because it lowers recurrence [^a16da483] [^6c2c2659]; open preperitoneal mesh is standard, with laparoscopy for larger defects or wound-risk patients [^34e73480]. In children, **observe until age 4–5** [^7c96ad82] because most close spontaneously [^a1449be0]; repair if persistent, > 1.5 cm, or symptomatic, using open primary closure or absorbable suture [^notfound]. Emergencies (incarceration, strangulation, rupture) require urgent repair, with mesh avoided in contamination; in cirrhosis, optimize ascites and consider TIPS before elective repair [^f4141d2d] [^8923bee9]. Recurrence is lower with mesh [^a16da483] and higher with obesity, ascites, or suture-only repair [^6c2c2659].

## Indications for repair

### Adults

- **Symptomatic hernias**: Pain, discomfort, or cosmetic concerns [^e7c8bc4e].
- **Defect size**: > 1 cm or progressive enlargement [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Obesity, chronic cough, ascites, or multiple pregnancies [^2ac9a67d] [^f4141d2d].
- **Complications**: Incarceration, strangulation, or rupture [^d668f8f2].

---

### Pediatric patients

- **Age**: Observe until 4–5 years; most close spontaneously [^7c96ad82] [^a1449be0].
- **Size**: Defects > 1.5 cm are less likely to close [^1ffce442].
- **Symptoms**: Persistent bulge, pain, or parental concern [^e1f22752].
- **Complications**: Incarceration or strangulation (rare, ~0.16–0.81%) [^b2280882].

## Surgical techniques

| **Technique** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Open preperitoneal mesh | Standard for adults; defects > 1 cm | Low recurrence; good outcomes [^a16da483] [^34e73480] | Wound infection; seroma [^b4083990] |
| Laparoscopic mesh | Large defects; wound risk; recurrent hernias | Less wound infection; faster recovery [^b4083990] [^901c82eb] | Longer OR time; specialized equipment [^af2e2bc3] |
| Primary suture | Small defects (< 1 cm); children | Simple; no mesh | Higher recurrence; not for large defects [^a16da483] [^6c2c2659] |
| Biologic mesh | Contaminated field; strangulation | Lower infection risk | Higher cost; recurrence risk [^03159f57] |

## Special considerations

### Cirrhosis with ascites

In cirrhosis with ascites, **preoperative optimization** — medical control of ascites and nutrition — is essential [^f4141d2d] [^31b8a6c7]. Elective repair is preferred over emergency repair due to lower morbidity and mortality [^b31fe017] [^80e86095]. TIPS may be considered for refractory ascites to facilitate repair [^f4141d2d] [^8923bee9].

---

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **observation** is appropriate unless complications occur [^56002710]. Postpartum repair is safe and effective after delivery.

---

### Pediatric patients

For pediatric patients, **observation** is appropriate until age 4–5 unless the defect is large or symptomatic [^7c96ad82] [^a1449be0]. Open primary closure is standard; absorbable suture is commonly used [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative complications

- **Recurrence**: Lower with mesh; higher with obesity, ascites, or suture-only repair [^a16da483] [^6c2c2659].
- **Infection**: More common with open repair; less with laparoscopic [^b4083990] [^901c82eb].
- **Seroma/hematoma**: Occurs in ~3–5% [^notfound].
- **Wound complications**: Higher in obesity, diabetes, or smoking [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence

Follow-up should include regular visits for **early detection of recurrence or complications**. Recurrence is less frequent with mesh and more likely with suture-only repair, obesity, or ascites [^a16da483] [^6c2c2659].

---

Umbilical hernia management is **tailored to age, size, and symptoms**, with mesh repair favored in adults to reduce recurrence and observation favored in children until spontaneous closure is unlikely. Emergencies require urgent repair, and cirrhosis demands careful perioperative planning.

### Guidelines for treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias from the European hernia society and americas hernia society [^34e73480]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are frequently performed surgical procedures with an expected low complication rate. Nevertheless, the optimal method of repair with best short- and long-term outcomes remains debatable. The aim was to develop guidelines for the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Methods

The guideline group consisted of surgeons from Europe and North America including members from the European Hernia Society and the Americas Hernia Society. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument were used. A systematic literature search was done on 1 May 2018, and updated on 1 February 2019.

Results

Literature reporting specifically on umbilical and epigastric hernias was limited in quantity and quality, resulting in a majority of the recommendations being graded as weak, based on low-quality evidence. The main recommendation was to use mesh for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias to reduce the recurrence rate. Most umbilical and epigastric hernias may be repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh. A laparoscopic approach may be considered if the hernia defect is large, or if the patient has an increased risk of wound morbidity.

Conclusion

This is the first European and American guideline on the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias. It is recommended that symptomatic umbilical and epigastric hernias are repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh.

### Management of asymptomatic pediatric umbilical hernias: a systematic review [^7c96ad82]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uncomplicated pediatric umbilical hernias are common and most close spontaneously. No formal practice guidelines exist regarding the optimal timing and indications for repair. The objective of this review is to examine the existing literature on the natural history of pediatric umbilical hernias, known complications of repair and non-operative approaches, and management recommendations.

Study Design

A systematic literature search was performed to identify publications relating to pediatric umbilical hernias. Inclusion criteria comprised studies addressing recommendations for optimal timing of repair, evidence examining complications from hernias not operatively repaired, and research exploring the likelihood of pediatric umbilical hernias to close spontaneously. In addition, the websites of all pediatric hospitals in the United States were examined for recommendations on operative timing.

Results

A total of 787 manuscripts were reviewed, and 28 met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Studies examined the likelihood of spontaneous closure based on child's age and size of hernia defect, complications of unrepaired umbilical hernias including incarceration, strangulation and evisceration based on child's age and size of defect, incidence of postoperative complications and current recommendations for timing of repair. In addition, 63 (27.5%) of the United States pediatric hospital websites published a wide range of management recommendations.

Conclusion

Despite the high prevalence of pediatric umbilical hernias, there is a paucity of high quality data to guide management. The literature does suggest that expectant management of asymptomatic hernias until age 4-5years, regardless of size of hernia defect, is both safe and the standard practice of many pediatric hospitals.

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^14b366a2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

### Umbilical hernia repair: overview of approaches and review of literature [^e7c8bc4e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are ubiquitous, and surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Umbilical hernia defects can range from small (< 1 cm) to very large/complex hernias, and treatment options should be tailored to the clinical situation. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic options exist for repair, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. In general, mesh should be used for repair, because it has been shown to decrease recurrence rates, even in small hernias. Although outcomes are generally favorable after umbilical hernia repairs, some patients have chronic complaints that are mostly related to recurrences.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^b2280882]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric umbilical hernias affect approximately 10%–30% of live births annually. This rate decreases between 2% and 10% after 1 year, with nearly 90% umbilical hernias resolving spontaneously within the first few years of life. Presently, expectant management, or watchful waiting, is the current medical guideline for monitoring umbilical hernias until children reach 4–5 years of age. Complications that may occur include incarceration and strangulation. The rate of these complications is quite low (0.16%–0.81%). There is no consensus regarding appropriate timing of surgical repair or indications for surgery by any of the major pediatric associations (eg, Canadian Association of Pediatric Surgery, American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Pediatric Surgical Association or the American College of Surgeons). A better understanding of the natural history of uncomplicated umbilical hernias, management and treatment outcomes is required. Additionally, there is minimal evidence on risk factors affecting the likelihood of spontaneous resolution in children. An in-depth analysis of various parameters influencing clinical outcomes, such as spontaneous resolution, has not been elucidated extensively, or at our institution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective chart review on the surgical outcomes of all patients with umbilical hernia treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Canada. The objective was to describe factors of spontaneous resolution, clinical outcomes, such as rate of recurrence, and complications.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^28357757]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In summary, umbilical endometriosis should enter into the differential diagnosis of umbilical tumours, and the workup should include a search for pelvic endometriosis. Surgical excision in this reported case had a 2-year recurrence-free interval but was complicated by a surgical site infection. Several umbilicoplasty techniques exist for optimal cosmesis. We agree with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines which state that surgical management is preferred for extrapelvic endometriosis as it removes the symptomatic mass and provides a histopathological diagnosis. Medical management may have a role in the treatment of umbilical endometriosis although further studies in cases of endometriosis in a hernia are warranted, as it may be futile to attempt medical therapy, prolonging time to surgery. The role of medical management after surgery to prevent recurrence also deserves further study especially in the presence of pelvic endometriosis.

Learning points

Recognise the prevalence of extrapelvic endometriosis in reproductive age women.
Umbilical endometriosis usually presents with catamenial symptoms and can exist within an umbilical hernia.
After complete surgical excision, individualised approaches to umbilical reconstruction based on patient and disease characteristics may be warranted.

### European hernia society guidelines on management of rectus diastasis [^35aca048]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

KQ8 What is the optimal treatment of rectus diastasis with concomitant umbilical or epigastric hernias?

Statement: Mesh-based repair is recommended according to the European Hernia Society and Americas Hernia Society Guidelines for Treatment of Umbilical and Epigastric Hernias. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath may be sufficient to repair the smallest (less than 1 cm) umbilical or epigastric hernias. Other approaches have been reported. The endoscopic subcutaneous dissection followed by linea alba plication with an onlay mesh was the most reported technique.

Recommendation: A mesh-based repair of RD with concomitant midline hernias is suggested. Plication of the linea alba may be sufficient to repair a diastasis associated with small (less than 1 cm) umbilical/epigastric hernias.

Quality of evidence: Low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

KQ9 Is there a role for specific postoperative management of RD repair?

Statement: Abdominal binders appear to aid mobilization, and reduce postoperative pain and psychological stress. They have no effect on seroma formation or pulmonary function. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme is used worldwide.

Recommendation: As a clinical expertise guidance, the use of an abdominal binder in the postoperative period can be suggested. The noted advantages of reduced pain, enhanced mobilization, and their perceived psychological support after surgery, make their contribution modest but of value. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme can be recommended.

Quality of evidence: Very low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^c5e515e6]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results from this study demonstrate that pediatric umbilical hernias are unlikely to become strangulated or incarcerated. The probability of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreases with an increase in defect size while controlling for prematurity and other comorbidities. On the other hand, probability of non-resolution increases with prematurity. In light of these findings, factors such as prematurity and increasing defect size should continue to be considered during the management of children with umbilical hernia in Ontario. Because umbilical hernias are usually a benign condition with a very low complication rate, family physicians should encourage parents to monitor their child's condition until 4–5 years of age while being cognizant of any potential complications. Overall, conservative management is justifiable and appropriate during pediatric monitoring of asymptomatic umbilical hernia.

In conclusion, we aimed to characterize the probability of spontaneous resolution for umbilical hernia in our Eastern Ontario cohort. Overall, our study determined that the odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size. As such, continued monitoring of defect size and prematurity is warranted during umbilical hernia management of children in Ontario.

### Primary uncomplicated ventral hernia repair: guidelines and practice patterns for routine hernia repairs [^a5be199e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical repair of primary umbilical and epigastric hernias are among the most common abdominal operations in the world. The hernia defects range from small (< 1 cm) to large and complex even in the absence of prior incision or repair. Mesh has generally been shown to decrease recurrence rates, and its use and location of placement should be individualized for each patient. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches provide unique considerations for the technical aspects of primary repair with or without mesh augmentation.

### Provincial review of adherence to age-specific guidelines for umbilical hernia repair and trends in management [^1207c2f0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia (UH) is a common pediatric condition, for which delaying surgical repair for asymptomatic UH until after age 3 is recommended due to a high incidence of spontaneous closure. We aimed to determine the adherence to guidelines, rate of urgent surgical repair, outcomes, cost, and interinstitutional referral patterns of UH repair in the province of Quebec (Canada).

Methods

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of children 28 days to 17 years old who underwent UH repair between 2010 and 2020 using health administrative databases. Children who had multiple procedures, or prolonged peri-operative stays were excluded. Early repair was defined as elective surgery at or under age 3.

Results

Of the 3215 children, 1744 (54.2%) were female, and 1872 (58.2%) were treated in a tertiary children's hospital. Guidelines were respected for 2853 out of 3215 children (89.7%). Patients living over 75 km from their treating hospitals (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.33–4.16, P < 0.01), with pre-existing comorbidities (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.96–4.05; P < 0.001), or being treated in a tertiary center (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.45–3.03, P < 0.001) had a higher risk of early repair. Repair at or under age 3 and urgent surgery were associated with significant cost increases of 411$ (P < 0.001) and 558$ (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusion

Quebec has a high rate of adherence to age-specific guidelines for UH repair. Future research should explore factors that explain transfers into tertiary centers, and the extent to which these reflect efficient use of resources.

### An unusual case of umbilical hernia rupture with evisceration [^03e5f1f0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernia is a common pediatric diagnosis for which the initial management is usually nonoperative. The high incidence of spontaneous closure and the infrequency of complications in the first few years of life justify this conservative management strategy. The authors present a case of a 5-month-old girl with a history of prematurity and prolonged ventilatory support, who subsequently experienced bowel evisceration via a previously uncomplicated umbilical hernia.

### Umbilical hernia… [^a94a61f2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The Mayo operation for umbilical hernia was a great advance over the previous unsatisfactory methods of treatment. Ample evidence of this is found in the acclaim with which the operation is hailed in textbooks and other publications appearing during the years following its introduction. It became the standard surgical procedure and is so regarded today. Various minor modifications in the arrangement of flaps and sutures have been published, without material change in the principles of operation. Perhaps the present suggestion may seem merely another such modification, but it is believed that it differs in its basic mechanics and is presented for what it is worth. I have done only the Mayo operation until recently. One patient operated on by this method some six years ago returned after about three years with a slight but definite recurrence consisting of a bulge at the extreme lateral margin of the repair.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^fc0aba7f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Endometriosis affects about 5% of women of reproductive age and was first coined by Sampson as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the endometrium and myometrium. It usually affects the pelvis, including the ovaries, uterosacral ligaments and the pouch of Douglas. Extrapelvic endometriosis is less prevalent and symptomatology varies based on site, making the exact prevalence challenging to estimate. Extrapelvic lesions comprise about 12% of lesions, and abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) is the most common extrapelvic site.

Umbilical endometriosis accounts for about 30–40% of AWE and 0.5–1.0% of all endometriosis and can appear either as a primary lesion in the absence of surgery, also known as Villar's node after Villar first described it in 1886, or as a secondary lesion arising from subsequent scar tissue after abdominal procedures. Patients typically present with a red, purple or black umbilical nodule lesion at the umbilicus and swelling colour/consistency change (83.5%), pain (83%) or bleeding (50.9%) from the umbilicus. Diagnosis is primarily made clinically, though MRI can aid in evaluation. Endometriomas appear homogeneously hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging. Histological findings generally include the presence of endometrial glands and stroma.

Management can include hormonal or surgical therapy. Surgical therapy is typically recommended and involves wide local excision of umbilical endometriosis. Resection of umbilical endometriosis has many advantages; it has been well studied, clearly establishes a diagnosis of endometriosis and rules out malignancy. Surgical management boasts low recurrence rates, decreases risk of malignant transformation and is the most common treatment modality for umbilical endometriosis in the literature.

Conversely, medical management has had varying degrees of success. Hormonal options reported in the literature include oral contraceptives, progestins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues. Small studies have demonstrated symptomatic control through oral contraceptive pills, while others have seen incomplete response, which suggests it may not be curative. Furthermore, there are no sound studies that compare medical to surgical management.

Timely diagnosis and effective treatment can be crucial to improving quality of life and outcomes. In this case, we report a secondary umbilical endometrioma arising from an umbilical hernia in a patient with prior abdominal myomectomy that failed medical management and was successfully treated surgically with excision and simultaneous hernia repair.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^471cd7a2]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aims were to describe the management of umbilical hernias, to define postoperative complications, and to identify the characteristics of patients that were more likely to have spontaneous resolution of their hernia.

Methods

All patients referred for umbilical hernia at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario from January 1990 to April 2017 were examined via retrospective chart review. Spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia was examined using binary logistic regression.

Results

We included 2621 patients presenting with an umbilical hernia. A total of 1587 (60.5%) patients underwent surgical repair at a median age of 3.6 years (IQR 2.3–5.4). Surgical complications consisted of infection (n = 3), bleeding (n = 3), hematoma (n = 3), and anesthesia-related complications (n = 3). For every one-unit increase in defect size, the odds of a spontaneous resolution of the hernia were 5% lower while controlling for prematurity and the presence of comorbidities [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.95; 95% confidence intervel (CI) 0.93 to 0.97]. Premature babies were 80% less likely to experience hernia resolution compared with non-premature babies (aOR = 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74).

Conclusion

The odds of spontaneous resolution were lower for premature babies and were negatively correlated with defect size.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^8331ddac]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (trocar site closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider suturing the fascial defect for trocar sites of ≥ 10 mm, especially after single-incision laparoscopic surgery and for trocars located at the umbilical site.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^a8c46bb6]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for ascites, more specifically with respect to elective hernia repair, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to discuss the suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons, and anesthesiologists.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^2ac9c67d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernias are extremely common, estimated to be prevalent in 23–50 percent of people. They account for approximately 6% to 14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults. 90% of adult umbilical hernias are acquired due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, ascites, pregnancy, or chronic cough. Surgical repair of umbilical hernias is recommended for worsening pain, increase in size, and/or bowel obstructive symptoms. Primary suture repair is the general recommendation for small umbilical hernias, specifically those two centimeters or less in size. However, the risk of hernia recurrence with primary umbilical repair is not insignificant, estimated to be anywhere from 4.9 to 27 percent. The rate of recurrence appears to be related to the dimensions of the hernia, with smaller defects tending to have lower recurrence rate following repair.

Currently, there is little literature to support what suture type will provide the best repair with lowest recurrence risk for primary umbilical hernias. There are a myriad of suture types used for repair. Most commonly used sutures include monofilament absorbable (polydioxanone suture (PDS)), monofilament permanent (Prolene), and braided (Ethibond) suture. Several studies have been conducted to determine which suture is best to use when closing the abdominal cavity with surgeries such as laparotomies. However, in the setting of small primary umbilical hernias little is known about optimal suture choice for repair. While many surgeons use non-absorbable suture, there are also those who use absorbable suture in these cases with reportedly good outcomes.

Our study's primary outcome aims to identify if there is less recurrence based on suture type. Secondary outcomes were evaluated looking for recurrence rates between repair techniques as well as comparisons between permanent and absorbable monofilament suture. In addition, we evaluated the rate of suture granulomas and wound infections.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^d668f8f2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This algorithm developed by the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery emergency general surgery (EGS) algorithms working group addresses the initial evaluation and management of ventral abdominal wall and groin hernias presenting in the emergency setting. The algorithm is intended to serve as a bedside reference for clinicians. It is annotated with letters linked to corresponding text that provides the rationale and references to support these recommendations. The algorithm is not a substitute for the clinical judgment and experience of bedside clinicians and should not be considered as the "standard of care". We encourage institutions to use these recommendations to formulate local protocols but recognize that there are patient-specific factors and institutional resource availability that may require deviation from this algorithm.

Abdominal wall hernia includes ventral hernias (umbilical, incisional, epigastric, spigelian) and groin hernias (inguinal, femoral). While the majority of abdominal wall hernias are treated in the elective setting, there is a subset of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute issues, including severe pain, intestinal obstruction, incarceration, and strangulation. Emergency surgery may be required for patients with an abdominal wall hernia, with an incidence of 16 to 19 emergent hernia repairs per 100,000 person-years. Presentation with acute hernia incarceration (inability to reduce hernia contents) warrants prompt repair, and concern for strangulation (compromise of blood supply to the contents), particularly bowel ischemia, is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to avoid the increased morbidity associated with delay in definitive management. Identifying strangulation can be a clinical challenge as physical examination, laboratory, and imaging findings can be nonspecific. Therefore, the evaluation of patients with abdominal wall hernia in the emergency setting and the decision to proceed with operative intervention should be made using a systematic approach.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^8923bee9]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of umbilical hernia in patients with ascites

In the cirrhotic patient, the incidence of abdominal wall hernia is 16% and reaches 24% in the presence of ascites; more than half of these are umbilical hernias. These progressively enlarge and are prone to complications, including ulceration of the overlying skin, incarceration, strangulation, and rupture. Non-operative management of complicated hernias with antibiotics and dressing changes might result in mortality rates in the range of 60–88%. On the other hand, hernia repair in cirrhosis has often been avoided due to high postoperative morbidity and mortality. Emergency surgery (OR = 10.32, 95% CI 3.66 to 47.82), Child-Pugh-Turcotte class C (OR = 5.52, 1.67 to 32.45), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 3 (OR = 8.65, 3.65 to 87.23) and MELD score ≥ 20 (OR = 2.15, 2.71 to 32.68) are associated with mortality.

A recent retrospective series of 102 patients, who underwent surgical repair of the umbilical hernia in the presence of ascites, included 45 patients having emergency surgery (24 with incarceration, 12 with rupture of the hernia sac, and nine with skin ulceration or necrosis). Morbidity and mortality rates of 37.2% and 3.9%, respectively, were observed. Optimising management of ascites, including LVP and TIPSS perioperatively, could reduce the risk of wound dehiscence and recurrence of hernia.

Recommendations

Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)

### Mesh versus suture repair of umbilical hernia in adults: a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial [^a16da483]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both mesh and suture repair are used for the treatment of umbilical hernias, but for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1–4 cm) there is little evidence whether mesh repair would be beneficial. In this study we aimed to investigate whether use of a mesh was better in reducing recurrence compared with suture repair for smaller umbilical hernias.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial in 12 hospitals (nine in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Italy). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years with a primary umbilical hernia of diameter 1–4 cm, and were randomly assigned (1:1) intraoperatively to either suture repair or mesh repair. In the first 3 years of the inclusion period, blocked randomisation (of non-specified size) was achieved by an envelope randomisation system; after this time computer-generated randomisation was introduced. Patients, investigators, and analysts were masked to the allocated treatment, and participants were stratified by hernia size (1–2 cm and > 2–4 cm). At study initiation, all surgeons were invited to training sessions to ensure they used the same standardised techniques for suture repair or mesh repair. Patients underwent physical examinations at 2 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24–30 months after the operation. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrences of the umbilical hernia after 24 months assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population by physical examination and, in case of any doubt, abdominal ultrasound. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789230.

Findings

Between June 21, 2006, and April 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 300 patients, 150 to mesh repair and 150 to suture repair. The median follow-up was 25·1 months (IQR 15·5–33·4). After a maximum follow-up of 30 months, there were fewer recurrences in the mesh group than in the suture group (six [4%] in 146 patients vs 17 [12%] in 138 patients; 2-year actuarial estimates of recurrence 3·6% [95% CI 1·4–9·4] vs 11·4% (6·8–18·9); p = 0·01, hazard ratio 0·31, 95% CI 0·12–0·80, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 12·8). The most common postoperative complications were seroma (one [< 1%] in the suture group vs five [3%] in the mesh group), haematoma (two [1%] vs three [2%]), and wound infection (one [< 1%] vs three [2%]). There were no anaesthetic complications or postoperative deaths.

Interpretation

This is the first study showing high level evidence for mesh repair in patients with small hernias of diameter 1–4 cm. Hence we suggest mesh repair should be used for operations on all patients with an umbilical hernia of this size.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^676d229f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

A nulliparous woman in her 40s is referred to gynaecological oncology secondary to umbilical pain and bleeding with menses. Examination revealed a blood-filled cystic mass within an umbilical hernia consistent with umbilical endometrioma. The patient exhausted medical management options, then pursued surgical management via umbilectomy, excision of umbilical endometriosis, lysis of adhesions and umbilical hernia repair. Surgical pathology revealed cystic endometriosis within a hernia sac. Postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection, which resolved with antibiotic treatment and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. Few theories attempt to explain the pathogenesis of umbilical endometriosis. Medical management has not been well studied but may prove to be an effective first-line adjuvant strategy. Surgical management is reported to have a low-recurrence rate. Many techniques have been described for umbilical reconstruction, but a superior surgical technique has yet to be identified. The case presented discusses the management of a secondary endometrioma in an umbilical hernia.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^3efaed58]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management with wide local excision is recommended, although it lacks long-term efficacy and safety outcome data. Although our patient has had no recurrence over a 2-year follow-up, the recurrence rate after local resection is reported to be about 10%. The typical excisional technique is the circumferential or 'stump' technique, similar to our approach. Most resections do not involve entry into the peritoneum, and reconstruction will typically depend on the size of the defect and preference for umbilicoplasty.

A superior approach for umbilicoplasty has not been identified, and long-term complication rates have yet to be determined and compared. Umbilicoplasty methods reported include a four-flap umbilicoplasty, bilateral square teeth flaps, purse string suture techniqueand a v-y flap technique.

The simplest techniques are the purse string method, which does not require defatting of the subcutaneous tissue, and the four-flap technique. Techniques that involve defatting of the subcutaneous tissue include the v-y flapand square teethtechniques, which had low complication rates with adequate depth after healing in all but one reported case (table 1). We did not perform an umbilicoplasty, resulting in a poor inferior cosmetic result.

Table 1
Surgical management methods for umbilicoplasty

The anterior abdominal wall defect size having resected the entire tumour en masse was 8–10 cm. Therefore, a mesh repair was indicated. The hernia was repaired using synthetic mesh in accordance with Hernia Surge guidance. Postoperative course was complicated by a surgical site infection. Fortunately, this infection resolved with medical management and did not necessitate more invasive management such as surgical debridement or mesh removal, and is doing very well without any long-term complications. The patient was at risk for surgical site infection given her elevated BMI.

### Does concomitant umbilical hernia repair increase the risk of complications in abdominoplasty? A propensity score matched analysis [^be813f96]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients seeking cosmetic abdominoplasty often have umbilical hernias. Optimal management and safety of concomitant umbilical hernia repair with abdominoplasty is not well described.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to compare complication rates following abdominoplasty with or without umbilical hernia repair.

Methods

A retrospective propensity score matched cohort study of patients who underwent an abdominoplasty at Massachusetts General Hospital was performed. Direct umbilical hernia repair was performed by making a fascial slit inferior or superior to the umbilical stalk. The fascial edges were approximated with up to three 0-Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Raritan, NJ) from the preperitoneal or peritoneal space. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounding variables.

Results

The authors identified 231 patients with a mean [standard deviation] age of 46.7 [9.7] years and a mean BMI of 25.9 [4.4] kg/m². Nine (3.9%) had diabetes, 8 (3.5%) were active smokers, and the median number of previous pregnancies was 2. In total, 223 (96%) had a traditional abdominoplasty, whereas 8 (3.5%) underwent a fleur-de-lys approach. Liposuction was performed on 90%, and 45.4% underwent simultaneous breast or body contouring surgery. The overall complication rate was 6.9%. Propensity scores matched 61 pairs in each group (n = 122) with closely aligned covariates. There was no significant difference in total complication rates between abdominoplasty alone vs abdominoplasty with hernia repair. There were no cases of skin necrosis or umbilical necrosis in either group.

Conclusions

Performing umbilical hernia repair with abdominoplasty is safe when utilizing the technique reported in this series.

### Frequency of potentially avoidable surgical referrals for asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children [^b2b351a7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association of Pediatrics released guidelines in 2019 recommending delay of surgical referral in children with asymptomatic umbilical hernias until 4–5 y of age. The purpose of this study was to assess contemporary rates of potentially avoidable referrals in this cohort of children, and to assess whether rates have decreased following guideline release.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of umbilical hernias referrals evaluated at a single pediatric surgery clinic from October 2014 to August 2021. Potentially avoidable referrals (PAR) were defined as asymptomatic, non-enlarging umbilical hernia referrals in a child 3 y of age or younger without a history of incarceration. Referral indication, disposition following clinic visit, and rates of PAR were compared before and after guideline release.

Results

A total of 803 umbilical hernia referrals were evaluated, of which 48% were in children 3 y of age or younger at time of evaluation ("early" referrals). 33% of all referrals and 68% of early referrals were categorized as a PAR, and rates were similar before and after guideline release (all referrals: 32% versus 33%, P = 0.94; early referrals: 68% versus 67%, P = 0.94). Of the 333 early referrals who were managed expectantly per guideline recommendations, 2 (0.6%) developed incarceration which was managed with successful reduction and interval repair.

Conclusions

One-third of all referrals for umbilical hernia evaluation are potentially avoidable, and this rate did not change following release of American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Aligning expectations between surgeons and referring providers through improved education and guideline dissemination may reduce avoidable visits, lost caregiver productivity, and exposure to potentially avoidable surgery.

### Variation in surgical management of asymptomatic umbilical hernia at freestanding children's hospitals [^2e6cebb0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine hospital-level variation in the timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of children undergoing umbilical hernia repair at 38 children's hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database (01/2013–12/2017). Early repair was defined as surgery performed at 3 years of age or younger. Repairs were categorized as emergent/urgent if associated with diagnostic or procedural codes indicating obstruction or strangulation, or if they occurred within 2 weeks of an emergency department encounter. Multivariable regression was used to calculate hospital-level observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for early repair adjusting for emergent/urgent repair and patient characteristics.

Results

23,144 children were included, of which 30% underwent early repair (hospital range: 6.9%-54.3%, p ≪ 0.001). Overall, 3.8% of all repairs were emergent/urgent, and higher rates of early repair did not correlate with higher rates of emergent/urgent repair across hospitals (r = -0.10). Following adjustment, hospital-level O/E ratios for early repair varied 8.9-fold (0.19–1.70, p ≪ 0.001).

Conclusion

Timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair varies widely across children's hospitals, and the magnitude of this variation cannot be explained by differences in patient characteristics or the acuity of repair. Many children may be undergoing repair of hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

Level Of Evidence

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^b00a2daf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We present a case of full thickness umbilical endometriosis presenting in an umbilical hernia sac in a patient who had had two prior myomectomy procedures through a Pfannenstiel incision with breaching of the endometrium. Having failed medical management, the lesion was successfully surgically removed with a 2-year recurrence-free interval to date. The surgery, however, was complicated by a surgical site infection necessitating readmission.

Umbilical endometriosis accounts for 0.5–1.0% of all endometriosis and can appear either as a primary lesion in the absence of surgery, also known as Villar's node, or as a secondary lesion arising from subsequent scar tissue after abdominal procedures. Abdominal wall endometriosis is reported to have rates of pelvic endometriosis ranging from 13% to 34%, but the exact rate is unknown since the peritoneum is not routinely evaluated during the workup or management of those cases.

Several theories explaining the pathogenesis of endometriosis exist, including both local implantation via refluxed endometrial cells entering the abdominal cavity through the tubesand dissemination through lymphovascular channels. Although overall a rare condition, patients with obstetric surgical history such as caesarean sections are at risk for umbilical endometriomas. It is therefore conceivable that a breach of the endometrium during her two myomectomy procedures may have caused seeding of the umbilical hernia in our patient.

Umbilical endometrioma must be differentiated from ventral hernia, suture granulomas, abscess, cyst or lipoma. The initial management is therefore often surgical, especially if there is no known history of pelvic endometriosis. When the diagnosis is suspected, on the other hand, some investigators have attempted medical management for those tumours. However, medical management has been infrequently reported, and the studies that investigated medical management have had small sample sizes and did not include long-term follow-up. Additionally, there is not much data specifically comparing medical and surgical management outcomes, which begs the question of whether the role of hormonal therapy should be reserved for postoperative long-term symptom control.

### Uncommon complication of pediatric umbilical hernia-spontaneous evisceration: case report and literature review [^7229f6e8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The umbilical hernia is common in children. Most of the cases have a spontaneous regression around the age of 3 years. Complications are very rare, and thus surgery is not routinely indicated before the age of 3 years. We report an exceptional case of spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia with emphasis on the management of this rare complication and a literature review of similar cases.

### Current national practice patterns for inpatient management of ventral abdominal wall hernia in the United States [^870960d8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The health-care burden related to ventral hernia management is substantial, with more than 3 billion dollars in expenditures annually in the US. Previous studies have suggested that the utilization of laparoscopic repair remains relatively low although national volume estimates have not been reported. We sought to estimate the inpatient national volume of elective ventral hernia surgery and characterize the proportion of laparoscopic versus open operations.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify adults with a diagnosis of an umbilical, incisional, or ventral hernia who underwent an elective inpatient repair between 2009 and 2010. Cases that involved other major abdominal or pelvic operations were excluded. Covariates included patient demographics, surgical approach, and use of mesh. National surgical volume estimates were generated and length of stay and total hospital charges were compared for laparoscopic versus open repairs.

Results

A total of 112,070 ventral hernia repairs were included in the analysis: 72.1% (n = 80,793) were incisional hernia repairs, while umbilical hernia repairs comprised only 6.9% (n = 7,788). Laparoscopy was utilized in 26.6% (n = 29,870) of cases. Mesh was placed in 85.8% (n = 96,265) of cases, including 49.3% (n = 3,841) of umbilical hernia repairs and 90.1% (n = 72,973) of incisional hernia repairs. Length of stay and total hospital charges were significantly lower for laparoscopic umbilical, incisional, and "other" ventral hernia repairs (p values all < 0.001). Total hospital charges during this 2-year period approached 4 billion dollars ($746 million for laparoscopic repair; $3 billion for open repair).

Conclusions

Utilization of laparoscopy for elective abdominal wall hernia repair remains relatively low in the US despite its excellent outcomes. Given the substantial financial burden associated with these hernias, future research focused on preventing the development and optimizing the surgical treatment of ventral abdominal wall hernias is warranted.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^e7626c3d]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (trocar site closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding trocar site closure. Recognize that the risk of developing a trocar site hernia is increased for trocar sites of ≥ 10 mm, single-incision laparoscopic surgery trocars, and trocars placed at the umbilical site. Insufficient evidence to recommend fascial closure at the trocar site for the prevention of trocar site hernia. Insufficient evidence regarding surgical site complications and pain. Insufficient evidence to recommend optimal closure technique or material.

### Fetal anterior abdominal wall defects: prenatal imaging by magnetic resonance imaging [^706935b0]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall defects range from the mild umbilical cord hernia to the highly complex limb-body wall syndrome. The most common defects are gastroschisis and omphalocele, and the rarer ones include the exstrophy complex, pentalogy of Cantrell and limb-body wall syndrome. Although all have a common feature of viscera herniation through a defect in the anterior body wall, their imaging features and, more important, postnatal management, differ widely. Correct diagnosis of each entity is imperative in order to achieve appropriate and accurate prenatal counseling and postnatal management. In this paper, we discuss fetal abdominal wall defects and present diagnostic pearls to aid with diagnosis.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^c97ac319]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Defect size, mesh use, and special populations — laparoscopic approach: It is important to consider the size of the hernia defect when contemplating a laparoscopic approach, with a published guideline recommending caution for defects greater than 10cm but not as an absolute contraindication; another recommendation stated that hernias with a defect size < 3cm should not be approached laparoscopically, based on expert opinion and a survey showing that less than 10% of surgeons used prosthetics in defects less than 3cm, and the present MEDLINE search did not reveal any evidence in support of this recommendation; best available evidence suggests prosthetics should be used even for small (umbilical) hernia defects as recurrence rates are minimized compared with primary repair, and recent guidelines recommend the use of mesh for all abdominal wall hernias independent of defect size; expert opinion suggests the laparoscopic approach may be beneficial in the morbidly obese patient and in recurrent cases compared to open; additional evidence is needed before a minimum size for laparoscopic repair can be defined.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### The preservation of umbilical blood supply in combined ventral hernia repair and abdominoplasty: a narrative review [^bf3ebc45]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The identified techniques lack high-quality evidence. Nonetheless, they remain viable options for combined ventral hernia repair and abdominoplasty. Therefore, large-scale high-quality RCTs are required to compare the effectiveness of various approaches with additional outcomes of hernia recurrence rates, intraoperative time, and patient- and surgeon-reported satisfaction.

### The preservation of umbilical blood supply in combined ventral hernia repair and abdominoplasty: a narrative review [^c8af541d]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

To better assess each technique's effectiveness, comparative studies are required. A systematic review provides the best evidence; however, this is unfeasible in the setting of low numbers of controlled trial studies and inconsistent reporting of outcomes among existing studies. A randomized controlled trial could be designed to compare the techniques, for example, comparing the effectiveness of the laparoscopic versus pre-rectus approach, and to better report the outcomes, the incidence and severity of complications.

Introducing abdominoplasty to ventral hernia repair potentially provides advantages; however, it is imperative to underscore that the efficient reconstruction of the abdominal wall should be prioritized over preserving umbilical vascularization. In instances where sacrificing the umbilicus is unavoidable and necessary, for example, umbilical hernias encroaching on the umbilical stalk, the failure to preserve the umbilicus is not a catastrophic outcome. Furthermore, umbilical necrosis often heals well and is an aesthetic rather than a medical complication, which may be followed by umbiliconeoplasty.

### National practice variation and disparities in pediatric umbilical hernia repair under five [^9c1b1745]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess national trends and predictors of elective pediatric umbilical hernia repair (UHR) before and after age five.

Summary Background Data

Limited surgical guidelines exist for pediatric umbilical hernias, leading to variations in practice patterns and timing of elective UHR.

Methods

The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (2016–2022) was used to identify isolated elective repairs of reducible umbilical hernias. Patients were categorized into early (0–4 years) and delayed (5–9 years) cohorts. Descriptive statistics and sample-weighted regression models were used to assess patient and hospital factors associated with delayed UHR. Outcome measures were total charge and non-home discharges. Age- and sex-adjusted national incidences were determined using negative binomial regression.

Results

Among 75,943 patients, the early (47.6%) and delayed (52.3%) cohorts had comparable case volumes. Early UHR was associated with higher total costs ($13,594 vs. $13,141) and non-home discharges (0.2% vs. 0.1%). The incidence of delayed UHR compared to that of early UHR increased after 2021. The incidence and odds of delayed UHR varied in the United States by region. Multivariate regression identified female sex, rural residence, non-private payment, and urban hospital location as factors with lower odds of delayed repair, while income above the 50th percentile and later years (2021–2022) were associated with higher odds of delayed repair.

Conclusions

Nearly half of elective UHR occurred before age five, with increased healthcare utilization and non-routine discharge. Significant socioeconomic and regional disparities highlight the need for standardized surgical guidelines to address the variability in pediatric umbilical hernia management.

### Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia in an adult non-cirrhotic patient [^1452fa71]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Figure 3
Factors contributing to umbilical hernia, skin necrosis and rupture, and small bowel evisceration (Author: Dr Matteo Zanchetta).

Learning points

Spontaneous hernia sac rupture is a sporadic occurrence, and accompanying small bowel evisceration is even rarer, particularly in patients without cirrhosis.
Spontaneous bowel evisceration through umbilical hernia (UH) is commonly associated with chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as refractory ascites in cirrhotic patients, obesity and pregnancy.
Each UH patient necessitates tailored management, and apart from asymptomatic UHs with no aesthetic compromise, this abdominal wall defect should always be repaired surgically, possibly electively to decrease the risk of complications associated with emergency repair.
Surgery is always necessary for small bowel evisceration through UH; and in emergency settings, a direct repair of the defect is advocated.
Mesh placement should always be considered if comorbidities do not contraindicate it.

### Umbilical hernias: the cost of waiting [^1d3e5c3e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernias are well described in the literature, but its impact on health care is less understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of non-operative management of umbilical hernias on cost, work absenteeism, and resource utilization.

Methods

The Truven Health Database, consisting of 279 employers and over 3000 hospitals, was reviewed for all umbilical hernia patients, aged 18–64 who were enrolled in health plans for 12 months prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a recurrence or had been offered a "no surgery" approach within 1 year of the index date. The remaining patients were separated into surgery (open or laparoscopic repair) or no surgery (NS). Post-cost analysis at 90 and 365 days and estimated days off from work were reviewed for each group.

Results

The non-surgery cohort had a higher proportion of females and comorbidity index. Adjusted analysis showed significantly higher 90 and 365 costs for the surgery group (p < 0.0001), though the cost difference did decrease over time. NS group had significantly higher estimated days of health-care utilization at both the 90 (1.99 vs. 3.58 p < 0.0001) and 365 (8.69 vs. 11.04 p < 0.0001) day post-index mark. A subgroup analysis demonstrated laparoscopic repair had higher costs compared to open primarily due to higher index procedure costs (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Though the financial costs were found to be higher in the surgery group, the majority of these were due to the surgery itself. Significantly higher days of health-care utilization and estimated days off work were experienced in the NS group. It is our belief that early operative intervention will lead to decreased costs and resource utilization.

Comments

There were conflicting data regarding the role of watchful waiting in ventral/incisional hernia treatment. Three studies reported that WW was a safe option [1–3], while a retrospective study reported higher crossover rate (33%) and higher unexpected intraoperative intestinal perforation rate in the crossover group (13%) compared with the operation treatment group (2%; p = 0.002) [4]. Another prospective study also reported that only repaired patients had improved functional scores on 6-month follow-up. In addition, a non-operative management was reported to be strongly associated with lower function scores (log odds ratio = − 26.5; 95% confidence interval = − 35.0 to − 18.0) [5]

### Management of hernias in pregnancy [^56002710]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Even though groin and umbilical hernias are rare in adult women, the rarer cases of pregnant women presenting with hernias create distinct challenges to treatment planning. The course of hernias in pregnant women, the effect of hernias on delivery, and the timing of elective herniorrhaphy have not been established. To date, there have been no published series establishing that postpartum repair of umbilical and groin hernias that develop in pregnancy is safe and acceptable.

Study Design

From September 2004 to July 2006, 12 female patients with groin or umbilical hernias occurring during pregnancy presented to a single surgeon at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. All patients later underwent postpartum herniorrhaphy and were enrolled retrospectively. All patients underwent either open umbilical or inguinal hernia repair primarily or using a plug-and-patch method (Bard Mesh PerFix Plug; Davol) in an ambulatory setting. Mean longterm followup was 17 months.

Results

Mean age of the patients was 35 years (range 27 to 41 years). The most common type of hernia was inguinal (58%). The predominant side was right (86%). None of the patients had an associated diagnosis or clinically significant medical history. All patients were evaluated, operated, and followed up by the same surgeon. Neither incarceration nor strangulation occurred in any patient before or after delivery. None required hospitalization or emergent hernia repair. Patients did not experience any delivery complications. All patients underwent elective postpartum open hernia repair with sedation and local anesthesia (4 to 52 weeks postpartum; mean 22 weeks postpartum). No patient experienced any perioperative or postoperative complications. None of the patients experienced a hernia recurrence. Four patients had subsequent uncomplicated pregnancies.

Conclusions

This series lends support to the "watchful waiting" strategy during pregnancy, with a plan for postpartum herniorrhaphy. Elective, postpartum hernia repair provides similar results to the nonpregnant population.

Indication for surgery

Indications for treatment: dependence on size of defect or hernia sac, hernia type, symptoms, and age

Thomas Simon

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and the Study Register, as well as a search of relevant journals and reference lists including publications until 6 June 2012. The following search terms were used in the search strategy: "operation" AND "watchful waiting" AND ("Hernia" [Mesh]) OR "Hernia; Abdominal" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Ventral" [Mesh] OR "Hernia; Umbilical" [Mesh] OR ("Abdominal wall hernias") OR ("ventral hernia") OR ("epigastric hernia") OR ("incisional hernia") AND (randomized controlled trial[pt] OR controlled clinical trial[pt]). The search produced 462 hits including inguinal hernias. Of the 42 relevant papers found, 28 were selected for this analysis. The only two level 1b trials addressed inguinal hernias and were included with intention to discuss the existing evidence in a related field. Regarding data addressing ventral and incisional hernias, only one level 3 study and 15 level 4 uncontrolled studies were found.

Statements

Recommendations

No precise data on the incidence and prevalence of ventral and incisional hernias are available. An epidemiologic study showed an increasing proportion of midline abdominal wall hernias, with a relative frequency of 19% for umbilical/par umbilical hernias, 8.6% for epigastric hernias, and 4.8% for incisional hernias [78]. The incidence for incisional hernia is 10–20% [79, 80], making it one of the most common surgical complication after laparotomy.

Ventral and incisional hernias are treated with surgery to relieve symptoms (pain and discomfort), to prevent complications (strangulation, respiratory dysfunction, or skin problems), or to resolve acute complications (incarceration and strangulation) [95].

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^1168db89]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we did not find that HDHP coverage is associated with a lower likelihood of children undergoing UHR before 4 years of age. Thus, our results do not suggest that HDHPs reduce potentially unnecessary surgical procedures or reduce deviation from best practice guidelines for the management of pediatric umbilical hernias. It is possible that future investigations of this or other procedures may yield different results, as the prevalence of HDHPs and the average deductible size in HDHPs have continued to rise in recent years. However, further research should investigate other factors that can be targeted to reduce unnecessary UHRs in young children, in accordance with best practice guidelines.

Indication related to size

From a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic vs open incisional hernia repair with 206 patients from 10 hospitals [9], the authors found that the defect size was an independent predictor for recurrence (p < 0.001) [9]. In a prospective nationwide study [3], they also found that defect size was a risk factor for emergency repair. Furthermore, older age, female gender, and umbilical hernia defects between 2 and 7 cm or incisional hernia defects up to 7 cm were important risk factors for emergency repair. A retrospective study also revealed that there was a correlation between the hernia gap size and risk factors [10], while another trial comparing laparoscopic and open mesh repair found that hernia size did not influence the surgical outcomes [11].

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^03159f57]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The debate on the optimal management of complicated ventral hernias continues. The use of prosthetic mesh has been considered the standard treatment for elective ventral hernia repair since simple repair with sutures is associated with significantly higher rates of recurrence of hernia that can reach up to 67% on long term follow-up. On another hand, the emergency management of complicated ventral hernias can be more cumbersome owing to the potential contamination of the operative field which can preclude the use of synthetic mesh. Alternatives to synthetic mesh, as bioprosthesis and biosynthetic mesh, appeared to solve the problem; nevertheless, these alternatives are not readily available everywhere because of their cost. This leaves the surgeon on the horns of a dilemma that entails higher risk for SSI when synthetic mesh is used and higher incidence of recurrence when the mesh is abandoned.

The WSES has issued a useful set of recommendations for the emergency repair of complicated ventral hernias including a grade A1 recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh for incarcerated hernias, grade 2C recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh with caution in strangulated hernias with or without concurrent bowel resection, and grade 2C recommendation for using biologic mesh instead of synthetic mesh in the cases of acute strangulation with bowel perforation.

We employed the WSES clinical guidelines for emergency ventral hernia repair on 122 patients and examined the outcome of synthetic mesh repair versus suture repair performed in accordance with the guidelines. Patients included were adults of a mean age of 56 years close to the mean age of paraumbilical hernia reported by Bedewi et al. The majority of the patients had at least one associated comorbidity, yet less than 20% of them had high ASA grade. Umbilical hernias represented around 85% of the ventral hernias included in the study, in accord with Aguirre and colleagues defined this type as the most common type of ventral hernia.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^e118b26e]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Treatment

Before referral for surgical management, the patient attempted medical therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate without relief and was not a candidate for combined oral contraceptives due to hypertension and elevated BMI. The patient, therefore, underwent umbilectomy, excision of umbilical endometriosis, lysis of adhesions and umbilical hernia repair under general anaesthesia. A circumferential incision was made around the umbilicus using a scalpel. This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue using electrocautery. The endometrioma was densely adherent to the umbilical skin as expected, as well as the hernia sac, the omental fat contents of the umbilical hernia sac and the anterior rectus sheath (see figure 3). This lesion was hence excised en masse with a wide margin, resulting in a large defect in the anterior abdominal wall (see figure 4). The defect was closed primarily using synthetic mesh and the skin edges were approximated using staples, leaving a subcutaneous drain (see figure 5). The specimen was sent to pathology for analysis.

Effectiveness and Quality of Evidence

The effectiveness of each technique emphasized by the presence of umbilical complications is presented in conjunction with the assessment of evidence quality in Table 2. All techniques appear to be viable options for preserving umbilical blood supply and only five out of 16 studies reported cases of umbilical complications. Additionally, these complications were minor, occurred in low frequencies and had risk factors for poor healing (e.g. diabetes and obesity).

### Perioperative management of infant inguinal hernia surgery; a review of the recent literature [^86b78e36]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Inguinal hernia surgery is one of the most common electively performed surgeries in infants. The common nature of inguinal hernia combined with the high‐risk population involving a predominance of preterm infants makes this a particular area of interest for those concerned with their perioperative care. Despite a large volume of literature in the area of infant inguinal hernia surgery, there remains much debate amongst anesthetists, surgeons and neonatologists regarding the optimal perioperative management of these patients. The questions asked by clinicians include; when should the surgery occur, how should the surgery be performed (open or laparoscopic), how should the anesthesia be conducted, including regional versus general anesthesia and airway devices used, and what impact does anesthesia choice have on the developing brain? There is a paucity of evidence in the literature on the concerns, priorities or goals of the parents or caregivers but clearly their opinions do and should matter. In this article we review the current clinical surgical and anesthesia practice and evidence for infants undergoing inguinal hernia surgery to help clinicians answer these questions.

### Clinical application and systematic review of waiting treatment for giant omphaloceles [^95a58ef8]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Some researchers express concerns about the long-term wound care required and potential complications associated with non-surgical delayed closure, including membrane infection and sepsis. However, based on our study and an extensive review of the literature, we found that educating the families of these patients on proper wound care was not particularly challenging. Furthermore, the occurrence of these complications is relatively uncommon. It is also important to note that many of the deaths reported in the literature are primarily attributed to other congenital abnormalities rather than directly to the untreated umbilical hernia.

However, this study does have certain limitations. All the data used in this research were based on a retrospective review of patient records, which meant we could not obtain detailed information regarding early mortality cases, including specific congenital abnormalities, infection status, or whether the omphalocele sac had ruptured. To comprehensively validate the effectiveness of conservative treatments combined with early surgical interventions, long-term follow-up assessments are essential. These follow-ups should focus on monitoring abdominal wall hernias, potential complications, the need for additional surgeries, and survival outcomes.

The primary limitation of this systematic review is the limited number of included case-control studies (n = 2). According to the PRISMA guidelines, publication bias cannot be reliably assessed via funnel plot analysis when the number of studies is < 10. Although registry searches suggested the potential existence of unpublished negative results — implying a possible overestimation of the true effect in the current conclusions — further large-scale studies are strongly recommended to validate these findings.

### Pediatric hernias [^e1f22752]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Almost all groin hernias in children are indirect inguinal hernias and occur as a result of incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis. The treatment is repair by high ligation of the hernia sac, which can be done by an open or laparoscopic technique. The contralateral side can be explored by laparoscopy or left alone; open exploration is no longer indicated due to the potential risk of infertility. Umbilical hernias are common in infants but usually close with time. Surgery is indicated if the umbilical hernia is symptomatic or if the fascial defect fails to decrease in size over time.

### Avoid referring most children with umbilical hernias to a pediatric… [^a1449be0]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with umbilical hernias may safely be observed until at least age four years; at that point, pediatric surgical consultation is recommended to discuss surgical repair option. Special consideration for earlier consultation can be given in cases of parental concern. Umbilical hernias, resulting from failure of complete closure of the umbilical ring after birth, affect up to 25% of newborns. Unlike inguinal hernias, or umbilical hernias in adults, a majority of newborn umbilical hernias will close spontaneously – about 85% closure rate by age five years. Larger umbilical hernias – vaguely defined as those over 1. 5 cm in diameter – have a lower likelihood of spontaneous closure. Complications of umbilical hernia, such as incarceration or strangulation are very rare; thus, the risk/benefit ratio in surgical closure of umbilical hernias strongly favors observation. Even markedly large or protuberant umbilical hernias may undergo spontaneous closure and are not clearly associated with an increased risk of complications when not surgically closed. Nonoperative closure techniques such as umbilical strapping are generally ineffective, can lead to skin breakdown, and should be avoided. Complications following umbilical hernia repair in children are rare and may include infection and recurrence. Recurrence rates appear to be higher in children repaired at an early age.

### Point-of-care ultrasonography for hernia reduction: a case of incarcerated umbilical hernia [^89b3d516]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Manual reduction of an incarcerated hernia is used to avoid emergency surgery, which comes with risks of complications and death, especially in patients with severe comorbidities. However, there are no established procedures for hernia reduction.

Case Report

We present the case of an 82-year-old man with refractory ascites due to nephrotic syndrome and chronic heart failure who developed an incarcerated umbilical hernia. Color Doppler ultrasonography allowed us to detect clearly visible blood-flow signals in the incarcerated bowel and rule out necrosis, which is a contraindication for reduction. Several attempts at manual reduction failed; ultrasonography-guided reduction revealed that fluid collection within the hernia sac was blocking the manual pressure directly on the incarcerated bowel toward the hernia orifice. After sac paracentesis (draining the fluid from the sac), the incarcerated bowel became palpable, leading to a successful reduction. Four days later, once the patient was in a stable condition, an elective surgery was performed to prevent the recurrence of incarceration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We believe that this is a useful report on the use of point-of-care ultrasonography for incarcerated hernia from the initial assessment of bowel viability to reasonable hernia reduction through hernia sac paracentesis according to real-time observation. An approach based on visualization by ultrasonography, and not on the operator's experience, would be rational, and we believe that this approach will be feasible for emergency physicians, who are responsible for the initial treatment of incarcerated ventral hernia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f4141d2d]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Abdominal hernias in cirrhosis and ascites — Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, and umbilical hernias develop in approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Hernias may result from increased abdominal pressure from ascites with weakened abdominal muscles, and poor nutrition can lead to rapidly enlarging hernias, whereas optimal fluid control, appropriate nutrition, and conservative management with binders may minimize or prevent hernia development and progression. Hernias may present with incarceration, pressure necrosis, rupture, evisceration, and peritonitis, and a rapid decline in the ascitic fluid volume (e.g. LVP) can paradoxically cause incarceration. Patients who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT) in the near future should defer hernia repair until during or after transplantation, while for patients in whom transplantation is not imminent elective herniorrhaphy may be offered after careful consideration of risks and benefits, with a possible need for an emergent operation. Clinically apparent ascites should be controlled before elective herniorrhaphy, laparoscopic approaches are preferred, the use of prosthetic mesh may reduce recurrence but may increase infections and other complications, and postoperatively control of ascites and optimization of nutrition are key determinants of successful outcome.

### A prospective randomized controlled study of ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block for pain management in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair with intraperitoneal onlay mesh [^6424278b]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IPOM is a widely-used minimally invasive approach for umbilical hernia repair. However, due to the utilization of mesh suspension and stapling devices, along with increased intra-abdominal pressure, patients often experience considerable postoperative pain. Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for facilitating early mobilization and swift recovery in individuals with umbilical hernias. Presently, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia utilizing opioid analgesics is the predominant method of postoperative pain relief in laparoscopic surgery. While opioids are potent analgesics, their efficacy varies among patients, and higher doses can lead to adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and slowed gastrointestinal motility.

Given that patients with umbilical hernia are often obese, the use of opioids increases the risk of postoperative adverse reactions. Researchers have conducted studies that emphasized the importance of reducing opioid use as a crucial component of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. Multimodal analgesia, which integrates medications with different mechanisms of action and diverse analgesic techniques is currently favored for acute pain management. This approach targets various aspects and sites of postoperative pain, aiming to achieve balanced analgesia, thereby promoting internal stability and enhancing postoperative recovery.

Among multimodal analgesic strategies, combining general anesthesia with nerve blocks is commonly practiced. Nerve blocks offer localized pain relief, reducing the reliance on opioid analgesics. Given that the primary source of pain in laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair with IPOM is the abdominal wall around the umbilicus rather than the visceral organs, it aligns perfectly with the indications for an RSB. Hence, this study adopts RSB to optimize both intraoperative and postoperative analgesia.

In the study, RSB was administered prior to the initiation of surgery, preemptively disrupting the transmission of surgical nociceptive stimuli. This proactive approach helps in averting the development of hyperalgesia and sensory abnormalities. The rectus abdominis muscle lies bilaterally along the midline of the abdomen, enclosed within the rectus sheath, and primarily innervated by the thoracolumbar nerves T 7 -T 12. During the RSB procedure, local anesthetics are confined within the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis, resulting in a localized blockade. The RSB specifically targets the anterior branches of the thoracolumbar nerves, particularly T 9 -T 11, making it particularly suitable for surgeries involving midline abdominal incisions and rectus abdominis manipulations. Hence, the RSB is well-suited for laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair with IPOM.

### Practice variation in umbilical hernia repair demonstrates a need for best practice guidelines [^f131aaca]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate and better understand variations in practice patterns, we analyzed ambulatory surgery claims data from 3 demographically diverse states to assess the relationship between age at umbilical hernia repair and patient, hospital, and geographic characteristics.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study of uncomplicated hernia repairs performed as a single procedure in 2012–2014, using the State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database for Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. Age and demographic characteristics of umbilical hernia repair patients are described.

Results

The State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database analysis included 6551 patients. Across 3 states, 8.2% of hernia repairs were performed in children < 2 years, 18.7% in children age 2–3 years, and 73.0% in children age ≥ 4 years, but there was significant variability (P < .001) in practice patterns by state. In regression analysis, race, Medicaid insurance and rural residence were predictive of early repair, with African American patients less likely to have a repair before age 2 (OR 0.62, P = 0.046) and rural children (OR 1.53, P = 0.009) and Medicaid patients (OR 2.01, P < .001) more likely to do so. State of residence predicted early repair even when holding these variables constant.

Conclusions

The age of pediatric umbilical hernia repair varies widely. As hernias may resolve over time and can be safely monitored with watchful waiting, formal guidelines are needed to support delayed repair and prevent unnecessary operations.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^1a22c213]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

At the opposite site of the spectrum, there are those patients with small fascial defects: due to the difficulty of palpating them, it has been advised to regularly mark the site of the hernia preoperatively, as it may be difficult to identify it in the supine and relaxed patient. We have been able to establish this association using correlation analyses and indeed found that small fascial defects are much less likely to be found during clinical examination. The palpable fascial defect is not a prerequisite to make the diagnosis: the diagnosis is mainly established by the presence of a (para)median swelling in physical examination. The aspect of the palpable fascial defect is relevant because the swelling will often disappear in the operating room, but this can be addressed by preoperative marking of the localization of the swelling before induction of anesthesia. Consequently, the use of ultrasound in pediatric epigastric hernia has been debated: some considered it to be exceptional, as the clinical examination will almost always establish the diagnosis, while others assumed ultrasound to be useful to establish the diagnosis because in the majority of cases, the fascial defect was not detected without ultrasound. Ultrasound has been a valuable tool in the evaluation of abdominal wall hernias for decades, and due to its high sensitivity and specificity, it may be advantageous when the clinical examination is equivocal. The most relevant among these is the differentiation between umbilical hernias and supraumbilical hernias: ideally, epigastric hernia could easily be discerned from umbilical hernias due to a distance to the navel as exemplified by Tinawi and Stringeror due to a characteristic U shape of the umbilicus being pushed downward by the epigastric hernia as shown by Shastri and Gilmer. If the clinical examination alone could not allow differentiation between these two types of hernia, ultrasound would most likely do so. This differentiation in equivocal cases is also of clinical relevance, as the management differs: while epigastric hernias are usually scheduled for elective repair once diagnosed, watchful waiting for spontaneous closure for asymptomatic umbilical hernia until the age of 4 years has been recommended by a systematic review. In addition, in umbilical hernias, the defect size is associated with the odds of spontaneous closure, with larger defects being less likely to close spontaneously, so the information gained by ultrasound could even be of relevance for counseling the patient's family if an umbilical and not an epigastric hernia is diagnosed. However, ultrasound should not be part of the routine care for epigastric hernia, as it is recommended to refer patients to secondary pediatric surgical care anyway if an epigastric hernia is suspected.

### Prospective analysis of outcomes in umbilical hernia repair for patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^80e86095]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Emergency repair of any type of abdominal wall hernia in patients with advanced stages of cirrhosis has been associated with high rates of perioperative complications, prolonged hospital and intensive care unit stay, and higher mortality. However, in the prospective study by Hew et al no difference in 90-day mortality rates (1.3% vs. 0%, P = 0.43) was found among 79 cirrhotic and 249 non-cirrhotic patients with emergent UHR, though cirrhotics experienced a higher complication rate (62% vs. 20%, P = 0.01). In our patient cohort, short-term and long-term mortality rates were high for both elective and emergency UHR, correlating with the severity of liver disease. Notably, there were no immediate surgical complications in our patients.

It has been reported that conservative treatment of ruptured umbilical hernia in cirrhotic patients confers a high mortality risk: over 60%, compared to up to 20% related to emergency herniorrhaphy. As for the preferred surgical approach, umbilical herniorrhaphy (non-mesh) on an elective basis has been recommended in cirrhosis, as it has been associated with fewer postoperative complications, and lower morbidity and mortality rates compared to emergency UHR. Recently, a randomized controlled trial showed that elective herniorrhaphy of the umbilical hernia in cirrhotics does not cause excess morbidity compared to the conservative approach. Thus, it could be a more feasible and safe option than a watchful waiting strategy, especially when performed in earlier stages of liver cirrhosis. In the majority of 21 emergency herniorrhaphy cases reported by Telem et al, the 20% mortality rate at 36 months was mainly attributed to advanced liver disease. In this retrospective study, management of ascites also included 6 cases of preoperative and 2 cases of postoperative TIPS. In our study, none of our patients had TIPS for the management of ascites, a procedure that has been associated with better outcomes and survival in previous studies. Portal decompression with TIPS can be considered in selected high-risk patients, but further prospective studies of this recommendation are required.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^31b8a6c7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Abdominal wall hernia repair in cirrhosis — control of ascites is key to successful hernia repair, and because the ascites inevitably recurs quickly, a single large-volume paracentesis before a surgical procedure does not provide adequate preoperative control of ascites. Medical control of clinically apparent ascites with diuretics before a surgical hernia repair is required in a patient with decompensated cirrhosis to prevent recurrent ascites postoperatively, and selected surgical candidates may benefit from preemptive placement of a TIPS to control ascites before surgery. Efforts should be undertaken to avoid recurrent ascites in the postoperative period and may include frequent postoperative paracentesis and careful diuretic therapy while attempting to avoid renal injury; in selected patients transient pigtail catheter drainage of ascites postoperatively may prevent pressure on the hernia repair. Both the MELD score and the Child-Pugh class combined with the ASA class have been advocated for hernia surgery risk stratification, but neither appears to be optimal in all cases. A single-center prospective case series without controls reported on patients listed for liver transplantation who presented for elective umbilical hernia repair; Thirty patients eventually underwent elective surgery, and most had Child-Pugh class B or C cirrhosis, with a median MELD score of 12. Two patients had prolonged hospital stays due to complications, but the remainder did not experience a direct surgical complication, and the authors concluded that elective umbilical hernia repair is preferable to emergency repair in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The lack of controls in this series makes broad conclusions difficult and the frequency of emergency incarceration in patients with cirrhosis with a stable abdominal hernia is unknown, and surgical and medical teams should determine the safety and risk-benefit ratio of elective hernia surgery carefully in this population.

To examine the association of sociodemographic factors with adherence to age-specific guidelines for asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, children 17 years and younger who underwent umbilical hernia repair from January 2013 to June 2018 at 47 freestanding children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database were eligible for study inclusion. Children who underwent multiple procedures, repair of recurrent hernias, or had missing sociodemographic data were excluded.

Exposures

Early umbilical hernia repair was defined as repair at 3 years or younger. Emergent or urgent presentation was defined as repair performed during the same encounter or within 2 weeks of an emergency department visit, respectively. Patients were categorized by sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, income quintile, and presence of complex chronic conditions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with the odds of early repair after adjusting for emergent or urgent presentation and hospital-level effects.

Results

Of the 25 877 included children, 13 817 (53.4%) were female, 14 143 (54.7%) had public insurance, and the median (interquartile range) age was 5.0 (3.0–6.0) years. Following adjustment, increased odds of early repair was associated with public insurance (public vs commercial insurance: odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36–1.56; P < .001), lower income (lowest vs highest income quintile: OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33–1.65; P < .001), and female sex (female vs male sex: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13–1.27; P < .001). Children with public insurance in the lowest income quintile had 2.2-fold increased odds of early repair compared with children with commercial insurance in the highest income quintile (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.93–2.40; P < .001). Sociodemographic factors were not associated with increased odds of early repair in the subgroup of children who underwent early repair following emergent or urgent presentation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Public insurance, lower income, and female sex are independently associated with repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children earlier than recommended by current guidelines. These children may be at greater risk of undergoing repair of umbilical hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^1ffce442]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study sought to examine the clinical outcomes and complications of umbilical hernias as well as to identify factors for spontaneous resolution among children. In our study population, nearly half experienced spontaneous resolution of hernia by 4–5 years of age. The low rate of strangulation and incarceration suggests that if left untreated, umbilical hernia may resolve by itself. The low rate of perioperative complications (n = 33; 1.26%) and reoccurrence (n = 20; 0.76%) further suggests that repair is a safe procedure, even after 4–5 years of age. These findings are consistent with a recent American study, which stated that the rate of preoperative complications in umbilical hernia (eg, incarceration, strangulation, and evisceration) were low, occurring in approximately 1 in 1500 hernias. Overall, our study findings suggest that patients with asymptomatic umbilical hernia can be followed up safely by their family physician until 4–5 years of age, at least at our institution. Caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other institutions across Canada.

Our study demonstrated that for every 1 mm increase in defect size, the odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia decreased by 5%. Despite 89.1% of hernias closing spontaneously at age 6, a study conducted by Walker and colleagues found that larger hernias were also less likely to close; in fact, 0% (0/21) with a defect > 1.5 cm were closed by 6 years of age. In contrast, hernia prevalence may decrease with increasing age, indicating that the majority of large hernias may close by ages 3–4 without the need for surgery. Although not statistically significant in our study, prior literature attests that comorbidities, such as childhood obesity, may impact the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Interestingly, in our study, 40% of men and 38.7% of women had spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia; however, when examining results of the logistic regression, this difference based on gender is not statistically significant. In other words, at least in our sample, there is no difference in frequency of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia among men versus women.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^d81dbb72]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernias are a common surgical pathology. Umbilical hernias 2 cm or less are generally treated with open primary suture repair with associated risk of recurrence up to 27 percent. A variety of suture and repair techniques are used with little evidence to suggest which provides the lowest risk of recurrence. The primary goal of our study is to evaluate recurrence rates between primary umbilical hernia repairs with braided and monofilament suture.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of primary umbilical hernia repairs in patients over the age of 18 performed at a single institution by a group of ten surgeons from November 2018 to November 2023. The primary outcome was comparison of recurrence rates between braided and monofilament suture. Secondary outcomes include recurrence rate of monofilament absorbable versus permanent repair, recurrence rate by repair method, rates of wound infection and suture granulomas.

Results

We evaluated 797 patients that met inclusion criteria with a mean age of 50.9 years, mean BMI 29.6, mean CCI 1.64, and 77% male. We had a 46-month average follow-up via chart review. Mean hernia size was 1.11 cm. 86.4% were repaired with braided (Ethibond) and 13.6% with monofilament (PDS or Prolene) suture. Recurrence rate was 3.9% versus 5.6% for braided and monofilament, respectively, with no significant difference. The incidence of wound complications was not significant between the two groups. There was an increased recurrence rate using the pants over vest repair technique.

Conclusion

Our study indicates that the type of suture used in primary umbilical hernia repairs does not significantly impact the rates of recurrence, wound infection, or suture granuloma formation. However, the pants-over-vest technique is associated with a higher recurrence rate.

### Prospective analysis of outcomes in umbilical hernia repair for patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^96dd5819]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study population

Consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis of any etiology and umbilical hernia requiring surgical treatment, regularly followed at the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece, between January 2016 and July 2024, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: age under 18 years, history of liver transplant; severe cardiorespiratory diseases; including recent major cardiac comorbidities (recent myocardial infarction; major valvular failure; cardiac failure more advanced than NYHA II); and major respiratory disease (such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced fibrosis). The ascites diagnosis was based on clinical and ultrasonographic findings. Preoperative and postoperative management of patients presenting with ascites was tailored to its severity. For patients with grade I and II ascites, diuretics were administered. In cases of grade III or refractory ascites, management consisted of paracentesis combined with human albumin substitution, as appropriate. All patients received antibiotics both preoperatively and postoperatively. Coagulopathy was addressed using intravenous vitamin K, and in cases of severe thrombocytopenia platelet transfusion. Other clotting agents were used rarely, according to clinical requirements.

Umbilical hernia was diagnosed through clinical examination. Emergency procedures were defined as those performed within 12 h after a diagnosis of a complication, such as strangulation, incarceration or perforation. The choice of surgical technique — whether sutures only, or with the application of a mesh — was at the discretion of the treating surgeon. When feasible, local anesthesia was preferred over general anesthesia.

Following hospital discharge, patients were followed-up in the outpatient clinic. Complications and mortality were recorded at multiple time points: during postoperative hospital stay, at 30 days, at 3 months and at 12 months after surgery. Hernia recurrence at follow up was assessed through clinical examination at each follow-up visit. The cause of death for each patient was recorded and was classified as postoperative if it occurred within 30 days after hernia repair, or as related to liver disease if it occurred thereafter.

### Meta-analysis to determine optimal timing for repair of inguinal hernia in pre-term infants [^d43307de]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The timing of inguinal hernia repair requires a careful balance between the surgical risk of incarceration, which favors early intervention, and the perioperative anesthetic risks and potential for recurrence, which may suggest delaying the procedure. Based on current evidence, delaying repair may be safe for preterm infants with respiratory issues, provided there are no hernia complications. Ultimately, the decision should be tailored to individual patient risks and clinical contexts. However, prospective studies, randomized controlled trials, and long‐term follow‐up are needed to provide more precise comparisons and inform clinical decision‐making.

Incarcerated hernias

Abdominal wall hernias are another common cause of intestinal obstruction in LMICs, as loops of intestine can become trapped, incarcerated, and subsequently strangulated within these abdominal wall defects.

Umbilical hernias are especially common in Africa. Umbilical hernias can occur in 91% of children 5 years or younger and 46% of children who are 10–15-year-old. In the United States, umbilical hernias occur in 40–60% of infants and only 4% remain present after the age of 5, while the remaining spontaneously close. In general, umbilical hernias should be repaired by 5 years of age if the defect does not obliterate spontaneously. In single center studies, incarceration from an umbilical hernia can occur in 37–44% of patients presenting to the hospital with symptoms.

In Africa, inguinal hernias are present in 1–5% of children overall and in 35% of premature babies. In the United States, the condition has a similar prevalence of 1–5% in children overall and a lower prevalence at 9–11% in premature infants. Similar incidence rates exist in Asia, where inguinal hernias occur in 6.6% of males and 0.7% of females in a nationwide Taiwanese population study. Given the heightened risk of incarceration, early elective herniotomy is the treatment of choice after diagnosis of a reducible inguinal hernia.

Elective herniotomy is usually a short outpatient case and is extremely cost-effective. However, surgical backlog or compromised access to surgical care frequently prevents timely repair of these defects, which leads to a high incidence of incarcerated and strangulated hernias in LMICs. In a Nigerian study, obstructed hernias made up 14.8% of all abdominal surgical emergencies, ranking third after typhoid ileal perforation and intussusception. Inadequate surgical capacity to accommodate elective cases prevents early surgical correction of this common condition, leading to preventable morbidity that necessitates emergent repair.

### Spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia with evisceration [^63ad2546]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are a common complication of persistent ascites. Spontaneous rupture of these hernias is a less common complication. We report a case of spontaneous evisceration through an umbilical hernia in a cirrhotic patient with chronic ascites. Definitive surgical repair of the evisceration was not possible secondary to persistent ascites that was refractory to paracentesis and diuresis. Transjugular intrahepatic portocaval shunt (TIPS) placement was ultimately performed in an attempt to eliminate the ascites fluid. This case demonstrates a rare, but life-threatening complication of abdominal ascites that may be prevented by aggressive medical and surgical management.

### Umbilical hernia in adults [^953f833f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus on the best technique for the repair of umbilical hernia in adults. The role of laparoscopic hernioplasty of umbilical hernia remains controversial. This study was undertaken to compare the outcomes of open and laparoscopic onlay patch repair of umbilical hernia in adults.

Methods

From January 1996 to December 2002, 102 patients underwent elective repair of umbilical hernia. Operative techniques included Mayo repair (n = 43), laparoscopic onlay Gore-Tex patch hernioplasty (n = 26), suture herniorrhaphy (n = 24), and mesh hernioplasty (n = 9).

Results

Demographic features and risk factors were similar among the four groups. The operative time of laparoscopic hernioplasty (median, 66 min) was significantly longer than those for patients who underwent Mayo repair (60 min) or sutured herniorrhaphy (50 min) (p < 0.05). None of the patients who underwent laparoscopic patch repairs required conversion to open repair. The median pain score at rest on postoperative day 1 was significantly lower in patients who underwent laparoscopic repair compared to those who had Mayo repair. A significantly shorter hospital stay and a lower wound morbidity rate were also observed in patients who underwent laparoscopic repair. With a mean follow-up of 2 years, suture herniorrhaphy had a relatively high recurrence rate (8.7%), whereas no recurrence was documented for the other techniques.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic onlay patch hernioplasty is a safe and efficacious technique for the repair of umbilical hernia. Compared to Mayo repair, the laparoscopic approach confers the advantages of reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, and a diminished morbidity rate.

### Techniques of concomitant abdominoplasty and umbilical hernia repair: a review [^a9132b04]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Different methods of performing full abdominoplasty and umbilical hernia (UH) repair simultaneously have been proposed.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to review and compare UH repair outcomes and umbilical stalk survival.

Methods

A literature research was performed through 28 December 2019. Other hernia repairs and mini-abdominoplasty (without umbilical transposition) were excluded. The primary outcomes analyzed were rates of UH recurrence, mesh infection, and umbilical necrosis.

Results

Six studies were included (5 retrospectives series, 1 case report). Hernia was repaired by an open approach (3 studies, 28 patients) or a laparoscopic approach (3 studies, 67 patients). UH repair consisted of mesh placement in the intraperitoneal or retromuscular/preperitoneal plane, or suture technique in the intraperitoneal plane. No hernia recurrence, mesh infection, or umbilical necrosis was described.

Conclusions

Both open and laparoscopic approaches to simultaneous abdominoplasty and UH repair seem to be safe based on the rates of umbilical stalk vascularization, hernia recurrence, and mesh infection. However, more well-designed studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.

### Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in umbilical hernia patients: university of California, Irvine, technique for port placement and repair [^e6558922]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss a technique currently used at our institution for the management of umbilical hernias during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. As more patients undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, there will be an increase in patients who qualify for robotic surgery with comorbidities.

Material and Methods

This technique has been utilized in clinically localized prostate cancer patients with umbilical hernias using the da Vinci Surgical System and standard laparoscopic instrumentation. Port placements and closures were performed by a resident assistant and a nurse at the operating table. The prostatectomy was performed by a single experienced surgeon at the console.

Results

Currently, no data are available regarding patients with umbilical hernias undergoing robotic prostatectomy. We reviewed our technique of port placement for patients with a pre-existing umbilical hernia undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.

Conclusion

This technique allows for a reduction of the umbilical hernia, the use of the fascial defect as a robotic port, and the removal of the prostate by way of transverse incision and transverse repair. In our experience, this technique is feasible and reproducible for any small or large umbilical hernia.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)): part B [^23f9200f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with symptomatic umbilical, ventral, and incisional hernias and concomitant rectus abdominis diastasis represent a growing clinical problem and, as with isolated hernias, the ideal operative management of this complex hernia situation has not been defined. With regards to isolated rectus diastasis, defined as a thinning and widening of the linea alba, combined with laxity of the ventral abdominal wall musculature, controversy remains as to whether this pathology is cosmetic or functional due to the variation in severity, symptomatology, and the absence of strangulation risk found with hernias [9]. While physiotherapy can achieve a limited benefit with regards to size and symptoms with isolated mild rectus diastasis, surgery significantly improves abdominal wall function and pain regardless of operative technique employed and should be considered with diastasis wider than 3 cm [10]. Currently, both plication and hernia repair methods are used to repair isolated rectus abdominis diastasis with no clear distinction in recurrence rate, postoperative complications, or patient reported outcomes found in the literature [9, 10].

The presence of rectus abdominis diastasis and coexisting hernia presents a greater challenge as the weakened linea alba and ventral abdominal musculature increase the risk of hernia formation, compromise the integrity of the midline, and complicate the repair of ventral hernias. Köhler et al. demonstrated that a coexisting rectus diastasis significantly increases hernia recurrence rate with primary sutured closure (31 vs. 8%) [11]. As such, well established principles from ventral hernia repair including primary closure with non-absorbable sutures and mesh repair should be utilized to decrease hernia and diastasis recurrence [11]. Mesh repair of ventral hernias is well established as safe reducing the recurrence rate significantly compared to suture repair. Based on the volume of Level 1 studies studying ventral hernia, mesh reinforcement of ventral hernia repairs with a concomitant rectus diastasis is recommended while studies specifically evaluating ventral hernia and rectus diastasis corroborate these findings [12].

### Assessment and management of inguinal hernia in infants [^cc64c4dd]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Inguinal hernia repair in infants is a routine surgical procedure. However, numerous issues, including timing of the repair, the need to explore the contralateral groin, use of laparoscopy, and anesthetic approach, remain unsettled. Given the lack of compelling data, consideration should be given to large, prospective, randomized controlled trials to determine best practices for the management of inguinal hernias in infants.

### Laparoscopic IPOM versus open sublay technique for elective incisional hernia repair: a registry-based, propensity score-matched comparison of 9907 patients [^901c82eb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Management pattern for ventral and incisional hernias are heterogeneous, often with little supporting evidence or correlation with existing evidence. In a systematic review and network meta-analysis of mesh location in open ventral hernia repair, sublay mesh location had lower complication rates than other mesh locations. An expert consensus endorsed sublay as the optimal mesh location in open, elective ventral hernia repair. Numerous meta-analyses demonstrated that laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair is a feasible and effective alternative to the open technique and is associated with lower incidence of wound complications. In these meta-analyses comparing laparoscopic versus open repair of ventral hernias, data on primary hernias (umbilical, epigastric) and secondary (incisional) hernias were pooled. As treatment outcomes of primary and incisional ventral hernias show significant differences, it is essential to conduct studies that compare the various surgical techniques focusing on a single hernia type. Two meta-analyses compared laparoscopic and open techniques in incisional hernia repair only.

Based on six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a maximum of 751 patients, the largest of those two meta-analyses found a statistically significant reduction in wound complications with laparoscopic compared to open repair of incisional hernias. However, the rate of bowel complications was significantly higher for the laparoscopic approach.

On the basis of these findings international guidelines recommend laparoscopic over open repair of incisional hernias due to the significantly reduced risk of wound complications, provided that the higher risk of intraoperative complications has been carefully evaluated.

On the contrary, a nationwide study of the Danish Hernia Database on early outcomes after incisional hernia repair observed major complications in 2.8% of open and in 4.8% of laparoscopic repairs with a total morbidity rate of 10.1% in open and 11.8% in laparoscopic repairs. These findings indicate that outcomes after incisional hernia repair, particularly concerning the laparoscopic approach, are unsatisfactory.

The current analysis used prospective data from the Herniamed Hernia Registry to compare outcomes for the laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) and open sublay techniques recommended in the guidelines for incisional hernia repair. Propensity score (PS) matching was utilized for statistical analysis of the prospective data. Analyzed outcome variables included perioperative complications and complication-related reoperations, as well as the rates of recurrence, pain at rest and on exertion, and pain requiring treatment after 1-year follow-up.

### Flood syndrome: endovascular management of spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia due to long-standing ascites – A case report [^232cb30f]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis of the liver and ascites; however, spontaneous rupture of the hernia is a rare complication. Flood Syndrome occurs very rarely in cirrhotic patients with massive ascites and refers to the spontaneous rupture of an umbilical hernia followed by leakage of ascites fluid. A literature search shows that patients have been managed both operatively and nonoperatively for this condition. We report a case of a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related liver cirrhosis and massive ascites refractory to medical therapy with sudden and spontaneous perforation of his hernia leading to drainage of ascitic fluid from the abdomen. We performed a transjugular intrahepatic portosystematic shunt to relieve portal pressure and subsequent intraabdominal pressure. The patient had resolution of symptoms and the ascitic fluid outflow was resolved.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^c2e0ac45]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Symptoms

The study found seven publications dealing with symptoms, including two database studies [84] and one a questionnaire study [82]. A large study with a long-term follow-up period (≤ 10 years) including 564 patients, showed that 11% of patients experience an incisional hernia, with 33% having symptoms and 14% experiencing obstruction [80]. In a retrospective review of 959 patients after liver transplantation, Vardanian et al. [83] found an incisional hernia rate of 4.6%, with 78% of the hernias being symptomatic (pain and discomfort) and 5% presenting with incarceration or strangulation. In the series of Courtney et al. [86], 78% of the patients underwent surgery because of pain, whereas 10% presented acutely [87], and in the series published by Hjaltason, umbilical hernias were incarcerated five times more often than incisional hernias.

Acute hernia

Emergency repairs of acute abdominal hernia are associated with a high morbidity rate [81, 88, 93]. In patients managed by a "watchful waiting" strategy, Davies et al. reported a significant proportion who presented with acute hernia. The series of Alani et al. comprised an interestingly high rate of acute ventral hernia amounting to almost 50% of the prospectively reviewed population. As a percentage of all the hernias managed by surgery during the study period, the 12.2% incidence of acute ventral hernias still is high [89]. Regarding pediatric umbilical hernia, a retrospective review of 489 children showed a 7% rate of presentation with acute hernia [90]. Earlier studies showed an incarceration rate of 14.6% and a strangulation rate of 2.4% [91].

Age

Only one retrospective study providing level 4 evidence and involving 155 patients addressed the question whether advanced age is a contraindication for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The study population was divided in two groups based on a threshold at 65 years. The authors did not find any significant difference regarding morbidity and mortality [92]. The Cochrane Review [106] comparing laparoscopic and open surgical techniques for ventral and incisional hernia repair showed a clearcut and consistent reduced risk for SSI in the laparoscopic group, and this review has had a great impact on hernia surgery among the elderly.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hernia [^e1bf0fcc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominopelvic hernias are common clinical entities composed of a wide variety of congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic etiologies. Any weakness in the body wall may result in hernia of cavity contents with concomitant risks of morbidity and mortality. Presentations may be specific, palpable body wall mass/bulge, or vague, nonspecific pain through bowel obstruction. This document focuses on initial imaging of the adult population with signs of symptoms prompting suspicion of abdominopelvic hernia. Imaging of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate defects is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often CT and ultrasound are the first-line modalities to quickly evaluate the abdomen and pelvis, providing for accurate diagnoses and management of patients. MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in patients with orthopedic instrumentation. Although often performed, abdominal radiographs and fluorographic procedures may provide indirect evidence of hernias but are usually not indicated for initial diagnosis of hernia. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Management of umbilical hernia complicated with liver cirrhosis: an advocate of early and elective herniorrhaphy [^b31fe017]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis have an increased likelihood of complications following herniorrhaphy. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients with umbilical hernias complicated by liver cirrhosis.

Methods

Between 2001 and 2010, 44 patients were enrolled in this study. The comparison between non-operative and operative group was performed. Patients who underwent emergency versus elective surgery were also compared.

Results

Of the 44 patients, there were 33 men and 11 women. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) underwent surgery and 13 patients (29.5%) were treated conservatively. Overall morbidity and mortality rates following herniorrhaphy were 42% and 6.5%. The mean albumin level was significantly lower and total bilirubin, creatinine and mean model of end-stage liver disease score were significantly higher in non-operative group than in operative group. Combined resection was performed more frequently in the emergency group than in elective group. A significantly higher proportion of patients in emergency operation group had postoperative complications (P = 0.01), especially ascites (P = 0.02). The operative time and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the elective operation group than in emergency operation group.

Conclusions

Early, elective repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients should be advocated considering the hepatic reserve and patient's condition. Ascites control is the mainstay of post-operative management.

### Prospective analysis of outcomes in umbilical hernia repair for patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^77e7f0aa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

What the new findings are:

We prospectively assessed the short- and long-term outcomes of 19 cirrhotic patients with ascites, who underwent either elective or emergency UHR, and evaluated any possible risk factors associated with these outcomes
Patients who underwent UHR, either electively or urgently, had high overall mortality rates of 26.32% at 30 days and 68.42% at 12 months, with worse outcomes in the elective UHR group
We confirmed that advanced Child-Turcotte-Pugh classes B and C are the primary factors driving poor survival in these patients
Opting for UHR under local anesthesia, preferably at earlier stages of cirrhosis, is the optimal practice

### Open versus laparoscopic umbilical and epigastric hernia repair: nationwide data on short-and long-term outcomes [^b4083990]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether an open or laparoscopic approach results in the best outcomes for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rates of 90-day readmission and reoperation for complication, together with rate of operation for recurrence after either open or laparoscopic mesh repair for primary umbilical or epigastric hernias with defect widths above 1 cm.

Methods

A merge of data between the Danish Hernia Database and the National Patient Registry provided data from 2007 to 2018 on perioperative information, 90-day readmission, 90-day reoperation for complication, and long-term operation for hernia recurrence.

Results

A total of 6855 patients were included, of whom 4106 (59.9%) and 2749 (40.1%) patients had an open or laparoscopic repair, respectively. There were significantly more patients readmitted with a superficial surgical site infection 2.5% (102/4106) after open repair compared with laparoscopic repair (0.5% (15/2749), P < 0.001. The 90-day reoperation rate for complications was significantly higher for open repairs 5.0% (205/4106) compared with laparoscopic repairs 2.7% (75/2749), P < 0.001. The incidence of a reoperation for a severe condition was significantly increased after laparoscopic repair 1.5% (41/2749) compared with open repair 0.8% (34/4106), P = 0.010. The 4-year cumulative incidence of operation for hernia recurrence was 3.5% after open and 4.2% after laparoscopic repairs, P = 0.302.

Conclusions

Recurrence rates were comparable between open and laparoscopic repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias. Open repair was associated with a significantly higher rate of readmission and reoperation due to surgical site infection, whereas the rate of reoperation due to a severe complication was significantly higher after laparoscopic repair.

### Laparoscopic versus open elective repair of primary umbilical hernias: short-term outcomes from the American college of surgeons national surgery quality improvement program [^af2e2bc3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 175,000 umbilical hernia repairs are performed annually in the US. Controversy exists regarding the optimal approach for the elective repair of primary umbilical hernias.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare 30-day outcomes of elective primary open (OHR) and laparoscopic (LHR) umbilical hernia repairs, using a prospectively collected dataset.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files during 2009 and 2010. Current Procedural Terminology and post-operative International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes were used to identify primary umbilical hernia repairs. Primary outcomes included composite endpoints of 30-day mortality, and major and overall complications. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed controlling for relevant patient characteristics. Secondary outcomes included operative time and hospital length of stay (LOS).

Results

Overall, 14,652 patients were identified-13,109 (89.5%) OHR and 1543 (10.5%) LHR. Univariate analyses of primary outcomes demonstrated similar 30-day morbidity and mortality between groups. In our multivariate model, however, after controlling for body mass index, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the odds ratio (OR) for overall complications favored LHR (OR 0.60; p = 0.01). This difference was driven primarily by the reduced wound complication rate in the LHR group [OR 0.41 (0.20, 0.78); p = 0.005]. LHR was associated with significantly longer operative time [57.7 min (SD 32.6) vs. 38.3 min (SD 22.9); p < 0.001], longer LOS [0.29 days (SD 0.68) vs. 0.17 days (SD 1.47); p = 0.001], and an increased rate of respiratory (0.52 vs. 0.10%; p < 0.001) and cardiac (0.26 vs. 0.05%; p = 0.005) complications.

Conclusions

This study identified potential decreased total and wound morbidity associated with LHR for elective primary umbilical hernia repairs at the expense of increased operative time, LOS, and respiratory and cardiac complications. These results should be considered within the context of a retrospective study with its inherent risks of bias and limitations.

### A pilot study of the rectus sheath block for pain control after umbilical hernia repair [^65559115]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia repair, a common day surgery procedure in children, is associated with significant postoperative discomfort. The rectus sheath block may offer improved pain management following umbilical hernia repair. In this pilot study, we compared the efficacy of the rectus sheath block with that of our current standard practice — local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical wound — for pain control after umbilical hernia repair in children.

Methods

Fourteen children, aged 1–8 years, undergoing umbilical hernia repair were randomly assigned to receive either a rectus sheath block or local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical wound at completion of surgery. Anesthetic management was standardized. Each analgesic technique was performed using 0.8 mL × kg⁻¹ of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. Postoperatively, an investigator who was blinded to the analgesic technique recorded the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores and sedation scores every 10 min, and administered intravenous morphine 50 microg × kg⁻¹ for cases with CHEOPS scores ≥ 8. Total morphine dose was recorded. Parents were telephoned the day after surgery to determine the overall satisfaction with pain control.

Results

Total postoperative morphine consumption did not differ significantly between groups, averaging 0.10 ± 0.09 and 0.10 ± 0.07 mg × kg⁻¹ for the local infiltration and rectus sheath groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in pain or sedation scores, and no complications related to either analgesic technique.

Discussion

Our results suggest that the rectus sheath block has no advantage over infiltration of local anesthetic into the surgical wound for postoperative pain management in children undergoing umbilical hernia repair.

### Perioperative management of infant inguinal hernia surgery; a review of the recent literature [^d9f1c85c]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Increasingly, pediatric surgeons are choosing to both identify and repair pediatric inguinal hernias via conventional laparoscopic techniques with the camera port in the umbilicus. This allows for addressing the ipsilateral, presenting hernia without an open groin incision as well as inspection, and if required, repair of the contralateral side. Data from Europe and North America confirms that the laparoscopic approach is gaining in popularity, although a true tipping point has not been reached and the open approach remains more popular. With the increasing advent of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs in children, a host of different technical variations have been described — an excellent compendium recently compiled by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons lists 20 unique procedures. Importantly, these all adhere to the original surgical dictum of controlling the "neck" of the hernia at the internal inguinal ring and none of the repairs use mesh or other exogenous material to reinforce the closure.

Because of the plethora of surgical techniques, comparative data of outcome and complication rates are difficult to analyze. Indeed, multiple overlapping systematic reviews have selectively included or excluded different source data on the topic. Despite these variations, what is relatively clear is that the laparoscopic approach to addressing a pediatric inguinal hernia results in a comparable risk profile with regards to the ipsilateral presenting pathology while reducing the risk of a later metachronous hernia on the contralateral side. There may be differences in resource utilization rates when comparing the open and laparoscopic techniques: several studies suggest that a unilateral hernia may be more expeditiously addressed with the open approach whereas a bilateral hernia (or ipsilateral hernia with a contralateral patent processus vaginalis) can be repaired more quickly via laparoscopy. Furthermore, laparoscopy may be advantageous in addressing instances of incarcerated inguinal hernias by allowing for easier reduction and inspection of incarcerated contents; a shorter length of stay and less overall complications has been documented in a recent systematic review.

### Perforation of a congenital umbilical hernia in a patient with Hurler's syndrome [^9018e64d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital umbilical hernias in Hurler's syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis I) are generally treated conservatively, because complications such as incarceration are, rare, and risks involved in surgical correction are high. This case report describes the surgical management of a ruptured umbilical hernia in a 3-year-old child with Hurler's syndrome. Emergency repair of the hernia was performed with primary closure of the fascia; hernia recurrence 6 months later was treated laparoscopically using a PTFE mesh graft with no evidence of re-recurrence. In selected cases of Hurler's syndrome (warning signs of rupture) elective surgical hernia repair may be indicated.

### Incidence of umbilical hernia in African children: redefinition of "normal" and reevaluation of indications for repair [^2444ba54]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to assess the degree of ubiquity of umbilical hernias (UHs) in Nigerians and to determine if a laissez faire approach to the presence of UHs is justified. A prospective evaluation was conducted of the umbilical area of 4052 Nigerians living in the vicinity of the Baptist Medical Centre (BMCO) in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. The diameter of the fascial defect was measured with the subject supine and the protrusion of the umbilical skin with the subject erect. Subjects were divided into three groups: group 1 (1 month to 18 years old); group 2 (older than 18 years); and group 3 (pregnant women in an antenatal clinic). "Outies" (defined as any protrusion of the umbilical tip past the periumbilical skin) were present in 92% of group 1, 49% of group 2, and 90% of group 3 subjects. UHs (defined as protrusion of at least 5 mm and diameter of at least 10 mm) were present in 23% of group 1, 8% of group 2, and 15% of group 3 subjects. Spontaneous closure of UHs seems to occur until age 14. A retrospective analysis identified 11 patients undergoing emergency operations for UH-related problems during the past 15 years. With a low incidence and 0% mortality rate associated with management of these emergencies, a policy of prophylactic repair is not justified at BMCO. Because most of the children we examined had outies, repair for cosmetic reasons is rarely requested. The only logical indication for repair of UHs at BMCO is incarceration, and this rarely occurs.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^60ceebf2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Indication related to size

The systematic search provided only one article on defect size and outcome [96]. Moreno-Egea et al. performed a prospective study without a control group that excluded hernias smaller than 5 cm in diameter and those with "Swiss cheese" defects. The data analysis showed that size correlates with recurrence, and these authors recommended restriction of the laparoscopic approach to a hernia size of 10 cm or smaller (level 4). A retrospective single-center study of 302 patients who underwent open repair of primary incisional hernia analyzed several risk factors for recurrence and demonstrated that the size of the hernia is a significant risk factor for recurrence [97].

Asymptomatic hernias

The search found no publications on the natural history of the condition. One long-term prospective study and one review showed 60% of patients with incisional hernias to be symptom free [80, 81]. An international questionnaire among hernia specialists showed a rate of 23% for asymptomatic cases, and more than 20% of the patients did not undergo operative repair. The strangulation/incarceration rate was 5% [82]. The group concluded that there are no hard data describing the natural course of an incisional hernia. Their current view is that patients with asymptomatic incisional hernias should be undergo surgery to avoid complications.

Precise data on the strangulation rate or the risk for acute incarceration of incisional hernias are unavailable. One small prospective case study reported an emergency operation rate of 3.2% [103]. The data from the Danish Ventral Hernia Database published by Helgstrand et al. [84] showed an acute hernia rate of 10%, with umbilical hernias showing the highest rate (57%). No controlled studies have investigated the increase in size of incisional hernias over time, the risk factors for strangulation, or the development of discomfort and pain.

A prospective case study involving consecutive patients investigated whether patients obtain pain relief from surgery [103]. This study found no benefit regarding pain for patients with minimal symptoms. Two prospective trials have been launched to address this question relating to the indication for surgery among asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic incisional patients. The multicenter AWARE trial of Lauscher et al. [104] is the multicenter study in the recruiting phase and the second trial that has completed intake and data collection but has not been published to date [105]. Hence, no conclusive data exist currently, but the issue is likely to be resolved with publication of the results from the two trials.

### Incarcerated umbilical hernia in a super-super-obese patient [^d1f82f3a]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall hernias are more prevalent in the morbidly obese. Incarceration of external hernias is a relatively common process in adults and is associated to a high rate of complications and mortality. We present the case of a morbidly super-super-obese patient (body mass index, 80 kg/m²) who underwent emergency surgery for an incarcerated umbilical hernia; the patient died despite segmental intestinal resection, hernia repair using mesh, and intensive care.

### Umbilical paracentesis for acute hernia reduction in cirrhotic patients [^39e6789a]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergent repair of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. We propose a new technique, umbilical paracentesis, for reduction of incarcerated hernias in the patient with ascites. Under ultrasound guidance, removal of ascitic fluid from the umbilical hernia sac can reduce the local pressure and thereby allow for easy hernia reduction, thus avoiding the need for an emergent operation.

### Factors associated with long-term outcomes of umbilical hernia repair [^6c2c2659]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Umbilical hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed general surgical procedures. However, there is little consensus about the factors that lead to umbilical hernia recurrence.

Objective

To better understand the factors associated with long-term umbilical hernia recurrence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort of 332 military veteran patients who underwent umbilical hernia repair was studied between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2008, at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Recurrence and mortality outcomes were tracked from that period until June 1, 2014. Data were collected on patient characteristics, operative, and postoperative factors and univariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess which factors were significantly associated with umbilical hernia recurrence and mortality. All patients with primary umbilical hernia repair, with or without a concurrent unrelated procedure, were included in the study. Patients excluded were those who underwent umbilical hernia repair as a part of another major planned procedure with abdominal incisions. Data were collected from June 1, 2014, to November 1, 2015. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2, 2015, to April 1, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study outcomes were umbilical hernia recurrence and death.

Results

Of the 332 patients in this study, 321 (96.7%) were male, mean age was 58.4 years, and mean (SD) time of follow-up was 8.5 (4.1) years. The hernia recurrence rate was 6.0% (n = 20) at a mean 3.1 years after index repair (median, 1.0-year; range, 0.33–13 years). The primary suture repair recurrence rate was 9.8% (16 of 163 patients), and the mesh repair recurrence rate was 2.4% (4 of 169 patients). On univariate analysis, ascites (P = 0.02), liver disease (P = 0.02), diabetes (P = 0.04), and primary suture (nonmesh) repairs (P = 0.04) were significantly associated with increased recurrence rates. Patients who had a history of hernias (125 [39%]) were less likely to have umbilical hernia recurrences (χ21 = 4.65, P = 0.03). On multivariable regression analysis, obesity and ascites were associated with significantly increased odds ratios of recurrence of 3.3 (95% CI, 1.0–10.1) and 8.0 (95% CI, 1.8–34.4), respectively. Mesh repair was seen to decrease recurrence with odds of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.08–0.95). There was no significant difference in complication rates between mesh repair and primary suture repair. The survival rate was 73% (n = 242) at the end of the study. Factors associated with mortality were older age, smoking, liver disease, ascites, emergency or semiurgent repair, and need for intraoperative bowel resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ascites, liver disease, diabetes, obesity, and primary suture repair without mesh are associated with increased umbilical hernia recurrence rates. Elective umbilical hernia repair with mesh should be considered in patients with multiple comorbidities given that the use of mesh offers protection from recurrence without major morbidity.

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^da74ba31]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernia repair (UHR) is an elective pediatric surgical procedure that is frequently unnecessarily performed in young children, as most pediatric umbilical hernias close spontaneously within the first few years of life. Current guidelines recommend careful observation until children are 4 years of age with the goal of also reducing pediatric anesthesia-related risks, especially repeated anesthesia in the setting of hernia recurrence. However, nearly 30% of pediatric UHRs are performed in children under 4 years of age. As HDHPs and out-of-pocket costs have been shown to motivate patients and families to delay or avoid medical care, patients with HDHPs may be less likely to undergo UHR before 4 years of age. Out-of-pocket cost considerations may also motivate families to delay UHR even beyond 5 years of age, perhaps long after it is recommended by a physician to be performed. It is also possible that physician preferences play a greater role than parental preferences in the timing of UHR, from the decision to refer for surgical consultation to the pursuance and timing of surgery after surgeon consultation. As a result, it may be that out-of-pocket cost considerations have little effect on age at pediatric UHR. This study aimed to evaluate whether children with HDHPs, as compared with other types of commercial health plans, are less likely to undergo UHR before 4 years of age but are more likely to undergo UHR after 5 years of age. We also aimed to evaluate whether children with HDHPs more often undergo UHR toward the end of the calendar year, when their families are more likely to have already met their health plan's deductible.

### Life-threatening dapagliflozin-associated euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a postoperative patient [^148a74a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Euglyceamic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is an uncommon but serious diabetes mellitus complication associated with risk factors such as fasting, surgery, pregnancy and, more recently, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). This case is of a woman with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in her 50s who underwent an incarcerated umbilical hernia repair and abdominoplasty. Two days after discharge, she was readmitted with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, low-grade fever and breathing difficulty. Preoperatively, her diabetes management included an SGLT2i. She was diagnosed with EuDKA with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, a medical emergency similar to diabetic ketoacidosis. The normal blood glucose levels in EuDKA can mask the condition, which poses a conundrum for physicians in the emergency department/intensive care units as it may delay diagnosis and treatment, worsening the outcomes. To mitigate this risk, SGLT2i should be stopped 3-4days before planned surgery with appropriate adjustments to the insulin regimen.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^95304aa7]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The final diagnoses for the 500 patients that had a standard re-evaluation are given in Table 2. The average follow-up was 12 days (range: 1–275 days), but most of the patients (46.2%) could be discharged from follow-up after just one outpatient visit.

Table 2
The final diagnoses for 500 patients who were not admitted to the hospital but who underwent standard outpatient re-evaluation after presentation at the emergency department for acute abdominal pain

NOS not otherwise specified

For 148 patients (29.6%) the final diagnosis (FD) was different from the initial clinical diagnosis (D1) or the combined diagnosis (CD1) after additional radiological imaging on the day of first evaluation (Table 3). Eighty-five (17.0%) patients had a change in management, 20 of which (4.0%) were considered major (Table 4). A change in management was regarded as major if the clinical strategy changed to a surgical procedure when the initial strategy was conservative. Seventeen patients underwent operation after re-evaluation for presumed appendicitis (1 negative appendectomy), one for an incarcerated umbilical hernia, another for an incarcerated ventral hernia; one patient underwent laparotomy for intestinal obstruction due to adhesions.

Comment

Overall, the published experimental and clinical studies outline an unclear picture compounded by differences in techniques used (stapler, sutures) and levels of experience. These account for the variability of reported data such as OR times. In essence, high-quality, high-volume studies are too few. The reported studies often do not differentiate between ventral, umbilical, and incisional hernias, rendering interpretation of the outcomes more difficult. In addition, complications often are grouped together, making it difficult to analyze specific complications.

Conclusions

The main important finding is that laparoscopic hernia repair results in a lower incidence of wound infection than open repair. For other complications such as bowel injury, long OR time, and seroma, no clear statement is possible because of conflicting data and poor levels of evidence.

Materials and Methods

General Information

We selected 139 patients who underwent scheduled laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair with IPOM under general anesthesia at our hospital from October 2022 to February 2024. The patients ranged in age from 26 to 75 years and weighed between 49 and 85 kg. They were classified as ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) Class I–III. Exclusion criteria for the study: a history of drug abuse; severe coagulopathy; unplanned postoperative transfers to the surgical intensive care unit; skin breakdown or infection at the nerve block site; severe cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal dysfunction; neurological or psychiatric disorders; and emergency admissions for incarcerated umbilical hernias. The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee. Before surgery, patients and their families provided informed consent and were randomly assigned to either the general anesthesia combined with RSB group (Group GR) or the general anesthesia alone group (Group G) according to a random number table. The study flow is illustrated in Figure 1.

### Assessment and management of inguinal hernias in children [^16b7d528]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Inguinal hernias in children — key summary statements are as follows: Inguinal hernias are a common pediatric surgical condition, and the risk of incarceration drives the preference for and timing of surgical repair. In preterm infants, repair can be safely considered after discharge from the NICU. Ideally, pediatric surgical specialists, pediatric urologists, or general surgeons with a significant yearly case volume should repair pediatric inguinal hernias to achieve optimal outcomes. The laparoscopic approach appears to be gaining popularity and is at least as effective as, if not better than, traditional open high ligation. In the absence of strong data for or against repair of incidentally discovered contralateral patent processus vaginalis (PPV), family values related to the risks and benefits of each approach from a nuanced preoperative discussion should be considered. Laparoscopy appears to be a feasible alternative in managing recurrent hernias. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that exposure to a single relatively short duration of anesthetic has adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes in otherwise healthy children. Study authors recommended cardiorespiratory monitoring in all former preterm infants less than 60 weeks of corrected gestational age, and institutional policies should be developed outlining the need and duration of observation after anesthesia in former preterm infants.
