## Question

insulinoma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about insulinoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and clinical presentation to frame pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic framework, including Whipple's triad and the biochemical thresholds. Next, I will review the imaging algorithm and how to sequence modalities. After that, I need to consider special populations and pitfalls, including MEN1, diabetes, and renal disease. Then, I will outline surgical management and alternatives, followed by medical therapy for unresectable disease. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, prognosis, and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and clinical phenotype so I don't jump to conclusions. Insulinoma is the most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, with an incidence around 0.7–4 per million per year, a female predominance, and a peak in the fifth to sixth decades, though MEN1-associated cases present earlier and can be multifocal, which I should keep in mind for younger patients or those with family history of endocrine tumors [^111TRHzA] [^117VKHgZ] [^111xvNoM].

> Wait, let me verify the classic presentation before anchoring on it. The hallmark is Whipple's triad: symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, a documented low plasma glucose at the time of symptoms, and resolution of symptoms with glucose administration; neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, visual disturbances, or seizures are common and often misattributed to psychiatric or neurologic disease, which explains the typical diagnostic delay of 18–30 months in many series [^116pto3U] [^117TWSnE] [^113Wqdbi].

> Hold on, I should verify the biochemical diagnostic thresholds because different sources cite slightly different cutoffs. NCCN supports documenting hypoglycemia with inappropriately elevated insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during the event, with commonly used thresholds of insulin greater than 3 μU/mL, C-peptide at least 0.6 ng/mL, and proinsulin at least 5 pmol/L when glucose is less than 55 mg/dL; some contemporary series use stricter glucose cutoffs of 40–45 mg/dL, so I need to reconcile this by ensuring the biochemical abnormality is demonstrated concurrently with symptoms and low glucose rather than relying on a single rigid glucose threshold [^112fUJEN] [^116jPjic] [^114E7xFW].

> I need to check the gold standard test and its nuances. The supervised 72-hour fast remains the reference standard; if hypoglycemia does not occur spontaneously, a structured fast with serial sampling of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin at the time of symptomatic hypoglycemia is appropriate, and some centers shorten to 48 hours if criteria are met earlier; importantly, a "normal" fast does not absolutely exclude insulinoma in rare cases, so clinical suspicion should guide further testing or alternative provocation strategies when the story is compelling [^112fUJEN] [^116pto3U] [^114U6EkQ].

> Let me consider the differential so I don't anchor prematurely. I should exclude exogenous insulin or sulfonylurea use with a careful medication history and toxicology screen, consider insulin autoimmune syndrome, noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia, post-bariatric hypoglycemia, and non–insulin-mediated causes such as adrenal insufficiency, hepatic or renal failure, and non–islet cell tumors; factitious hypoglycemia often shows high insulin with suppressed C-peptide/proinsulin, whereas sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia can mimic insulinoma biochemically, so a drug screen is essential [^113Wqdbi] [^111tKVt4] [^115EwdTR].

> Next, I should review the imaging algorithm and make sure I sequence modalities correctly. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis is first-line to localize and stage, but because many insulinomas are under 10–15 mm, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offers the highest sensitivity for small intrapancreatic lesions and should be used when CT/MRI are negative or equivocal; for occult indolent tumors, GLP-1 receptor PET/CT or PET/MRI is highly sensitive, whereas SSTR-PET is less consistently positive in benign insulinomas but more useful in aggressive disease; if noninvasive imaging fails, selective arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling can regionalize the source of hyperinsulinism [^116zncMU] [^115sX6Gr] [^117Rm5Qo] [^113Pezwj] [^114zQSvY].

> But wait, what if the patient is young or has multifocal disease. I should double-check for MEN1 in patients diagnosed at age 35 or younger, those with multiple pancreatic lesions, or a family history of parathyroid, pituitary, or other endocrine tumors; MEN1-associated insulinomas are more often multiple, larger at resection, and occur earlier, and management may require more extensive pancreatic surgery or staged procedures to balance cure against exocrine/endocrine insufficiency [^111TRHzA] [^111KovaX] [^113KB3in].

> I will now examine surgical management, since cure is the goal in localized disease. Enucleation is preferred for small, peripheral, benign lesions more than 2–3 mm from the main pancreatic duct, whereas distal pancreatectomy with or without splenic preservation is appropriate for body/tail lesions; pancreaticoduodenectomy is reserved for head lesions not amenable to enucleation; minimally invasive approaches are feasible in experienced hands, and intraoperative ultrasound with palpation remains invaluable when preoperative localization is uncertain; importantly, blind distal pancreatectomy should be avoided if the tumor is not identified [^117RgmuK] [^1179hkQe] [^112HiAXZ].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives when surgery is contraindicated or declined. Endoscopic ultrasound–guided radiofrequency ablation has emerging evidence for small, well-selected lesions, particularly near the duct where enucleation carries high fistula risk; medical therapy with diazoxide, frequent carbohydrates, and somatostatin analogs can mitigate hypoglycemia, though efficacy is variable; for refractory cases, everolimus or sunitinib may be considered, and PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE is reasonable in SSTR-positive aggressive disease; continuous glucose monitoring helps quantify hypoglycemia burden and guide therapy and safety [^111iAFEE] [^113HusER] [^113g3aSv] [^115afmTK].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't miss important pitfalls. In patients with preexisting diabetes, unexplained or persistent hypoglycemia despite stopping antihyperglycemic therapy should prompt evaluation for insulinoma; in renal impairment, insulin and C-peptide handling is altered, so interpretation of thresholds must be cautious; rarely, insulinoma can coexist with or mask type 1 diabetes, so postoperative hyperglycemia warrants checking islet autoantibodies and assessing endogenous insulin reserve; and although most insulinomas are benign, larger size, atypical imaging features, and heterogeneous insulin/proinsulin expression raise concern for aggressive behavior and mandate thorough staging [^112wRjF9] [^113uXQDY] [^111q76y3] [^115MgHhL].

> I should confirm follow-up and prognosis to close the loop. For indolent, nonmetastatic insulinomas, surgical resection is curative in the vast majority with 5-year survival approaching 94–100%, whereas aggressive metastatic disease carries substantially lower survival; recurrence risk is higher in MEN1, warranting long-term surveillance for hypoglycemia and new lesions; patient education on hypoglycemia recognition, medic alert identification, glucagon for rescue, and structured follow-up with periodic imaging are prudent [^117VKHgZ] [^114vRBn4] [^111JRmYd].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Suspect insulinoma in patients with Whipple's triad or compatible neuroglycopenic symptoms; confirm endogenous hyperinsulinism with insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during spontaneous or provoked hypoglycemia; exclude factitious causes and other differentials; localize with multiphasic CT/MRI, add EUS if needed, and deploy GLP-1R PET/CT for occult indolent tumors or SSTR-PET for suspected aggressive disease; refer for surgery when feasible, tailoring resection to anatomy and multifocality; use medical therapy or ablation when surgery is not possible; and arrange long-term surveillance with education and rescue strategies, adjusting for MEN1 and other special contexts [^112fUJEN] [^116zncMU] [^117RgmuK].

Insulinoma is a rare, benign pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that causes **fasting hypoglycemia** [^116pto3U] due to autonomous insulin secretion [^116pto3U]. Diagnosis requires the **Whipple triad** (symptoms of hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose, and symptom relief with glucose) [^113Wqdbi] plus biochemical confirmation of inappropriately elevated insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN]. Imaging with multiphasic CT/MRI and endoscopic ultrasound [^116zncMU] is used for localization, with GLP-1 receptor PET/CT for occult tumors [^115sX6Gr]. Surgical enucleation or resection is **curative** [^114RaDPT] in most cases; medical therapy (diazoxide, somatostatin analogs, everolimus) is reserved for inoperable or metastatic disease [^113HusER]. Prognosis is excellent for benign tumors, with 5-year survival 94–100% [^117VKHgZ]; malignant insulinomas have poorer outcomes and require multimodal therapy [^113qiDPH].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Incidence**: 1–4 per million per year [^117VKHgZ]; female predominance (64.5%) [^117TWSnE]; median age ~48 years [^notfound].
- **Symptoms**: Neuroglycopenic (confusion, seizures, coma) and autonomic (sweating, palpitations, hunger) [^116pto3U]; symptoms typically fasting, but ~20% postprandial [^116pto3U].
- **Whipple triad**: Symptoms of hypoglycemia, plasma glucose < 55 mg/dL, and relief with glucose [^116pto3U].

---

## Pathophysiology

Pathophysiology involves **autonomous insulin secretion** by tumor β-cells, causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia despite low glucose [^112fUJEN]. Molecularly, YY1 mutations and chromatin remodeling are common; aggressive tumors show ATRX/DAXX mutations and ALT phenotype [^112tVnVG].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biochemical tests

- **Whipple triad**: Essential clinical foundation [^113Wqdbi].
- **Biochemical diagnosis**: Elevated insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during hypoglycemia; exclude sulfonylureas [^112fUJEN].
- **72-hour fast**: Gold standard; insulin ≥ 3 μU/mL, C-peptide ≥ 0.2 nmol/L, proinsulin ≥ 5 pmol/L with glucose < 55 mg/dL [^116pto3U].

---

## Imaging modalities for localization

| **Imaging modality** | **Sensitivity** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Multiphasic CT/MRI | 70–90% | First-line; detects tumors ≥ 1 cm [^116zncMU] |
| Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | 85–100% | Highly sensitive for small tumors; allows FNA [^114zQSvY] |
| GLP-1 receptor PET/CT | 85–98% | For occult or recurrent tumors [^115sX6Gr] |
| Selective arterial calcium stimulation | 80–90% | For negative noninvasive imaging [^117Rm5Qo] |

---

## Treatment options

### Surgical management

- **Enucleation**: Preferred for small, benign, well-localized tumors away from ducts [^1179hkQe].
- **Resection**: Distal pancreatectomy or Whipple for large, deep, or malignant tumors [^117RgmuK].
- **Laparoscopic/robotic**: Feasible with low morbidity in experienced centers [^1179hkQe].

---

### Medical management

- **Diazoxide**: First-line to suppress insulin secretion [^113HusER].
- **Somatostatin analogs**: Octreotide/lanreotide; variable efficacy [^113HusER].
- **Everolimus**: For refractory cases; mTOR inhibitor [^113g3aSv].
- **EUS-guided ablation**: Emerging for inoperable tumors [^115C6fys].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** for benign insulinomas, with 5-year survival of 94–100% [^117VKHgZ]. Malignant insulinomas have 5-year survival of 24–67% and require multimodal therapy [^117VKHgZ]. Recurrence occurs in 5–10% — higher with MEN1 or incomplete resection — and warrants long-term surveillance [^114vRBn4].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up includes **regular clinical and biochemical monitoring** for recurrence [^117VKHgZ]. Imaging with periodic CT/MRI or EUS is recommended, with GLP-1 PET/CT for suspected recurrence [^115WmJXh]. Patient education should cover hypoglycemia recognition and emergency management [^111JRmYd].

---

Insulinoma is a rare, benign tumor causing fasting hypoglycemia; diagnosis relies on the **Whipple triad** and biochemical confirmation, with imaging for localization. Surgery is curative in most cases, while medical therapy is reserved for inoperable or metastatic disease; prognosis is excellent for benign tumors, with vigilant surveillance for recurrence.

### Multimodality preoperative imaging of pancreatic insulinomas [^111sogQV]. Clinical Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic insulinomas are rare tumours of the islet cells of the pancreas, which account for the majority of functional neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas. There is often a typical history of recurrent hypoglycaemic collapse and dizzy spells. Insulinomas are usually solitary, and the vast majority are intra-pancreatic in location. They are characteristically small with approximately 66% being less than 2cm at presentation. Insulinomas continue to pose a diagnostic challenge to physicians, surgeons and radiologists alike. The role of imaging is to detect and provide precise anatomical localization and staging of tumours prior to surgery. Due to their small size at clinical presentation, they are notoriously difficult to localize radiologically, and specifically designed protocols are necessary to aid detection. In this review, we describe the current "state of the art" imaging protocols that may be used in the preoperative localization of insulinomas.

Diagnosis and Presentation

The Whipple triad, named after the American surgeon Allen O. Whipple (1881–1963), is the diagnostic hallmark establishing the existence of a hypoglycemic disorder and has the following 3 features: (1) symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia; (2) low plasma glucose measured at the time of the symptoms and signs; and (3) relief of symptoms and signs when the glucose is raised to a normal level. In addition to the familiar hypoglycemic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, nervousness, and feeling of hunger, neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, visual disturbances, or seizures may also occur. The latter may cause patients to be misdiagnosed with a psychiatric or neurological disorder. Symptoms occur mainly in the fasting state, but up to 20% of patients also described postprandial symptoms. By definition, in endogenous hyperinsulinism, the insulin secretion does not decrease to very low levels when plasma glucose concentrations decrease to hypoglycemic levels. Thus, in patients with insulinoma, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin concentrations are inappropriately high in the setting of low fasting plasma glucose concentrations. According to the most recent clinical practice guidelines, critical diagnostic findings are present when the confirmed fasting plasma glucose concentrations are preferably below 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or below 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (= hypoglycemia — depending on guidelines and cutoffs — the optimal cutoff level for blood glucose is currently still a matter of debate), plasma insulin concentrations of at least 3 μU/mL (18 pmol/L), plasma C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 ng/L (0.2 nmol/L), and plasma proinsulin concentrations of at least 5.0 pmol/L. The patients presented here fulfilled all these criteria. If hypoglycemia does not occur spontaneously, a 72-hour prolonged fasting test should be performed and blood should be drawn for measurements of insulin, and pro-insulin, or C-peptide measurements if hypoglycemia occurs. Some authors have advocated shorter fasting tests. There are data suggesting that a standardized evaluation of neurocognitive function during the fasting test (using the Mini-Mental test) can be helpful and more important than a glucose concentration threshold. Indeed, a median decrease in Mini-Mental score of ≥ 6 points has been shown to be superior for stopping the fasting test than a predefined glucose concentration. For the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia not caused by insulinoma in individuals who have not undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery, such as persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy and noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (nesidioblastosis), administration of exogenous insulin or sulfonylureas, insulinomatosis, and insulin (receptor) autoimmune syndrome (Hirata disease), the reader is referred to other publications.

### The management of insulinoma [^112NEM5N]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare tumours. Their clinical presentation, localization techniques and operative management were reviewed.

Methods

An electronic search of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was undertaken for articles published between January 1966 and June 2005 on the history, presentation, clinical evaluation, use of imaging techniques for tumour localization and operative management of insulinoma.

Results and Conclusion

Most insulinomas are intrapancreatic, benign and solitary. Biochemical diagnosis is obtained during a supervised 72-h fast. Non-invasive preoperative imaging techniques to localize lesions continue to evolve. Intraoperative ultrasonography can be combined with other preoperative imaging modalities to improve tumour detection. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. In the absence of preoperative localization and intraoperative detection of an insulinoma, blind pancreatic resection is not recommended.

### Insulinoma [^111vL1Bk]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Insulinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor with an incidence of 4 per 1 million persons per year, which may occur as a unifocal sporadic event in patients without an inherited syndrome or as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Key neuroglycopenic and hypoglycemic symptoms in conjunction with biochemical proof establish the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established, the insulinoma is preoperatively localized within the pancreas with the goal of surgical excision for cure. This review discusses the historical background, diagnosis, and management of sporadic insulinoma.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^117VKHgZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Insulinomas are hormone-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms with an estimated incidence of 1 to 4 cases per million per year. Extrapancreatic insulinomas are extremely rare. Most insulinomas present with the Whipple triad: (1) symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia; (2) a low plasma glucose measured at the time of the symptoms and signs; and (3) relief of symptoms and signs when the glucose is raised to normal. Nonmetastatic insulinomas are nowadays referred to as "indolent" and metastatic insulinomas as "aggressive". The 5-year survival of patients with an indolent insulinoma has been reported to be 94% to 100%; for patients with an aggressive insulinoma, this amounts to 24% to 67%. Five percent to 10% of insulinomas are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. Localization of the insulinoma and exclusion or confirmation of metastatic disease by computed tomography is followed by endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging for indolent, localized insulinomas. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor positron emission tomography/computed tomography or positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging is a highly sensitive localization technique for seemingly occult, indolent, localized insulinomas. Supportive measures and somatostatin receptor ligands can be used for to control hypoglycemia. For single solitary insulinomas, curative surgical excision remains the treatment of choice. In aggressive malignant cases, debulking procedures, somatostatin receptor ligands, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, everolimus, sunitinib, and cytotoxic chemotherapy can be valuable options.

4 Discussion

Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas, with reported incidence rates varying by region. While epidemiological studies indicate a lower prevalence in Europe and Australia (0.7–1.2 cases per million per year), higher rates have been documented in Japan and the United States (3.3 and 4.0 cases per million per year, respectively). However, no epidemiological studies have been conducted in our country, making the true prevalence of insulinoma unknown. Our study provides the first comprehensive, multicenter analysis of insulinoma cases in the Türkiye, offering valuable insights into clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment outcomes.

Our findings confirm that insulinoma is more common in women (64.5%) and is typically diagnosed in middle‐aged individuals (mean age: 48 years). These results align with previous studies reporting a female predominance and a mean age of onset around 50 years. The mean symptom duration before diagnosis in our cohort was 22 months, consistent with the literature, which reports delays of 18–30 months. The delay in diagnosis is often attributed to the episodic nature of hypoglycemia and the frequent misdiagnosis of neuroglycopenic symptoms as psychiatric or neurological disorders. In our study, 5% of patients had been prescribed antiepileptics and 8% antidepressants before their insulinoma diagnosis, highlighting the risk of misclassification.

4.1 Hypoglycemia Patterns and Diagnostic Considerations

Hypoglycemia in insulinoma patients predominantly occurs during fasting; however, some patients experience symptoms postprandially or in both states. Our findings indicate that fasting hypoglycemia was the most common presentation (70%), followed by a combination of fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia (27%), and exclusive postprandial hypoglycemia in 3% of cases. These results are consistent with previous reports, such as those by Placzkowski et al. who found fasting hypoglycemia in 73% of cases, mixed hypoglycemia in 21%, and postprandial hypoglycemia alone in 6%. Interestingly, our data also support the observation that postprandial hypoglycemia is more frequently seen in men. This finding suggests that insulinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with postprandial symptoms, even in the absence of fasting hypoglycemia.

### Giant insulinoma: case report and review of the literature [^116f9LpD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

An insulinoma is a rare pancreatic endocrine tumor that is typically sporadic, solitary, and less than 2 cm in diameter. Fewer than 5% of insulinomas are larger than 3 cm. Ninety percent or more of all insulinomas are benign. Larger tumors are more likely to be malignant. We report a case of a giant pedunculated insulinoma, measuring 9 cm in diameter and weighing 100 g, with amyloid deposits accounting for 70% of the tumor volume. At the time of operation, no local invasion or metastatic disease was identified. On pathological evaluation, the tumor was classified as an insulinoma of uncertain biological behavior. In addition to describing the clinical presentation and operative findings, criteria for determining malignancy are outlined, a detailed pathological description is presented, and the 2000 World Health Organization Classification for Pancreatic Endocrine Neoplasms is reviewed.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^111TRHzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Incidence and Epidemiology

Insulinomas are the most common, yet still rare, hormone-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNEN) with a reported incidence of 0.7 to 4 cases per million per year. There is an age-specific incidence peak in the fifth decade of life in men and the sixth decade of life in women and the incidence is slightly higher in women than in men. More than 99% of insulinomas are located in the pancreas, where its tumor locations are evenly distributed. Extrapancreatic (occasionally metastatic) insulinomas are extremely rare and have been described in the lung, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, hilum of the spleen, and gastric antrum. Approximately 10% of insulinomas present as multiple lesions. Because the definitions for malignancy in insulinoma are ambiguous, nonmetastatic insulinomas are now referred to as "indolent" and metastatic insulinomas as "aggressive" (see Treatment of Metastatic or Inoperable Aggressive Insulinoma). Approximately 10% to 15% of insulinomas belong to the aggressive category and 85% to 90% can be considered as indolent. Patients with an aggressive insulinoma have lower survival compared with patients with an indolent insulinoma. The 5-year survival of patients with an indolent insulinoma has been reported to be 94% to 100% and for patients with an aggressive insulinoma this amounts to 24% to 67%. Secondary, or metachronous insulin secretion by panNEN that previously were nonsecreting, or secreting other peptide hormones, can also occasionally develop and is generally associated with a poor survival as compared with their non-insulin-secreting counterparts.

A total of 5% to 10% of insulinomas are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. The MEN1-related insulinomas may develop as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions and are generally diagnosed at an earlier age than their sporadic counterparts because of application of the MEN1 screening recommendations. Routine genetic testing for MEN1 is usually not recommended in patients with newly diagnosed insulinoma, but a thorough medical and family history should be obtained, and patients should be referred for appropriate testing if there is suspicion of the insulinoma being 1 of the manifestations of MEN1. A recent Delphi consensus recommends to consider MEN1 screening in patients aged 35 or younger who present with an apparently sporadic insulinoma, although this is not yet supported by the literature. Other genetic syndromes associated with the development of insulinomas are neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex.

### Multicenter study on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of insulinoma: insights from 15 medical centres [^114vTES4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment outcomes of insulinoma patients from diverse regions across the country. We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records from 76 adult patients diagnosed with insulinoma between 2018 and 2023 at 15 medical centres. Data collected included demographics, presenting symptoms, laboratory and imaging results, surgical reports, pathology findings, and clinical follow-up information.

Design

Multi-centre retrospective study.

Methods

The study revealed that key factors such as age, BMI, symptom duration, tumour size, and follow-up period were similar across genders. The majority of patients experienced neuroglycopenic symptoms, particularly during fasting. Insulinoma was typically diagnosed either during fasting or spontaneously, with no significant gender differences in glucose and insulin levels during hypoglycemia. However, men exhibited higher C-peptide levels (p < 0.05). Common comorbidities included hypertension, hypothyroidism, and cardiovascular conditions, and some patients had been using antiepileptics or antidepressants before their diagnosis.

Results

Preoperative tumour diagnoses were largely accurate, with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) being the most effective method. Most tumours were small (< 2cm) and located in the pancreas body, with the majority being solitary. Surgical treatments primarily involved enucleation or distal pancreatectomy. Follow-up data indicated high remission rates, with low rates of nonremission and mortality.

Conclusion

This study emphasises that early diagnosis and intervention, particularly in patients with a history of neurological or psychiatric issues, postprandial symptoms, or rapid symptom improvement after treatment, can lead to significantly better outcomes.

### Insulinomas may present with normoglycemia after prolonged fasting but glucose-stimulated hypoglycemia [^114U6EkQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare but are the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the adult population. Diagnosis of this pathology relies on clinical features along with laboratory tests and imaging investigations to aid in localization. One of the most robust standard tests used for establishing a biochemical diagnosis is the prolonged (72 h) fast. Currently, it is recommended that a prolonged supervised fast be performed, at least for 48 h if not for 72 h, and many would take the absence of hypoglycemia after a 72-h fast as evidence excluding the diagnosis.

Methods

We employed prolonged fasts and standard glucose tolerance tests, plus imaging studies and surgical pathology, in two patients with suspected insulinomas.

Results

The prolonged 72-h fast was normal in both the patients, whereas in both cases a prolonged oral glucose tolerance test clearly demonstrated the induction of severe hyperinsulinemia followed by significant hypoglycemia. Surgical removal confirmed the presence of insulinomas in each case.

Conclusions

Although the sensitivity of the 72-h fast is high and still plays an important role in the diagnosis of an insulinoma, we suggest that a "normal" test result should be interpreted in the light of clinical symptoms.

Insulinoma is a type of functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) that originates from islet beta cells, which excessively secrete insulin and cause hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is the most common functional pNET, with a prevalence of approximately one to four cases per million people. Four features of insulinoma are associated with four "90%" parameters: 90% are benign, 90% are solitary, 90% occur in the pancreas, and 90% are less than 2 cm in diameter. Malignant insulinoma is extremely rare and accounts for only about 10% of all insulinoma cases. Malignant insulinoma refers to cases exhibiting local invasion or distal metastasis, which is the only biological property that differentiates malignant cases from benign cases. Clinical manifestations, biochemical traits, and pathology cannot be used as direct evidence for identification. Benign insulinomas are typically treated surgically, whereas malignant insulinomas often require comprehensive approaches to maximize patient survival. In this study, we analyzed the clinical data of 15 cases of malignant insulinoma treated at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from 1984 to April 2017.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^111xvNoM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

MEN1 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor — insulinoma clinical features, diagnosis, and management: Insulinomas represent 10 to 30% of all pancreatic tumors in patients with MEN1 and are usually a single lesion more than 5 mm, with association with other neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors at diagnosis in 10% of patients with MEN1. They occur more often in patients with MEN1 who are younger than 40 yr, with many younger than 20 yr, whereas in patients without MEN1 insulinomas generally occur in those older than 40 yr. Insulinomas may be the first manifestation of MEN1 in 10% of patients, and approximately 4% of patients with insulinomas will have MEN1. The most reliable test is a supervised 72-h fast demonstrating increased plasma insulin with hypoglycemia; elevated circulating C-peptide and proinsulin and exclusion of oral hypoglycemic agents support diagnosis. Preoperative localization with endoscopic ultrasonography, MRI, CT, celiac axis angiography, selective intraarterial stimulation with hepatic venous sampling, and intraoperative direct pancreatic ultrasonography is likely to improve the success rate of surgery. Medical treatment (frequent carbohydrate meals and diazoxide or octreotide) is not always successful, and surgery is the optimal treatment; surgical options range from enucleation to distal or partial pancreatectomy or excision of all macroscopic pancreatic tumors with enucleation of nodules, and monitoring the insulin/glucose ratio during surgery has been reported to be of value. For metastatic disease, chemotherapy consisting of streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin or hepatic artery embolization has been used.

### Insulinoma presenting as postprandial hypoglycaemia [^113UzWap]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Although insulinoma commonly presents as fasting hypoglycaemia it can rarely present as postprandial hypoglycaemia. We describe a case of insulinoma presenting as postprandial hypoglycaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A 60-year-old man presented with a 6 year history of postprandial hypoglycaemic symptoms. A diagnosis of T2DM was made using a standard oral glucose tolerance test to which patient's postprandial hypoglycaemia was attributed. He was given dietetic advice for postprandial hypoglycaemia and was followed up routinely. After 2 years, hypoglycaemic symptoms worsened by exercise and delayed meals. A number of supervised fasting glucose measurements failed to demonstrate biochemical hypoglycaemia. His insulin, c-peptide and pro-insulin levels were mildly elevated but plasma glucose levels were normal. A CT scan showed 20 mm lesion in the pancreas which was confirmed as insulinoma with pancreatic arterial calcium stimulation studies. Laparoscopic resection confirmed benign insulinoma and hypoglycaemia resolved. Our case illustrates the importance of considering insulinoma as a cause of postprandial hypoglycaemia.

### Managing hypoglycaemia in patients with insulinoma – A tertiary centre experience and review of the literature [^114tK8QY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypoglycaemia associated with insulin‐secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours was first reported in the early 20th century. The presence of neuroglycopenic symptoms in association with fasting hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose concentration < 3 mmol/L or < 55 mg/dL) and resolution of these symptoms after ingestion of glucose is termed 'Whipple's triad'. Concomitant hypoglycaemia, elevated insulin, pro‐insulin, and C‐peptide is indicative of endogenous hyperinsulinism, warranting radiological investigations to identify the tumour source. Computed tomography (CT) pancreas, endoscopic ultrasound ± fine needle aspiration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional imaging methods like Gallium‐68‐DOTATATE PET CT, which binds to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2), are employed in localising insulinomas. Insulinomas are rare tumours with an incidence of 1−4/million person years, and other causes of adult‐onset hypoglycaemia should be excluded. This includes insulin‐mediated causes of hypoglycaemia such as exogenous sulphonylurea or insulin administration, insulin or insulin receptor antibodies, renal failure and post‐gastric bypass syndrome, and non‐insulin mediated causes like hepatic failure, malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency, and insulin‐like growth factor secreting tumours.

Hypoglycaemia symptoms in patients with insulinoma are frequently pervasive and disabling. The autonomic symptoms of hunger, sweating, weakness, dizziness and confusion are commonly present at diagnosis, but their non‐specific nature means diagnosis is often delayed. The development of the hypoglycaemic syndrome several years after a diagnosis of non‐functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour has been reported and is associated with a worse prognosis. Hypoglycaemic awareness can decline over time, putting patients at risk of severe life‐threatening hypoglycaemic events.

Most insulinomas are benign, single tumours and for many patients surgical resection is curative. Pre‐ and peri‐operative glycaemic control remains a crucial part of management. For the 5−10% of patients with malignant disease, those with unresectable or ectopic disease and those with co‐morbidities precluding surgery, long term management of hypoglycaemia is the focus of treatment. Achieving normoglycaemia requires a multi‐modal therapeutic approach and can be challenging, with one single‐centre study of treated endogenous hypoglycaemia reporting ongoing asymptomatic hyper or hypoglycaemic deviations in 56% of patients.

Herein, we report our multi‐disciplinary tertiary centre experience in managing these patients, review the literature for each treatment modality and propose an algorithm for the stepwise management of hypoglycaemia in patients with hyperinsulinemia caused by an insulin secreting neuroendocrine tumour.

### Clinical presentation in insulinoma predicts histopathological tumour characteristics [^1127mmDq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the pancreas, characterized clinically by neuroglycopenic symptoms during periods of substrate deficiency. The gold standard test for diagnosing an insulinoma is a 72-h fast. However, the prognostic value of parameters in the standardized 72-h fast on histopathological tumour criteria and clinical presentation has not been examined.

Methods

In thirty-three patients diagnosed with an insulinoma records, and data were investigated retrospectively. Histopathological tumour characteristics, including staging, grading and size, were reviewed. Grading was performed using Ki-67 index. Cut-off values for classical grading (G(clas)) were set at G1(clas) ≤ 2%, G2(clas) 3–20% & G3(clas) > 20% and for modified grading (G(mod)) at G1(mod) < 5%, G2(mod) 5–20% & G3(mod) > 20%.

Results

When G(mod) criteria were applied, the initial blood glucose was lower in GII/III(mod) patients compared to GI(mod) (2.8 ± 0.8 vs 3.8 ± 1.3 mmol/l; P = 0.046). Basal and end of fast levels of insulin (basal insulin 71 ± 61 vs 20 ± 16 mU/l; P < 0.001; end of fast insulin 77 ± 51 vs 21 ± 20 mU/l; P < 0.001) and c-peptide (basal c-peptide 5.4 ± 2.4 vs 2.7 ± 1.6 μg/l; P = 0.004; end of fast c-peptide 5.3 ± 2.4 vs 2.5 ± 1.4 μg/l; P = 0.001) were significantly higher in GII/III(mod) than in GI(mod). No differences between the groups were observed when G(clas) criteria were applied. Additionally, close correlations were observed between insulin concentration, Ki-67 index and tumour size.

Conclusion

This study shows an impact of histopathological tumour characteristics in patients suffering from an insulinoma on clinical presentation during a standardized 72-h fast. Lower initial blood glucose levels and higher concentrations of insulin and c-peptide are associated with worse tumour grading and larger tumour size.

### Metastatic malignant insulinoma in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus: case presentation and literature review [^114hk5Cj]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the occurrence of metastatic malignant insulinoma in a patient with preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We present a detailed case report, with clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings, and summarize the data from 21 similar cases in the literature.

Results

The occurrence of malignant insulinoma in a patient with preexisting diabetes is very rare and thus can be a diagnostic challenge. In our patient with type 2 diabetes, endogenous hyperinsulinism was confirmed by demonstrating elevated insulin and C-peptide levels during hypoglycemic episodes in the absence of sulfonylurea on a blood screen. Abdominal computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pancreatic mass as well as metastatic lesions in the liver. The pancreatic mass was removed and confirmed to be a malignant insulinoma. This procedure was followed by disappearance of the hypoglycemic episodes as well as the diabetes for a few months. On follow-up, however, more metastatic lesions appeared in conjunction with a protracted course of hypoglycemia that necessitated treatment with antihypoglycemic agents and, 3 years after the initial surgical intervention, culminated in the death of the patient.

Conclusion

Our patient is one of the few subjects known to have a malignant insulinoma in conjunction with preexisting diabetes. A high degree of suspicion for the presence of an insulinoma should be maintained when unexplained hypoglycemic episodes occur in a patient with previously stable diabetes.

### Multicenter study on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of insulinoma: insights from 15 medical centres [^114E7xFW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Ethic

This study was conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The retrospective study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Pamukkale University Faculty of Medicine, under protocol number 20/261.

2.2 Patients

We retrospectively analysed the records of 76 adult patients diagnosed with insulinoma between 2018 and 2023 from 15 different medical centres. The data collected included demographic information, clinical presentations, preoperative laboratory and imaging findings, detailed surgical reports, histopathological examinations of resected samples, and clinical follow‐up data from the outpatient clinics of the participating centres.

Whipple's triad is a key diagnostic criterion for insulinoma, comprising three elements: (1) symptoms of hypoglycemia, (2) documented low blood glucose levels at the time of symptoms, and (3) resolution of symptoms after glucose administration. For a definitive diagnosis of insulinoma, a compatible clinical presentation is required, along with the following biochemical criteria: blood glucose levels ≤ 40 mg/dL, insulin ≥ 36 pmol/L, C‐peptide ≥ 200 pmol/L, proinsulin ≥ 5 pmol/L, β‐hydroxybutyrate ≤ 2.7 mmol/L, and the absence of plasma or urinary sulfonylurea metabolites.

2.3 Clinical Approach

Additionally, the study assessed the presence of components of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). A variety of imaging modalities were employed for insulinoma detection, including ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), octreotide scintigraphy (OS), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET), Ga‐68 DOTATATE PET/CT, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and calcium‐stimulated hepatic venous sampling.

### A rare cause of hypoglycemia in a type 2 diabetic patient: insulinoma [^112wRjF9]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes are often associated with the ongoing treatment regimen. However, despite changes in treatment modalities, assessment of the causes of hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients in the presence of severe and recurrent hypoglycemia is very important. The treatment that had been provided for 6 years in a 67-year-old female patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus was discontinued due to hypoglycemic episodes that presented for the previous 2 years. The patient experienced persistent hypoglycemia after cessation of the treatment and was hospitalized for further examination. Spontaneous hypoglycemia with a final diagnosis of insulinoma was established following histopathologic evaluation and was relieved postoperation. Insulinoma is rarely encountered as a cause of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin-secreting tumors should be considered where hypoglycemic episodes occur despite discontinuation of insulin and other antidiabetic treatment with endogenous hyperinsulinemia being noncompliant with the blood glycemic levels.

3 Results

3.1 Anthropometric Values

Among the 76 patients included in the study, 49 (64.5%) were female and 27 (35.5%) were male. Patients were retrospectively selected from 15 medical centres based on confirmed diagnoses of insulinoma between 2018 and 2023. Inclusion criteria required a definitive biochemical and/or imaging‐confirmed diagnosis of insulinoma, while patients with incomplete records or alternative diagnoses were excluded to minimise selection bias. Despite the retrospective design, cases were obtained from multiple centres to enhance the generalisability of the findings.

No significant differences were found between male and female patients in terms of age, BMI, symptom duration, follow‐up period, or tumour size (p > 0.05). During symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes, glucose and insulin levels did not significantly differ between genders. However, C‐peptide levels were statistically higher in men compared to women (p < 0.05) (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data of insulinoma patients.

3.2 Clinical Presentation and Hypoglycemia Characteristics

Neuroglycopenic symptoms were the most common presentation, observed in 57% of patients, while 24% presented with adrenergic symptoms, and 18% exhibited both. Patients reported experiencing hypoglycaemia symptoms during fasting (70%), postprandially (3%), or in both situations (27%). Hypoglycemia was detected during a prolonged fasting test in 54% of patients, while it occurred spontaneously in 46%. Patients who experienced spontaneous hypoglycemia were only monitored, and insulin, glucose, and C‐peptide levels were assessed at the time of the hypoglycaemia event. Thus, insulin, glucose, and C‐peptide levels were evaluated in all patients, and further investigations were initiated accordingly.

### Giant pancreatic tumor with clinical characteristics of insulinoma but without common pathologic features [^112zaCpH]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a large pancreatic tumor that had clinical characteristics of an insulinoma without classic pathologic features.

Methods

We describe a 58-year-old woman who presented with a 3-month history of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes, which were characterized by confusion. The laboratory, imaging, and pathologic findings are summarized, the current literature on giant insulinomas is reviewed, and the distinction between clinical and pathologic diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors is discussed.

Results

The biochemical diagnosis of insulinoma was established with concomitant low fasting blood glucose concentrations and inappropriately high insulin levels. An abdominal computed tomographic scan revealed a mass (10 by 11.7 by 9.7 cm) in the head and body of the pancreas, which was resected. Pathologic examination revealed a massive neuroendocrine tumor (13.5 by 11 by 8 cm) without immunohistochemical evidence of insulin expression. Nevertheless, tumor resection resulted in decreased blood insulin levels and resolution of the patient's hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

Although more than 95% of insulinomas are smaller than 3 cm, this case is unique in that the extremely large pancreatic tumor had clinical characteristics of an insulinoma but did not have the classic pathologic findings. Because of the extensive pancreatic resection, the patient is dependent on both insulin and orally administered pancreatic enzymes but remained free of symptoms and disease recurrence at 1-year follow-up.

### Unusual presentation of a pancreatic insulinoma in helical CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging: case report [^113s9B4M]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Insulinomas are pancreatic neoplasms that can be radiologically characterized typically because of their tendency to present intense and early contrast enhancement with a wash-out phenomenon. In this sense, we report an unusual case of a hypovascular solid pancreatic insulinoma confirmed with surgery and pathologic analysis, in a patient with normal serum insulin levels. In the two-phase helical CT, the mass behaved as a hypodense lesion with respect to the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma during the arterial phase and as a hypointense lesion during the dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Pathologic examination demonstrated a hypercellular tumor with poor vascularization of intervening stroma which showed prominent amyloid deposits.

### Diagnostic work-up and surgical management of insulinoma: a retrospective analysis from a tertiary referral center [^114zQSvY]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Insulinoma is a multifaceted disease that poses several challenges in terms of clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and surgical management. The aim of this study was to describe diagnostic work-up, surgical management, and postoperative outcomes of patients with insulinoma. All consecutive patients who underwent surgery for insulinoma at San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) between January 2008 and January 2022 were included. Overall, 98 patients were considered. The median delay between presenting symptoms and insulinoma diagnosis was 10months (IQR, 4–21). Insulinoma diagnosis was made at our Institution in 45 patients, 20 of whom referred within 6months from symptoms onset. In this subgroup, the median interval between symptoms presentation and insulinoma diagnosis was 4months (IQR, 2–6), as compared to 14months (IQR, 10–26) in patients (n = 25) who referred to our institution after 6months from symptoms onset (p < .001). The insulinoma was localized preoperatively in all the cases. All patients underwent ≥ 1 high-quality imaging: computed tomography (CT: n = 87, sensitivity 84%), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI: n = 55, sensitivity 85%) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS: n = 79, sensitivity 100%). MRI identified the tumor in eight patients with negative CT. EUS localized the insulinoma in three patients with negative CT and negative MRI. Parenchyma-sparing resections were performed in 41 patients. Contact with major vessels, lesion close to Wirsung duct and suspect of malignancy were the main reasons to perform a formal resection. An early referral to high-volume centers is important for reducing diagnostic delay in patients with insulinoma. The diagnostic work-up of insulinoma frequently requires several imaging modalities to be performed, with EUS being the most sensitive one. Parenchyma-sparing surgery for insulinoma should be performed whenever technically and oncologically feasible.

### Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus [^113Wqdbi]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical presentation, causes, and diagnostic approach to spontaneous hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus.

Methods

A literature review was performed using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases.

Results

Hypoglycemia is uncommon in people who are not on glucose-lowering medications. Under normal physiologic conditions, multiple neural and hormonal counterregulatory mechanisms prevent the development of abnormally low levels of plasma glucose. If spontaneous hypoglycemia is suspected, the Whipple triad should be used to confirm hypoglycemia before pursuing further diagnostic workup. The Whipple criteria include the following: (1) low levels of plasma glucose, (2) signs or symptoms that would be expected with low levels of plasma glucose, and (3) improvement in those signs or symptoms when the level of plasma glucose increases. Spontaneous hypoglycemia can be caused by conditions that cause endogenous hyperinsulinism, including insulinoma, postbariatric hypoglycemia, and noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia. Spontaneous hypoglycemia can also be seen with critical illness, hepatic or renal dysfunction, hormonal deficiency, non-diabetes-related medications, and non-islet cell tumors. The initial diagnostic approach should begin by obtaining a detailed history of the nature and timing of the patient's symptoms, medications, underlying comorbid conditions, and any acute illness. A laboratory evaluation should be conducted at the time of the spontaneous symptomatic episode. Supervised tests such as a 72-hour fast or mixed-meal test may be needed to recreate the situation under which the patient is likely to experience symptoms.

Conclusion

We provide an overview of the physiology of counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia, its causes, and diagnostic approaches to spontaneous hypoglycemia in adults.

### Multidisciplinary management of refractory insulinomas [^113HusER]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Insulinomas are predominantly benign (~90%), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours characterized by hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. They usually present as a small (< 2 cm), well-demarcated, solitary nodule that can arise in any part of the organ. Treatment for sporadic insulinomas is generally aimed at curative surgical resection with special consideration in genetic syndromes. Patients with significant hypoglycaemia can pose a difficult management challenge. In isolated cases where the patient is not medically fit for surgery or with metastatic spread, other treatment options are employed. Medical therapy with diazoxide or somatostatin analogues is commonly used first line for symptom control, albeit with variable efficacy. Other medical options are emerging, including newer targeted biological therapies, including everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor), sunitinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and pasireotide, a multisomatostatin receptor ligand. Pasireotide and everolimus both cause hyperglycaemia by physiological mechanisms synergistic with its antitumour/antiproliferative effects. Minimally invasive treatment modalities such as ethanol ablation are available in selected cases (particularly in patients unfit for surgery), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) can effectively control tumour growth or provide symptomatic benefit in metastatic disease, while cytotoxic chemotherapy can be used in patients with higher-grade tumours. This review considers the developments in the medical and other nonsurgical management options for cases refractory to standard medical management. Early referral to a dedicated neuroendocrine multidisciplinary team is critical considering the array of medical, oncological, interventional radiological and nuclear medical options. We discuss the evolving armamentarium for insulinomas when standard medical therapy fails.

### Case presentation of 8-year follow up of recurrent malignant duodenal insulinoma and lymph node metastases and literature review of malignant insulinoma management [^116q6d2z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

As improvements in imaging studies continue to increase the frequency of pancreatic NET detection, recent studies have also evaluated the role of lymph node metastases in prognosis and management strategies. A retrospective review found tumor location, tumor size, Ki-67 index, and presence of lymphovascular invasion were associated with lymph node metastasis. Tumor diameter > 1.5 cm, tumors located in the head of pancreas, presence of lymphovascular invasion on surgical pathology, and Ki-67 index > 20% were reported to frequently present with lymph node metastasis. Further analysis in this study showed that lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with a decrease in disease-free survival (4.5 years compared with 14.6 years for patients without lymph node metastasis). At this time, multiple studies report that both the number and presence of positive lymph nodes have important prognostic value in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, thereby supporting the recommendation for systematic removal of lymph nodes in the peritumoral area during any pancreatic NET operation. Patients with duodenal NETs treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy have been reported to have a higher incidence of metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes compared with patients with pancreatic NETs. In a study investigating surgical outcomes of patients with pancreatic versus duodenal NETs, those with duodenal NETs had more lymph node metastases. Yet, despite this difference in metastases, there was no impact on recurrence-free survival or overall survival between the two groups. Furthermore, those with duodenal NETs were more likely to have recurrent disease within 2 years of pancreaticoduodenectomy compared with those with pancreatic NETs. Further analysis is required to determine if these outcomes are similar in patients presenting with insulinomas. If so, this may suggest that a duodenal primary NET has higher malignant potential than a typical pancreatic primary NET.

At the present time, our patient continues to do well clinically with no evidence of significant hypoglycemia. She has declined octreotide treatment due to concerns with side effects and wishes to continue active surveillance with imaging. Given her recurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms and evidence of lymph node metastases 2 years after initial enucleation surgery, we suspect that she has microscopic, undetectable, clinically silent disease. As such, we will continue to monitor her closely for redevelopment of hypoglycemia.

### Diagnosis of insulinoma in a patient with hypoglycemia without obvious hyperinsulinemia [^115zf6si]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 41-year-old Maltese woman with a 12-month history of severe, morning episodes of confusion, blurred vision and sweating was referred to a specialist center for evaluation of fasting hypoglycemia. She was not taking medication and did not report any prior personal or familial history of endocrinopathy or other relevant pathology.

Investigations

Measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations during a prolonged supervised fast; sulfonylurea screen; CT, MRI scan and endoscopic ultrasonography of the pancreas; calcium stimulation test; surgical exploration and intra-operative ultrasonography of the pancreas.

Diagnosis

Insulin-secreting lesion (insulinoma) in the tail of the pancreas.

Management

The tumor was resected with cure of symptoms.

### Surgical treatment of insulinomas [^112HiAXZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of hypoglycemic patients should include insulinoma. Plasma insulin-to-glucose ratio greater than 0.3 or C-peptide levels of 2 nmol/L or greater suggest insulinoma. Abdominal CT scan can exclude metastatic disease and identify uncommonly large islet cell tumors, but has poor sensitivity for localizing insulinomas; transgastric endoscopic ultrasound is the most sensitive technique. Palpation combined with intraoperative ultrasound identifies most tumors at operation and gives vital information about surrounding structures. If no tumor is found, blind distal pancreatectomy should not be performed, and the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist or endocrine surgeon for diagnostic confirmation and further localization. Laparoscopy is a viable alternative to open tumor resection; laparoscopic ultrasound can facilitate localization and guide safe resection.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^111FJ9vP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

MEN1 glucagonoma — presentation and treatment: Glucagonomas occur in fewer than 3% of patients with MEN1, and characteristic manifestations of a skin rash (necrolytic migratory erythema), weight loss, anemia, and stomatitis may be absent, with tumors detected by pancreatic imaging or by glucose intolerance and hyperglucagonemia. The tail of the pancreas is the most frequent site and surgical removal is the treatment of choice, but treatment may be difficult because approximately 50 to 80% of patients have metastases at the time of diagnosis. Medical treatment with somatostatin analogs (octreotide or lanreotide), or chemotherapy with streptozotocin and 5-fluorouracil or dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole carboxamide has been successful in some patients, and hepatic artery embolization has been used to treat metastatic disease.

### Innovative imaging of insulinoma: the end of sampling? A review [^113qiDPH]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Malignant insulinomas

Only about 10% of insulinomas present with malignant behavior at diagnosis, i.e. metastasis at diagnosis. Clinically, patients with malignant insulinomas present with similar signs and symptoms as patients with other differential diagnosis of EHH, notably benign insulinomas. The biochemical work-up is identical as in benign insulinomas, i.e. positive Whipple's triads and documentation of EHH. However, conventional imaging (ceCT or MRI) usually show a pancreatic NEN often with peri-pancreatic suspicious lymph nodes and hepatic metastasis. Complete surgical resection of all tumors is often difficult and prognosis remains relatively poor, with a 5-year survival of 55.6% and 10-year survival of 29%. Accurate assessment of the extent of the disease ('staging') is essential, primarily because pre-interventional localization of all lesions facilitates surgery or local-ablative approaches. Remarkably, intervention aiming at reducing the tumor burden (without a curative strategy) is often indicated because of the sometimes severe and life-threatening hypoglycemia. This is of particular importance since medical therapy for EHH is sometimes difficult and often needs a combined treatment including Diazoxid, Somatostatin analogs, Everolimus and Prednisone in addition to regular ingestion (or even infusion) of glucose with the associated increase in body weight.

In order to allow for a comprehensive staging in patients with suspected malignant insulinomas, the incidence and density of peptide receptor status in 11 patients with malignant insulinomas were established in vivo using GLP-1R and SSTR2 imaging and/or in vitro using autoradiography of the tumor samples. The results indicate that GLP-1 receptor targeting was positive in four of 11 (36%), and SSTR2 imaging was positive in eight of 11 patients (64%). In only one patient, both receptors were expressed. Importantly, in all patients, one of these two receptors was overexpressed. Our data indicate that, in contrast to benign insulinomas, malignant insulinomas often lack GLP-1 receptors but express SSTR2. This observation is clinically relevant since in case of a positive SSTR2 imaging a peptide radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT) using 177 Lu-DOTATOC or 177 Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera®) can be performed. Unfortunately, due to a high renal uptake and the potential associated side effects, PRRT using exendin-4 is not an option in malignant insulinoma expressing GLP-1Rs.

### Comparison between sporadic and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated insulinoma [^111KovaX]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The differences between sporadic and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1)-associated insulinoma are not well described. Herein, we compared demographics, neoplasm characteristics, presentation, and survival in patients with sporadic vs MEN-1 insulinomas including benign and malignant disease.

Study Design

A retrospective study identified insulinoma patients. MEN-1 was defined based on genetic testing or clinically in patients with 2 or more primary MEN-1 tumor types.

Results

A total of 311 patients were identified: 84% benign and 16% malignant. The incidence of malignancy was similar (18% vs 16%, MEN-1 vs sporadic, p = 0.76). Within malignant patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 33 (25 ,44) years in MEN-1 vs 54 (41, 70) years in sporadic insulinoma (p = 0.04). There was no difference in sex or tumor size between MEN-1 and sporadic malignant insulinoma (p > 0.05). Of the 260 patients with benign insulinoma, 7% had MEN-1 syndrome. MEN-1 patients presented with insulinoma at a younger age: median (interquartile range) age was 38 (24, 49) years vs 52 (43, 65) years (p < 0.01). Resection of benign insulinoma was performed in 78% of the MEN-1 and 94% of the sporadic group (p = 0.03). Resected benign tumors were larger in the MEN-1 group: 2.0 (1.65, 2.45) cm vs 1.5 (1.2, 2.0) cm, respectively (p = 0.03). Concurrent insulinomas were more common in MEN-1 (17% vs 2%; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

MEN-1 patients present with insulinoma at younger age and have larger benign pancreatic lesions at the time of resection compared with sporadic neoplasms. Younger patients and those with multifocal pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in the setting of endogenous hyperinsulinism should be evaluated for MEN-1.

### Use of intraoperative insulin assay for the localisation of insulinoma [^111QNVK3]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The curative treatment for patients with insulinoma is the surgical removal of the tumour; however, these tumours are small and therefore their preoperative localisation using ultrasound and CT scans may be difficult.

Methods

Intraoperative serum insulin measurements were used as an aid to the surgical management of seven unselected and consecutive presentations of insulinoma.

Results

In six of the seven cases we were able to demonstrate an increase in the peripheral serum insulin concentration between 3 and 5 min after manual examination of the tumour. In addition, there was a 50% decrease in concentration 10 min after removal of the tumour.

Conclusions

We believe that intraoperative insulin measurements are of use in demonstrating the functionality of tumours localised by intraoperative ultrasound and surgical examination. In addition, they act as an indicator of the completeness of surgery post tumour excision.

### The incidence of insulinoma in Western Sweden between 2002 and 2019 [^113sQzBm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of insulinoma may be nonspecific. Interestingly, 3 of our 41 (7%) patients had falsely been diagnosed with epilepsy before they were diagnosed with insulinoma. In fact, diagnostic delay still remains a concern for many patients with insulinoma. In earlier reports, the mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis of an insulinoma has been between 15 months and 3.8 years. In the current study, the median duration of symptoms prior to insulinoma diagnosis was much shorter (7 months) and the median time from first physician's visit to correct diagnosis was only 39 days.

A spontaneous hypoglycemic episode was very common among our patients, and only 1 patient was diagnosed with insulinoma in connection with a detection of an incidentally discovered pancreatic lesion. Nevertheless, a 72-h fasting test was conducted in 28 (76%) of the patients to confirm endogenous hyperinsulinism. The mean P-glucose and median S-insulin and C-peptide at diagnosis (spontaneous or during fasting test) were within similar ranges as in previous studies. In a study from the Mayo Clinic (1999–2007) the sensitivity of P-glucose ≤ 3 mmol/L at the end of a fasting test was < 60%, 93% for S-insulin ≥ 6 μU/mL and 100% for C-peptide ≥ 0.2 nmol/L. If the same diagnostic criteria had been applied in our study, the sensitivity of P-glucose, S-insulin, and C-peptide, as measured in our center, would have been 93%, 100%, and 97%, respectively, supporting the current diagnostic criteria for endogenous hyperinsulinism test. Interestingly, however, 1 patient ultimately diagnosed with insulinoma did not develop neuroglycopenic symptoms after 72 h of fasting. The lowest P-glucose was 3.1 mmol/L and the lowest C-peptide (0.18 nmol/L) was below the diagnostic threshold of < 0.2 nmol/L. At the termination of the test S-insulin was only moderately elevated (5.7 μU/mL). Also, it is interesting that the diagnostic delay in this patient was estimated to be 9 years; moreover, the patient had falsely been diagnosed with epilepsy.

Localization

Localization of the insulinoma and exclusion or confirmation of metastatic disease by CT is still the preferred initial localization modality followed by EUS or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for indolent, localized insulinomas (Table 1) (Fig. 3). Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) PET/CT or PET/MRI is a highly sensitive localization technique for seemingly occult, indolent, localized insulinomas and has become increasingly popular.

Figure 3.
Algorithm for clinical suspicion of insulinoma. After the diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, imaging procedures should be performed to locate the source of hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia should be prevented by dietary and medical interventions. Following the detection of the localized or metastatic insulinoma, tumor-directed surgical and/or medical therapy should be initiated.

Table 2
Summary of Extrapancreatic Insulinomas in the Literature

In patients with a biochemical diagnosis of insulinoma, surgical cure rates range from 77 to 100%. When technically possible, tumor enucleation is preferred. For tumors not amenable to enucleation, various surgical techniques can be pursued, such as segmental resection of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy, or pancreaticoduodenectomy. Complications associated with surgery include pancreatic fistula, pseudocyst, intra-abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, hemorrhage, and diabetes. For patients who are not surgical candidates or are awaiting surgical intervention, medical therapy and dietary modifications are important interventional measures. These include diazoxide or long-acting somatostatin analogs such as octreotide and lanreotide. Endoscopically directed ethanol ablation has been utilized in refractory individuals who are not surgical candidates, but this approach is not considered to be standard of care in healthier patients. Typically, short-acting octreotide is initiated to assess for tolerability and side effects, and, if tolerated, can be transitioned to long-acting somatostatin analog therapy.

### Imaging presentation of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms [^113XtPzg]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

P-NENs classification

The most common characteristic of P-NENs is that, generally, they are hypervascular, showing a typical enhancement behavior after contrast media injection during several imaging methods (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Non-functioning NEN. US and CEUS examinations: large hypoechoic mass (a) with small calcifications in the pancreatic head, causing upstream dilation of the Wirsung duct. This lesion is inhomogeneously hypervascularized at CEUS (b). CT examination: the pancreatic mass appears inhomogeneously hyperenhancing (c) in respect to the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma on dynamic phases. Dynamic MRI: inhomogeneous hypervascularity (d) of the pancreatic head mass

As previously stated, these neoplasms are mainly subdivided into two large groups (functioning and non-functioning), with different main features.

Functioning P-NENs are usually diagnosed in younger patients compared to the non-functioning P-NENs (55 years vs. 59 years), and the first type are usually smaller in dimension (< 3 cm) and usually non-metastatic at the time of diagnosis. However, the non-functioning neoplasms are generally the majority of P-NENs, accounting for about 40–90% of cases. Usually, functioning P-NENs present early with clinical manifestations related to the produced hormones, so, often, patients with P-NENs undergo imaging studies with a strong suspicion of disease.

Insulinomas are the most common functioning P-NENs and they account for about 60% of these neoplasms. Insulinomas are slightly prevalent in middle-aged (V–VI decades) women, and they are usually ubiquitarian within the gland, maybe with a slight prevalence in the body-tail. Usually, they have a benign course and behavior (85–99%) and they are often small (Fig. 4), smaller (90% < 2 cm) than other types. However, they can also be bigger and they could have a malignant behavior in some cases. At the time of clinical presentation, about half of cases are smaller than 1.5 cm. Insulinomas are usually solitary, but they could be multifocal in the majority of patients with MEN1 disease.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — clinical course and additional imaging in insulinomas: Ninety percent of insulinomas pursue an indolent course and can be cured surgically, and to rule out metastatic disease, chest CT scans with or without contrast and SSTR-based imaging can also be done. However, insulinomas are less consistently octreotide-avid than other PanNETs, and SSTR-based imaging may consequently be less useful as an imaging technique in insulinomas than in other tumor subtypes, and genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be considered.

### Insulinoma may mask the existence of type 1 diabetes [^111q76y3]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinoma is a tumour of insulin-producing cells of the pancreas and is known to be one of the causes of hypoglycaemia. Usually, appropriate removal of the insulinoma results in normalization of blood glucose levels. However, we found novel cases of insulinoma, in which hyperglycaemia developed soon after resection of the insulinoma.

Case Report

We encountered two patients with repeated hypoglycaemia caused by insulinoma. Following removal of the insulinoma, unanticipated hyperglycaemia was observed in both patients. Thereafter, their blood tests revealed low levels of serum C-peptide and high titres of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, indicating concomitant Type 1 diabetes. Indeed, histological examination of the resected specimen revealed that one patient showed insulitis in non-tumorous pancreatic tissue in which β-cells had already disappeared. Moreover, inflammatory cells infiltrated the insulinoma, as if it were insulitis of Type 1 diabetes, suggesting the existence of anti-islet autoimmunity.

Conclusion

These are first cases of insulinoma associated with underlying Type 1 diabetes. Physicians should be aware of the possibility that insulinoma may mask Type 1 diabetes, and measurement of anti-islet autoantibodies may be helpful to find underlying Type 1 diabetes, such as in these cases. It is pathologically interesting that the immune cell infiltration into insulinoma may be suggestive of anti-islet autoimmunity.

### Giant insulinoma: a report of 3 cases and review of the literature [^11377Asa]. Pancreas (2013). Low credibility.

Insulinoma is a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that is usually described as benign, sporadic, and very small (< 2 cm). However, there have been rare case reports of insulinoma presenting as a giant tumor. We describe 3 cases of giant insulinomas, all of which developed liver metastases. The patients were aged 38, 63, and 67 years. Clinically, all patients presented with Whipple's triad associated with a large mass located in the pancreatic tail. The tumors ranged in size from 10 to 15 cm. On microscopic examination, the tumors were well differentiated with amyloid deposition ranging between 20% and 30%. Immunohistochemically, all 3 tumors showed strong diffuse expression of chromogranin and synaptophysin, whereas they were only focally positive for insulin. One patient developed liver recurrence 3 years after resection of the primary tumor yet remained asymptomatic without treatment. Another patient with liver recurrence underwent right hepatectomy and has been free of disease for 2 years. The third patient died of metastatic disease 13 years after initial surgery. Giant insulinomas are characterized by focal expression of insulin and high rates of liver metastases. Long-term follow-up is mandatory in these patients, as recurrence is expected after primary surgery.

### 68Ga DOTANOC PET / CT detects primary malignant insulinoma [^113cCot6]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Malignant insulinoma is an extremely rare pancreatic tumor variant characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior with local and distant spread. Delays in the diagnosis are common because symptoms usually precede tumor detection and may be misattributed. Aggressive surgical resection is the primary treatment option; therefore accurate tumor localization is important for appropriate management. Although somatostatin receptor imaging has a limited role in the visualization of benign insulinoma (characterized by a low expression of somatostatin receptors), it can still have a role in the detection of malignant forms.

### Insulinoma in a patient with normal results from prolonged fast and glucagon-induced hypoglycemia [^111SQkPN]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a man with a functioning insulinoma and normal results from two 72-hour fasts who developed hypoglycemia secondary to exaggerated insulin response following glucagon stimulation.

Methods

We report the patient's clinical findings, laboratory findings, and clinical course. We also review the literature for previously reported cases and possible mechanisms.

Results

A 49-year-old man presented with hypoglycemic symptoms initially occurring after jogging and well-documented symptomatic hypoglycemia occurring during an evening meal. A 72-hour fast was associated with a serum glucose concentration of 50 mg/dL, suppressed insulin and C-peptide levels, and mildly elevated β-hydroxybutyrate. Another documented episode of hypoglycemia occurring 3 hours postprandially was associated with elevated insulin and C-peptide and suppressed β-hydroxybutyrate. A second 72-hour fast provoked asymptomatic hypoglycemia (glucose concentration at 60 hours: 32 mg/dL) with suppressed insulin and measurable β-hydroxybutyrate. After 72 hours of fasting, glucagon administration led to a decrease in glucose from 50 to 18 mg/dL, elevations in insulin and C-peptide, and suppression of β-hydroxybutyrate. Computed tomography revealed a mass lesion in the pancreatic tail. Distal pancreatectomy was performed, and the resected specimen demonstrated immunostaining for insulin. Hypoglycemic symptoms resolved postoperatively.

Conclusions

Normal results from a prolonged fast do not preclude an insulinoma and may demonstrate exaggerated insulin secretion from the insulinoma following glucagon administration. In addition to examining the glucose response to glucagon as a surrogate for insulinoma diagnosis, measurement of serum insulin levels following glucagon administration may provide a further clue to the diagnosis of insulinoma.

### Interventional vs surgical procedures in localized / nonmetastatic insulinomas (ablation vs surgery) [^1171Xpq5]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Localized insulinoma is an uncommon entity that can result in substantial morbidity due to the associated hypoglycemia. Recent studies have suggested an increase in the incidence of insulinoma in recent decades that may possibly be secondary to increased awareness, incidental diagnoses, and better diagnostic methods. Diagnosing and localizing insulinoma within the pancreas can be challenging, but advances in nuclear imaging may improve diagnostic accuracy. Delays in diagnosis are common, but once a localized insulinoma is diagnosed and appropriately treated, the long-term prognosis is excellent. Surgical resection is considered the standard of care management option for localized insulinoma, but tumor ablation with endoscopic ultrasound guidance has also been shown to be an effective and safe method for therapy.

### Imaging and localization of pancreatic insulinomas [^1167ouGX]. Clinical Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

For pancreatic insulinomas, the treatment of choice is surgical excision, which when successful is curative. Intraoperative palpation combined with ultrasonography theoretically depict almost all tumors, however the accuracy of palpation is improved by the preoperative localization. All recent advances in imaging have improved the likelihood for curative surgical resection. Our purpose is to demonstrate the characteristics of all modalities, which may be used in the preoperative localization algorithm.

### Improved contemporary surgical management of insulinomas: a 25-year experience at the Massachusetts general hospital [^1136Bzry]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine changes in the management strategy of patients with insulinomas and identify critical factors in patient outcome.

Background

Pancreatic insulinomas are rare neoplasms that are present in various ways. The optimal approach to localization, operative management, and follow-up of insulinomas is undetermined.

Methods

Sixty-one patients with a diagnosis of insulinoma requiring surgery at a tertiary care center between 1983 and 2007 were reviewed. Demographic details, mode of presentation, preoperative localization, operative procedures, and pathology data were assessed. The effect of different factors on survival was determined.

Results

Seven of 61 (11%) patients had a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia-type 1 (MEN-1). Multiple insulinomas were noted in 8% of cases and were more common in MEN-1 patients. The overall rate of malignancy was 8%. Confusion (67%), visual disturbances (42%), and diaphoresis (30%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Weight gain was noted in 44% of patients. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 18 (1–240) months. The sensitivity of preoperative imaging of tumors before 1994 was 75%, compared with 98% after this period, which included use of endoscopic ultrasound scanning (P = 0.012). A combination of palpation and intraoperative ultrasound detected 92% of tumors. Distal pancreatectomy (40%), enucleation (34%), and pancreaticoduodenectomy (16%) were the most common procedures and pancreatic fistula occurred in 18% of patients. Three patients underwent noncurative distal pancreatectomy in the early period. The 10-year disease-specific and disease-free survival was 100% and 90% respectively. There were 5 patients with disease recurrence. Lymph node metastases (P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.001), and the presence of MEN-1 (P = 0.035) were prognostically significant adverse factors in disease-free survival. Lymphovascular invasion was the only significant factor on multivariate analysis (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Pancreatic insulinomas can be readily localized preoperatively with modern imaging to avoid unsuccessful blind pancreatic resection. Surgical resection is associated with low morbidity and mortality and achieves long-term disease-free survival in the absence of lymphovascular invasion.

Discussion

Insulinoma is a rare tumor resulting in insulin hypersecretion. Patients with insulinoma present with neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion and seizure as well as occasional diaphoresis, anxiety, palpitations, and tremors. The majority of insulinomas are small (< 2 cm), single, sporadic, and arise within the pancreas with equal intra-organ distribution. Ectopic insulinomas have also been described in the literature and have been reported to account for an estimated incidence of 1–2% of all insulinomas.

Ectopic insulinomas usually develop in ectopic pancreatic tissue and have been reported in 0.5–15% of autopsies as well as in 1 out of 500 abdominal surgeries. In our patient, careful review of the initial resection specimen showed no evidence of adjacent ectopic pancreatic tissue.

A population-based study of 224 patients with surgically confirmed insulinomas presenting between 1927 and 1986 showed recurrence rates of 7% in patients with sporadic insulinomas compared with 21% in patients with MEN syndrome type 1. Recurrence of pancreatic insulinoma can develop 4–20 years after initial surgery, but there have not been reports of disease recurrence for extrapancreatic insulinomas. Also, previous cases of extrapancreatic insulinoma did not include significant follow-up evaluations as each respective patient was presumably cured surgically. The longest follow-up evaluation reported among these cases was 4 months in the setting of a surgically-managed ectopic neuroendocrine tumor arising from the ligament of Treitz. As our case seems to be the first recurrence of extrapancreatic insulinoma, the future surveillance and management of our patient remains a challenge Table 2.

Insulinoma is a very rare pancreatic neoplasm of childhood. Early recognition of insulinoma is important to ensure proper surgical treatment and prevent serious adverse neurological consequences. We describe here a case of insulinoma in an infant who presented with seizures and abnormal behaviour. Random blood glucose was found to be abnormally low (40 mg/dl). MRI showed a well-encapsulated mass (hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images) at the junction of the head and body of the pancreas. The tumour was successfully enucleated. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of insulinoma.

Most patients who have islet cell tumors, except those who have insulinomas, present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. In contrast with patients who have adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, those who have islet cell carcinomas can achieve long-term survival even if their disease is advanced. Liver-directed therapies, somatostatin analogs, and interferon are not curative but can be used to relieve tumor-associated symptoms. Similarly, palliative chemotherapy has been used with limited success. Advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression have translated into intense interest in biologically based strategies to treat this disease.

### Case presentation of 8-year follow up of recurrent malignant duodenal insulinoma and lymph node metastases and literature review of malignant insulinoma management [^115WmJXh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulinoma is an uncommon insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor that presents with severe recurrent hypoglycemia. Although cases of extrapancreatic insulinomas have been reported, the majority of insulinomas occur in the pancreas. The number of reported cases of ectopic insulinomas with follow-up assessments is limited and they do not report disease recurrence. The current report presents the first documented case of recurrent extrapancreatic insulinoma with 8 years of follow-up, provides relevant literature review, and proposes surveillance and treatment strategies.

Case presentation

We describe an insulinoma localized in the duodenal wall of a 36-year-old female who presented in 2013 with weight gain and Whipple's triad and was successfully managed with duodenotomy and enucleation. She presented again in 2017 with recurrent Whipple's triad and was found to have metastatic disease localized exclusively to peripancreatic lymph nodes. Primary pancreatic insulinoma was not evident and her hypoglycemia resolved following lymph node dissection. Eight years after initial presentation continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) showed a trend for euglycemia, and PET-CT Gallium 68 DOTATATE scan evaluation indicated absence of recurrent disease.

Conclusion

Insulinomas are rare clinical entities and extrapancreatic insulinomas are particularly uncommon. Follow-up evaluation and treatment strategies for ectopic insulinoma recurrence presents a significant clinical challenge as the condition has hitherto remained undescribed in the literature. Available evidence in the literature indicates that lymph node metastases of intrapancreatic insulinomas likely do not change prognosis. Given the absence of long-term data informing the management and monitoring of patients with extrapancreatic insulinoma, we suggest patient education for hypoglycemic symptoms, monitoring for hypoglycemia with CGM, annual imaging, and a discussion with patients regarding treatment with octreotide or alternative somatostatin receptor analog therapies.

### Insulinoma due to multiple pancreatic microadenoma localized by multimodal imaging [^117Tz1YP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Insulinomas are usually due to a solitary tumor, but they can be challenging to localize.

Case Description

A 66-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of episodic neuroglycopenic hypoglycemia and was suspected of having an insulinoma. On a supervised fast, she was found to be hypoglycemic at 39 mg/dL, with an insulin of 40 μU/mL 26 hours into the fast and a proinsulin of 35 pmol/L. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not localize a pancreatic lesion. Intra-arterial calcium stimulation testing showed a step-up of venous insulin levels at injection of the superior mesenteric artery and proximal and mid-splenic artery, and a 68 Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed focal uptake in the neck of the pancreas with a standardized uptake value of 12. Despite negative intraoperative pancreatic palpation and ultrasound, the patient underwent an extended distal pancreatectomy with normalization of biochemical levels and resolution of her symptoms. Pathology showed four subcentimeter neuroendocrine tumors that were positive for insulin, consistent with a diagnosis of multiple microadenomas.

Conclusions

Multiple microadenomas are a rare cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and localization, and resection of these tumors may be facilitated by multimodal imaging.

Table 1.
Imaging strategies in patients with insulinoma

Preoperative localization of nonmetastatic insulinomas is important and sometimes difficult, because approximately 30% of insulinomas are less than 10 mm in diameter. Furthermore, particularly in patients with MEN1, 10% of insulinomas can be multiple. The anatomical localization of nonmetastatic insulinomas is also important for the choice between laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and open pancreatic surgery and between enucleation or resection, or partial pancreatectomy. The GLP-1R is mainly expressed on the pancreatic β cells, overexpressed on indolent insulinoma and is therefore an interesting target for imaging of (previously occult) indolent localized insulinomas. In various studies, the radiolabeled GLP-1R agonists 111 In-DOTA-exendin-4 single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) and/or 68 Ga-DOTA-exendin-4 PET successfully detected localized indolent insulinomas. 68 Ga-DOTA-exendin-4 PET/CT is more sensitive than 111 In-DOTA-exendin-4 SPECT/CT. In case 1, who had localized indolent insulinoma, the GLP-1R PET/CT was clearly positive in the pancreatic lesion (Fig. 1), whereas SSTR2 PET/CT was negative. However, as opposed to localized indolent insulinomas, aggressive malignant insulinomas often lack the expression of the GLP-1R. Conversely, malignant aggressive insulinomas usually express the SSTR2, which can be targeted with PET/CT or PET/MRI using 68 Ga-DOTA-labeled somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs), or in the past with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and SPECT using 111 In-pentetreotide. In case 2, who had metastatic insulinoma, the SSTR PET/CT showed positive uptake in all tumor lesions (Fig. 2). In this case, no GLP-1R PET/CT was performed.

In the past, selective pancreatic angiography and selective intra-arterial injection of calcium with sampling of hepatic vein insulin were routinely used in high-volume centers. This invasive regionalization (an exact localization will be never given) procedure became less used because of the improved imaging procedures mentioned above.

If all localization and regionalization techniques fail to localize a tumor, intraoperative palpation of the pancreas and intraoperative ultrasound might still prove to be successful.

### Insulinoma: rare yet important [^115Qm9bU]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We report our experience with six cases of insulinoma that were managed at our hospital between 2009 and 2013. Four patients were women and two men, with mean age of 43 years and mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis of 5.7 years. Biochemical confirmation was made in all cases and preoperative localisation was successful in two cases only. In the other four, intraoperative localisation was made. Enucleation was performed in four patients and distal pancreatectomy in the other two. The tumour was proved benign in all patients by histopathology. Postoperatively, all patients were asymptomatic during a follow-up period ranging from 9 months to 4 years and both serum glucose and insulin were normal during that period. We think that careful preoperative workup and skilful surgical techniques can end the prolonged suffering of patients with insulinomas with excellent results.

### A clinicopathological study of malignant insulinoma in a contemporary series [^115MgHhL]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to address the origin and natural history of malignant insulinoma.

Methods

Retrospective review of medical records of patients diagnosed with insulinoma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between 2000 and 2015 was conducted. Hormonal expression in tumor specimens was examined by immunostaining.

Results

All the 9 patients with malignant insulinoma (35% of 26 patients with insulinoma) already had liver metastasis at hypoglycemia presentation with bulky cumulative tumor burden. Six patients had de novo diagnosis, 2 had known metastatic nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and 1 had a known pancreatic mass. Tumor grade at presentation was G1 in 4 patients, G2 in 4, and unknown in 1. Four patients died 2 to 32 months after presentation, all with extensive liver tumor involvement. Tumor expression of proinsulin and insulin was heterogeneous and overall infrequent. The proinsulin levels and proinsulin/insulin molar ratio in patients with malignant versus benign insulinoma were 334 versus 44 pmol/L and 2.1 versus 0.9, respectively.

Conclusions

Malignant insulinoma seems to arise from and behave like nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor oncologically but with metachronous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. High proinsulin levels and proinsulin/insulin molar ratio may suggest malignant insulinoma.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — evaluation of insulinomas (diagnostic thresholds): Insulinomas should be suspected in people with hypoglycemia (generally fasting or nocturnal) and a pancreatic mass, and also when hypoglycemia occurs despite non-visualization on imaging; evaluation with a 72-hour fast testing serum insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide during concurrent hypoglycemia is the gold standard. An insulin level > 3 mIU/mL (usually > 6 mIU/mL), C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 ng/mL, and proinsulin levels of ≥ 5 pmol/L when fasting blood glucose is < 55 mg/dL is suspicious for insulinoma. The Panel also recommends evaluating fasting blood glucose levels if clinically feasible, and other causes of hypoglycemia (including adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and non–insulin-mediated causes) should be ruled out prior to performing a 72-hour fast.

### Prevalence and characteristics of factitious hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic patients in a department of endocrinology [^115EwdTR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypoglycaemia in non‐diabetic patients is a rare metabolic emergency. It presents with variable and non‐specific symptoms including adrenergic and/or neuroglycopenic signs. The diagnosis of hypoglycaemia is challenging. It requires the fulfilment of the Whipple triad which consists of the presence of clinical symptoms, a concomitant blood glucose level lower than 2.75 mmol/L (50 mg/dl) and the resolution of symptoms after glucose administration and correction of hypoglycaemia.

Hypoglycaemia in non‐diabetic adults may be due to multiple aetiologies such as primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, insulinomas, non‐insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome, non‐islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia, autoimmune syndrome, critical illness and functional hypoglycaemia. Factitious hypoglycaemia is defined by an intentional insulin use or ingestion of oral hypoglycaemic agents to induce self‐harm, seek attention and gain care. It is a rare disorder commonly associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is usually denied during the history approach leading to a challenging diagnosis and a life‐threatening condition if missed.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and the characteristics of factitious hypoglycaemia in non‐diabetic patients in a department of endocrinology.

Insulinoma imaging and staging considerations specify that multiphasic imaging studies are performed with IV contrast in arterial and portal venous phases; SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI of skull vertex to mid-thigh with multiphase IV contrast when possible is described with SSTR-PET tracers (eg, 68Ga-DOTATATE, 64Cu-DOTATATE, and 68Ga-DOTATOC); Two-thirds of insulinomas are SSTR-PET negative and therefore may impact subsequent therapy and surveillance recommendations; and after evaluation, Locoregional disease (NE-L) proceeds to PanNET-6, whereas Metastatic disease proceeds to PanNET-12.

### Management of insulinomas: analysis from a tertiary care referral center in India [^114NkoFv]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the localization and management of patients with pancreatic insulinomas and determine the most effective localization and surgical techniques in the presence of significant financial constraints in the patient population. We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 18 patients with insulinomas treated at our institution over a period of 10 years. The medical records were reviewed for demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemistry, details of localization studies, intraoperative findings, postoperative outcome, and long-term follow-up. The sensitivities of the various localization procedures were calculated using the intraoperative findings as the gold standard. There were 10 men and 8 women in the study, with a median age of 43 years. All patients underwent a supervised 72-hour fast and developed symptomatic hypoglycemia within 48 hours. An average of 1.9 localization procedures was performed per patient. Computed tomography (CT) had a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 100%. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography had specificities of 85% and 100%, respectively, with a specificity of 66% and 50%, respectively. Fourteen patients underwent surgery. Intraoperatively the excised tumor was palpable in nine patients, and all patients had postoperative euglycemia. In five patients the tumor was not palpable during the time of surgery; three of these patients underwent blind distal pancreactomy, with two patients having persistent hypoglycemia during the postoperative period. Two patients had a negative exploratory laparotomy. Patients with a surgical cure were followed up for a mean period of 24 months. On the background of financial constraints in connection with patient care, CT scanning is a cost-effective option with good specificity. Intraoperative palpation of the tumor and enucleation is the most effective technique for surgical cure. Blind distal pancreactomy is not advocated for tumors that are not localized intraoperatively.

Pancreatic islet cell tumors (NET) in MEN1 — epidemiology and behavior indicate that the incidence varies from 30 to 80% in different series, many tumors secrete hormones (e.g., gastrin, insulin, VIP) while some may be nonsecretory, and these NET have an earlier age of onset in patients with MEN1. They are frequently multiple with uncertain behavior, creating diagnostic and management challenges, and tumor visualization on imaging does not necessarily correlate with the site of hormone excess in functioning syndromes.

Discussion and conclusions

Clinical hypoglycemia occurs when plasma glucose concentration is low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs, which include neurological alterations. The clinical feautures of hypoglycemia are non specific and it is not possible to establish a single plasma glucose concentration that definitively confirms clinical hypoglycemia. Therefore, hypoglycemia is confirmed by the documentation of the Whipple's triad, e.g. symptoms and/or signs consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of clinical alterations after the plasma glucose concentration is increased.

The most common cause of hypoglycemia is represented by insulin, insulin secretagogues, alcohol abuse and drugs of different classes. Hypoglycemia may occur during sepsis and other critical illnesses, which include renal or hepatic failure. Hypoglycemia can be also secondary to cortisol deficiency. It is therefore reasonable to assess plasma cortisol in the presence of hypoglycemia, although adrenocortical failure is not a common cause of hypoglycemia in adults in the absence of other clinical evidence. A low plasma cortisol concentration found in the presence of hypoglycemia is not per se indicative of adrenocortical insufficiency. In fact, recurrent hypoglycemia shifts glycemic thresholds for cortisol secretion.

Hypoglycemia may be caused by hyperinsulinism in the absence of prior gastric surgery or after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity. It can also be associated to the presence of anti-insulin antibodies, such as in Hirata syndrome. Finally, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia may be due to uncontrolled insulin release either from tumoral pancreatic beta-cells or from functionally defective beta-cells, as observed in nesidioblastosis, which is usually seen in newborns.

Although rare, insulinoma is the most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas with an annual incidence of four in every 1 million persons. Malignancy is observed in only 10% of cases. The clinical manifestation of insulinoma are variable and nonspecific and are related to the presence of hypoglycemia. The symptoms, which are often precipitated during physical exercise, become typically evident after fasting. The 72-h fasting test remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of insulinoma and includes the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, at the time hypoglycemic symptoms appear. We used this test for the diagnosis of primary hyperinsulinism in our case and the severe hypoglycemia with measurable insulin levels occurred after only 12 h unequivocally confirmed the hypothesis.

### Hypoglycemia [^111ffDVL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Except in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia is a rare disorder. It is identified by modified Whipple's criteria consisting of neuroglycopenic symptoms, a blood glucose level equal to or less than 40 mg/dL, and relief of symptoms by glucose use. The sources of the body glucose are dietary intake, glycogenolysis, and [figure: see text] gluconeogenesis. The metabolism of glucose involves oxidation and storage as glycogen or fat. Causes of hypoglycemia include medications or toxins capable of decreasing blood glucose, disorders associated with fasting hypoglycemia, and postprandial hypoglycemic disorders. The most common type of hypoglycemia is insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics. Insulinoma is rare; however, it is the most common hormone-secreting islet cell tumor. The diagnosis is made by the occurrence of hypoglycemia in the presence of symptoms of neuroglycopenia and inappropriately high levels of insulin and C-peptide. In hospitalized patients, the diagnosis is best made by prolonged fast. Most insulinomas are small and require invasive methods for precise localization. In surreptitious insulin use, hypoglycemia is associated with low plasma C-peptide. Postprandial hypoglycemia occurs in response to feeding and is generally caused by excessive insulin effect. It is seen in patients with postgastric surgery and rarely in early diabetes mellitus. Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia is rare and seems to be caused by subtle abnormalities of insulin response to food. Treatment of postprandial hypoglycemia consists of frequent small meals, with deletion of refined carbohydrate and increased protein intake. Primary treatment of insulinoma is surgical resection of the tumor.

Methods

Study subjects

"Malignant insulinoma" was used as the keywords to search the PUMCH medical record retrieval system for patients with a discharge diagnosis of malignant insulinoma and their related clinical data from 1984 to April 2017. The search yielded 25 patients. Among these patients, the medical records of three patients were unavailable, two patients were later diagnosed with benign insulinoma, two patients were diagnosed with recurrent insulinoma, two patients were diagnosed with multiple insulinomas, and one patient had no clear diagnosis; therefore, 15 patients diagnosed with malignant insulinoma based on clinical and/or pathological evidence were included in this study. The clinical diagnostic criteria for malignant insulinoma included the following: i) hypoglycemic symptoms and the Whipple triad; ii) endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia symptoms, with a blood glucose level < 3 mmol/L, insulin level > 3 μIU/mL, and C-peptide level > 0.6 ng/mL; and iii) pancreatic tumors with local infiltration or distant metastases based on evidence from one or several imaging methods. In addition, the pathological diagnostic criteria included a clinical diagnosis with surgical or puncture specimens indicative of a pNET.

### Laparoscopic treatment of benign insulinomas localized in the body and tail of the pancreas: a single-center experience [^113CLwv7]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The increasingly widespread use of minimally invasive surgery has allowed surgeons to exploit this approach for complex procedures, such as pancreatic resections, though its actual role outside simple operations remains debated.

Methods

This is a study of 12 consecutive patients, 5 men and 7 women, with pancreatic insulinoma who were treated at our institution from 2000 to September 2005. All patients presented with typical symptoms and laboratory findings of hyperinsulinism and were good candidates for laparoscopic surgery. Preoperative diagnostic work-up, operating time, postoperative complication rate, length of hospital stayd and clinical outcome were assessed.

Results

Successful laparoscopic resection was performed in 11 out of 12 patients: 4 had tumor enucleation, and 7 had distal pancreatectomy; among these latter 5 had spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. In 1 case conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean operative time was 170 minutes. The median tumor size was 18 mm, and all the insulinomas were benign. Four complications were observed in this group, and the median hospital stay was 8 days.

Conclusions

The laparoscopic approach proved to be feasible and safe, although the average operative time was longer and demanded good surgical skills as well as precise localization of the tumor and definition of its nature. Tumors located in the body or tail of the pancreas that are benign in nature can better benefit of laparoscopic approach.

### Severe deterioration of psoriasis due to an insulinoma [^116k99Q6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 56-year-old woman who presented with a severe exacerbation of psoriasis with concurrent hypoglycaemic episodes. Methotrexate 17.5 mg weekly was required to control her psoriasis. Investigation of her hypoglycaemia showed raised levels of insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin. Radiological investigation showed a tumour at the tail of the pancreas and the diagnosis was insulinoma. A spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed and the hypoglycaemic symptoms resolved. Immediately following the pancreatectomy, methotrexate was stopped and the patient's psoriasis went into remission. During a 2-year follow-up, she has required only minimal topical treatment for her skin.

### Insulinoma with focal hepatic lesions: malignant insulinoma? [^117QGocq]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Insulinoma is a rare tumour that is malignant in only 10% of cases. We report a case of insulinoma in a 59-year-old woman, associated with focal liver lesions, which raised the suspicion of malignancy of a pancreatic tumour. Enucleation of the insulinoma was performed with wedge resection of one hepatic nodule. Pathological examination indicated that the pancreatic tumour was compatible with insulinoma whereas the hepatic lesion was related to focal nodular hyperplasia. This clinical case highlights the need for histopathological proof of malignancy before selecting therapeutic strategies for insulinomas.

### Occult insulinoma with treatment refractory, severe hypoglycaemia in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome; difficulties faced during diagnosis, localization and management; a case report [^114vRBn4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

The current treatment modality of choice for insulinoma is surgical resection. The procedure selected may vary from enucleation of the tumour, partial or complete pancreatectomy to Whipple's procedure, depending on patient and tumour characteristics and availability of resources. In the Mayo clinic cohort, surgical resection was curative in about 87.5%. Major complications were observed in 10% of patients. It was also observed that the risk of recurrence of insulinoma was significantly higher among patients with MEN 1 (21% vs. 5% at 10 years) syndrome than in those without MEN 1 syndrome. A significant proportion of MEN 1 syndrome patients were found to have multiple insulinomas and required repeated surgical interventions. Hence it was recommended that patients with insulinoma related to MEN 1 syndrome need to undergo local excision of the tumour combined with distal subtotal pancreatectomy. But some studies concluded that enucleation and local resection provided long term cure for MEN 1 syndrome associated insulinoma in patients with solitary or dominant tumours while subtotal distal pancreatectomy should be preserved for patients with multiple insulinoma without dominance. This approach is suggested to minimize the risk of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency in a relatively young population.

### The incidence of insulinoma in Western Sweden between 2002 and 2019 [^114V2efw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulinoma is a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm with an incidence of 0.7–4 cases per million/year. Because of its rarity, epidemiological studies on insulinoma are few and limited by small sample sizes. An increasing incidence of insulinoma has recently been suggested. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of insulinoma in the Västra Götaland Region (VGR) of Sweden. Secondary aims were to evaluate clinical characteristics, diagnostic workup, management and outcome in patients diagnosed with insulinoma.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed for all patients in the VGR who had received an ICD-10 diagnosis code of a benign (D13.7) and/or a malignant (C25.4) tumor in the endocrine part of the pancreas, of hypoglycemia (E.161), and/or a code of a fasting test (AB011), from 2002–2019.

Results

Forty-two patients with insulinoma were identified, 37 of whom (20 men) were residents in the VGR at the time of diagnosis, giving a mean annual incidence of 1.3 cases per million/year. The mean (± standard deviation) age at diagnosis was 56 ± 18 years. Six of the 37 (16%) patients had metastatic insulinoma and 2 patients (5%) had a confirmed multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. At preoperative workup, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound detected an insulinoma in 28/36 (78%) and 21/21 (100%) cases, respectively.

Conclusions

Insulinoma remains a rare tumor in the modern era. The recorded mean annual incidence of 1.3 cases per million/year is compatible with the reported incidence in Sweden during the 1980s. Our results do not support an increasing incidence of insulinoma.

### Occult insulinoma with treatment refractory, severe hypoglycaemia in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome; difficulties faced during diagnosis, localization and management; a case report [^115xktzz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited genetic disorder. It was first described by Dr. Paul Wermer in 1954. In more than 80% of the cases, it is caused by inactivating mutation on MEN 1 gene located on chromosome 11q13. MEN 1 appears to be a tumour suppressor gene but precise mechanisms of tumorigenesis are not established yet. Both sexes are equally affected with a prevalence of 2:100,000. Presence of mutated MEN 1 gene results in increased predisposition to hyperplasia of endocrine glands and non-endocrine organs. Among the endocrine tumours, parathyroid adenoma (95%), pancreatic islet cell tumours (gastrinoma, insulinoma) (40%), pituitary adenoma (30%) and adrenal cortical adenoma, carcinoid tumours are frequently found. Ovarian tumours, lipomas, collagenomas and angiofibromas are noted to be manifested as non-endocrine tumours.

MEN 1 syndrome is defined clinically as the occurrence of two or more MEN 1 associated endocrine tumours or the occurrence of one MEN 1 syndrome associated endocrine tumour in a patient with family history of MEN 1 syndrome. Genetic testing for MEN 1 mutation is available for clinical use and should be considered on individual basis. But presymptomatic genetic diagnosis has not shown any clear benefits in preventing of morbidity and mortality in individuals with risk of developing MEN 1 syndrome. In our patient, presence of endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia was suggestive of an insulinoma. Coexistence of primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary microadenoma and characteristic cutaneous tumours in a patient diagnosed with an insulinoma in her 3 rd decade of life led to a diagnosis of MEN 1 syndrome. Insulinoma in MEN 1 syndrome typically presents in the second to fourth decade of life as opposed to sporadic insulinoma, which usually occurs in individuals older than 40 years. Our patient did not have any family members diagnosed with MEN 1 syndrome but had two paternal relatives with history of recurrent renal calculi who were not extensively evaluated.

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^1119dMSJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Localized insulinomas are an indication for surgical resection. Regarding the extent of resection (enucleation vs. resection) recent data show excellent outcomes of enucleations in patients with solitary insulinomas. Therefore, given the better outcomes of pancreatic function over the long‐term and young age of the patients, if surgically feasible, enucleation seems the better option for solitary insulinomas in MEN1, provided of course that concomitant PanNETs or gastrinomas do not dictate a different strategy.

The option of chemoprevention for PanNETs in MEN1 is interesting and a recent small observational cohort study compared lanreotide with a standard of care active surveillance. The study showed improved RECIST‐defined progression‐free survival (PFS) in the lanreotide group. In both groups however, one patient developed liver metastases. Limitations next to the small sample size, include the nonexperimental and therefore nonrandomized design and the nonblinded outcome evaluation. In addition, improved RECIST PFS is not yet known to predict longer overall survival for MEN1 patients with small NF‐PanNETs. Ideally, this is further evaluated in a randomized double‐blind trial.

4.2 Thoracic NETS

Thymic NETs (thNETs) are one of the most aggressive MEN1‐related manifestations. Although their prevalence is low (2%–8%) among patients with MEN1, they are responsible for up to one‐fifth of the MEN1‐related deaths. More than 50% of the published cases presented with distant metastases and 10‐year survival was 33%. Median age at diagnosis of thNETs is in the fifth decade, and there is only one published case of an adolescent with a thNET., thNETs predominately, but not exclusively, occur in males, although less pronounced in Asian cohorts. Some cohorts report a familial occurrence of thNETs, but this is not seen by others. The most important challenge is the early identification of this rare MEN1‐related tumour, as currently most published cases were not detected during surveillance. When more data becomes available of patients who are diagnosed early in life through predictive testing, we may get a sense if early detection of thNETs in MEN1 may improve the outcome. Prophylactic thymectomy during initial parathyroidectomy is advocated to reduce the risk of subsequent thNETs, although the risk is not abolished.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation for a pancreatic insulinoma: a novel endoscopic management strategy [^111iAFEE]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Although rare, insulinomas are the most common functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), typically presenting with Whipple's triad – symptoms of hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose, and symptom resolution after glucose administration. While surgery remains the primary curative treatment for an insulinoma, its potential for significant adverse outcomes has prompted exploration of less invasive approaches, such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA). EUS-RFA has shown high efficacy and a favorable safety profile in the treatment of insulinomas, especially for patients who are not suitable for surgery. The purpose of presenting this case is to highlight the role of EUS-RFA as a minimally invasive and effective treatment option for an insulinoma in a patient who declined to undergo surgery (Video 1).

A 37-year-old man with Crohn's disease presented with recurrent fasting hypoglycemia and met Whipple's triad. Laboratory testing showed endogenous hyperinsulinemia. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET) 68 GA-dotatate scans were negative. EUS revealed a 13-mm well-differentiated NET in the pancreatic head, with additional subcentimeter lesions, and fine-needle biopsy confirmed this was an insulinoma (Fig. 1). Surgical enucleation was deemed high risk owing to proximity to the main pancreatic duct and the risk of fistula formation, and the patient declined to undergo a Whipple surgery. After multidisciplinary review, EUS-RFA was selected as the treatment modality. The procedure was technically successful without complications, with complete resolution of the patient's symptoms and improvement of his biochemical parameters.

Fig. 1
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) image showing: a the insulinoma in the pancreatic head; b EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy being performed.

This case highlights EUS-RFA as an effective minimally invasive option for insulinomas in select patients who are not ideal surgical candidates or who elect not to undergo surgery. Further prospective trials are needed to validate the long-term efficacy of EUS-RFA and better characterize its safety profile, including the incidence and management of potential adverse events.

### Prevalence and characteristics of factitious hypoglycaemia in non-diabetic patients in a department of endocrinology [^111tKVt4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

It is noted that patients with factitious hypoglycaemia may falsify medical history, mimic signs, tamper with features, interfere with diagnostic investigations to induce an illness and seek medical care through unnecessary tests and repeated hospital admissions. Thus, the clinical presentation of self‐induced hypoglycaemia is highly variable. Patients may present with a spectrum of symptoms including asthenia, tremor, sweating, palpitations, hunger, dizziness, blurred vision, slurred speech and attention disorders or difficulties in concentration. The latter was significantly more frequent in patients with factitious hypoglycaemia than patients with other causes of hypoglycaemia in our study. Patients with factitious hypoglycaemia are more likely to undergo severe complications of hypoglycaemia such as disorientation, seizures, brain damage, irreversible neurological sequelae, coma and death.,

Factitious hypoglycaemia is a challenging diagnosis. Measuring insulin, proinsulin and C‐peptide levels during a hypoglycaemic event help differentiate it from other causes of hypoglycaemia. In the case of exogenous intentional human insulin use, the plasma insulin level is elevated while the proinsulin and C‐peptide levels are suppressed. However, in the case of insulin analogue injection, the diagnosis may be more difficult since most commercial insulin assays can detect only human insulin and fail to detect insulin analogues due to low cross‐reactivity. The detection power of a test for insulin analogues depends on both the type of platform and the complexity of the analogue. On the contrary, in the case of auto‐ingestion of sulfonylureas that stimulate endogenous insulin secretion, insulin, proinsulin and C‐peptide levels are elevated mimicking thereby an insulinoma. The drug detection in the blood or urine adjusts the diagnosis. Clinical suspicion remains thus the fundamental key to establish the diagnosis considering the shortage of any definitive laboratory findings. In some cases, as in our study, patients may admit to the intentional use of hypoglycaemic drugs.

### Surgery for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-related insulinoma: long-term outcomes in a large international cohort [^113KB3in]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 159 patients with MEN1 were identified, of whom 96 met the inclusion criteria. Sixty‐three patients did not meet the inclusion criteria for the following reasons: no surgery 15, liver metastases at diagnosis 6, no proper diagnosis 3, follow‐up less than 1 year 34, total pancreatectomy 4 or no details on surgical procedure 1. Demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1. Median age at diagnosis was 30 (range 5–81) years and 15 of the 96 patients (16 per cent) were younger than 21 years at diagnosis. There were 58 female patients (60 per cent). The insulinoma diagnosis was confirmed following a 72‐h fasting test in 64 patients (67 per cent).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 study cohort undergoing insulinoma surgery

Preoperative imaging and type of surgery

Preoperative imaging results and surgical strategies are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The insulinoma was localized in 63 patients (66 per cent), and these patients underwent typical resections: single enucleation 17, distal pancreatectomy 41 or Whipple/PPPD 5. The disease was considered multifocal in 33 patients (34 per cent), leading to combined pancreatic resections, of which the majority (26 of 33) were distal pancreatectomies with enucleation of tumour in the pancreatic head. Clinical characteristics of patients undergoing one or multiple enucleations and other resections are shown in Table S1 (supporting information). Twenty‐nine of 48 patients operated before 2006 were considered to have localized insulinoma compared with 34 of 48 who had surgery from 2006 onwards (Table S2, supporting information).

Figure 1
Study flow chart showing insulinoma location, surgical procedures and postoperative hypoglycaemia

Of 92 patients with preoperative imaging, 45 (49 per cent) had a solitary pNET on imaging. Despite having a solitary pNET on imaging, 14 of these patients underwent resection for multifocal disease, based on invasive imaging or intraoperative findings. Ten had distal pancreatectomy with enucleation, one had Whipple/PPPD with enucleation and three had multiple enucleations.

### Multiple proinsulin-secreting tumors of the pancreas treated by laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy [^115cnV8i]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with pancreatic tumors that induce hypoglycemia present with a myriad of symptoms. Laboratory testing can frequently result in data challenging to the clinician to confirm the biochemical diagnosis. Proinsulin, in addition to insulin levels, may be essential in evaluating and diagnosing an insulinoma.

Methods

The objective of this case report is to demonstrate the potential importance of proinsulin levels in the evaluation of tumor-induced hypoglycemia. We report a 49-year-old woman with an unusual clinical presentation. Unlike many patients with tumor-induced hypoglycemia, her fasting glucose levels were fairly unimpressive, her insulin levels were undetectable during a prolonged fast, and she had elevated proinsulin levels.

Results

The inpatient fast was remarkable for levels of serum glucose 53 mg/dl or higher, a serum insulin < 2 uIU/ml, C-peptide 0.7–1.1 (nl 0.8–3.1 ng/ml), and proinsulin 29.2–36.8 pmol/l (nl ≤ 18.8 pmol/l). CT scanning of the abdomen revealed multiple pancreatic lesions. A laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy led to the removal of multiple neuroendocrine tumors, which stained only for proinsulin and not for other pancreatic tumor markers. Postoperatively, she normalized her biochemical serum studies and has remained symptom-free 2 years later.

Conclusions

The measurement of proinsulin plays an important part in the diagnostic workup of neuroendocrine tumors causing hypoglycemia. These potentially malignant tumors can be treated adequately with minimally invasive surgery.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^112tVnVG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and Pathology

Pathophysiology

Despite a low tumor mutational burden, insulinomas are enriched for genetic mutations and copy number variants in epigenetic modifiers. This suggests a central role for chromatin remodeling in the pathogenesis of insulinomas. The predominant recurring genetic variant in up to 30% of insulinomas is an activating T372R mutation in the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) gene, which is absent in nonfunctioning panNEN. YY1 is a transcriptional activator of the insulin gene. MEN1 mutations appear to be less common in insulinomas than nonfunctioning panNEN, but insulinomas do display loss of heterozygosity of the MEN1 region at chromosome 11q13.1 in 30% of cases. Insulinomas are also associated with aberrant methylation patterns, including of the insulin promoter, where noncanonical transcription factors drive insulin expression.

Pathology

The World Health Organization classification and grading of panNEN separates these tumors using the Ki67 index (MIB-1 antibody staining) into 4 broad categories: well-differentiated panNET grade 1, 2, or 3 (G1–2–3) and poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). Helpful for the distinction of panNEC from G3 panNET is the overexpression of p53 and loss of expression of Rb1. Insulin staining is not obligatorily positive in insulinomas and is usually not necessarily required once the clinical diagnosis has been made.

Indolent and aggressive insulinomas are different entities. Aggressive insulinomas are characterized by rapid onset of symptoms, larger size, and expression of ARX and alpha-1-antitrypsin, and decreased or absent immunohistochemical expression of insulin, PDX1, and GLP-1R. Moreover, aggressive insulinomas often harbor ATRX and DAXX mutations, the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype and chromosomal instability. Tumor grade and somatic MEN1 or YY1 mutations are less useful for predicting clinical behavior. Aggressive insulinomas have similarities to normal α cells and nonfunctioning panNETs, whereas indolent insulinomas remain closely related to normal β cells.

### Pancreatic endocrine tumors: radiologic-clinicopathologic correlation [^1156fKt4]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) are primarily well-differentiated tumors composed of cells that resemble normal islet cells but that arise from pancreatic ductal cells. They are classified as functioning or nonfunctioning according to their associated clinical symptoms; insulinoma, gastrinoma, and glucagonoma are the most common functioning PETs. They also are classified according to their biologic behavior, although all PETs have malignant potential. Most are sporadic, but some are associated with familial syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1. At imaging, PETs typically appear as well-defined hypervascular masses, a finding indicative of their rich capillary network. Cystic change, calcification, and necrosis are common in large tumors, which are associated with a poorer prognosis and a higher prevalence of local and vascular invasion and metastases than are smaller tumors. Even when metastases are present, many well-differentiated PETs have an indolent course. Poorly differentiated PETs are rare and have an infiltrative appearance; patients with such tumors have a poor prognosis. Knowledge of the characteristic clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features of PETs is important in the evaluation and management of patients with a suspected clinical syndrome or a pancreatic mass.

### Insulinoma in chronic renal failure: a case report [^113uXQDY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of insulinoma depends on the fulfillment of well-established criteria during the 72-h fast. However, these criteria rely on normal renal function. Spontaneous hypoglycemia that is not attributable to insulinoma may occur in persons with renal failure. We describe herein a patient with renal impairment who had undergone renal transplant and had a 20-yr history of hypoglycemic symptoms and successful resection of insulinoma. Although the results of a 72-h fast were consistent with endogenous hyperinsulinemia, their interpretation was complicated in the presence of renal impairment. Fortunately, the identification of the tumor, by endoscopic ultrasonograph, led to a correct diagnosis. This case seems to be the second report of a patient with insulinoma with concomitant renal failure.

### Recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by an insulin-secreting insulinoma [^114h9ugX]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 37-year-old woman presented to her local physician in 1995 for evaluation of episodes of neuroglycopenia, which manifested as visual distortion and withdrawal without response to verbal commands in the food-deprived state. A 72 h fast was positive for hypoglycemia and the patient was given diazoxide and prednisone, but hypoglycemia was not controlled. The patient underwent pancreatic exploration in 1997, but no insulinoma was found. She was referred to the Mayo Clinic in 1998 for further evaluation and treatment. Abdominal CT and transabdominal ultrasound revealed a 1 cm insulinoma in the uncinate process of the pancreas. The patient again underwent pancreatic exploration. The insulinoma was removed, but during enucleation the tumor fractured. Hypoglycemia recurred 6 months later.

Investigations

Laboratory tests, transabdominal ultrasound CT of the pancreas, endoscopic ultrasonography, fine-needle aspiration, and pancreatic exploration.

Diagnosis

Recurrence of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by fracture of an insulin-secreting insulinoma.

Management

Surgical excision of the recurrent tumor.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — localization of insulinomas: Imaging with multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT or MRI is recommended to localize insulinomas; some are too small for CT or MRI, and in those cases endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be useful. If imaging is negative, insulinomas can often be localized by injecting calcium into selective pancreatic arteries and measuring insulin levels in the right (usually) or left hepatic vein (Imamura-Doppman procedure), and most experts recommend this test only for patients with persistent or recurrent insulin-mediated hypoglycemia and when other localization tests are equivocal or negative.

### Continuous glucose monitoring in patients with insulinoma [^115afmTK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumours that are usually small and may take time to localize. They cause recurrent life-threatening spontaneous hypoglycaemia. Recurrent hypoglycaemia causes loss of hypoglycaemia awareness, putting the patient at further risk, but this has rarely been described in insulinoma. We describe the utility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with insulinoma.

Patients and Methods

Three patients, aged 72 years (patient 1), 37 years (patient 2) and 24 years (patient 3), with suspected insulinoma attended our investigation unit, in a university teaching hospital. Biochemical diagnosis was confirmed by elevated plasma insulin and C-peptide during biochemical hypoglycaemia [plasma glucose < 2.2 mM (40 mg/dl)]. Surgery confirmed histology in all. CGM was used to monitor frequency and time of hypoglycaemia during diagnosis and medical treatment, and after definitive surgical treatment.

Results

All patients had evidence of hypoglycaemia unawareness. At diagnosis in patients 1–3, CGM revealed 6.1%, 21.9% and 71.0% of time spent in moderate hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose 2.2–3.0 mM), and 1.4%, 11.4% and 48.1% of time in severe hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose < 2.2 mM), respectively. On diazoxide this reduced to 0.6%, 5.4% and 5.7% time in moderate hypoglycaemia, and no severe hypoglycaemia in patients 1 and 3, and 0.5% in patient 2. Octreotide therapy in patients 2 and 3 resulted in 5.8% and 0% of time in moderate hypoglycaemia, respectively, and no severe hypoglycaemia. After surgical excision CGM confirmed cure in all.

Conclusions

CGM in insulinoma is useful in detecting hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia unawareness, monitoring response to medical therapy and for confirming cure postoperatively, and is useful in the management of this uncommon but dangerous condition.

### Genetic disorders and insulinoma / glucagonoma [^1111kPr7]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Insulinoma and glucagonoma are two rare functioning neoplasms of the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, respectively, characterized by an uncontrolled over-secretion of insulin or glucagon, responsible for the development of the hypoglycemic syndrome and the glucagonoma syndrome. They prevalently arise as sporadic tumors; only about 10% of cases develop in the context of rare inherited tumor syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), being the result of an autosomal-dominant germline heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene. Here, we reviewed the main epidemiological and clinical aspects of insulinoma and glucagonoma in the context of genetic syndromes.

### 68Ga DOTA-exendin PET / CT for detection of insulinoma in a patient with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^1145jDUK]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Insulinomas are the most common functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and the leading cause of persistent hypoglycemia with hyperinsulinemia in adults. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP) receptor analogs are the latest agents being used in the detection of insulinomas, with initial reports suggesting high sensitivity due to universal GLP1 receptor expression on these tumors. PET/CT imaging in this patient using Ga DOTA-Exendin, a GLP receptor analog, proved useful for accurate localization of the culprit lesion, aiding in the definitive management of the patient.

### Characteristics of glucose metabolism indexes and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) in patients with insulinoma [^114FT4vL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

It is relatively easy to make a qualitative diagnosis of hypoglycemia when the symptom is demonstrated as typical Whipple's triad. Clinically, however, the symptoms of hypoglycemia for patients with insulinoma are more complicated and volatile, which include the non-specific autonomic nerve symptoms like profuse sweating, palpitation and trembling, as well as the central nervous system disorders like insanity, behavioral abnormality, personality change, epilepsy, narcolepsy, lethargy, coma. The chronic patients can even suffer a remarkable reduction of blood glucose without any clinical symptoms. According to the study of Ding Bo et al. more than half of the patients with insulinoma suffer from hypoglycemia at night and among the 22 patients with insulinoma in this study, there are 11 of them suffering the lowest blood sugar at night. Governed by the vagus nerves, the symptoms of hypoglycemia at night are still more unconspicuous. The traditional fingerstick glucose monitor only provides snapshots of plasma glucose, so reducing its reliability for quantification of hypoglycaemic episodes, especially at night. The traditional glucose examination is unable to discover the atypical hypoglycemia and the hypoglycemia at night timely. The continuous glucose monitoring system, however, can indirectly reflect the level of blood glucose by monitoring the glucose concentration of interstitial fluid of the subcutaneous tissues with a glucose sensor. Capable of offering the information about the blood glucose in all day, its major advantages lie in the fact that it is able to find out the hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia that are beyond the reach of traditional glucose examination, such as post-meal hyperglycemia and asymptomatic hypoglycemia at night, and it can define the time, frequency, and extent of hypoglycemia, making up for the deficiency of traditional glucose examination, and providing new clues to preliminary diagnosis. The emergence of real-time continuous glucose monitoring system equipped with alarming functions for determining hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, in particular, is beneficial to the diagnosis of insulinoma, especially the atypical cases. Studies show that CGMS contributes to increasing the detection rate of hypoglycemia and the asymptomatic ones in particular. Han et al. contend that the lowest blood glucose detected by CGMS is of diagnostic value to insulinoma. In this study, there is also a marked difference of the lowest blood glucose between the insulinoma group and the hypoglycemia group and the lowest blood glucose of patients in the former group is remarkably lower than that in the latter group of which the hypoglycemia is caused by other reasons. Due to the different occurrence mechanism of hypoglycemia, the patients with insulinoma have suffered more serious hypoglycemia out of the unstifling secretion of endogenous insulin. In addition, this study suggests that hypoglycemia is of vital danger to the patients with insulinoma because of the high number in occurrence, the seriousness in extent and the long period of disease, therefore it is imperative to have early diagnosis and early treatment.

Surgery and ablation

For single solitary insulinomas, curative surgical excision remains the treatment of choice. However, it should be performed only when the diagnosis is certain and by a surgeon who is skilled in pancreatic surgery. EUS with special focus on the relationship between the tumor and the pancreatic duct is an excellent tool to guide surgical resectability. Laparoscopic, or robot-assisted enucleation of an insulinoma, has been shown to be feasible, particularly if the lesion is visualized preoperatively on CT scan, or by EUS, and when there is sufficient distance to the pancreatic and/or common bile duct. Localized insulinomas at the head of the pancreas rarely require a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure), thereby avoiding considerable morbidity.

Complications following pancreas resection include postoperative pancreatic fistula, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, and delayed gastric emptying together with exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. These complications seem to occur at higher rates than those observed in patients undergoing surgery for other solid pancreatic tumors. Perioperative SRL administration may reduce the perioperative complications. Enucleation is favored for small lesions (< 2 cm) located > 2 to 3 mm from the main pancreatic and/or common bile duct. In a large series of > 1000 patients undergoing surgery for panNET, the complication rates as defined by a Clavien–Dindo score ≥ 3 was 32% for pancreaticoduodenectomy, 20% for distal pancreatectomy, and 25% for enucleation, whereas the rate of pancreatic fistula grade B/C was 23%, 29%, and 33%, respectively. In case 1, the patient successfully underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic enucleation of the insulinoma without any complications.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117RgmuK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Surgical management of insulinomas states that the treatment for exophytic or peripheral insulinomas is enucleation because they are usually benign. Sporadic tumors are usually solitary, whereas familial tumors are multiple. If enucleation is not possible due to invasion or tumor location within the pancreas, then pancreatoduodenectomy for tumors in the head of the pancreas or distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen for small tumors not involving splenic vessels may be performed. A minimally invasive resection can be considered.
