## Question

In context of nonfatal drowning and CXR with pneumonitis in 2 year old, is treatment recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 2-year-old with nonfatal drowning and a chest radiograph showing "pneumonitis" should receive antibiotics, and how to manage this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "pneumonitis" on CXR after drowning actually represents pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about empiric antibiotics in drowning. Next, I will examine how to differentiate chemical pneumonitis from infectious pneumonia using clinical signs and, if needed, targeted diagnostics. After that, I should consider pediatric-specific issues and safe observation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based plan and confirm the bottom line recommendation with references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and pathophysiology. "Pneumonitis" on CXR after drowning often reflects chemical irritation from aspirated water causing alveolar-capillary injury, surfactant disruption, and an ARDS-like picture rather than bacterial infection; importantly, even small volumes of aspirated water can produce radiographic abnormalities that mimic pneumonia, so I should not jump to conclusions about infection based solely on CXR findings [^113nCNyU] [^116spww7].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on empiric antibiotics. The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) 2019 and 2024 updates issue a strong recommendation against empiric antibiotics in the initial treatment of drowning patients, emphasizing that no study shows benefit and that routine prophylaxis is not indicated; antibiotics should be reserved for patients who, after initial resuscitation, demonstrate clinical or microbiologic evidence of pneumonia, ideally guided by cultures or antigen testing rather than imaging alone [^116LziJV] [^113nCNyU] [^115ALGz7].

> Hold on, let's not conflate aspiration pneumonitis with aspiration pneumonia. I need to check the adult CAP guidance: many aspiration events result in chemical pneumonitis that resolves with supportive care within 24–48 hours without antibiotics, whereas anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended unless there is lung abscess or empyema; this supports a conservative approach unless infection is proven or strongly suspected clinically [^1168zSU9].

> Next, I should review how to differentiate infection from chemical injury at the bedside. I will now examine for objective signs such as fever, rising CRP/procalcitonin, purulent sputum, worsening oxygenation, new focal consolidation on exam, or systemic toxicity; leukocytosis alone is nonspecific after drowning and can be misleading, so I should avoid anchoring on that. If infection is suspected, I should obtain targeted cultures (sputum or endotracheal aspirate) and consider blood cultures or urinary antigens before starting antibiotics, aligning with WMS guidance [^113nCNyU] [^115ALGz7].

> But wait, what if the CXR is the only abnormality and the child looks well? I should double-check the role of routine CXR in drowning. WMS advises that initial chest radiographs do not correlate with severity or outcomes and should not be used in isolation to drive antibiotic decisions; thus, a CXR labeled "pneumonitis" without clinical infection signs should not trigger antibiotics by itself [^112uCzGa] [^115tTAJs].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific issues. Children aged 1–4 years are the highest-risk drowning group, and many recover with supportive care. Pediatric pneumonia pathways emphasize that well-appearing, fully vaccinated toddlers with mild symptoms are often viral and may not require antibiotics or routine CXR, reinforcing a conservative stance here unless clinical deterioration or specific risk factors emerge [^115SweS3] [^113TaSE2].

> I should confirm safe observation and disposition. For mild symptoms with normal mentation, WMS supports 4–6 hours of observation with discharge if respiratory function normalizes and no deterioration occurs. Pediatric data show that most who decompensate do so within 4–6 hours, and validated pediatric criteria (normal mentation, respiratory rate, no dyspnea, no airway support, no hypoxemia) predict safe discharge after 8 hours, which helps structure follow-up planning and parent education [^1126bFNR] [^112X8tZF] [^1161wSPE].

> Let me synthesize the management plan. Supportive care remains first-line: supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate saturation, consider noninvasive ventilation for mild-to-moderate distress if alert and protecting airway, and apply lung-protective strategies if intubation is needed; do not start empiric antibiotics solely for "pneumonitis" on CXR. If objective infection signs develop or cultures return positive, then initiate targeted antibiotics based on microbiology; otherwise, observe closely and reassess serially [^113z8EK5] [^11396FgC] [^114C47JG] [^113nCNyU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "pneumonitis" might imply a need for steroids, but I should verify that. WMS recommends against routine corticosteroids in drowning, and although rare case reports describe organizing pneumonia after near-drowning responding to steroids, that is not generalizable; steroids should not be used empirically here [^1125qcwJ] [^113T2seR].

> I need to ensure I address special risks. If there was prolonged submersion in contaminated water, immunocompromise, or clinical deterioration with concern for atypical pathogens (including fungi), I should escalate diagnostics (e.g., bronchoscopy with BAL) and tailor therapy accordingly. Case literature documents invasive fungal disease after near-drowning, reminding me to keep an index of suspicion when the course deviates from expected chemical pneumonitis [^116163rb].

> Bottom line: No, antibiotics are not indicated solely because a CXR in a 2-year-old after nonfatal drowning shows "pneumonitis". I should treat supportively, avoid empiric antibiotics, and start antibiotics only if clinical, laboratory, or microbiologic evidence of infection emerges, consistent with WMS strong recommendations and pediatric pneumonia best practices [^113nCNyU] [^116LziJV] [^113TaSE2].

Empiric antibiotics are **not recommended** for a 2-year-old with nonfatal drowning and CXR pneumonitis unless there is clinical or microbiologic evidence of infection [^113nCNyU] [^116LziJV]. Initial CXR changes after drowning are often **noninfectious** and can mimic pneumonia, so antibiotics should be guided by clinical signs (fever, leukocytosis, rising CRP, purulent sputum, or positive cultures) [^112uCzGa] [^115ALGz7]. If infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, use ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole to cover aspiration pathogens; add vancomycin if MRSA is a concern. Observe for 4–6 hours and discharge if stable, with clear return precautions [^1126bFNR] [^112X8tZF].

---

## Pathophysiology of pneumonitis after drowning

After drowning, **aspiration of water** causes direct alveolar injury, surfactant disruption, and an inflammatory response that can produce CXR infiltrates resembling pneumonia [^116spww7]. These changes are often **noninfectious** and may resolve with supportive care alone [^113nCNyU].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding antibiotic use in drowning-associated pneumonitis

Empiric antibiotics are **not recommended** in drowning without confirmed infection because initial CXR changes are often noninfectious and can mimic pneumonia [^113nCNyU] [^116LziJV]. Antibiotics are indicated only when there is clinical or microbiologic evidence of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, rising CRP, purulent sputum, or positive cultures [^115ALGz7].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for infection in drowning patients

To differentiate infectious from noninfectious pneumonitis, use the following criteria:

| **Clinical sign** | **Indicative of infection** |
|-|-|
| Fever | Yes |
| Leukocytosis | Yes |
| Elevated CRP | Yes |
| Purulent sputum | Yes |
| Positive cultures (sputum, blood, BAL) | Yes |
| Clinical deterioration | Yes |

---

If these signs are absent, **infection is unlikely**, and antibiotics should be withheld [^113nCNyU].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens if infection is confirmed

If infection is confirmed or strongly suspected, use the following regimens:

- **First-line therapy**: Ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole to cover common aspiration pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes).
- **MRSA coverage**: Add vancomycin if MRSA is a concern.
- **Duration**: Typically 7–10 days, adjusted based on clinical response and culture results.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Both the Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend against empiric antibiotics in drowning without confirmed infection [^113nCNyU]. Antibiotics should be guided by **clinical and microbiologic evidence** [^115ALGz7].

---

## Potential risks of unnecessary antibiotic administration

Unnecessary antibiotics carry **significant risks**, including:

- Antibiotic resistance
- Adverse drug reactions
- Increased healthcare costs
- Delayed recognition of noninfectious complications

Thus, antibiotics should be used only when clearly indicated [^113nCNyU].

---

## Clinical observation and follow-up

Patients should be observed for 4–6 hours after drowning; if stable with normal mental status and respiratory function, discharge is appropriate [^1126bFNR]. Provide clear return precautions and arrange follow-up to monitor for delayed complications [^113uuT5J].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Empiric antibiotics are **not recommended** for a 2-year-old with nonfatal drowning and CXR pneumonitis unless there is clinical or microbiologic evidence of infection. Antibiotics should be guided by clinical signs and culture results, with supportive care as the mainstay. If infection is confirmed, use ampicillin-sulbactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, adding vancomycin if MRSA is suspected.

### Mild hypothermia after near drowning in twin toddlers [^114tj18B]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Under pressure controlled ventilation the oxygenation index improved initially and the inspiratory oxygen fraction could be reduced to 0.3 over the first 48 hours after the accident. However, 72 hours after the accident oxygenation deteriorated. The initial CT of the thorax had shown infiltrations in the basal dorsal thorax after aspiration (Fig. 2). The following chest X-ray films revealed increasing bilateral infiltrations of the lung (Fig. 3). After 3 days in the ICU, sepsis with multiple organ failure developed (acute respiratory dysfunction syndrome [ARDS] with an oxygenation index of 109 torr, circulatory failure requiring catecholamines, liver dysfunction with increased transferases and reduced prothrombin time, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Substitution of blood products was necessary. Acute renal failure did not develop. Antibiotic treatment was started (ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aerguinosa in the tracheal aspirate, vancomycin for Enterococcus faecium at the central venous catheter tip).

Under differentiated pressure controlled ventilation, oxygenation did not improve. Because it was unclear at this time whether extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would be required, 5 days after the accident the child was transferred by helicopter to another university hospital because of limited capacity at our hospital. Under high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation, oxygenation improved and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was not necessary. Conventional pressure controlled ventilation could be restored 7 days after the accident, and at the same time the multiple organ failure improved. Sedation was reduced and the girl was extubated 11 days after the accident, with no neurological deficit. Twenty-three days after the accident she was transferred to the community hospital where her brother was initially hospitalized, and she was discharged 1 day later completely restored to health.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — diagnostics (radiologic testing): We do not recommend routine initial chest radiographs, as findings do not correlate with arterial blood gas measurements or outcome; x-rays may be useful in tracking changes in patient condition but not for determining prognosis if obtained at the time of presentation. We do not suggest a routine initial head computed tomography (CT), as a normal initial head CT does not have prognostic value in the drowning patient. Routine use of neuroimaging in the awake and alert drowning patient is not recommended unless dictated by a change in clinical status. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Compliance with the current recommendations for prescribing antibiotics for paediatric community-acquired pneumonia is improving: data from a prospective study in a French network [^113TaSE2]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The absence of antibiotic prescription was considered as non-compliant. It could be argued that children who did not receive antibiotics were suspected of having a viral infection, which therefore obviated the need for antibiotics. French health authorities recommended, in 2005, to perform a chest X-ray in cases where CAP is suspected and to treat all cases of CAP with antibiotics, as the differentiation between viral and bacterial infections is not easy to distinguish. The latest guideline from the British Thoracic Society also recommends for all children with pneumonia to be treated with antibiotics; however, the Society also stated that fully vaccinated children of less than 2 years old of age with mild lower respiratory symptoms are not likely to have bacterial pneumonia (but rather viral pneumonia) and therefore require no chest X-rays or antibiotics. The American recommendations from the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America also stated that 'Antimicrobial therapy is not routinely required for preschool-aged children with CAP, because viral pathogens are responsible for the great majority of clinical disease' (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Therefore, challenging the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in fully vaccinated children younger than 2 years old with mild symptoms is another way to reduce antibiotic use.

Oxygenation during drowning resuscitation highlights that few large-scale studies have evaluated different airway adjuncts applied to drowning patients. Although ideal rescue breathing includes supplemental oxygen and a positive pressure delivery device, any amount of oxygen delivery (eg, mouth-to-mouth, bag-valve-mask [BVM] with ambient air) is better than none if supplemental oxygen is not available. Manikin studies of supraglottic airways have shown that lifeguards can successfully insert them, but there is concern that this does not replicate real world usage, and because of pulmonary edema from drowning, certain supraglottic airway devices may perform poorly for oxygenation based on leak pressures.

### Mild hypothermia after near drowning in twin toddlers [^1163opW3]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Two recently published studies, conducted in patients who had suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, compared induced mild hypothermia for 12–24 hours with normothermic management; they found that a significantly greater percentage of patients in the groups treated with mild hypothermia had good neurological outcomes. In patients affected by brain injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale score from 3 to 8, induced mild hypothermia for 24–48 hours yielded controversial findings. In these patients hypothermia on admission correlated with poor outcome, suggesting that spontaneous hypothermia may be a result of major brain injury.

In the present case report, hypothermia on the scene and on admission was probably the result of external factors such as water and air temperature and the children's age, suggesting cerebral protection from hypothermia. Up until the arrival of the twins at hospital, the treatment was identical. The boy was passively warmed to achieve normothermia, and the girl underwent prolonged (72 hours) mild hypothermia (32–34°C). The different neurological outcomes could have been influenced by these different treatments. However, some factors remain uncertain. For example, was the boy the first to go into the water, with resulting longer submersion and hypoxaemia times? How effective was bystander CPR in the two children? Was the time to achieve hypothermia the same in both children? Excluding bystander CPR, the remaining factors are considered strong predictors of outcome after near drowning. The girl developed ARDS and septic shock, whereas the boy recovered from aspiration pneumonia without further complications.

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^111xvxgZ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

It was surprising that the majority of published studies regarding the treatment of drowning are on the use of ECLS. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization international database has over 400 centres contributing data. Despite this, there were only 247 drowning patients included over a 30-year period. Clearly, the use of ECLS in drowning patients is not a common occurrence. However, the survival rates in patients with cardiac arrest (57% with ROSC, 23% with ECLS) compare favourably to published survival rates post-drowning associated cardiac arrest in Germany (18%), Sweden (14%) and France (9%). There were one meta-analysis and one systematic review examining ECLS in the treatment of drowning and hypothermia that were not included in this paper. Both studies grouped drowning and avalanche patients in 'asphyxial' groups, and the drowning outcomes could not be separated. However, the outcomes for this group of patients were much worse when compared with isolated hypothermic cardiac arrest with 23.4% vs 67.7% survival and an odds ratio for survival of 0.19 (0.11–0.35).

No study reported on the efficacy of any of the adjuvant therapies in isolation. Added to this was the confounder that all treatments were administered at the clinicians' discretion and, almost certainly, there was significant treatment bias with sicker patients more likely to receive MV and adjuvant therapies, such as steroids and antibiotics. van Berkel et al. (1996) did conduct a regression analysis attempting to control for confounding variables and concluded that there was no benefit from any of the adjuvant therapies with regards to duration of MV, hospital or ICU LOS. They also concluded that MV was a risk factor for developing pneumonia post-drowning without presenting the data or outlining the variables included in the analysis. Clinical trials in ARDS have established a lack of efficacy for steroids and surfactant. The evidence for or against diuretic therapy in ARDS is less clear. The lack of evidence in drowning prevents any recommendations.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^1136cufe]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia Definition

We did not apply an a priori definition for pneumonia, and pneumonia definitions varied by individual trial. Some trials required radiologic criteria, such as chest radiograph findings, for the diagnosis of pneumonia, whereas others used clinical criteria. The nonhospital trials typically used the WHO clinical criteria of fast breathing pneumonia, defined as isolated tachypnea (> 60 breaths per minute), with no other clinical signs among infants aged 7 to 59 days.

Interventions

We included publications that evaluated any antibiotic regimen to treat pneumonia in young infants, as well as those that evaluated antibiotic regimens as a component of a package of interventions. We excluded studies that only enrolled infants who were treated prophylactically or on the basis of risk factors without clinical evidence of pneumonia. We also excluded studies that evaluated antiviral, antifungal, or antimalarial interventions. WHO-recommended antibiotic regimens are defined in Table 1.

Comparator

We included studies with a comparator group that was either the standard of care, an alternate antibiotic regimen, placebo, or an alternate management strategy such as referral or observation.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were: (1) mortality (all-cause or infection-specific), (2) clinical improvement or deterioration, (3) neurodevelopmental outcomes, or (4) adverse antibiotic effects. Secondary outcomes included (a) hospital utilization (ie, length of stay or readmission), (b) relapse, and (c) cost effectiveness. We preferentially reported the latest time point available for all outcomes. Studies reporting only pharmacokinetic outcomes were excluded.

Study Selection

We initially screened studies on the basis of title and abstract, then by full text. All study screening was conducted in duplicate and adjudicated by a third author, using Covidence systematic review software.

Data Extraction and Management

We extracted data into a predesigned extraction spreadsheet. All data were independently extracted in duplicate, with discrepancies adjudicated by a third author. For published studies of infants with isolated tachypnea aged 0 to 59 days, we contacted authors to request data disaggregated into age groups of 0 to 6 days and 7 to 59 days to enable analysis of data according to WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness case definitions (as described in the definitions section above).

For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted event rates (n of N, %). For continuous outcomes, we extracted mean/SD or median/interquartile range. We extracted both unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes, as well as both intention-to-treat and per-protocol outcomes as reported.

### Fulminant invasive pulmonary aspergillosis after a near-drowning accident in an immunocompetent patient [^116163rb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on invasive aspergillosis infection in an immunocompetent adult after a near-drowning event, which allowed this pathogen to easily gain access to the human respiratory system and result in rapid, severe infection.

Case Summary

A 51-year-old female developed severe pneumonia after a near-drowning accident. Two days after admission, a bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. After a 30-day hospital course, multiple antifungals, and various routes of administration, the patient expired.

Discussion:

Pneumonia is particularly common because of the aspiration of contaminated water. Whereas pneumococci, staphylococci, and Gram-negative bacteria are all common pathogens for this type of infection, fungi such as Aspergillus spp can also be involved and may be life threatening. Typically, these cases are reported in individuals with an immunodeficiency such as from receipt of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, or lung transplants. Despite initiation of an appropriate empirical antifungal regimen, the rapid recovery of A fumigatus from pulmonary alveolar lavage and BAL samples as well as extremely elevated levels of galactomannan and (1→3)-β-D glucan may have indicated an invasive fungal infection (IFI).

Conclusion:

IFIs are uncommon in immunocompetent adults, but in the event of a near-drowning accident, environmental fungi can gain access to the human respiratory system and result in rapid, severe infection. Based on this case and the others described, it appears that near-drowning patients need an early initial evaluation for IFI.

Drowning — emergency department observation and discharge: One study derived and validated a clinical score to assist in determining which patients may be safely discharged after 8 h of ED (emergency department) observation and found that the presence of 4 or more of normal mentation, normal respiratory rate, absence of dyspnea, absence of need for airway support, and absence of hypoxemia predicted safe discharge. Recommendation: After an ED observation period of 4 to 6 h, we suggest it is reasonable to discharge a drowning patient with normal mental status in whom respiratory function is normalized and no further deterioration in respiratory function has been observed. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Lower-risk BRUE — chest radiography: Clinicians should not obtain a chest radiograph in infants presenting with a lower-risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate Recommendation). Infectious processes can precipitate apnea, and in 1 ALTE study, more than 80% of these infections involved the respiratory tract. Davies and Gupta reported that 9 of 65 infants who had ALTEs had abnormalities on chest radiography despite no suspected respiratory disorder on clinical history or physical examination, and some of the radiographs were performed up to 24 hours after presentation. Davies and Gupta further reported that 33% of infants with ALTEs that were ultimately associated with a respiratory disease had a normal initial respiratory examination. Patel et al reported that 2 of 176 infants discharged after admission for ALTE died within 2 weeks, both of pneumonia. Careful follow-up within 24 hours is important in infants with a nonfocal clinical history and physical examination to identify those who will ultimately have a lower respiratory tract infection diagnosed.

### Prevention and treatment of drowning [^111mYSiU]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly 4,000 drowning deaths occur annually in the United States, with drowning representing the most common injury-related cause of death in children one to four years of age. Drowning is a process that runs the spectrum from brief entry of liquid into the airways with subsequent clearance and only minor temporary injury, to the prolonged presence of fluid in the lungs leading to lung dysfunction, hypoxia, neurologic and cardiac abnormalities, and death. The World Health Organization has defined drowning as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid". Terms such as near, wet, dry, passive, active, secondary, and silent drowning should no longer be used because they are confusing and hinder proper categorization and management. The American Heart Association's Revised Utstein Drowning Form and treatment guidelines are important in guiding care, disposition, and prognosis. Prompt resuscitation at the scene after a shorter duration of submersion is associated with better outcomes. Because cardiac arrhythmias due to drowning are almost exclusively caused by hypoxia, the resuscitation order prioritizes airway and breathing before compressions. Prevention remains the best treatment. Education, swimming and water safety lessons, and proper pool fencing are the interventions with the highest level of current evidence, especially in children two to four years of age. Alcohol use during water activities dramatically increases the risk of drowning; therefore, abstinence is recommended for all participants and supervisors.

Antibiotics in drowning management — empiric use and diagnostic guidance: There is no evidence to support empiric antibiotic therapy in the initial treatment of drowning patients; after initial resuscitation, if pneumonia is present, treatment should be guided by expectorated sputum or endotracheal aspirate bacterial culture, blood cultures, or urinary antigen tests; in the absence of these tests, decision to treat should be based on clinical examination focusing on physical evidence of pulmonary or systemic infection. Recommendation Grade: 1A.

Drowning — cessation of rescue and resuscitation: Based primarily on retrospective studies, submersion times of > 10 min appear to correlate with increased mortality or survival with severe neurologic dysfunction. Based on resources, it might be reasonable to cease rescue and resuscitation efforts when there is a known submersion time of greater than 30 min in water > 6°C (43°F), or greater than 90 min in water < 6°C (43°F), or after 25 min of continuous cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If at any point during search and rescue efforts the safety of the rescue team becomes threatened, rescue efforts should be ceased, and if resources are available and recovery team safety is maintained, body recovery efforts may continue beyond the search and rescue period with the understanding that resuscitation attempts will likely be futile. Recommendation Grade: 1C.

### Necrotising pneumonia caused by non-PVLwith 2-year follow-up [^115yNbHY]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Necrotising pneumonia (NP) is a rare but life-threatening complication of pulmonary infection. It is characterised by progressive necrosis of lung parenchyma with cavitating foci evident upon radiological investigation. This article reports the case of a 52-year-old woman, immunocompetent healthcare professional presenting to Accident and Emergency with NP and Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia. The cavitating lesion was not identified on initial chest X-ray leading to a delay in antimicrobial optimisation. However, the patient went on to achieve a full symptomatic recovery in 1month and complete radiological recovery at 2-year follow-up. Long-term prognosis for adult cases of NP currently remains undocumented. This case serves as the first piece of published evidence documenting full physiological and radiological recovery following appropriate treatment of NP in an immunocompetent adult patient.

Terminology — drowning definitions and modifiers are clarified: Drowning is defined as "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment due to submersion or immersion in liquid", and the standard definition "allows for only 3 outcomes after drowning: nonfatal drowning (with or without morbidity) and fatal drowning". For clarity of use, "Immersion refers to a situation in which the airway is above water, whereas "submersion" refers to a situation in which the airway is underwater", with immersion in cold water potentially leading to hypothermia and "submersion at any water temperature may lead to drowning". The guideline states "The following modifiers should not be used in association with drowning: near, wet, dry, active, passive, saltwater, freshwater, or secondary", because "none of these modifiers is valid because the final common pathway is hypoxemia and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest".

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^117FD4gs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Initial resuscitation and airway prioritization in drowning — Because of the central role of hypoxemia in the pathophysiology of drowning, initial resuscitation should focus on establishing and maintaining a patent airway and providing oxygen at the highest concentration available, which may include positive pressure ventilations. Compression-only CPR is likely to be of little to no benefit in drowning resuscitation, and its use should be limited to bystanders not trained to provide full (rescue breath and compression) CPR; bystander CPR for infants and children includes compressions and ventilations, regardless of which is started first. Professional rescuer CPR should emphasize prioritization of airway and breathing with positive pressure ventilation before initiation of chest compressions, because if the airway is overlooked in initial resuscitation, ongoing hypoxemia leads to decreased survival and worse neurologic outcomes. Incorrect administration of rescue breaths can delay care and cause gastric insufflation and pulmonary aspiration. For persons who are not trained, able, and/or willing to give rescue breaths, compression-only CPR is still the recommended method of resuscitation, and all persons who might respond to a drowning person (eg, parents, trip leaders, lifeguards) should take CPR classes that include training on the proper use of chest compressions and rescue breathing.

### Guidelines for the use of chest radiographs in community-acquired pneumonia in children and adolescents [^115X2yui]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood community-acquired pneumonia in context

Globally there are 155 million cases of childhood pneumonia annually, and pneumonia results in the death of 2 million children younger than 5 years every year (20% of all deaths in this age group), making it the biggest single cause of childhood death. In the United Kingdom the annual incidence of attendance to hospital for pneumonia is 14.4 per 10,000 in children ages 0–16 years, and 33.8 per 10,000 for those ages < 5 years, with admission rates just slightly lower. In the developing world, one South African study indicated a pneumonia incidence of 0.27 episodes per child-year and a case–fatality ratio of 1% for cases admitted to a hospital.

The definition of community-acquired pneumonia in children is almost identical in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that has been acquired outside of the hospital". According to the British Thoracic Society it is "the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (such as fever of > 38.5°C, cough and respiratory distress) in a previously healthy child, due to an infection which has been acquired outside the hospital".

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^113WsawG]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drowning is a cause of significant global mortality. The mechanism of injury involves inhalation of water, lung injury and hypoxia. This systematic review addressed the following question: In drowning patients with lung injury, what is the evidence from primary studies regarding treatment strategies and subsequent patient outcomes?

Methods

The search strategy utilised PRISMA guidelines. Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS. There were no restrictions on publication date or age of participants. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology.

Results

Forty-one papers were included. The quality of evidence was very low. Seventeen papers addressed the lung injury of drowning in their research question and 24 had less specific research questions, however included relevant outcome data. There were 21 studies regarding extra-corporeal life support, 14 papers covering the theme of ventilation strategies, 14 addressed antibiotic use, seven papers addressed steroid use and five studies investigating diuretic use. There were no clinical trials. One retrospective comparison of therapeutic strategies was found. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations as to best practice when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient. Mechanical ventilation is associated with barotrauma in drowning patients, but the evidence predates the practice of lung protective ventilation. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding adjuvant therapies.

Conclusions

Treating the lung injury of drowning has a limited evidentiary basis. There is an urgent need for comparative studies of therapeutic strategies in drowning.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

Swimming ability — there is considerable debate regarding the definition of "swimming" or "survival-swimming" and what constitutes the most protective approach to swim instruction, and the most recent review by the American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges a lack of evidence surrounding pediatric swimming lessons and so does not formally recommend for or against lessons for children under age 4 y. In addition, unique aquatic environments, such as whitewater, should be approached only after focused instruction on swimming techniques specific to that environment. For the purpose of drowning prevention, the distance of 25 m (82 ft) has been adopted by international lifesaving agencies and a large population-based study in Bangladesh, and All persons who participate in activities conducted in or around water should have, at a minimum, enough experience and physical capability to maintain their head above water, tread water, and make forward progress for a distance of 25 m (82 ft). Recommendation Grade: 2C.

### 6-year-old male drowning complicated by cardiac arrest and ensuing metabolic and respiratory acidosis: should presence of pulses lead clinicians to pursue prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation? [^117BiUZq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Drowning is one of the leading causes of death in the pediatric population. Patients arriving to the emergency department (ED) with submersion injuries are often asymptomatic and well-appearing, but can sometimes present critically ill and require prolonged resuscitation. The question of how long to continue resuscitation of a pediatric patient with a submersion injury is a difficult question to answer.

Case Report

We present a case of 6-year-old boy was found by his friends submerged in sea water for 10–15 min. The patient was rescued by lifeguards and evaluated by emergency medical personnel, who found him breathing spontaneously but unresponsive. En route to hospital, the patient became apneic, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started, and the patient was intubated. The patient arrived to the ED in cardiopulmonary arrest, CPR was continued and epinephrine was administered. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after 42 min in the ED. Initial laboratory test results showed severe acidosis and chest x-ray study showed diffuse interstitial edema. Ventilator settings were adjusted in accordance with lung protective ventilation strategies and the acidosis began to improve. Over the next several days, the patient was weaned to noninvasive ventilation modalities and eventually made a complete neurologic recovery and continued to be a straight-A student. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?We make the case that, in select drowning patients, duration of CPR longer than 30 min can potentially result in favorable neurologic outcomes. Prolonged CPR should be especially strongly considered in patients with a pulse at any point during evaluation. With the combination of prolonged CPR and judicious use of lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies, we were able to successfully treat the patient in our case.

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^116spww7]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Drowning is a major cause of preventable death and morbidity worldwide. There are over 295,000 unintentional drowning deaths (excluding boating) per year. Ninety percent of these deaths occur in middle- and low-income countries, and half the fatalities are aged less than 25 years. Despite the modern medical literature on drowning reaching back at least as far as The Lancet in 1878, there have only recently been efforts to standardise definitions and data collection for drowning research. The majority of the published studies focus on three themes — preventative strategies such as secure pool fencing, high-risk groups such as children and factors determining clinical outcome, especially duration of immersion.

The mechanism of drowning involves aspiration of water into the lung which damages surfactant, disrupts the alveolar capillary membrane and leads to the development of alveolar oedema, resulting in a local acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like syndrome. A high proportion of drowning patients are hypoxic and have a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 300 mm Hg. Treating this lung injury and reversing the hypoxia are the cornerstone of the management of drowning.

However, current ventilation guidelines for drowning patients are adapted from ARDS and as such may not reflect the needs of the drowned patient. The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence to guide the clinician in the treatment of the lung injury and respiratory distress associated with drowning.

Results

There were 41 studies which met the inclusion criteria. The summary table of included studies is detailed in Additional file 3. They included data on patients from 20 countries with the USA and France most frequently represented. Patient data were reported on 1973 patients. Patient demographics were incomplete with regards to gender in eleven papers. Data presented included 1093 (55.4%) males and 545 (27.6%) females and were similarly incomplete with regards to age groups in seven papers, with a minimum of 675 (34.5%) children included. Studies were predominately (30/41, 73.2%) from intensive (critical) care units, 6/41 (14.6%) from inpatient units and five (12.2%) studies were based in the Emergency Department. Three studies utilised the Utstein Style for drowning.

A total of 17 papers were identified where the lung injury of drowning was the focus of the research question. Twenty-four papers where the lung injury of drowning was not the focus of the research question that nevertheless included information relevant to the review were included. All were case series other than one retrospective cohort study and two multicentre registry studies. The GRADE level was universally (41/41, 100%) rated as very low.

Mortality was reported in all papers. There was considerable overlap amongst treatment groups and reported outcomes frequently included multiple treatment groups. Insufficient studies were free of these issues to allow meta-analysis. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was the most common theme (21 articles) followed by ventilatory strategies (14 articles), the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent aspiration or early onset post-drowning pneumonia (14 articles), the use of corticosteroids (7 articles) and the use of diuretics (5 articles). A summary of the aims, the population studied, the study setting, treatment strategies, methodology, results and GRADE level of the selected studies is included in Additional file 3.

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^116o4maU]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is often used when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient. Other indications include decreased conscious state or cardiac arrest. Complications of MV include the development of pneumonia and barotrauma. The reported frequency of barotrauma is high, with an incidence of 75%, 12% and 10%, respectively. Since these earlier papers, MV strategies have evolved into the practice termed lung protective ventilation (LPV), which decreases ventilator-associated lung injury, and this practice is currently advocated for the treatment of drowning patients. Michelet et al. reports using LPV in 30 drowning patients with no barotrauma reported. Unfortunately, barotrauma was not identified as an outcome of interest in the paper. Duration of mechanical ventilation has not changed greatly. A study of 25 patients reported a mean duration of MV of 4.3 days in 1982, but data from two recent papers demonstrate a mean (SD) duration of 6 (± 12) days (n = 70).

Other outcomes reported for MV typically include survival and neurological status. Given the co-existence of hypoxic encephalopathy in many of these patients, it is impossible to comment on the success or otherwise of mechanical ventilation in aiding survival (Table 2).

Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Introduction — scope and definitions clarify intended users and roles: these guidelines are designed primarily for health care professionals, trained rescuers, and untrained lay rescuers resuscitating adults and children who have drowned. A "trained rescuer" is defined as an individual with appropriate training to perform the task discussed in a given recommendation, and this is independent of the individual's occupation or ethical duty to respond; trained rescuers must have the appropriate expertise and training necessary for that specific resuscitation task and have access to the equipment necessary to perform the specific skill. An "untrained lay rescuer" is an individual who lacks the expertise to safely perform a specific resuscitation task, and examples clarify that a health care professional who has training in basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) would be expected to deliver chest compressions with rescue breathing, whereas a health care professional who is not skilled at water rescue would be considered untrained for in‑water rescue breathing. In‑water rescue is typically not learned by health care professionals but is common to most aquatic first responder training. A World Health Organization definition is provided: drowning is "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid", with outcomes classified as fatal drowning (death) or nonfatal drowning (morbidity or no morbidity).

Drowning terminology and definitions — The standard definition for drowning is "the process of experiencing respiratory impairment due to submersion or immersion in liquid", and the standard definition allows for only 3 outcomes after drowning: 1) morbidity; 2) no morbidity; and 3) mortality. Respiratory impairment occurs as the person's airway goes below the surface of the liquid (submersion) or water splashes over the face (immersion), and immersion refers to situations in which airways are above water whereas submersion refers to situations in which airways are under water. Thus immersion (in cold water) may lead to hypothermia, and submersion at any water temperature may lead to drowning. The following modifiers should not be used in association with drowning: near, wet, dry, active, passive, saltwater, freshwater, or secondary, because sufficient data related to human drowning pathophysiology show that none of these modifiers is valid as the final common pathway is hypoxemia and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest.

In-water resuscitation (IWR) — definition, feasibility, and use conditions: For these guidelines, in-water resuscitation (IWR) is defined as an attempt to provide ventilations to a drowning patient who is still in the water, and it is impossible to perform adequate chest compressions while the victim and rescuer are in the water, and so they should not be attempted. Available outcome data for IWR are based on a single retrospective analysis of lifeguard rescues in Brazil and show significant improvement in survival and neurologic outcome in persons receiving IWR, though subsequent manikin studies found that IWR increases overall rescue time, subjective rescue difficulty, number of submersions, and water aspiration; a single study comparing lifeguards to lay rescuers found improved rescue times and decreased estimated pulmonary aspiration with lifeguards. Consensus statements from the International Lifesaving Federation, United States Lifesaving Association, American Red Cross, and the Young Men's Christian Association recommend IWR by trained rescuers when a patient is rescued in shallow water or in deep water when a flotation device is present.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) use in drowning — NIPPV may be used in the alert drowning patient with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, and caution should be taken with any patient displaying altered mental status and/or active emesis owing to the potential for aspiration (Recommendation Grade: 2C). Caution should be used with NIPPV in the drowning patient with altered mental status because there may be increased risk of vomiting and aspiration, and one small retrospective study showed similar neurologic outcomes and correction of hypoxemia and acidosis versus early endotracheal intubation, with lower infection and decreased hospital and intensive care unit length of stay in the NIPPV group.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — lower-risk infants: "Clinicians Should Not Obtain a Chest Radiograph To Assess for Pulmonary Infection in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate Recommendation)". It states, "Chest radiography is unlikely to yield clinical benefit in a well-appearing infant presenting with a lower-risk BRUE" and "In the absence of abnormal respiratory findings (eg, cough, tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, auscultatory changes), lower respiratory tract infection is unlikely to be present". Supporting data include "in a follow-up of 176 children admitted for an ALTE, reported that 2 infants died within 2 weeks of discharge and both were found to have pneumonia on postmortem examination. This observation does not support the potential indication for an initial radiograph", and "reported 14 cases of pneumonia identified at presentation in their analysis of 95 cases of ALTEs. However, in 13 of the patients" there were signs of lower respiratory infection leading to radiography; evidence grading shows "Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B" and "Strength Moderate recommendation".

### Organising pneumonia after near-drowning [^113T2seR]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 38 year-old female with no significant medical history was transferred to a medical centre in Hawaii after near-drowning at the beach. She was noted to have increasing shortness of breath. Subsequently she was placed on non-invasive ventilation and then intubated for respiratory support. She was thought to have early stage acute respiratory distress syndrome after sea water aspiration. By multidisciplinary treatment, she was able to be extubated successfully on hospital day 5, and then flew back to Japan. When visiting our hospital in Japan, further examinations were conducted for prolonged respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates by CT. A specimen obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy revealed organising pneumonia which was thought to be related to sea water aspiration. Methylprednisolone treatment resolved her respiratory symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates.

### Treatment of the lung injury of drowning: a systematic review [^1134kwfM]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The key finding from this review is the lack of evidence informing the treatment of the lung injuries associated with drowning. There was a single retrospective comparison of treatments. This is in stark contrast to eight included studies that compare outcomes of drownings between fresh and salt water.

In 1973, it was reported that the lung injury associated with drowning was rapidly reversible with the application of positive pressure mechanical ventilation. Following this, several studies reported a high incidence of barotrauma when treating drowning with MV. Subsequently, the similarities between the lung injury in drowning and ARDS have been established. Randomised trials have established the safety and efficacy of LPV in ARDS, and it has been adopted as best practice in the management of the lung injury associated with drowning. This may explain the decrease in reported barotrauma associated with MV in recent studies; however, it was not documented as a measured outcome.

The use of NIV in drowning was first reported in 1982; however, it has only been recently that any substantive evidence has been presented regarding the efficacy of NIV in the drowning patient. When compared with MV for the treatment of drowning patients, NIV is similarly effective as MV in reversing hypoxia but is required for a significantly shorter duration (1.4 ± 2.4 vs 6 ± 12 days, P = 0.004). This has to be interpreted with caution given different indications for both treatments, but a recent study also established the efficacy and safety of NIV in mild to moderate ARDS.

Oxygen therapy using HFNP has been adopted widely from the treatment of bronchiolitis to many other causes of respiratory insufficiency in children and adult patients. There is a single report of its use in drowning. There is, however, such a lack of evidence that we can only recommend clinical judgement be applied when deciding on therapeutic strategies when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient.

Aspiration pneumonia anaerobic coverage — hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): we suggest not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for suspected aspiration pneumonia unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); some have estimated that 5% to 15% of pneumonia hospitalizations are associated with aspiration, and patients who aspirate gastric contents are considered to have aspiration pneumonitis, with many having resolution of symptoms within 24 to 48 hours and requiring only supportive treatment, without antibiotics; rates are higher in populations admitted from nursing homes or extended care facilities, and several studies of acute aspiration events in hospitalized patients have suggested that anaerobic bacteria do not play a major role in etiology.

Drowning — pediatric considerations and resuscitation pearls note that drowning is a common cause of death in children and that risk factors include male gender, age less than 14 years old, alcohol use, lack of supervision, and risky behavior. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure the patient is rapidly accessed and removed from the water. Initiation of in-water ventilations may increase survival, and in-water chest compressions are futile. The European Resuscitation Council recommends five initial breaths be provided to the drowning victim. The initial ventilations may be more difficult to achieve as water in the airways may impede alveolar expansion. If cardiac arrest after 5 rescue breaths, refer to Cardiac Arrest Guideline.

Drowning — emergency department disposition and safe discharge after observation: Follow-up phone interviews with 33 patients who were either released on the scene or discharged from the emergency department (ED) within 1 to 6 h of arrival found that none of these patients experienced delayed effects. In a retrospective review of 48 pediatric drowning patients who presented to a single ED with Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥ 13, initial chest radiograph did not correlate with severity of disease, and all patients who deteriorated did so within 4 h of ED arrival; the authors concluded that patients could be safely discharged home if normalized and if there was no deterioration in respiratory function after 4 to 6 h of observation in the ED. A retrospective review of hospitalized pediatric patients found that among initially asymptomatic patients who later developed symptoms, these developed within 4.5 h in all but 1 patient and within 7 h in the final patient. One study derived and validated a clinical score to assist in determining which patients may be safely discharged after 8 h of ED observation, finding that the presence of 4 or more of the following predicted safe discharge: normal mentation, normal respiratory rate, absence of dyspnea, absence of need for airway support, and absence of hypotension. Recommendation: After an observation period of 4 to 6 h, it is reasonable to discharge a drowning patient with normal mental status in whom respiratory function is normalized and no further deterioration in respiratory function has been observed. Recommendation Grade: 2C.

### Evaluation and monitoring of a child with hydrocarbon pneumonitis using point-of-care lung ultrasound in the pediatric emergency department [^117CMhhK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

A well-appearing 3-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department 2 hours after a presumed hydrocarbon ingestion. He was referred to the emergency department by his pediatrician after consultation with the local poison control center after possibly ingesting ylang ylang (Cananga odorata) fragrance oil. The child was asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. Point-of-care lung ultrasound identified focal hydrocarbon pneumonitis in the right lung and demonstrated resolution of these findings. Utilization of point-of-care ultrasound resulted in a shorter emergency department length of stay and the avoidance of radiation exposure from serial chest x-rays.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — antibiotics: Although microorganisms present in aspirated water may eventually cause pneumonia, no study to date has shown benefit from empiric administration of antibiotics in drowning patients, and microorganisms found in drowning-associated pneumonia are atypical bacteria or fungi and often are resistant to standard empiric treatments. Aspiration of even small volumes of water can produce radiographic abnormalities that can mimic pneumonia, and trauma, hypoxemia, and airway irritation can cause leukocytosis and fever, complicating differentiation from infection. We do not recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in the initial treatment of drowning patients; after initial resuscitation, if pneumonia is present, treatment should be guided by bacterial culture or antigen testing, and in the absence of these tests the decision to start should be based on clinical examination for physical evidence of infection. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Pediatric acute lung injury [^1145DzdL]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Among ventilated children, the incidence of acute lung injury (ALI) was 9%; of that latter group 80% developed the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The population-based prevalence of pediatric ARDS was 5.5 cases/100.000 inhabitants. Underlying diseases in children were septic shock (34%), respiratory syncytial virus infections (16%), bacterial pneumonia (15%), near-drowning 9%, and others. Mortality ranged from 18% to 27% for ALI (including ALI-non ARDS and ARDS) and from 29% to 50% for ARDS. Mortality was only 3%-11% in children with ALI-non ARDS. As risk factors, oxygenation indices and multi-organ failure have been identified. New insights into the pathophysiology (for example the interplay between intraalveolar coagulation/fibrinolysis and inflammation and the genetic polymorphism for the angiotensin-converting enzyme) offer new therapeutic options. Lung protective mechanical ventilation with optimal lung recruitment is the mainstay of supportive therapy. New therapeutic modalities refer to corticosteroid and surfactant treatment. Well-designed follow up studies are needed.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in drowning — NIPPV has been used successfully in the out-of-hospital setting with case reports in drowning, but it can only be used in spontaneously breathing patients and should be used with caution in drowning patients with altered mental status because there may be an increased risk of vomiting and aspiration; drowning patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia being treated in out-of-hospital and emergency medical settings using NIPPV might benefit from this therapy.
