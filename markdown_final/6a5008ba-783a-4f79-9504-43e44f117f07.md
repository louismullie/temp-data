## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about potential causes of 6 days of fluctuating high fever to 103.9°F, coughing fits, and diarrhea in a 7-year-old boy, with the fever usually responding to Tylenol/ibuprofen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and the illness time course. Then, I should prioritize a differential by pretest probability and epidemiology. Next, I will specify immediate and secondary diagnostics. After that, I will outline management pathways tailored to the leading diagnoses. Finally, I will verify antipyretic dosing and monitoring, correct any internal inconsistencies, and call out red flags and escalation triggers with appropriate citations.

> Let me first synthesize the presentation to anchor the pretest probabilities: a previously healthy 7-year-old with 6 days of high, antipyretic-responsive fever, paroxysmal cough, and diarrhea suggests a systemic infectious process spanning respiratory and gastrointestinal involvement rather than a focal bacterial source, and the 6-day duration edges beyond many self-limited viral upper respiratory infections, raising influenza, atypical bacterial infection, enteric fever if epidemiologically plausible, and COVID-19 as leading considerations, while I should remain open to error and be ready to self-correct if new data contradict this frame [^114enpVx] [^111tdbZg] [^111231ZL] [^112n5aQW].

> I will now examine influenza as the top probability given the combination of sudden fever, cough, systemic symptoms, and the not-infrequent gastrointestinal manifestations in children, with typical infectiousness for roughly a week aligning with a 6-day course and the availability of rapid testing to increase diagnostic certainty, and I should check for seasonal circulation and sick contacts to further raise or lower suspicion [^114enpVx] [^112n5aQW] [^1168v6nX].

> Next, I need to consider enteric fever, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without epidemiology; typhoid or paratyphoid typically shows a gradual fever rise to 39–40°C by the end of week one, abdominal symptoms including diarrhea, and sometimes cough, making it a credible alternative if there is travel to or exposure from endemic regions or high-risk food and water sources, so I should confirm travel, exposure, and incubation timing before proceeding down this path [^111tdbZg].

> Let me consider Mycoplasma pneumoniae as an atypical respiratory pathogen causing persistent fever with cough that can be protracted and is sometimes associated with extrapulmonary features, recognizing that gastrointestinal symptoms are less classic and that imaging may demonstrate patchy or interstitial changes; I should confirm that cough is the dominant symptom and use PCR or serology when the clinical picture supports it [^notfound].

> I should also keep COVID-19 on the list because children can present with fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, and testing should be guided by community prevalence and exposure risk; wait, I should verify that my lab expectations are realistic and based on available data, using routine markers judiciously to assess severity rather than to make the diagnosis itself [^111231ZL] [^115bgME1] [^114Z1RPs].

> PFAPA enters the broader differential for pediatric periodic fever with gastrointestinal and pharyngeal features, but I need to check periodicity and recurrence because a single nonrecurrent 6-day febrile illness without stereotyped episodes would be atypical for PFAPA, especially if aphthae and adenitis are absent on exam, so I will deprioritize it while remaining alert for recurrence patterns [^113g28VJ] [^116ppWeG].

> Bacterial pneumonia with systemic symptoms is possible, yet the coexistence of prominent diarrhea and the paroxysmal quality of cough steers me toward viral or atypical etiologies; still, with persistent fever beyond 5 days and significant cough, I should not miss occult pneumonia, and a chest radiograph becomes reasonable if respiratory findings, hypoxia, or clinical deterioration emerge, although I must acknowledge that the referenced ACEP febrile policy is aimed at younger children and not directly applicable to a 7-year-old, which means I should apply these principles contextually rather than literally [^114MPr7w] [^112R1AoS].

> Now, I will exclude or de-emphasize less likely conditions: group A streptococcal pharyngitis is less compelling here given the diarrhea and cough, which are not classic features, and although IDSA guidance focuses on testing indications by age and risk, this clinical phenotype limits pretest probability; viral gastroenteritis alone does not fit severe cough; tuberculosis would more often present with a chronic course; melioidosis requires specific environmental exposure such as contaminated water in endemic regions, so I should verify environmental history before entertaining it [^111vEpTV] [^114oTdcC] [^114MPr7w] [^111drUUN].

> For immediate diagnostics on day 6, I should confirm or refute influenza and COVID-19 with rapid molecular testing given availability and pretest probability, and obtain a focused CBC and inflammatory markers to gauge severity and complications, while reassessing hydration status, respiratory effort, and perfusion at the bedside to decide on further imaging or observation, and I need to ensure that positive or negative results are interpreted in the context of timing and local circulation [^114enpVx] [^112n5aQW] [^111231ZL] [^114Z1RPs].

> If initial tests are negative or the child deteriorates, I should double-check the lungs with a chest radiograph for pneumonia or atypical patterns, consider Mycoplasma PCR or serology if the cough predominates with influenza and COVID-19 excluded, obtain blood cultures if the history raises concern for enteric fever, and send stool testing if diarrhea is severe or persistent; hold on, I initially thought about routine urinalysis from a febrile policy, but I should verify applicability because the ACEP guidance specifically targets 2 months to 2 years, so in a 7-year-old I will reserve urinalysis for urinary symptoms or lack of another source rather than apply the infant algorithm indiscriminately [^114MPr7w] [^111tdbZg] [^112R1AoS].

> If influenza is confirmed, supportive care is the mainstay with antipyretics and hydration, and antiviral therapy such as oseltamivir has greatest evidence when started within approximately 48 hours of symptom onset, though I should acknowledge that the label trials were in adults and initiation windows varied up to roughly 40 hours, so for a child presenting at day 6 I will individualize based on severity and risk, ensuring families understand the expected course and warning signs [^114rvsRR] [^115vHiqY].

> If enteric fever is suspected based on exposure and clinical picture, I should obtain blood cultures before antibiotics and initiate guideline-concordant empiric therapy aligned with local resistance patterns, ensuring supportive care for diarrhea and careful monitoring for complications, and I need to re-evaluate therapy when culture and susceptibility results return to narrow appropriately [^111tdbZg].

> If Mycoplasma is diagnosed or strongly suspected, I should confirm that the clinical trajectory matches atypical pneumonia and consider macrolide therapy as commonly used in practice for pediatric M. pneumoniae, while recognizing that some cases resolve without specific therapy and that diagnosis can prevent unnecessary invasive testing; I should also check for extrapulmonary involvement and follow clinical response closely [^114MPr7w].

> For symptomatic care across scenarios, I should ensure adequate oral rehydration, rest, and antipyretic use with precise dosing; I initially wrote a maximum acetaminophen dose of 100 mg/kg/day based on a rectal dosing SPL, but wait, I should verify route-specific maxima, because FDA SPL for oral acetaminophen lists 10–15 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours with a maximum of 75 mg/kg/day, and IV pediatric dosing has a distinct lower daily maximum, so to avoid dosing errors I will use 10–15 mg/kg orally every 4–6 hours not to exceed 75 mg/kg/day and reserve rectal or IV routes only when clinically indicated with their respective maxima, documenting the route and total daily dose clearly; regarding alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen, evidence suggests improved sustained defervescence versus monotherapy, but I should counsel on complexity and potential dosing errors, using the combination judiciously [^1167qeW9] [^111ZyCGe] [^114NShZC] [^1123bXH4] [^112aUmL6].

> I should confirm red flags that warrant escalation or emergency reassessment, including respiratory distress, persistent hypoxia, signs of sepsis or hemodynamic instability, intractable vomiting with dehydration, altered mental status, or focal neurologic signs, and I need to be ready to broaden evaluation and management if the child becomes unstable, applying the general principle that clinical instability triggers escalation even when initial testing is unrevealing, while acknowledging that some cited policies target infants or special populations and must be adapted thoughtfully to a 7-year-old [^115wo3tK] [^113aPwe3] [^112R1AoS].

> In closing, my prioritized differential is influenza followed by COVID-19 and atypical pneumonia, with enteric fever contingent on epidemiologic risk, and PFAPA or other autoinflammatory syndromes only if a pattern of periodicity emerges; I should double-check test selection and timing, correct for any guideline applicability issues across age groups, and communicate clear return precautions and follow-up plans while integrating laboratory and imaging results into a dynamic, evidence-based care pathway for this child [^114enpVx] [^111231ZL] [^114MPr7w] [^111tdbZg].

The most likely causes for a 7-year-old male with **fluctuating high fever, coughing fits, and diarrhea** persisting for 6 days are **viral infections** (influenza [^114enpVx], COVID-19 [^111231ZL], adenovirus, enterovirus) or **atypical bacterial pneumonia** (Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^114MPr7w], Chlamydia pneumoniae). Consider **bacterial enteritis** (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Yersinia) if diarrhea predominates, and **pertussis** if coughing fits are severe. Less common causes include **tuberculosis** [^117WamrK], **melioidosis** [^111drUUN], **Q fever** [^114RDEA9], and **PFAPA** [^113g28VJ]. Initial workup should include **CBC, CRP/ESR, blood and stool cultures, a respiratory viral panel, chest X-ray, and COVID-19 testing**; if unrevealing, escalate to a broader infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy evaluation [^112h3Wip].

---

## Infectious causes

### Viral infections

- **Influenza virus**: High fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea) are common in pediatric influenza [^112n5aQW].

- **COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)**: Fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, are well-documented in pediatric COVID-19 cases [^115bgME1] [^111231ZL].

- **Adenovirus**: Can cause respiratory symptoms, high fever, and diarrhea in children.

- **Enterovirus**: Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, are common presentations.

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**: Atypical pneumonia presenting with persistent fever, cough, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms [^114MPr7w].

- **Chlamydia pneumoniae**: Similar presentation to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Pertussis (Bordetella pertussis)**: Characterized by severe coughing fits, persistent fever, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Bacterial enteritis**: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Yersinia can cause high fever, diarrhea, and occasionally respiratory symptoms [^111tdbZg] [^111XAjZZ].

---

### Other infectious causes

Other infectious causes include **tuberculosis**, presenting with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms — particularly in endemic areas or in immunocompromised patients [^117WamrK]. **Melioidosis** (Burkholderia pseudomallei) can cause high fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms in endemic regions [^111drUUN]. **Q fever** (Coxiella burnetii) may also present with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^114RDEA9].

---

## Non-infectious causes

### Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions

- **PFAPA syndrome**: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis, and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms [^113g28VJ] [^116ppWeG].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Persistent fever, diarrhea, and occasionally respiratory symptoms [^112h3Wip].

- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and occasionally respiratory symptoms [^115QePFm].

---

### Malignancies

Among malignancies, **leukemia** and **lymphoma** can present with persistent fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, often due to immunosuppression and secondary infections [^112h3Wip] [^116Mo91X].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the broad differential, a **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential, beginning with initial laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, ESR, blood cultures, stool cultures, respiratory viral panel, and COVID-19 testing) and imaging such as chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or other respiratory infections [^115QePFm]. If these are inconclusive, pursue further investigations, including autoimmune screening (ANA, anti-dsDNA), tuberculosis testing (PPD, IGRA), and evaluation for malignancy (bone marrow biopsy, imaging studies) [^112DjDK3] [^117WamrK] [^112h3Wip].

---

## Management considerations

Management includes **supportive care** — antipyretics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen), hydration, and monitoring for complications — plus targeted therapy based on the identified etiology (appropriate antiviral, antibiotic, or immunosuppressive therapy) [^115wo3tK] [^112aUmL6] [^1123bXH4]. Consider hospitalization if the patient becomes clinically unstable, develops complications, or if outpatient management is insufficient [^115wo3tK].

In summary, the most likely causes in a 7-year-old with fluctuating fever, coughing fits, and diarrhea include viral infections (influenza, COVID-19, adenovirus, enterovirus); bacterial infections (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, pertussis, bacterial enteritis); and, less commonly, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (PFAPA, IBD, SLE) or malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma). A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management.

Influenza virus infection can be associated with a variety of symptoms, including runny nose, cough, chills, fever, and cough of acute onset. Other symptoms may include dyspnea, fatigue, a positive rapid influenza test, headache, malaise, and obesity. Additionally, patients may experience diffuse aches, flu-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, vomiting, sneezing, chronic disease, elevated serum CK, diarrhea, and decreased blood lymphocyte count.

The main microbiologic finding was a nasopharyngeal swab positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Since the general clinical conditions of the patient were improving and the fever disappeared 6 days after the admission, we did not prescribe a specific macrolide treatment. We repeated, one month after the beginning of the clinical manifestations in an outpatient setting, a lung ultrasound which was normal.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in children can cause different and noncharacteristic clinical, laboratory, and radiologic manifestations. It is often responsible for self-limited community-acquired pneumonia, but sometimes it is the pathogen of severe low respiratory tract inflammation causing atelectasis and massive lung infiltration. In this article, we report the cases of two children who came to our attention with persistent fever and evidence of basal ipophonesis on respiratory auscultation. In both cases, CT scans showed parenchymal hypoventilation, areas with ground-glass appearance, and centrilobular micronodules, some of which exhibited a tree-in-bud aspect, compatible with the suspicion of tuberculosis. Interestingly, both had severe mediastinal lymph node swelling. In a retrospective audit, we acknowledge the excessive diagnostic procedures (including invasive ones like CT and bronchoalveolar lavage) due to lack of awareness of this possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae localization and the social risk factors for TB.

Pediatric mediastinal lymphadenitis has been rarely reported in literature as a possible radiographic pattern of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Lee et al analyzed the cases.

### Influenza [^114enpVx]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Influenza is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, dry cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also common. The incubation period of influenza, which is the time from infection to the development of symptoms, is 1 to 4 days. Viral shedding, when the virus is infectious, usually occurs from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after.

Influenza can cause severe illness or death, particularly in high-risk populations. Mortality is higher among individuals with complicated influenza, which is defined as an infection that requires hospital admission or an exacerbation of an underlying chronic illness. This is true across all age groups but is highest in infants aged 6 months or younger.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

- **Symptoms of COVID-19**: The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

- **What is Gohibic?**: Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. It is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

As 2020 evolved, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presented the greatest global health crisis in a century, affecting medical, social, and economic systems. Despite challenging society with new ways of living, working, and communicating, its significant clinical, research, and public health impact was admirably managed by clinicians and scientists worldwide against a backdrop of continually evolving evidence. In this update, we review important publications from the American Thoracic Society journals and others that provide insight into pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment advances of COVID-19 disease while also considering broader societal effects. Throughout the update, we use "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)" when referencing the virus and use "COVID-19" in relation to the associated illness.

In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus. This virus has been temporarily named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and the disease it causes has been designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and worldwide.

The purpose of this review is primarily to examine the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, it comments briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the evidence.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^114Z1RPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. The key target condition for this review was COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms), mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest), severe (symptoms include breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia), or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). People with COVID-19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require distinctive patient management, and it is important to be able to identify these patients.

In this review, we focus on COVID-19, without making the distinction between mild to moderate and severe disease.

- **Index tests**: We collated evidence on all routine biomarker tests reported in the identified studies. These can be classified into:
	- Full blood count, haemoglobin, and red blood cells
	- Coagulation markers
	- Liver markers, cardiac markers, and kidney function markers
	- General inflammatory markers
	- Metabolic markers

### From telemedicine to the ICU: Fever and rash in a 9-year-old girl [^112eQ5mZ]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of four days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After ten additional days of documented fever > 38°C, worsening fatigue, and one day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to the clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed a nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next two weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in the clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced a rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with the identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^112R1AoS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infants, specifically pertaining to urine tests, the ACEP 2016 guidelines recommend considering the acquisition of urinalysis and urine cultures to identify urinary tract infections (UTI) in well-appearing infants and pediatric patients aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever (≥ 38.0°C or 100.4°F). This is especially pertinent in cases with a higher risk for UTI, such as females younger than 24 hours, those presenting with a fever of ≥ 39°C, those with a negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and when no obvious source of infection is identified.

### Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the treatment of febrile children: a pilot study [^115nSKA2]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen for treating febrile children is a prevalent practice among physicians and parents, despite the lack of evidence on effectiveness or safety. This randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to compare the antipyretic effectiveness and safety of a single administration of alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen doses to that of ibuprofen monotherapy in febrile children.

- **Methods**: Seventy febrile children were randomly allocated to receive either a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg ibuprofen and 15 mg/kg oral acetaminophen after 4 hours, or a similar dose of ibuprofen and placebo at 4 hours. Rectal temperature was measured at baseline, and at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours later. Endpoints included proportions of afebrile children at 6, 7, and 8 hours, maximum decline in temperature, time to recurrence of fever, and change in temperature from baseline at each time point. Intent-to-treat analysis was planned with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: A higher proportion of subjects in the intervention group (83.3%) became afebrile at 6 hours than in the control group (57.6%); P = 0.018. This difference was accentuated at 7 and 8 hours (P < 0.001) with a significantly longer time to recurrence of fever in the intervention group (mean ± SD of 7.4 ± 1.3 versus 5.7 ± 2.2 hours), P < 0.001. Odds ratios (95% CI) for defervescence were 5.6 (1.3; 23.8), 19.5 (3.5; 108.9), and 15.3 (3.4; 68.3) at 6, 7, and 8 hours, respectively. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures over time revealed a significantly large effect.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111vEpTV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, specifically concerning primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend not testing for GAS pharyngitis in pediatric patients under 3 years of age because acute rheumatic fever is rare in this age group. Additionally, the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and its classic presentation is uncommon. Testing may be considered for selected patients in this age group in the presence of risk factors, such as an older sibling with group A streptococcal infection.

### Neurological complications in two children with Lemierre syndrome [^114JLbXj]. Developmental medicine and child neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Lemierre syndrome is a distinct clinical syndrome comprising oropharyngeal sepsis and fever, internal jugular vein thrombosis and remote septic metastases caused by Fusobacterium species. The mortality rate was historically high and although use of antibiotics led to a dramatic fall in incidence, a resurgence has been seen recently. A 14-year-old male developed Lemierre syndrome after tonsillitis. There was extensive leptomeningitis, especially over the clivus, causing 6th and 12th cranial nerve palsies, a clinical feature termed the 'clival syndrome'. He also developed an epidural abscess in the cervical spine, which was unsafe for surgical drainage. Conservative treatment with an extended course of antibiotics and anticoagulation for jugular vein thrombosis led to a good recovery. A 15-year-old female developed Lemierre syndrome following a persistent sore throat lasting 7 weeks. She had palsy of the 12th cranial nerve from clival osteomyelitis. She was treated with a 6-week course of antibiotics and anticoagulants leading to almost full recovery at 3-month review. Awareness of the potential neurological complications of Lemierre syndrome and prompt management are crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality in this 'forgotten disease'.

### The COVID-19 pandemic: diverse contexts; different epidemics-how and why [^113ZtAAc]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

It is very exceptional that a new disease becomes a true pandemic. Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread to nearly all countries of the world in only a few months. However, in different countries, the COVID-19 epidemic takes variable shapes and forms in how it affects communities. Until now, the insights gained on COVID-19 have been largely dominated by the COVID-19 epidemics and the lockdowns in China, Europe, and the United States. This variety of global trajectories is little described, analysed, or understood. In only a few months, an enormous amount of scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been uncovered. However, important knowledge gaps remain.

Learning from the variety of ways the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding across the globe can potentially contribute to solving the COVID-19 puzzle. This paper tries to make sense of this variability by exploring the important role that context plays in these different COVID-19 epidemics; by comparing COVID-19 epidemics with other respiratory diseases, including other coronaviruses that circulate continuously; and by highlighting the critical unknowns and uncertainties that remain. These unknowns and uncertainties require a deeper understanding of the variable trajectories of COVID-19. Unravelling them will be important for discerning potential future scenarios, such as the first wave in virgin territories still untouched by COVID-19, and for future waves elsewhere.

### Still new chronic Q fever cases diagnosed 8 years following a large Q fever outbreak [^114RDEA9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic Q fever usually develops within two years after primary infection with Coxiella burnetii. We determined the interval between acute Q fever and diagnosis of chronic infection, assessed what factors contribute to a longer interval, and evaluated the long-term follow-up.

- **Methods**: From 2007 to 2018, patients with chronic Q fever were included from 45 participating hospitals. The interval between acute and chronic infection was calculated in patients with a known day of first symptoms and/or serological confirmation of acute Q fever. Chronic Q fever-related complications and mortality were assessed by two investigators based on predefined criteria.

- **Results**: In total, 313 (60.3%) proven, 81 (15.6%) probable, and 125 (24.1%) possible chronic Q fever patients were identified. The date of acute Q fever was known in 200 patients: in 45 (22.5%), the interval was longer than two years, with the longest observed interval being 9.2 years. Patients in whom serological follow-up was performed after acute Q fever were diagnosed less often after this two-year interval (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.54). Chronic Q fever-related complications occurred in 216 patients (41.6%). Chronic Q fever-related mortality occurred in 83 (26.5%) of proven and 3 (3.7%) of probable chronic Q fever patients.

- **Conclusions**: Chronic Q fever is still being diagnosed and mortality keeps occurring eight years following a large outbreak. Intervals between acute Q fever and diagnosis of chronic infection can reach more than nine years. We urge physicians to perform microbiological testing for chronic Q fever when necessary.

### Synergies between communicable and noncommunicable disease programs to enhance global health security [^1137pBf9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of clinical links between noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases implies that the optimal path to communicable disease control may require consideration of NCDs. The proliferation of NCD risk factors associated with demographic trends in longevity and urbanization can raise a population's baseline susceptibility to infection-related health security risks.

The detrimental effect of uncontrolled NCDs and NCD risk factors on health security concerns can be illustrated by the examples of diabetes and tobacco use. Diabetes has been shown to increase the severity of endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, dengue, and malaria. Diabetes also interferes with tuberculosis treatment, threatening the progress of global tuberculosis control in countries with high rates of both illnesses, such as China and India.

Tobacco smoking, besides playing a primary role in all leading NCDs, is a notable risk factor for the acquisition and accelerated progression of a variety of infectious diseases, including influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia, sexually transmitted diseases, and hospital-acquired infections. Tobacco use is also among the factors facilitating the convergence of infectious and chronic illnesses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and compounds the role of other factors, such as urbanization and displacement, in worsening health outcomes. Urbanization in China and India, in particular, has resulted in large groups of rural migrants who are increasingly affected by lifestyle-associated chronic conditions.

### Pemgarda [^114cruda]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pemgarda is an investigational medicine authorized for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19 in adults and children aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg). It is intended for those who are not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, have not been known to be exposed to someone who is infected, and have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to a medical condition or because they are receiving medicines or treatments that suppress the immune system, rendering them unlikely to have an adequate response to COVID-19 vaccination.

Pemgarda is investigational because it is still under study. There is limited information on its safety and effectiveness for the prevention of COVID-19. The FDA has authorized the emergency use of Pemgarda for pre-exposure prophylaxis under an EUA. For more information on EUA, refer to the "What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?" section at the end of the Fact Sheet.

Pemgarda is not authorized for the following:

- **To treat COVID-19**: It is not authorized for COVID-19 treatment.

- **To prevent COVID-19 after exposure**: Post-exposure prophylaxis is not authorized.

- **For use in children under 12 years of age or weighing less than 88 pounds (40 kg)**: It is not authorized for these demographics.

TAFINLAR administered with trametinib (pediatric): In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.

Withhold TAFINLAR when used as monotherapy, and both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, TAFINLAR, or both TAFINLAR and trametinib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at the same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming TAFINLAR if the patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if the temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023).

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital but then returned to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted.

A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

- **Serious febrile reactions**: Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure can occur when Mekinist is administered with dabrafenib.

- **Mekinist administered with dabrafenib (adult)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in less than 1% of patients.

- **Mekinist administered with dabrafenib (pediatric)**: In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients.

Withhold Mekinist when used as monotherapy, and both Mekinist and dabrafenib when used in combination if the patient's temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### TB or not TB: That is no longer the question [^117WamrK]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a devastating infectious disease and, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant forms, represents a major global threat. Much of our understanding of pathogenic and immunologic mechanisms in TB has derived from studies in experimental animals. However, it is becoming increasingly clear in TB, as well as in other inflammatory diseases, that there are substantial differences in the immunological responses of humans not found or predicted by animal studies. Thus, it is critically important to understand mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunological protection in humans. In this review, we will address the key immunological question: What are the necessary and sufficient immune responses required for protection against TB infection and disease in people — specifically protection against infection, protection against the establishment of latency or persistence, and protection against transitioning from latent infection to active disease?

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) - a call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, the classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis, management, and diagnostic testing over the last three decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

After two months, he was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hypovolemic shock due to sudden vomiting and required non-invasive ventilation. His laboratory results showed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which led to corticosteroid treatment (1g/1.73 m²) for five days, with a good response. At the end of the treatment, he relapsed with new features of HLH and was then treated with anti-IL1. Since then, he has shown no signs of inflammation.

- **Case report**:
	- A 17-year-old female presented with fever, deterioration in general health, and hepatomegaly. She had no medical history. Her blood test showed moderate inflammation with a CRP of 55 mg/L, leukopenia of 2210/mm³, and anemia with Hb 9 g/dL. Her viral markers and antibodies were negative. A PET TDM revealed multiple hypermetabolic lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm, and heterogenous splenic hypermetabolism. An axillary lymph node biopsy revealed numerous histiocytes and macrophages, with a few large immunoblastic cells and early necrosis, indicating a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD). She had normal cardiac and abdominal ultrasounds and a TAP CT. Initially, she was treated with IV antibiotics for a month. Three weeks after the onset of the fever, she showed biological signs of HLH, leading to corticosteroid treatment (1mg/kg) with a good response and early remission. She hasn't relapsed since.

- **Results**:
	- Most studies show that Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is mainly located in the neck, and the outcome is usually good, with frequent resolution.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^116ppWeG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

Results: 207 patients were diagnosed with PFAPA. Of these, 56 patients (27%) had a resolution of periodic fever, 115 (56%) were still active, and 36 patients (17%) were lost to follow-up and could not be contacted. In the resolved fever group, the median time from first contact with the center to the last follow-up was 6.5 years (Q1-Q3: 4.7–8.8) and 3.3 years (Q1-Q3: 2.0–4.4) from the last febrile episode to the last news. The median duration of symptoms was 5.0 years (Q1-Q3: 2.8–8.1), and the median age at the last febrile episode was 8.3 years (Q1-Q3: 5.2–9.9). No correlation was identified between age of onset and duration of symptoms (Spearman r = -0.41, p = 0.002). Tonsillectomy was performed in 8 patients. Of these, 4 had complete resolution of episodes, 3 had temporary remission, and 1 experienced a short period of spacing of the episodes before resuming. Only 2 patients in this group had been treated with colchicine without reported efficacy. Among the 115 patients with persistent fever, we identified 10 patients who were initially considered recovered but relapsed following a median remission period of 32 months (Q1-Q3: 25–39).

We present data from a large cohort of PFAPA patients followed in a reference center for autoinflammatory diseases. In the resolved fever group, the last febrile episode occurs for the great majority before adolescence. The duration of symptoms is variable and does not seem to correlate with the age of onset. The identification of relapses after at least 12 months without a febrile episode raises questions about the definition of recovery. Further investigation is warranted.

### SARS-CoV-2: A comprehensive review from pathogenicity of the virus to clinical consequences [^115X6K6f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, presents a worldwide challenge. The virus is highly contagious, and the clinical consequences are very diverse. It is estimated that if no effective action is taken, COVID-19 could affect 90% of the world's population and result in over 40 million fatalities. Therefore, it is essential to understand the virus's pathogenicity and follow preventive methods to control the high morbidity and mortality rates.

Our knowledge of COVID-19 is still limited, despite the concerted efforts of scientists and clinicians over the last few months. In this review article, we have collected the latest data about the characteristics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic methods of SARS-CoV-2.

### Covid-19: Why does disease severity vary among individuals [^115maGfC]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While all people are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the nature and severity of the disease vary significantly among individuals and populations. Importantly, reported disease burdens and case fatality rates differ considerably from country to country. There are, however, still uncertainties about the severity of the disease among individuals or the reason behind more severe cases in some instances. There is a strong possibility that the severity of this disease depends on a complicated interaction between the host, virus, and environment, leading to different clinical outcomes. The objective of this article is to identify the essential influential factors related to the host, virus, and environment affecting the clinical outcome of COVID-19.

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy.

Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per µL, with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### The pathogenesis of influenza virus infections: The contributions of virus and host factors [^115g7Qd2]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Influenza viruses cause acute respiratory inflammation in humans and symptoms such as high fever, body aches, and fatigue. Usually, these symptoms improve after several days; however, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [influenza A(H1N1) 2009] is more pathogenic than seasonal influenza viruses, and the pathogenicity of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses is even higher. The 1918 influenza pandemic virus caused severe pneumonia, resulting in an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. Several virulence factors have been identified in these virus strains, but host factors are also responsible for the pathogenesis of infections caused by virulent viruses. Here, we review the contributions of both virus and host factors to the pathogenesis of these viral infections.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: A pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^116Mwvu7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old patient with no history of severe infections presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, fever, and acute respiratory insufficiency. Although this clinical condition is usually associated with an acute respiratory infection, a rare primary immunodeficiency was eventually diagnosed. The borderline growth represented the only finding indicative of possible chronicity. Because the respiratory failure did not respond to first-line therapeutic approaches, a detailed pulmonary evaluation was performed, revealing acute diffuse lung parenchymal disease.

While the chest CT pattern can usually narrow the otherwise extensive differential diagnoses, in our case, the lung involvement combined with skin involvement required an extensive workup to exclude a range of diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. The diffuse nodular pattern with hilar lymphadenopathy also warranted an oncologic screening in search of possible malignancy.

Finally, the history of mold and mulch exposure, high levels of specific IgG antibodies against molds, together with the corresponding CT pattern, suggested the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). However, at the initial stage, several aspects were unclear. First, the association of HP with skin lesions was elusive. Second, an ongoing fungal lung infection had to be thoroughly assessed, particularly as the targeted examinations were inconclusive. Third, although the CMV positivity in BAL did not match the short history of symptoms, CMV infection may, in rare cases, present as a diffuse parenchymal pattern on CT.

### Hospitalized children with influenza A before, during and after COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study [^1168v6nX]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The Flu A virus, also known as H1N1 and belonging to the Orthomyxovirus family, exhibits high variability and can be transmitted through the air, droplets, and direct contact, infecting both humans and other animals. Since its initial emergence in the early 20th century, the H1N1 virus has been responsible for several global pandemics. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic resulted in a significant number of deaths worldwide, while the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic marked the first global flu pandemic caused by a swine-origin H1N1 virus. The population at risk for Flu A includes individuals of all age groups, with particular vulnerability observed in children, the elderly, individuals with chronic illnesses, and those with compromised immune systems who are at higher risk of infection and developing severe illness.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in late 2019, swiftly escalated into a global public health crisis with profound implications for the global economy. This pandemic has also influenced the epidemiology of various respiratory viruses worldwide, including the Flu A virus. Between January 2020 and December 2022, the preventive and control measures implemented for COVID-19 effectively curbed the transmission of other respiratory viruses in China, including the flu to some extent. However, by early 2023, with the normalization of population movement and social activities in China, flu activity, predominantly of the H1N1 subtype, experienced a rapid resurgence, leading to an influenza epidemic peak in numerous regions across China.

### The COVID-19 pandemic: diverse contexts; different epidemics-how and why [^1165DWhJ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

It is very exceptional that a new disease becomes a true pandemic. Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread to nearly all countries of the world in only a few months. However, in different countries, the COVID-19 epidemic takes variable shapes and forms in how it affects communities. Until now, the insights gained on COVID-19 have been largely dominated by the COVID-19 epidemics and the lockdowns in China, Europe, and the United States. This variety of global trajectories is little described, analyzed, or understood.

In only a few months, an enormous amount of scientific evidence on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has been uncovered (knowns). However, important knowledge gaps remain (unknowns). Learning from the variety of ways the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding across the globe can potentially contribute to solving the COVID-19 puzzle. This paper tries to make sense of this variability by exploring the important role that context plays in these different COVID-19 epidemics, by comparing COVID-19 epidemics with other respiratory diseases including other coronaviruses that circulate continuously, and by highlighting the critical unknowns and uncertainties that remain. These unknowns and uncertainties require a deeper understanding of the variable trajectories of COVID-19. Unraveling them will be important for discerning potential future scenarios, such as the first wave in virgin territories still untouched by COVID-19 and for future waves elsewhere.

### Acute gastroenteritis due to in an adolescent boy [^111XAjZZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis with persistent vomiting, high fever, and blood-streaked stools often suggests a bacterial etiology in children. The authors report a case of a 13-year-old boy presenting with acute watery diarrhea, persistent vomiting, a fever of 103°F, abdominal cramps, and blood-streaked stools, who did not respond to parenteral third-generation cephalosporin for 72 hours. Stool examination revealed numerous cystic and amoeboid forms of Blastocystis hominis. Metronidazole was administered, and the boy promptly responded within 24 hours. There was no recurrence of symptoms thereafter. This case highlights the crucial role of stool examination in cases of acute diarrheal disease to identify rare etiologies.

- **Prolonged neutropenia**: Extended periods of neutropenia signify a high-risk category.
- **Receiving high-dose corticosteroids**: Usage of high-dose corticosteroids places patients in the high-risk group.
- **Undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation**: This includes patients in the first year after transplantation without evidence of T-cell reconstitution, or those receiving corticosteroids or multiple immunosuppressive agents to prevent or treat GvHD.

### Child melioidosis deaths caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei-contaminated borehole water, Vietnam, 2019 [^111drUUN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In November 2019, the Preventive Health Center of Soc Son district in Vietnam reported the deaths of three children from one family. The first child, a 7-year-old girl, experienced a high fever and abdominal pain on April 6, 2019. Two days later, she was admitted to a local hospital; after one day, she was transferred to St. Paul Hospital in Hanoi, where septic shock was diagnosed. Tragically, she died on April 9, shortly after admission, before any diagnostic tests were performed.

On October 27, 2019, the second child, a 5-year-old boy, presented with a high fever and abdominal pain around the umbilicus. He was admitted to Vietnam National Children's Hospital in Hanoi on October 28, with a diagnosis of septic shock. Although abdominal and chest radiographs and abdominal ultrasound results were unremarkable, his blood culture grew B. pseudomallei, leading to his death on October 31.

The third child, a 13-month-old boy, exhibited a high fever and poor appetite on November 10, 2019. According to his grandparents, he had black stool, similar to his sister and brother. He was admitted to Vietnam National Children's Hospital; although chest radiography results were unremarkable, B. pseudomallei was cultured from his blood sample. He died on November 16.

We retrieved laboratory findings from all hospitals to which these children were admitted. Results showed leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and high procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels in all children's blood. Liver dysfunction was diagnosed in all three children, but kidney dysfunction was recognized only in the two older children. We detected no identifiable risk factors.

A 12-year-old boy presented to the outpatient clinic of Tabarak Allah Rural Hospital in Gedaref State in October 2013 with complaints of fever, chills, headache, dry cough, and vomiting for one week, and with anorexia for the last two days. The patient had no history of visceral leishmaniasis but came from Barbar El Fugara village in the Atbara River area (lat. 13°34′47.7″N, long. 36°18′30.6″E), the most endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis in Sudan. He was enrolled in a clinical study called "Neglected Infectious Diseases Diagnosis" (NIDIAG) and underwent standard history taking, physical examination, and a set of diagnostic tests targeting severe and treatable infectious causes of persistent fever. These included visceral leishmaniasis, malaria, tuberculosis, enteric fever, brucellosis, amebic liver abscess, relapsing fever, rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The NIDIAG project did not interfere with the choice of treatment of the included patients but ensured that essential medicines for the target conditions were present at the study site.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, specifically in terms of primary prevention, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend that diagnostic studies for GAS pharyngitis are not indicated for children under 3 years old. This is because acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is rare in children under 3 years old, and the incidence and classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon in this age group. However, selected children under 3 years who have additional risk factors, such as an older sibling with a GAS infection, may be considered for testing.

### Central cord syndrome in a 7-year-old boy secondary to standing high jump [^1173URDF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute traumatic central cord syndrome is commonly associated with major trauma such as falling and motor vehicle crashes, but minor or nontraumatic causes are very rare in children. Consequently, most physicians frequently overlook children presenting with complaints of arm weakness when there is no history of definite major trauma, especially in the emergency department. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy who was experiencing weakness in both arms following a standing high jump with his head tilted back in school. He had no history of definite trauma and no evidence of bone abnormalities on plain radiography and computed tomography of the cervical spine. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed observable swelling with increased signal intensity at the C1 to C4 levels. This case showed a spinal cord injury caused by a standing high jump with neck extension alone. Therefore, physicians must consider the possibility of spinal cord injury even without any history of major trauma.

### Etiology and resource use of fever of unknown origin in hospitalized children [^112h3Wip]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a well-known pediatric presentation. The primary studies determining the causes of prolonged fever in children were performed four decades ago, before major advances in laboratory and diagnostic testing. Given that the distribution of diagnosed causes of adult FUO has changed in recent decades, we hypothesized that the etiology of FUO in children has concordantly changed and may also be impacted by a definition that includes a shorter required duration of fever.

- **Methods**: A single-center, retrospective review was conducted on patients aged 6 months to 18 years admitted to the North Carolina Children's Hospital from January 1, 2002, to December 21, 2012. These patients had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of fever, documented fever duration of more than 7 days before admission, and each patient's illness had a previous physician evaluation.

- **Results**: A total of 1164 patients were identified, of whom 102 met our inclusion criteria for FUO. Etiologic categories included "infectious" (42 out of 102 patients), "autoimmune" (28 out of 102 patients), "oncologic" (18 out of 102 patients), and "other" or "unknown" (14 out of 102 patients). Several clinical factors were statistically and significantly different between etiologic categories, including fever length, laboratory values, imaging performed, length of stay, and hospital costs.

- **Conclusions**: Unlike adult studies, the categorical distribution of diagnoses for pediatric FUO has marginally shifted compared to previously reported pediatric studies.

### Tamiflu [^114rvsRR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of Tamiflu were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the US, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had a fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (such as cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral Tamiflu or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of the 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received Tamiflu 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who were given a placebo.

In late 2019, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, causing an infectious disease that would later be named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020. This disease quickly spread across the globe, with a very rapid increase in new cases noted in many European countries and the United States between early February and early March 2020. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a global pandemic. As of May 29, 2020, a total of 5,657,529 cases of COVID-19 were registered worldwide, with 356,254 confirmed deaths. In the United States alone, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 28, 2020, was 1,698,523, and 100,446 Americans had died of this disease.

### Pemgarda [^115P5edA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

You may need to receive additional doses of PEMGARDA for ongoing protection from COVID-19, as viruses can change over time (mutate) and develop into slightly different forms, known as variants. Based on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 variants, additional doses of PEMGARDA may be required every 3 months.

- **Who should generally not take PEMGARDA**: Do not take PEMGARDA if you have had a severe allergic reaction to PEMGARDA or any ingredient in it. Refer to the end of this Fact Sheet for a complete list of ingredients in PEMGARDA.

- **What are the important possible side effects of PEMGARDA**: Allergic and infusion-related reactions are common and can sometimes be severe or life-threatening. These reactions can occur during and after your infusion of PEMGARDA. You may have an increased risk of allergic reaction with PEMGARDA if you've previously experienced a severe allergic reaction to a COVID‑19 vaccine. PEMGARDA contains polysorbate 80, an ingredient in some COVID‑19 vaccines, which is similar to polyethylene glycol (PEG), found in other COVID‑19 vaccines. Before administration, your healthcare provider may consult with an allergy and immunology specialist if you have had a serious allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. You will be monitored for allergic reactions during the infusion and for at least 2 hours after receiving PEMGARDA.

### Estimating the burden of total knee replacement in the United States [^112QLAY3]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

In the last decade, the number of total knee replacements performed annually in the United States has doubled, with disproportionate increases among younger adults. While total knee replacement is a highly effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis, recipients can experience persistent pain and severe complications. We are aware of no estimates of the prevalence of total knee replacement among adults in the U.S.

- **Methods**: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated computer simulation model of knee osteoarthritis, along with data on annual total knee replacement utilization, to estimate the prevalence of primary and revision total knee replacement among adults fifty years of age or older in the U.S. We combined these prevalence estimates with U.S. Census data to estimate the number of adults currently living with total knee replacement. The annual incidence of total knee replacement was derived from two longitudinal knee osteoarthritis cohorts and ranged from 1.6% to 11.9% in males and from 2.0% to 10.9% in females.

- **Results**: We estimated that 4.0 million (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.6 million to 4.4 million) adults in the U.S. currently live with a total knee replacement, representing 4.2% (95% CI: 3.7% to 4.6%) of the population fifty years of age or older. The prevalence was higher among females (4.8%) than among males (3.4%) and increased with age. The lifetime risk of primary total knee replacement from the age of twenty-five years was 7.0% (95% CI: 6.1% to 7.8%) for males and 9.5% (95% CI: 8.5% to…

### Bartonella quintana transmission from mite to family with high socioeconomic status [^114X38Bd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Urban trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana has been reported in persons who abuse alcohol and in homeless persons in large cities worldwide. Symptoms vary from asymptomatic intermittent bacteremia to serious complications. Pediculus humanus lice, the known vector of the infection, are not always identified, which raises the possibility that other vectors might also be involved. We report on an outbreak of B. quintana infection among a young family of high socioeconomic status and their visiting relatives.

The family resides in a regional city (population 104,000) in northern Czech Republic, in an old, renovated apartment located on the top floor, just under the roof. In the summer of 2007, hundreds of ectoparasitic mites migrated from a hole in the roof and settled on the inner side of a permanently open window before infesting family members. Two weeks later (day 1 of symptom onset), a papular rash and pruritic vesicular lesions were noted by the parents on the body and legs of their two children, a 1-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy. On day 3, the girl's body temperature rose to 38.0°C, and the boy's temperature rose to 39.5°C. The rash resolved in approximately 10 days in both children. Vesicular lesions on the girl's buccal mucosal membrane resolved in 5 days. Excoriated areas resulting from spontaneous rupture of lesions or scratching were still visible on day 14.

On day 4, a fever (temperature, 38.5°C) and intense tibialgia, which persisted for 5 days, developed in the 33-year-old father of the infected children. On day 5, a vesicular rash, which resolved in…

In total, 704 (36.6%) participants were immediately admitted to the hospital, particularly in Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At inclusion, antibiotics were prescribed to more than 70% of patients with persistent fever, except in the DRC where about half received antimalarials. For 475 (24.7%) participants, data on the final assessment at 12 weeks post-inclusion were incomplete. In almost all these cases, data on the 4-week follow-up visit were also missing. Sixty-three patients died, corresponding to 3.3% of the whole cohort or 4.4% (63/1447) of those participants for whom outcome data were complete. This proportion was particularly high in Cambodia (42/305, 13.8%). Another 187 patients (9.7%) did not report any significant improvement or suffered some sequelae at the final assessment.

### Combined and alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen therapy for febrile children [^112aUmL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Health professionals frequently recommend fever treatment regimens for children that either combine paracetamol and ibuprofen or alternate them. However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects and side effects of combining paracetamol and ibuprofen, or alternating them on consecutive treatments, compared with monotherapy for treating fever in children.

- **Search methods**: In September 2013, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2009–2011).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing alternating or combined paracetamol and ibuprofen regimens with monotherapy in children with fever.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria. Two authors assessed the risk of bias and graded the evidence independently. We conducted separate analyses for different comparison groups: combined therapy versus monotherapy, alternating therapy versus monotherapy, and combined therapy versus alternating therapy.

- **Main results**: Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included. Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI).

### The role of asymptomatic infections in influenza transmission: What do we really know [^111EKoXd]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in influenza transmission was uncertain. However, the importance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 for onward transmission of COVID-19 has led experts to question whether the role of asymptomatic influenza virus infections in transmission had been underappreciated. We discuss the existing evidence on the frequency of asymptomatic influenza virus infections, the extent to which they contribute to infection transmission, and remaining knowledge gaps. We propose priority areas for further evaluation, study designs, and case definitions to address these knowledge gaps.

### Enteric fever [^111tdbZg]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Patients present with a gradual onset of fever which typically rises to a plateau of 39–40°C (102–104°F) towards the end of the week. This slow rise in fever contrasts with the intermittent high fever and rigors seen in malaria.

Abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common, as per a systematic review on the clinical profile of enteric fever. Abdominal pain is diffuse and poorly localized but occasionally intense in the right iliac fossa, mimicking appendicitis. Patients may also have headache, cough, and malaise. Children under 5 years old frequently present with only fever, and the diagnosis may be missed unless they have complications.

Symptoms start 7–14 days after exposure (range 3–60 days). Paratyphoid fever has a shorter incubation period (4–5 days), but symptoms are indistinguishable from those of typhoid fever.

### A 5-month-old infant with a complicated holiday souvenir [^117EtkhX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

A 5-month-old Dutch male infant from non-consanguineous parents was referred to an academic children's hospital in the Netherlands due to a fever of unknown origin lasting for 2 weeks and progressive pancytopenia. His previous medical history was unremarkable, and he had been adequately vaccinated for his age. The travel history included a visit to Morocco at the age of 2 months.

Before presenting at our hospital, empirical sepsis treatment was initiated. However, blood cultures were negative, and the child remained febrile after 48 hours of antibiotic treatment.

Upon referral, the child was hemodynamically stable but appeared pale, inactive, and mildly dehydrated during the physical examination. His body temperature was 39.6°C. Further physical examination revealed an enlarged spleen, which was otherwise unremarkable. Splenomegaly was confirmed by ultrasound, showing a total spleen size of 8 cm (suggested upper limit value for age 3–6 months: 6.5 cm).

Laboratory tests revealed the following: white blood cell count of 2.4 × 10⁹/L (reference: 6.0–15.0 × 10⁹/L), hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL (reference: 9.02–12.73 g/dL), platelet count of 67 × 10⁹/L (reference: 229–597 × 10⁹/L), C-reactive protein of 10 mg/dL (reference: < 1 mg/dL), ferritin of 4662 µg/L (reference: 30–240 µg/L), lactate dehydrogenase of 1053 U/L (reference: < 610 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase of 154 U/L (reference: 89 U/L), and alanine transaminase of 43 U/L (reference: < 60 U/L). A serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and the microscopy is shown in Figure 1.
