## Question

Increase in vertigo and balance problems after a concussion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage increased vertigo and balance problems after a concussion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology to frame expectations. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and the most common etiologies, especially BPPV and vestibular migraine. Next, I will review the targeted examination strategy, including cervical and autonomic contributors. After that, I need to check the evidence-based interventions, including canalith repositioning, vestibular rehabilitation, cervical therapy, and medication nuances. Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence, red flags, and when to escalate care, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Most concussions recover within 7–14 days, but dizziness and balance problems persist in roughly 10–30% of cases, and in some cohorts up to 20% remain symptomatic at 5 years, which underscores the need for a structured, subtype-informed approach rather than assuming time alone will resolve symptoms [^112ZhbgX] [^112Sxa57]. I should also remember that dizziness is among the most common post-concussive complaints and is frequently multifactorial, so I need to keep a broad differential while prioritizing treatable causes [^112Sxa57].

> Wait, let me verify the most likely etiologies so I can prioritize testing and treatment. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the single most common cause of dizziness after concussion, with estimates around 40% in some series, and it is frequently underrecognized in TBI populations, partly due to vestibular agnosia and multi-canal involvement that may require repeated maneuvers [^114k3Q4V] [^112Sxa57] [^113xtWvY]. I should also consider vestibular migraine, which accounts for roughly a third of post-traumatic dizziness and often coexists with concussion, making it easy to miss without careful history of migrainous features and triggers [^114k3Q4V]. But hold on, I should not overlook central vestibular dysfunction, cervical contributions, and autonomic or psychogenic factors, as these commonly overlap and can perpetuate symptoms if not addressed in parallel [^114nNFKH] [^112cfcBY] [^111P5GXV].

> I will now examine the targeted clinical assessment, and I need to ensure I sequence it safely. After cervical clearance, I should perform positional testing with Dix-Hallpike and supine roll maneuvers to screen for posterior and horizontal canal BPPV, repeating as needed because post-traumatic BPPV has higher recurrence and may be bilateral or multi-canal [^115nfdPt] [^113RKfLA] [^112qPc8a]. Next, I should review vestibulo-oculomotor function using VOMS and dynamic visual acuity to detect VOR deficits, convergence insufficiency, smooth pursuit or saccadic abnormalities, and visual motion sensitivity, since these are prevalent after concussion and correlate with symptom burden and recovery time [^1133sjRT] [^116b5kgU]. I should also assess cervical range, strength, and sensorimotor control because cervicogenic dizziness and neck pain frequently coexist and can amplify imbalance and visual-vestibular conflict [^112cfcBY]. Finally, I need to check orthostatic vitals and screen for autonomic dysregulation, as orthostatic intolerance can mimic or worsen vestibular symptoms in a meaningful subset of patients [^111P5GXV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging or labs. Routine neuroimaging is not indicated for uncomplicated post-concussive dizziness in the absence of red flags, and I should avoid vestibular suppressants that can delay central compensation unless symptoms are severe and brief, favoring meclizine if absolutely necessary and avoiding benzodiazepines when possible [^114SbFtg] [^111LYV1m]. I should confirm that my plan emphasizes nonpharmacologic, targeted rehabilitation first, reserving medications for specific phenotypes like vestibular migraine or refractory symptoms, and only after a careful risk–benefit analysis given the limited specificity of pharmacologic benefit for isolated dizziness in PCS [^113JFaAy].

> Next, I should review canalith repositioning maneuvers for confirmed BPPV, and I need to double-check technique and follow-up. For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is first-line and should be repeated until nystagmus and symptoms resolve, with reassessment at follow-up given higher recurrence after trauma and the possibility of multi-canal disease requiring multiple sessions or alternative maneuvers [^113hUpio] [^112qPc8a]. Let me verify feasibility in the acute TBI setting: recent randomized data suggest bedside assessment and treatment of post-traumatic BPPV is safe and practical, with improved gait speed when BPPV resolves, though recurrence remains substantial, reinforcing the need for structured follow-up and fall-risk counseling [^114jFgTe].

> I will now examine vestibular rehabilitation for non-BPPV dizziness and imbalance, and I should confirm dosing and expectations. For persistent vestibular symptoms beyond the acute window, guidelines suggest offering a trial of specific vestibular and proprioceptive exercises, with benefits outweighing harms in most cases, though evidence quality is modest and requires individualized, goal-based reassessment to avoid prolonged, ineffective courses [^111uR9ip] [^111aGeap]. Let me verify dosing: for unilateral peripheral hypofunction, gaze stabilization and balance exercises are typically prescribed at least 3 times daily for a cumulative 12–20 minutes, progressing based on symptom provocation and functional gains, with discontinuation upon goal attainment or plateau [^111qjy1c] [^113k6NVs]. But wait, what if symptoms are driven by visual motion sensitivity or PPPD? In that case, habituation and visual-motion programs can be layered in, ideally coordinated by a vestibular-trained clinician to tailor progression and monitor for maladaptation [^112PticH].

> Let me consider cervical rehabilitation, because I need to ensure I'm not missing a key driver of dizziness and imbalance. Combining cervical spine physiotherapy with vestibular rehabilitation has randomized evidence of accelerating medical clearance for return-to-sport in youth and young adults with persistent post-concussive dizziness, neck pain, or headache, with an odds ratio around 3.9 for clearance by 8 weeks compared with usual care, which is clinically meaningful in sports cohorts [^115BqsT2]. I should confirm that cervical interventions address strength, endurance, proprioception, and postural control, and that they are integrated with vestibular exercises rather than pursued in isolation, given the shared neuroanatomy and symptom overlap [^112cfcBY].

> I should double-check the role of subthreshold aerobic exercise, because timing and dose can influence outcomes. Early, individualized subsymptom threshold aerobic training started within days to a couple of weeks can reduce symptom scores and may shorten recovery in some patients, and it is reasonable to layer this alongside vestibular and cervical therapy rather than delaying rehabilitation unnecessarily [^111Wrjmu]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit: meta-analytic data suggest a small-to-moderate improvement in symptom scores with subthreshold exercise, with the strongest signal in persistent symptom populations, supporting its adjunctive use rather than as a standalone for vestibular-dominant cases [^111KYFMc].

> Now, I need to ensure I address medication strategy carefully, especially for vestibular migraine phenotypes that often coexist with concussion. Propranolol, TCAs, or gabapentin may be considered when migrainous features are prominent, but I should avoid agents that worsen cognitive complaints or fatigue in PCS, and I must be transparent that evidence for dizziness-specific benefit is limited and often inferred from headache or global symptom scales rather than dizziness endpoints [^113tS2tL] [^113JFaAy]. I should confirm that any pharmacologic trial is time-limited, reassessed frequently, and coordinated with nonpharmacologic vestibular and behavioral therapies to avoid masking symptoms and delaying compensation [^111LYV1m].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and outcome tracking so I can detect nonresponders early. For BPPV, I should reassess at least weekly until resolution, and for broader vestibulo-oculomotor impairments, reassessment every 1–2 weeks with serial measures such as VOMS, DHI, and functional balance tests is prudent to guide progression and identify plateaus or alternative diagnoses [^112zKeR2]. I need to ensure goals are functional and measurable, and that I discontinue therapy upon resolution or plateau to mitigate negative illness expectations and unnecessary burden [^113k6NVs].

> But wait, what if recovery is protracted or atypical? I should confirm that I've screened for red flags and alternative etiologies, including structural lesions when indicated, seizures, and nonvestibular causes of dizziness, and I should consider multidisciplinary referral for persistent post-concussive symptoms that exceed expected timelines, integrating psychological and cognitive rehabilitation as needed [^112NBm1h]. I should also remember that earlier referral to vestibular therapy correlates with faster symptom resolution and return-to-play in youth athletes, which supports timely escalation rather than prolonged watchful waiting when vestibular symptoms persist beyond the early subacute phase [^116R3fxt].

> In summary, I need to ensure a stepwise, phenotype-driven approach: screen and treat BPPV promptly with repeated maneuvers, implement individualized vestibular and cervical rehabilitation early, add subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise, reserve medications for specific phenotypes like vestibular migraine, and track outcomes with structured reassessment to avoid ineffective, prolonged care, aligning with VA/DoD and sports concussion guidance while tailoring to patient-specific risk factors and goals [^111uR9ip] [^1142Ay3Z].

Vertigo and balance problems are common after concussion, with **BPPV as the most frequent cause** [^112Sxa57] and persistent symptoms in 10–30% of cases [^112ZhbgX]. Early, targeted assessment with **Dix-Hallpike testing** [^115nfdPt] and vestibular rehabilitation [^114NmiyT] are recommended; canalith repositioning maneuvers are first-line for BPPV [^113hUpio] [^114SbFtg], and individualized vestibular therapy improves dizziness and balance [^112ZhbgX] [^112Cp9Vh]. Persistent symptoms warrant **multidisciplinary care** [^1142Ay3Z] to address central, cervical, and psychogenic contributors [^1142Ay3Z] [^112cfcBY] [^114nNFKH].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

Vertigo and balance problems are **highly prevalent** after concussion, with dizziness reported in up to 80% of patients in the acute phase [^112Sxa57] and persisting in 10–30% beyond the typical recovery period [^112ZhbgX]. These symptoms significantly impair daily functioning, delay return to work or sport, and increase fall risk [^114jFgTe].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** underlie vertigo and balance problems after concussion:

- **Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)**: Displacement of otoconia within the semicircular canals, causing brief, positional vertigo episodes [^notfound].

- **Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) dysfunction**: Impaired gaze stability and visual motion sensitivity due to central or peripheral vestibular involvement [^114nNFKH] [^113Fsfsn].

- **Central vestibular dysfunction**: Injury to brainstem, cerebellum, or cortical vestibular pathways, causing persistent dizziness and imbalance [^116bP4MN].

- **Cervical spine involvement**: Neck pain and proprioceptive disturbances contributing to dizziness and balance impairment [^112cfcBY].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

Patients typically present with **dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, nausea, visual disturbances, and difficulty concentrating** [^1176CJE2]. Diagnostic criteria include:

- **History**: Detailed characterization of dizziness (positional, spontaneous, triggered), associated symptoms, and temporal pattern [^111YGjua].

- **Physical examination**: Neurological examination, orthostatic vitals, cervical spine assessment, and vestibular tests (Dix-Hallpike, head impulse test, VOR assessment) [^1133sjRT].

- **Functional testing**: Balance and gait assessment, including the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) and Dynamic Gait Index [^11687uGt].

---

## Assessment tools and diagnostic tests

Several **assessment tools and diagnostic tests** are recommended:

| **Tool/test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Dix-Hallpike maneuver | Diagnose BPPV [^115nfdPt] |
| Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening (VOMS) | Identify vestibulo-ocular impairments [^116b5kgU] |
| Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) | Assess static balance [^notfound] |
| Dynamic Gait Index | Evaluate dynamic balance and gait [^112G4QF8] |
| Vestibular rehabilitation protocols | Structured rehabilitation programs [^111qjy1c] |

---

## Evidence-based treatment strategies

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are **first-line** [^notfound]:

- **Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)**: Individualized programs including gaze stabilization, balance training, and habituation exercises [^111qjy1c] [^112ZhbgX].

- **Canalith repositioning maneuvers**: Epley maneuver for BPPV [^113hUpio] [^1158rhCf].

- **Cervical spine physiotherapy**: Addressing neck pain and proprioceptive deficits [^112cfcBY] [^115BqsT2].

- **Subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise**: Gradual, individualized exercise programs [^111KYFMc].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments are **reserved for refractory cases** [^113iuHYp]:

- **Vestibular suppressants**: Short-term use of meclizine or benzodiazepines for severe dizziness [^notfound].

- **Migraine prophylaxis**: Propranolol, topiramate, or amitriptyline for vestibular migraine [^113tS2tL].

- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs or SNRIs for coexisting anxiety or depression [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Most patients recover within weeks to months, but **10–30% experience persistent symptoms** beyond three months [^112ZhbgX]. Recovery is influenced by injury severity, pre-existing conditions, and adherence to rehabilitation. Persistent symptoms may indicate **post-concussion syndrome** [^112NBm1h] and require multidisciplinary management [^1142Ay3Z].

---

## Risk factors for persistent symptoms

Several factors increase the risk of **persistent vertigo and balance problems**:

- **High initial symptom burden**: Severe dizziness and balance impairment at onset [^114ShJgA].

- **Pre-existing conditions**: History of migraine, anxiety, or vestibular disorders [^1142Ay3Z].

- **Delayed treatment**: Late initiation of vestibular rehabilitation [^116R3fxt].

- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing [^114k3Q4V].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **early, individualized assessment and treatment** [^111Wrjmu] [^112NBm1h]. Key recommendations include:

- **Early vestibular rehabilitation**: Initiate within 1–2 weeks post-injury [^111HfkDy] [^111Wrjmu].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve physical therapy, occupational therapy, neurology, and psychology [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Explain symptoms, recovery timeline, and treatment expectations [^112JH3Ze].

---

## Impact on daily life and quality of life

Vertigo and balance problems significantly affect **daily functioning**, causing difficulties with work, driving, and social activities. They also increase fall risk and injury, and are associated with anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^114jFgTe] [^113EtkmY].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Current research gaps include limited high-quality randomized controlled trials, unclear optimal timing and intensity of vestibular rehabilitation, and insufficient understanding of central mechanisms. Future directions should prioritize **large-scale RCTs**, develop standardized protocols, and investigate central vestibular mechanisms and biomarkers [^112ZhbgX] [^111aGeap].

---

Vertigo and balance problems are common after concussion, with BPPV as the most frequent cause and persistent symptoms in 10–30% of cases. Early, targeted assessment and vestibular rehabilitation are recommended; canalith repositioning maneuvers are first-line for BPPV, and individualized vestibular therapy improves dizziness and balance. Persistent symptoms warrant **multidisciplinary care** to address central, cervical, and psychogenic contributors.

### Can vestibular rehabilitation exercises help patients with concussion? A systematic review of efficacy, prescription and progression patterns [^112ZhbgX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Concussion symptoms normally resolve within 7–10days but vertigo, dizziness and balance dysfunction persist in 10–30% of cases causing significant morbidity. This study systematically evaluated the evidence supporting the efficacy, prescription and progression patterns of vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) in patients with concussion.

Design

Systematic Review, guided by PRISMA guidelines and presenting a best evidence synthesis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases PubMed (1949 to May 2015), CINAHL (1982 to May 2015), EMBASE (1947 to May 2015), SPORTDiscus (1985 to May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to May 2015) and PEDRO (1999 to May 2015), supplemented by manual searches and grey literature.

Eligibility Criteria For Study Selection

Article or abstract of original research, population of patients with concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with vestibular symptoms, interventions detailing VRT, measurement of outcomes pre-VRT/post-VRT. Study type was not specified.

Results

Following a double review of abstract and full-text articles, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria: randomised controlled trial (n = 2), uncontrolled studies (n = 3) and case studies (n = 5). 4 studies evaluated VRT as a single intervention. 6 studies incorporated VRT in multimodal interventions (including manual therapy, strength training, occupational tasks, counselling or medication). 9 studies reported improvement in outcomes but level I evidence from only 1 study was found that demonstrated increased rates (OR 3.91; 95% CI 1.34 to 11.34; p = 0.002) of medical clearance for return to sport within 8weeks, when VRT (combined with cervical therapy) was compared with usual care. Heterogeneity in study type and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. Habituation and adaptation exercises were employed in 8 studies and balance exercises in 9 studies. Prescription and progression patterns lacked standardisation.

Conclusions

Current evidence for optimal prescription and efficacy of VRT in patients with mTBI/concussion is limited. Available evidence, although weak, shows promise in this population. Further high-level studies evaluating the effects of VRT in patients with mTBI/concussion with vestibular and/or balance dysfunction are required.

### Concussion is confusing us all [^112Sxa57]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Dizziness

Dizziness affects up to 80% of patients in the first few days following a head injury. It often persists after mild head injury, with up to a fifth of patients still symptomatic 5 years later. This is often labelled as 'post-concussion' dizziness, but this is not a useful 'diagnosis'. In acute head injury, expert neuro-otological review can identify the causes for dizziness in virtually all cases (personal communication B Seemungal), with the most common diagnoses being benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, migraine and damage to the central vestibular system, which can produce vestibular agnosia. There are distinct treatments for most common vestibular conditions, and a pragmatic approach to management was recently described in Practical Neurology, an approach relevant to patients with TBI.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common cause of dizziness after TBI, presumably because of the mechanical effect of the injury on semicircular canal function. It can be diagnosed with Hallpike's testing and treated via repositioning manoeuvres. However, post-traumatic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be challenging for the non-expert as it can involve multiple canals and may even be bilateral, explaining why a single treatment session may not suffice. Following effective therapy the long-term relapse rate is no different from that in idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (∼15%). Intermittent episodes of vertigo associated with headaches or other migrainous features should alert the neurologist to the possibility of migrainous vertigo. Our experience is that this can be successfully treated using generic approaches to migraine treatment with propranolol being our first choice. Vestibular rehabilitation helps in unselected cases of vertigo and balance impairment after mild TBI. Anxiety is common in chronic dizziness and the combination is associated with worse outcome. Hence, combining cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety with vestibular rehabilitation is likely to be effective.

### Post-concussive vestibular dysfunction is related to injury to the inferior vestibular nerve [^116bP4MN]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contact sport athletes are at high risk of sustaining head impacts that may lead to a sports-related concussion (SRC). The incidence of SRC has increased during the last decades. While symptoms typically gradually subside within seven to 14 days, some athletes show prolonged persisting symptoms, and some never recover fully. When three symptoms last three months, this has commonly been defined as a post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Because of difficulties defining the syndrome, the descriptive term persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS), referring to symptoms persisting beyond the normal recovery period, is increasingly used. Vestibular dysfunction, manifested as vertigo, dizziness, unsteadiness, and visual impairment, are common in PPCS, and, when present, associated with a worse outcome and a prolonged recovery.

The vestibular system is an intricate sensorimotor system responsible for detection of self-motion, head and body positioning, motor responses, and multi-sensory integration with the main purposes of gaze stability and maintaining balance. It includes peripheral structures of the inner ear and vestibular nerves, as well as central structures including cerebellar tracts, brainstem, and supratentorial regions. The cause of persisting vestibular symptoms has not been established. While some SRC studies indicate a central origin, others suggest a peripheral cause, and recently a combination of vestibular lesions was suggested.

Our aim was to establish whether vestibular dysfunction in athletes with SRC who have PPCS is of central, peripheral, or combined origin. We used morphological, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cerebellum, a detailed vestibular testing protocol, and self-reporting questionnaires addressing symptoms of post-concussion dizziness, anxiety, and depression.

Vestibulo-oculomotor impairments — postconcussion features indicate that numerous studies show vestibular and oculomotor deficits are common after concussion and can contribute to many postconcussion symptoms, impairments, and functional limitations such as dizziness, balance problems, vertigo, blurred vision, headaches, nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mental fogginess, difficulty reading, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and fatigue; precise incidence rates remain unclear and may be driven by different and/or multiple factors, and physical therapy examination and intervention strategies for both systems are linked, particularly in literature pertaining to concussions/mTBIs.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^111HfkDy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Vestibulo-oculomotor interventions after concussion indicate that a CPG supported by level I evidence recommended that if benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is identified as a potential source of dizziness, then canalith repositioning maneuvers should be used, and if BPPV is identified as a potential impairment, then physical therapists should use canalith repositioning maneuvers. Evidence includes a systematic review including 2 randomized controlled trials providing weak-to-moderate evidence that vestibulo-oculomotor rehabilitation improved outcomes; a moderate-quality randomized controlled trial indicates such rehabilitation may be feasible even within the first 10 days after a concussive injury and can be effective in reducing symptoms, reducing time to recovery, and improving function; and in 1 randomized controlled trial, individuals in the treatment group who received cervical and vestibular rehabilitation were 3.91 times more likely to be medically cleared for return to sport by 8 weeks. Observational evidence indicates that vestibular rehabilitation, including canalith repositioning maneuvers for BPPV, is commonly used by physical therapists to treat individuals who have experienced a concussive event and may help reduce dizziness and improve gait and balance dysfunction, and although repositioning maneuvers can be effective in treating BPPV, a patient may require additional interventions in the presence of concomitant vestibular hypofunction.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: evidence for subtype classification [^114nNFKH]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Vestibular

The vestibular subtype of concussion is characterized by disruption to the central vestibular system that involves movement and orientation of the body to space and time. Symptoms include dizziness, fogginess, lightheadedness, nausea, vertigo, and disequilibrium. This subtype comprises vestibulo-ocular (eg, vestibular ocular reflex [VOR], visual motion sensitivity [VMS]), vestibulo-spinal (eg, imbalance), and gait dysfunction. Peripheral vestibular dysfunction may co-exist with concussion, but it is not common. Dynamic movement, involving integrated head and body movements, may provoke dysfunction and symptoms for these patients. Patients with the vestibular subtype have the following: at least 1 symptom of dizziness, fogginess, lightheadedness, nausea, vertigo, or disequilibrium; dysfunction in vestibulo-ocular or vestibulo-spinal tracts affecting gait and/or balance; symptoms and/or dysfunction are provoked with dynamic movement; and they may present with concurrent deficits in neurocognitive testing, feelings of anxiety due to disorientation, and concurrent clinical findings.

Anxiety/Mood

The anxiety/mood subtype of concussion is characterized by increase in anxiety and mood-related symptoms including the following: nervousness, feeling more emotional, hypervigilance, ruminative thoughts, feelings of being overwhelmed; depressed mood with sadness, feeling more emotional, anger, hostility/irritability, loss of energy, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness. These symptoms are triggered or exacerbated by the concussion directly, or indirectly in relation to other injury-related symptoms. Pre-existing conditions, such as a history of anxiety or migraine, and concurrent stressful events may also predispose or contribute to this subtype. This subtype is often accompanied by sleep disturbance. Physical and social inactivity may trigger or exacerbate the anxiety/mood subtype and physical exertion/exercise often results in improvement.

### What is the lowest threshold to make a diagnosis of concussion? [^114dnxJa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to examine the evidence for determining the lowest threshold for diagnosing a sport-related concussion.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included sports concussion, concussion assessment, diagnosis, concussion symptoms, onfield assessment and sports-related traumatic brain injury.

Results

The majority of concussions in sport occur without loss of consciousness or frank neurological signs. Some of the hallmark signs of acute concussion include mental confusion, memory and balance disturbance. Over the course of the first 24 h, the most common symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness and balance problems, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, confusion, memory loss and 'fatigue'. Symptoms such as tiredness, irritability, nervousness or anxiety, sleep disturbance and sensitivity to light or noise may be noticed in the days after injury. The pathophysiology of sports concussion remains poorly understood. There appears to be a period of vulnerability following concussion in which an overlapping injury might cause magnified pathophysiology.

Conclusions

Sport-related concussions can be difficult to diagnose. Concussion produces an evolving constellation of somatic, cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms that are typically most severe during the earliest acute postinjury period (ie, within the first 24–48 h) and diminish over a matter of several days to weeks in the majority of athletes. Athletes suspected of concussion should be removed from play and evaluated thoroughly.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111YGjua]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Dizziness and disequilibrium — assessment in post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) should document symptom character, timing, and triggers, perform a targeted primary care vestibular assessment prior to referral, and include specified examination domains and functional testing, with referral to vestibular rehabilitation recommended once other causes are excluded. Dizziness and disequilibrium are common symptoms that individuals present with in the primary care settings and may be related to mTBI. In individuals with symptoms attributed to mTBI, a description and characterization of their dizziness, temporal pattern, and symptom-provoking activities provides valuable information in establishing a working differential diagnosis. Primary care assessment for vestibular disorders should be done before referring for further vestibular examination and rehabilitation, and observation and patient interview are key elements to guide care. Evaluation should include a thorough examination of neurologic function, orthostatics, vision, auditory, sensory, motor, cervical, and vestibular systems, and evaluation of functional activities should include sitting and standing balance and gait. Once the initial assessment is completed and other causes are eliminated, referral to a vestibular rehabilitation specialist is recommended for symptom management.

### The effects of vestibular rehabilitation on dizziness and balance problems in patients after traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^112Cp9Vh]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To investigate the effects of group-based vestibular rehabilitation in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Design:

A single-blind randomized controlled trial.

Setting:

University Hospital (recruitment and baseline assessments) and Metropolitan University (experimental intervention).

Subjects:

A total of 65 patients (45 women) with mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (mean age 39.4 ± 13.0years) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 33) or control group (n = 32).

Intervention:

Group-based vestibular rehabilitation for eight weeks. Participants were tested at baseline (3.5 ± 2.1months after injury) and at two post-intervention follow-ups (2.7 ± 0.8 and 4.4 ± 1.0months after baseline testing).

Main Measures:

Primary outcome: Dizziness Handicap Inventory. Secondary outcome: High-Level Mobility Assessment Tool. Other outcomes: Vertigo Symptom Scale; Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; and Balance Error Scoring System. Between-group differences were analyzed with a linear mixed-model analysis for repeated measurements.

Results:

At baseline, no group differences were revealed (personal factors, clinical characteristics and outcome measures). At the first follow-up, statistically significant mean differences in favor of the intervention were found in the primary (-8.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): -16.6 to -0.9) and secondary outcomes (3.7 points, 95% CI: 1.4–6.0). At the second follow-up, no significant between-group differences were found. No significant between-group differences in the other outcomes were found at the two follow-ups.

Conclusion:

The intervention appeared to speed up recovery for patients with dizziness and balance problems after traumatic brain injury. However, the benefits had dissipated two months after the end of the intervention.

Post-Concussive Syndrome

Concussion is an acceleration-deceleration injury, and is a term often used to describe a mild form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The symptoms of concussion may include headache, cognitive or emotional symptoms, sleep disturbance, and an initial loss of consciousness (LOC) or amnesia. Symptoms typically resolved within 2 weeks, but symptoms that persist past 2 weeks are classified as the post-concussive syndrome (PCS), while the persistent post-concussive syndrome (persistent PCS) describes symptoms lasting longer than 3 months. For the remainder of this manuscript, we will refer to both post-concussive syndrome and persistent post-concussive syndrome as PCS. While headache is the most common complaint of PCS, dizziness is the second most common complaint. Patient with PCS commonly also experience photophobia, phonophobia, visual focusing issues, and fatigue.

Dizziness due to PCS is typically described as either a continuous or episodic swaying or rocking sensation and it may be worse with movement or complex visual or overstimulating sensory cues. The most common ocular motor abnormality in patients with concussion is convergence insufficiency in around 40% of patients, abnormal smooth pursuit in 40%, and accommodative dysfunction in around 20% of patients, although the ocular motor examination is often normal.

Treatment of PCS is variable, however a randomized controlled trial confirmed that early vestibular rehabilitation for post-concussive dizziness accelerates recovery. Although there is a lack of randomized controlled trials for pharmacologic therapy targeting dizziness after concussion, trials have demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in headaches and the post-concussion symptom scale (PCSS) score with either gabapentin or a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). While the PCSS does include dizziness, this scoring system groups together nausea, vomiting, balance problems, photophobia, phonophobia, fatigue, tingling, and a variety of cognitive, sleep related, and emotional symptoms with it. Therefore, the specificity of these medications' effects on dizziness in PCS remains uncertain. While there is evidence from animal studies that CGRP inhibitors may be effective for post-traumatic headaches, it is unclear whether this is also true in humans, and its generalizability to post-concussive dizziness remains uncertain.

Vestibulo-oculomotor impairments — physical therapists should examine vestibular and oculomotor function for patients after a concussive event who report symptoms such as headache, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, fatigue, balance problems, visual motion sensitivity, blurred vision, or difficulty with focusing on stable or moving targets, and should examine aspects including ocular alignment, smooth pursuits, saccades, vergence and accommodation, gaze stability, dynamic visual acuity, visual motion sensitivity, light-headedness caused by orthostatic hypotension, and vertigo caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV); if BPPV is suspected, physical therapists should assess the patient using a Dix-Hallpike test or other appropriate positional test(s), and they may examine vestibulo-oculomotor function even when related symptoms are not reported to identify potential subtle impairments contributing to symptoms.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^112cfcBY]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Cervical musculoskeletal impairments — postconcussion symptom relationships note that cervical musculoskeletal impairments can lead to symptoms commonly reported after concussion, including neck pain, headache with or without neck pain, dizziness, and diminished balance/postural control, yet the incidence associated with concussive events has not been comprehensively studied; given the biomechanical mechanism of many concussive injuries, it is hypothesized these impairments may be present, and in patients with neck pain without concussion there is strong evidence for diminished range of motion, strength, and insufficient muscle endurance, with evidence that sensorimotor and vestibular reflex deficits may originate from altered cervical afferent input leading to dizziness, visual dysfunction, balance problems, and difficulties with head and eye movement control; even without neck pain after a concussive event, cervical musculoskeletal impairments may underlie symptoms such as dizziness, imbalance, and headache, and overlapping symptoms can make determining symptom origin difficult.

### We should be screening for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all older adults at risk of falling: a commentary on the World Falls Guidelines [^111Nn7wF]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is amongst the commonest causes of dizziness and falls in older adults. Diagnosing and treating BPPV can reduce falls, and thereby reduce fall-related morbidity and mortality. Recent World Falls Guidelines recommend formal assessment for BPPV in older adults at risk of falling, but only if they report vertigo. However, this recommendation ignores the data that (i) many older adults with BPPV experience dizziness as vague unsteadiness (rather than vertigo), and (ii) others may experience no symptoms of dizziness at all. BPPV without vertigo is due to an impaired vestibular perception of self-motion, termed 'vestibular agnosia'. Vestibular agnosia is found in ageing, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, and results in dramatically increased missed BPPV diagnoses. Patients with BPPV without vertigo are typically the most vulnerable for negative outcomes associated with this disorder. We thus recommend simplifying the World Falls Guidelines: all older adults (> 60 years) with objective or subjective balance problems, irrespective of symptomatic complaint, should have positional testing to examine for BPPV.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^111mtH1z]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Randomisation

Patients with BPPV were sequentially randomised, using an online platform, to one of three interventions (re-positioning manoeuvres, Brandt–Daroff exercises or advice). Currently, routine practice in trauma centres does not include ward-based acute vestibular assessment and treatment. Thus, the advice arm constituted no change to current clinical practice, that is, comprised of the 'usual' or 'standard' care for participants. Additionally, there are currently no prospective, randomised treatment studies in acute TBI-related BPPV; thus, there are no data to guide the constituents of an effective intervention or the feasibility of an intervention. The lack of evidence is of critical importance, since the latest clinical guidelines, which follow evidence-based medicine, also do not advise routine assessment and treatment of BPPV in acute TBI. Minimisation criteria were used to ensure a similar distribution of patient-specific factors between intervention groups, including age ≤ 40 years vs > 40 years), TBI severity (highest Glasgow coma scale at 24 hours following GCS ≥ 9 vs GCS < 9) and ability to complete balance measures (Yes vs No). Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.

### Vestibular dysfunction in acute traumatic brain injury [^117899WA]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Vestibular dysfunction is common in acute TBI patients typically combining peripheral and central vestibular diagnoses (Table 2) — as we found in chronic TBI patients with persisting vestibular symptoms. That TBI patients have additional neurological conditions (e.g. cognitive dysfunction and epilepsy) indicates a complex neurological need that is poorly served as neurologists are currently not routinely involved in acute TBI care.

Half of the cases with clinically obvious gait ataxia reported no balance problem which may lead to an under-recognition of vestibular dysfunction by clinical staff in acute TBI. This replicates a recent finding in a smaller group of acute TBI patients (with intracranial abnormalities on CT), where, using a sports concussion tool, we found no correlation between objective signs and symptoms of imbalance.

Although common, we cannot yet advocate the routine screening and treatment of vestibular conditions in acute TBI since there is no evidence base for such intervention. For example, a retrospective study found a recurrence rate of 67% with traumatic BPPV versus only 14% with idiopathic BPPV, which could support treating BPPV in the subacute phase (when it may respond to treatment) and not the acute phase (when it may recur).

An acute unilateral peripheral vestibular loss was found in 20% of cases, two thirds with a petrous temporal bone fracture and one third of uncertain aetiology. Theoretically, the simultaneous injury of peripheral and central vestibular structures, relatively unique to acute TBI, could worsen clinical recovery.

Limitations

The single-unit setting limits the generalisability of our findings to other units, although our finding of multiple vestibular diagnoses in individual patients supports a similar finding in an outpatient case series.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Synopsis

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. With no valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury provides an additional level of complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms. While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and Balance Error Scoring System, have been developed specifically for concussion, the vast majority of tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of postconcussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area. The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

### Does earlier vestibular therapy after sport-related concussion lead to faster recovery? [^116R3fxt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many patients experience vestibular dysfunction following a sport-related concussion (SRC). Vestibular rehabilitation therapy has recently become more well established. In a cohort of athletes with SRC, the authors sought to 1) assess the relationship between symptoms at the initial clinic visit and time to referral for vestibular therapy, and 2) evaluate whether earlier referral to vestibular therapy was associated with faster recovery, as defined as days to return to learn (RTL), symptom resolution (SR), and return to play (RTP).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a regional multidisciplinary concussion center's database. Patients aged 12–23 years diagnosed with SRC who received vestibular rehabilitation therapy between October 2017 and October 2021 were included. Demographics and Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) scores were extracted. The independent variable of interest was time to vestibular therapy referral. The three outcome variables were RTL, SR, and RTP. Spearman's rho correlation (rho) was used to evaluate the relationship between total PCSS score and individual symptoms (balance problems, blurred vision, and dizziness) and time to referral for vestibular therapy. Multivariable linear regression was performed to determine the impact of time to vestibular therapy on the three outcomes of RTL, SR, and RTP. Covariates included initial symptom burden, age, and prior concussions.

Results

Forty-two concussed athletes were referred for vestibular therapy (mean age 16.8 ± 2.7 years; 54.8% female). The mean time from concussion to the initial clinic visit was 22.4 ± 20.2 days, and the mean time from the initial clinic visit to vestibular therapy referral was 4.9 ± 11.3 days. Initial total PCSS scores (rho[37] = 0.05, p = 0.78) and individual symptoms, including balance problems (rho[33] = -0.004, p = 0.98), blurred vision (rho[34] = -0.17, p = 0.33), and dizziness (rho[33] = 0.07, p = 0.67), were not correlated with time to referral for vestibular therapy. Multivariable linear regression analysis found that earlier vestibular therapy referral was predictive of shorter days to SR (p = 0.002) and RTP (p = 0.02) but not RTL (p = 0.59).

Conclusions

In athletes with SRC referred for vestibular therapy, earlier vestibular therapy referral was significantly associated with faster time to RTP and SR. Future investigations should focus on identifying common postconcussive signs and symptoms that serve as indications for referral to vestibular therapy.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^1115mvaD]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in under 40-year-olds in the UK. Imbalance and dizziness secondary to vestibular dysfunction, involving damage to peripheral and/or central vestibular structures, affect most patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Persistent vestibular dysfunction is linked to physical and psychosocial morbidity, including delayed return-to-workand falls. Critically, falls causing unintentional trauma are linked to excess mortality in community-dwelling TBI survivors.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in acute TBIand is a treatable risk factor for falls in idiopathic BPPV. However, current evidence indicates that routine assessment and treatment of BPPV in acute TBI is uncommon, seemingly due to a variety of knowledge and role-based barriers. Notably, previous qualitative work demonstrated that healthcare professionals had concerns regarding the assessment and treatment procedures for BPPV in the acute TBI cohort, while post-traumatic dizziness was viewed by some as self-limiting and non-specific. These concerns also included practical considerations such as patients' pain, cognition and how to complete procedures in those with spinal and limb trauma. Healthcare professionals were also apprehensive about patients' tolerability and response to treatment. Currently, there are no patient- or healthcare professional-derived data on the tolerability, practicability or acceptability of BPPV assessment and treatment procedures in acute TBI. This would be critical for the implementation of any changes to practice. Furthermore, there are no prospective data on the effectiveness of treatment, via repositioning manoeuvres, in post-traumatic BPPV. Indeed, despite the frequency of BPPV in the TBI population, the latest clinical guidelines for early head injury management do not mention the need for vestibular, or more specifically BPPV, assessment or treatment.

Diagnosis of concussion — the diagnosis is challenging and based on clinical assessment; it is complicated by a lack of validated, objective diagnostic tests, reliance on self-reported symptoms, and confounding symptoms from other conditions; nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, mood changes, "fogginess", dizziness, visual changes, fatigue, and neck pain may also originate from other etiologies; symptoms may be delayed or initially unrecognized, and concussion remains a clinical diagnosis made by synthesizing history and physical examination findings as the injury evolves.

A systematic approach is required for patients with a suspected concussion. Although standardized tools can aid in assessment, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical one. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be given both verbal and written review of the common symptoms of concussion, expected course of recovery, as well as strategies to manage symptoms. Most patients benefit from a brief period of rest, followed by a gradual reintroduction of activities, and a graduated return-to-sport protocol. Patients with prolonged recovery from a concussion may benefit from exercise, vestibular, and cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^112qPc8a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — comorbid conditions influencing fall and injury risk indicates that patients with a history of stroke or diabetes, particularly with peripheral neuropathy, may already have a preexisting gait, balance, or proprioceptive deficit, and the additional symptoms of BPPV may increase their risk for fall and injury. Patients with visual disturbances may also be at increased risk for falls, and possible associations between osteoporosis (osteopenia) and BPPV have also been reported; patients with both conditions should be identified and monitored closely for fall and fracture risk. The text adds that patients with a history of recurrent falls, particularly among the elderly, should be assessed for underlying BPPV, and that BPPV may occur simultaneously with other CNS disorders so patients should be questioned about preexisting CNS disorders that may modify management. Trauma is relevant because BPPV may occur relatively commonly after trauma or traumatic brain injury, and posttraumatic BPPV is significantly more likely to require repeated CRP (up to 67% of cases) for resolution.

Dizziness is one of the most common chief complaints in both the ambulatory care setting and the emergency department. These symptoms may be representative of a broad range of entities. Therefore, any attempt at treatment must first start with determining the etiology. In this current perspective, we focus specifically on the diagnosis of and treatment of vestibular migraine, which is common and overlaps clinically with a variety of other diagnoses. We discuss the traditional treatments for vestibular migraine in addition to the recent explosion of novel migraine therapeutics. Because vestibular migraine can mimic, or co-exist with, a variety of other vestibular diseases, we discuss several of these disorders including persistent postural-perceptual dizziness, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, post-concussive syndrome, Ménière's disease, and cerebrovascular etiologies. We discuss the diagnosis of each, as well as overlapping and distinguishing clinical features of which the reader should be aware. Finally, we conclude with evidence based as well as expert commentary on management, with a particular emphasis on vestibular migraine.

### Vestibular rehabilitation in Europe: a survey of clinical and research practice [^114y9EZx]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is a specialised form of rehabilitation for individuals with physical and psychological impairments due to vestibular disease or dysfunction. The need for VR is evident as vestibular problems are highly prevalent and costly. The evidence base for VR has expanded considerably since its origins in the 1940s. Several systematic reviews have concluded efficacy in sub-populations of vestibular dysfunction including unilateral and bilateral peripheral dysfunction, post-acoustic neuroma resection, middle-age to older adults, and post-concussion. Additionally, clinical guidelines developed for the treatment of peripheral dysfunction provided strong recommendations that VR should be offered to patients with unilateral or bilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction with a preponderance of benefit over harm while acknowledging that not all patients benefit. Further, there is abundant evidence for the efficacy of specific manoeuvres to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) since the 1980s.

VR is usually provided by therapists (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and audiologists) but also by physicians and is considered a speciality within these professions. This is appropriate as there are often multiple causes for symptoms of dizziness and imbalance, each of which require accurate diagnosis and separate treatments. Although serious causes of chronic dizziness and vertigo are rare, early identification in acute cases can be life-saving. Furthermore, there are complexities in recovery, and many direct and indirect psychological and functional factors to consider. Therefore, knowledge and skill in differentiating presenting complaints and selecting the most appropriate physical assessment and appropriate exercise prescription treatment are of paramount importance.

Previous studies investigating the practice of VR have found low levels of usage by physicians due to lack of access and knowledge. In addition, low levels of pre-registration training in VR across professionals ranging from 4 to 53% have been reported. Surveys of therapists practicing VR are outdated, have focussed on just one aspect of VR (BPPV), or geographically confined to one area with a very small sample size. Up to date knowledge about current practice of VR in Europe is scant. It is not known what comprises VR across Europe or whether commonalities exist in approaches to assessment and management. There is little information on training and education as well as research capacity amongst those doing VR. There are also gaps in knowledge about how VR is accessed and how accessible it is. Updating the knowledge base in relation to the practice of VR would be of use to those researching the area and seeking to increase capacity. The aim of this study, therefore, was to generate new knowledge on the practice of VR across Europe.

### Phenotyping the spectrum of traumatic brain injury: a review and pathway to standardization [^115UVziv]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Three additional studies examined post-concussion symptom profiles. Howell and colleagues examined post-concussive symptom domains (somatic, vestibular-ocular, cognitive, sleep, and emotional) among 689 patients ages 7–30 years, in relationship to symptom duration. The study reported longer total symptom duration associated with more severe somatic and vestibular-ocular symptoms in adolescents. Kontos and colleagues conducted a retrospective, blind chart review of 236 subjects ages 11–40 years with mild TBI within 90 days of injury from two concussion clinics. Primary and secondary clinical profiles were determined based on relevant medical history, injury information, clinical interview/examination notes, reported symptoms, and cognitive and vestibular/ocular test results. Feddermann-Demont and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of data from 2416 athletes represented by 33 prospective studies to determine, among other things, what domains of clinical function should be assessed after sports-related concussion. Domains identified were cognition, dizziness and balance, emotions, headache, and vision. This study reported that clinical domains affected in the diagnosis of sport-related concussion included cognitive, vestibular, and headache/migraine. Overall, the studies examining acute post-concussion symptom profiles reveal some similarities, with symptomatic, vestibular, and cognitive symptoms all featured repeatedly, but the measurement, magnitudes, and associations between symptoms varying considerably across studies.

### Objective vestibular testing of children with dizziness and balance complaints following sports-related concussions [^115ar4J1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct objective assessment of children with balance and vestibular complaints following sports-related concussions and identify the underlying deficits by analyzing laboratory test outcomes.

Study Designs

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Pediatric tertiary care facility.

Subjects and Methods

Medical records were reviewed of 42 pediatric patients with balance and/or vestibular complaints following sports-related concussions who underwent comprehensive laboratory testing on their balance and vestibular function. Patients' characteristics were summarized and results analyzed.

Results

More than 90% of the children with protracted dizziness or imbalance following sports-related concussion had at least 1 abnormal finding from the comprehensive balance and vestibular evaluation. The most frequent deficit was found in dynamic visual acuity test, followed by Sensory Organization Test and rotational test. Patient's balance problem associated with concussion seemed to be primarily instigated by vestibular dysfunction. Furthermore, semicircular canal dysfunction was involved more often than dysfunction of otolith organs. Yet, < 10% of the children experienced a hearing loss following sports-related concussion.

Conclusions

Vestibular impairment is common among children with protracted dizziness or imbalance following sports-related concussion. Our study demonstrated that proper and thorough evaluation is imperative to identify these underlying deficits and laboratory tests were helpful in the diagnosis and recommendation of following rehabilitations.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — interventions for movement-related impairments: Two systematic reviews of moderate-quality study designs indicate that personalized physical therapy interventions targeting movement-related impairments are safe and result in clinical improvement after an initial period of relative rest. In a randomized controlled feasibility study of adolescents with concussion and dizziness up to 14 days after injury, early personalized physical therapy demonstrated a shorter recovery time than control, with the median number of days to medical clearance for the experimental group 15.5 (versus 26 for the controls) and the median number of days to symptomatic recovery 13.5 for the experimental group (versus 17 for the controls). Several studies indicate that these interventions can be safely introduced within a few days to weeks post injury, with earlier initiation potentially resulting in better outcomes for patients.

Setting

2016 National Health Interview Survey.

Subjects and Methods

Responses from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey for children ages 3 to 17 years were examined to determine the prevalence of vestibular symptoms and provider-assigned diagnoses.

Results

Dizziness or imbalance was reported in 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–3.9) million patients (5.6%) with a mean age of 11.5 years. Dizziness was reported in 1.2 million patients (2.0%) with a mean age of 12.7 years and balance impairment in 2.3 million patients (3.7%) with a mean age of 10.6 years. Prevalence of dizziness and imbalance did not vary by sex (P = .6, P = .2). Evaluation by a health professional was reported for 42% of patients with dizziness and 43% of patients with imbalance, with diagnoses reported in 45% and 48% of patients with dizziness and imbalance, respectively. The most common diagnoses reported for dizziness were depression or child psychiatric disorder (12%), side effects from medications (11%), head/neck injury or concussion (8.4%), and developmental motor coordination disorder (8.3%). The most common diagnoses reported for imbalance were blurred vision with head motion, "bouncing" or rapid eye movements (9.1%), depression or child psychiatric disorder (6.2%), head/neck injury or concussion (6.1%), and side effects from medications (5.9%).

Conclusion

The national prevalence of childhood vestibular symptoms is more common than previously thought. Reported diagnoses varied greatly from the literature, suggesting a need for increased awareness of causes of vestibular symptoms in children.

### Concussive events: using the evidence to guide physical therapist practice [^116CTMdH]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Concussion (also called mild traumatic brain injury) can occur across the lifespan. Excessive force to the head, either through direct impact or force transmission through the body and neck, is a concussive event. After a concussive event, there can be injury not only to the brain, but also to other structures such as the cervical spine and vestibular system. The clinical practice guideline published in the April 2020 issue of JOSPT outlines the role of physical therapy examination and management after a concussive event.

### Reframing postconcussional syndrome as an interface disorder of neurology, psychiatry and psychology [^114k3Q4V]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic dizziness is another good example of symptom clustering. The commonest causes following mTBI are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (40%) and vestibular migraine (34%). Vestibular migraine is associated with other migrainous symptoms as discussed above but, perhaps surprisingly, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is also associated with cognitive impairments and heightened anxiety, especially if left untreated.

Relationship to psychiatric disorders

Mild TBI increases the risk of developing a subsequent psychiatric condition nearly threefold. However, trying to distinguish psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder from the effects of a mTBI can be challenging due to symptom overlap, yet has important implications for symptom persistence (Table 3). It is important to remember that symptom overlap can obscure diagnostic clarity, 50% of people with depression who have not had a TBI meet the criteria for moderate to severe PCS. Alongside the psychosocial impact of head injury, it is of course also possible for depression and anxiety to be related to structural brain injury, either as a result of macroscopic damage or triggering of a secondary inflammatory process.

Table 3
Diagnoses and important differentials for persistent symptoms post head injury from DSM-5

There also remains stigma surrounding mental health diagnoses, which results in a higher likelihood of misattributing the cognitive changes to the injury, rather than potentially reversible psychological or psychiatric causes. The unfortunate consequence of this is that appropriate, evidence-based treatment may not be accessed in a timely way, subsequently worsening the treatment responsiveness and prognosis of the psychiatric condition.

Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder

Functional neurological disorder is characterized by internal inconsistency, typically demonstrated by the complaint of abnormal function in a system that can be demonstrated (usually clinically, but sometimes by investigation) to be capable of normal function. Over 80% of people with functional neurological disorder report a health event near to the onset of functional symptoms. These events, which include accidental injuries, are typically minor and would be expected to improve and not produce lasting symptoms in their own right.

This preceding discussion clearly has relevance for the development of persistent symptoms after mTBI. The immediate and lasting physical and psychological consequences of accidents and injuries causing TBI could undoubtedly act as triggers to the onset of functional neurological disorder and/or somatic symptom disorder in some people, also interacting with pre-morbid risk factors and subsequent behaviours such as fear avoidance. Positive diagnosis of such symptoms is possible within normal clinical practice, and diagnostic explanation according to best practice is typically a positive and empowering experience for patients.

### Is skull fracture associated with post-traumatic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo? An observational study [^111RoZU6]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular dysfunction (resulting in dizziness and imbalance) is common in acute traumatic brain injury (aTBI). The most frequently diagnosed cause of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in aTBI is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, post-traumatic BPPV is often undiagnosed and left untreated in these patients.

Objectives

To investigate clinical risk factors for BPPV in patients experiencing aTBI.

Methods

Patients were recruited from three Major Trauma Centres in London. Logistic regression was used to derive the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of diagnosed BPPV for sex, categorised age, severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and site of skull fracture.

Results

166 patients with aTBI were included. Approximately a third (n = 55; 33.1%) tested positive for BPPV. Compared to patients aged less than or equal to 40 years, those aged 41 to 64 years were more likely to experience BPPV (aOR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.47 to 10.16; p = 0.006), as were those aged 65 years and above (4.41; 1.52 to 12.81; p = 0.006). Patients that experienced both facial and cranial skull fracture were more likely to experience BPPV than those that didn't have a skull fracture (23.64; 6.36 to 87.89; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The risk of post-traumatic BPPV increased with increasing age, plus in those with combined skull and facial fractures when compared to those without a skull fracture. We advocate routine BPPV screening of those with aTBI, especially in older adults and those with combined facial and skull fractures.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113EtkmY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.

### Post-concussive vestibular dysfunction is related to injury to the inferior vestibular nerve [^1132FKhM]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

An SRC may induce a multitude of pathologies in the peripheral and/or central parts of the vestibular system. Establishing an etiology of the impairment is crucial because it may guide intervention and clinical management. Our study, investigating both central and peripheral dysfunction, strongly implies a peripheral nerve dysfunction associated with vestibular dysfunction in athletes with SRC who have persistent post-concussive symptoms.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^113iuHYp]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Vestibular/oculomotor

Persisting oculomotor symptoms may occur, and pre-exist, coexist with and/or result from SRC. Oculomotor symptoms are detected through history and physical examination including validated oculomotor tests. Mitigating risk factors include pre-existing vestibular dysfunction (eg, motion sickness). Specialists including vestibular rehabilitation therapist, otolaryngologist and audiologist may be considered.

It is essential that the team physician understand:

Most athletes with SRC recover within the typical timeframe.
PSaSRC is defined as symptoms lasting beyond the typical recovery time.
Immediate removal from play after a concussion may decrease the risk for PSaSRC.

It is desirable that the team physician understand:

Athletes with PSaSRC should have a thorough evaluation for other etiologies of their symptoms.
Prolonged strict physical and cognitive rest are not recommended because it increases the risk for PSaSRC.
Treatment for athletes with PSaSRC is symptom-targeted and may require a multidisciplinary team.
Pharmacologic treatment is used rarely in SRC and selectively for PSaSRC.
The most common risk factors associated with developing PSaSRC include a pre-existing mood disorder and high symptom load immediately after injury.
The various symptom-targeted treatments shown to be effective for PSaSRC.
Early individualised subsymptom threshold exercise training may reduce the risk for developing PSaSRC.

### Vestibular dysfunction in acute traumatic brain injury [^115ibiGJ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the commonest cause of disability in under-40-year-olds. Vestibular features of dizziness (illusory self-motion) or imbalance which affects 50% of TBI patients at 5 years, increases unemployment threefold in TBI survivors. Unfortunately, vestibular diagnoses are cryptogenic in 25% of chronic TBI cases, impeding therapy. We hypothesized that chronic adaptive brain mechanisms uncouple vestibular symptoms from signs. This predicts a masking of vestibular diagnoses chronically but not acutely. Hence, defining the spectrum of vestibular diagnoses in acute TBI should clarify vestibular diagnoses in chronic TBI. There are, however, no relevant acute TBI data. Of 111 Major Trauma Ward adult admissions screened (median 38-years-old), 96 patients (87%) had subjective dizziness (illusory self-motion) and/or objective imbalance were referred to the senior author (BMS). Symptoms included: feeling unbalanced (58%), headache (50%) and dizziness (40%). In the 47 cases assessed by BMS, gait ataxia was the commonest sign (62%) with half of these cases denying imbalance when asked. Diagnoses included BPPV (38%), acute peripheral unilateral vestibular loss (19%), and migraine phenotype headache (34%), another potential source of vestibular symptoms. In acute TBI, vestibular signs are common, with gait ataxia being the most frequent one. However, patients underreport symptoms. The uncoupling of symptoms from signs likely arises from TBI affecting perceptual mechanisms. Hence, the cryptogenic nature of vestibular symptoms in TBI (acute or chronic) relates to a complex interaction between injury (to peripheral and central vestibular structures and perceptual mechanisms) and brain-adaptation, emphasizing the need for acute prospective, mechanistic studies.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^116unbMg]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common and disabling condition, with prevalence increasing with advancing age. It typically causes positional dizziness but is also common in those with balance abnormalities and falls without the typical dizziness. It is an underdiagnosed problem, which can lead to reduced quality of life, depression and increased falls risk. Whilst the diagnosis and treatment of the commonest form of BPPV (posterior canal) is straightforward in robust and younger populations, this is frequently not the case in people with multiple long-term conditions or frailty. Barriers to diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in each of the three canals can be overcome with simple practical measures, which are presented here. Given the lack of good quality evidence in this area, this best practise article presents evidence, where it exists, alongside expert clinical experience.

### The difficult concussion patient: what is the best approach to investigation and management of persistent (> 10 days) postconcussive symptoms? [^1142iYVA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concussion in sport typically recovers clinically within 10 days of injury. In some cases, however, symptoms may be prolonged or complications may develop. The objectives of the current paper are to review the literature regarding the difficult concussion and to provide recommendations for an approach to the investigation and management of patients with persistent symptoms.

Methods

A qualitative review of the literature on concussion in sport was conducted with a focus on prolonged recovery, long-term complications and management including investigation and treatment strategies. MEDLINE and Sports Discus databases were reviewed.

Results

Persistent symptoms (> 10 days) are generally reported in 10–15% of concussions. This figure may be higher in certain sports (eg, ice hockey) and populations (eg, children). In general, symptoms are not specific to concussion and it is important to consider and manage coexistent pathologies. Investigations may include formal neuropsychological testing and conventional neuroimaging to exclude structural pathology. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine clinical use of advanced neuroimaging techniques or genetics markers. Preliminary studies demonstrate the potential benefit of subsymptom threshold activity as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation programme. Limited research is available on pharmacological interventions.

Conclusions

Cases of concussion in sport where clinical recovery falls outside the expected window (ie, 10 days) should be managed in a multidisciplinary manner by healthcare providers with experience in sports-related concussion. Important components of management, after the initial period of physical and cognitive rest, include associated therapies such as cognitive, vestibular, physical and psychological therapy, assessment for other causes of prolonged symptoms and consideration of a graded exercise programme at a level that does not exacerbate symptoms.

### Vestibular agnosia in traumatic brain injury and its link to imbalance [^113xtWvY]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Vestibular dysfunction, causing dizziness and imbalance, is a common yet poorly understood feature in patients with TBI. Damage to the inner ear, nerve, brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres may all affect vestibular functioning, hence, a multi-level assessment-from reflex to perception-is required. In a previous report, postural instability was the commonest neurological feature in ambulating acute patients with TBI. During ward assessment, we also frequently observe a loss of vertigo sensation in patients with acute TBI, common inner ear conditions and a related vigorous vestibular-ocular reflex nystagmus, suggesting a 'vestibular agnosia'. Patients with vestibular agnosia were also more unbalanced; however, the link between vestibular agnosia and imbalance was confounded by the presence of inner ear conditions. We investigated the brain mechanisms of imbalance in acute TBI, its link with vestibular agnosia, and potential clinical impact, by prospective laboratory assessment of vestibular function, from reflex to perception, in patients with preserved peripheral vestibular function. Assessment included: vestibular reflex function, vestibular perception by participants' report of their passive yaw rotations in the dark, objective balance via posturography, subjective symptoms via questionnaires, and structural neuroimaging. We prospectively screened 918 acute admissions, assessed 146 and recruited 37. Compared to 37 matched controls, patients showed elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds (patients 12.92°/s versus 3.87°/s) but normal vestibular-ocular reflex thresholds (patients 2.52°/s versus 1.78°/s). Patients with elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds [3 standard deviations (SD) above controls' average], were designated as having vestibular agnosia, and displayed worse posturography than non-vestibular-agnosia patients, despite no difference in vestibular symptom scores. Only in patients with impaired postural control (3 SD above controls' mean), whole brain diffusion tensor voxel-wise analysis showed elevated mean diffusivity (and trend lower fractional anisotropy) in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe that correlated with vestibular agnosia severity. Thus, impaired balance and vestibular agnosia are co-localized to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe. Finally, a clinical audit showed a sevenfold reduction in clinician recognition of a common peripheral vestibular condition (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) in acute patients with clinically apparent vestibular agnosia. That vestibular agnosia patients show worse balance, but without increased dizziness symptoms, explains why clinicians may miss treatable vestibular diagnoses in these patients. In conclusion, vestibular agnosia mediates imbalance in traumatic brain injury both directly via white matter tract damage in the right temporal lobe, and indirectly via reduced clinical recognition of common, treatable vestibular diagnoses.

Visual symptoms following concussion

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the primary cause of trauma-related long-term or permanent disability worldwide. It is categorised as mild, moderate and severe, with 90% of all TBIs being mild to moderate. In a mild TBI (mTBI), the most acute symptoms are headache, nausea, dizziness and double vision. Approximately one-half of the brain is devoted to visual processing, and deficits in eye movement and affect recognition are among the impairments reported to arise from mTBI. With mTBI, both the afferent and efferent visual pathways can be damaged, disrupting vision.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a subset of mTBI and accounts for 20% of all TBIs.SRC is an evolving injury in the acute phase, with rapidly changing clinical signs and symptoms, which may reflect the underlying physiological injury in the brain and is among the most complex injuries in sports medicine to diagnose, assess and manage. These symptoms can be cognitive, physical, emotional and sleep disturbances. Overall, 80%–90% of SRCs typically resolve within 7–10 days. However, symptoms can persist for weeks to months in a small subset of athletes. Nearly 30% of concussed athletes report visual problems during the first week after the injuryand the visual impairments can be caused by accommodative, oculomotor and binocular dysfunction. Visual processing can be disrupted and create issues with balance and hand-eye coordination. Vision can be compromised because of injury to one or both optic nerves, impaired visual processing in diffuse brain injury, or limitation in eye movements because of dysfunction of cranial nerves. Ocular motor impairments and symptoms may manifest as blurred vision, diplopia, impaired eye movements, dizziness, photophobia, headaches, ocular pain, difficulty in reading and poor visual-based concentration. Among the most common of these are photophobia and its migraine-like symptoms. Dizziness, which may represent an underlying impairment of the vestibular or ocular motor systems, is reported by 50% of concussed athletesand is associated with a 6.4- times greater risk in predicting protracted (> 21 days) recovery. Prolonged recovery can also be seen when fogginess and blurred vision are present.

Sports medicine physicians are uniquely positioned to diagnose, manage and treat SRC. The need for a multidisciplinary team is widely accepted and viewed as a critical approach to treating SRC's multifactorial signs and symptoms (online supplemental appendix 2 — Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening).

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^113tS2tL]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

While post-concussive dizziness is common, a variety of other treatable etiologies of dizziness should be considered including VM, BPPV, and PPPD. It is recognized that post-traumatic headache can include migraine, and there can be significant overlap between PCS and VM given symptoms of headache, photophobia, phonophobia, fatigue, and visual complaints in both. This makes the history especially important with particular attention to identifying classic migraine triggers and understanding the temporal relationship between dizziness, headaches, photophobia, and phonophobia. These symptoms occurring after concussion in a spontaneous episodic manner may more likely be VM, meanwhile a slow improvement over time with some fluctuations may more likely be PCS. It is also common that VM and PCS co-exist or cannot be teased apart.

Practically speaking, medications such as TCAs and gabapentin may be beneficial for both VM and PCS, and can be prescribed empirically even when the diagnosis is in question. Otherwise, the potential risks and benefits should be weighed in each individual patient – e.g. avoid topiramate as a migraine preventive in a patient with cognitive dysfunction due to PCS or avoid propranolol as a migraine preventive in a patient with significant fatigue due to PCS. Inversely, a TCA may be considered in a patient with features of VM and PCS whose symptoms of dizziness are dominated by co-existing anxiety, insomnia, and headaches.

### Chronic dizziness: the interface between psychiatry and neuro-otology [^111sDAEy]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This paper reviews the often-enigmatic relationships between dizziness and psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric causes of dizziness, neuro-otologic causes of anxiety, underrecognized co-morbid conditions, and medical illnesses that masquerade as 'psychogenic' dizziness are examined. Key clinical features and data from recent treatment trials are presented with potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Recent Findings

Investigations at the interface between psychiatry and neuro-otology have identified the distinguishing features of several clinical conditions that present with non-vertiginous dizziness, subjective imbalance, and psychiatric symptoms. The most common condition is chronic subjective dizziness; a refinement of earlier concepts of psychogenic dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and space-motion phobia. Chronic subjective dizziness is consistent with advancing research on anxiety and somatoform disorders and offers greater insights into the relationships between neuro-otologic illnesses and anxiety. Migraine, post-concussional syndrome, and dysautonomias also cause persistent dizziness and may be misdiagnosed or malingering or psychogenic dizziness because they often present with comorbid psychiatric symptoms in the absence of identifiable vestibular deficits.

Summary

Recent research has defined the key features of several medical-psychiatric conditions that cause chronic dizziness, permitting greater diagnostic precision and insight into underlying pathophysiologic processes. Treatment studies have identified potentially effective interventions, which must be evaluated in controlled clinical trials.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^113RKfLA]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) guideline — non-pharmacologic management of dizziness and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) notes that non-pharmacologic interventions for posttraumatic dizziness may be useful as an alternative to or in conjunction with pharmacotherapies, although the effectiveness of such interventions is not fully established with mTBI; patients with vestibular disorders who received customized programs showed greater improvement than those who received generic exercises, and studies utilizing vestibular exercises have shown up to an 85% success rate in reducing symptoms and improving function in the population with peripheral vestibular disorders. With mTBI, recovery of vestibular lesions is often limited or protracted due to the coexistence of central or psychological disorders, and evidence is limited regarding the benefits of specific vestibular exercises for patients with a history of mTBI and psychological co-occurring symptoms. For BPPV, knowledge of canalith repositioning and liberatory maneuvers is beneficial for primary care physicians, clinicians should perform the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll tests to assess for BPPV, radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, and routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications is not recommended, and patients whose symptoms do not fully resolve after one trial of a canalith repositioning maneuver may be sent to a vestibular rehabilitation therapist for further specialized BPPV assessment and treatment. In cases of persistent dizziness and disequilibrium, a vestibular rehabilitation therapist may also be utilized to execute a more comprehensive vestibular and balance evaluation and treatment program, patients with central, functional, and psychological disorders need a coordinated team effort, and if an individual appears to be at fall risk due to symptoms of dizziness and disequilibrium, referral for home evaluation for adaptive equipment should also be considered as a compensatory strategy to limit further injury.

### Clinical symptom clusters, neurocognitive function, balance and vestibulo-ocular function in athletes with sport-related concussion [^111oCq6M]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a frequent injury with an estimated incidence of 1.6–3.8 million per year in the United States. The clinical presentation of SRC is highly heterogeneous. It can include a wide range of clinical signs and symptoms, which may affect the domains of headache/migraine, fatigue, cognition, anxiety/mood, vestibular or ocular. Due to the complexity and variability of the injury, the diagnosis of SRC is challenging, and there is no objective clinical test or marker that can be used in isolation to diagnose concussion. Therefore, a multimodal assessment that covers all potentially affected domains is recommended.

One commonly affected domain is neurocognitive functioning, which may include deficits in reaction time, memory or executive function. Many patients also present with balance problems and/or impaired vestibulo-ocular function, for example, objectively manifested in changes in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Objective tests of these functions (eg, neurocognitive test batteries, computerised vestibulo-ocular tests, objective balance tests) can be used in addition to the clinical examination and may aid in facilitating the diagnosis or monitoring recovery. However, a single test may not be able to discriminate between SRC and healthy athletes, as patients may not be affected in all domains.

In this context, grouping symptoms according to clinical profiles may facilitate a systematic evaluation of symptoms. These clinical profiles may include the symptom clusters headache/migraine, fatigue, cognitive, anxiety/mood, vestibular or ocular. While some patients present with a single cluster only, SRC is more commonly associated with a combination of several clusters. Recognition of these symptom clusters can potentially help to develop a more targeted assessment and treatment of symptoms. Especially for athletes, this could be highly important and may contribute to optimising management and rehabilitation outcomes, for example, during the return-to-sport process. It has already been shown that certain symptom profiles are associated with a longer duration of symptoms or recovery, but the specific symptom clusters related to symptom/recovery duration differed between studies. Different risk factors may also be associated with specific symptom clusters. Investigating SRC-related impairments specifically for patients presenting with certain symptom clusters could therefore provide more information than investigating the whole cohort of patients. Additionally, it may provide insight into the relationship and dependency of different clinical clusters.

Therefore, this study investigates whether neurocognitive function, balance, and vestibulo-ocular performance are impaired in athletes with SRC, depending on clinical symptom clusters.

Dizziness and disequilibrium — medication review in post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) emphasizes identifying drugs that can cause dizziness and investigating timing and dosing relative to symptom onset. A detailed medication history is warranted as numerous medications include dizziness as a potential side effect, and the following classes are particularly important to consider: stimulants, benzodiazepines, tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tetracyclics, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, selective serotonin agonists, beta blockers, and cholinesterase inhibitors. The temporal relationship to the onset of dizziness and the initiation and dosing of these medications should be investigated.

### Prevalence of orthostatic autonomic dysregulation in pediatric concussion [^111P5GXV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In this study, approximately 25% of patients experienced symptom provocation, which aligns with previous studies, but is slightly lower than reported prevalence rates. Active standing tests in pediatric studies found symptom provocation rates ranging from more than one-third to nearly one-half, although time since injury varied. Importantly, the minimal overlap between AD and symptom provocation suggests distinct underlying mechanisms, further supported by distinct clinical profiles. This finding underscores the need to explore orthostatic intolerance within the broader spectrum of postconcussion symptoms. Contributing factors such as vestibular dysfunction, anxiety, and cervical spine injury likely play a role, emphasizing the importance of understanding the interplay to improve diagnosis, guide management, and optimize recovery.

The higher symptom burden observed in patients reporting symptom provocation, despite no association with objective AD, suggests that provocation may indicate broader concussion effects rather than underlying AD alone. This dissociation could reflect general physiological stress response postconcussion, heightened symptom sensitivity or altered interoception, or a disruption in other physiological systems that influence comfort. Psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression may increase sensitivity to somatic sensations, as supported by evidence of elevated anxietyand catastrophizing in adolescents with POTS. Moreover, impaired vestibulo-ocular reflex, balance control issues, visual motion sensitivity, and cervicogenic symptoms are common postconcussion and may contribute to dizziness or nausea during unsupported postural changes. Altered systems may act independently or interactively, amplifying symptoms. Although not assessed herein, these potential mechanisms underscore the importance of comprehensive clinical assessment.

Interestingly, unlike the predominance of females in POTS, we observed no significant female predominance in AD after concussion. This finding is consistent with a study of patients aged 8 to 25 years presenting to a specialty clinic for concussion that found a similar prevalence of orthostatic tachycardia in the sexes. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of postconcussion orthostatic tachycardia may differ from that of POTS.

### Cervicovestibular rehabilitation in sport-related concussion: a randomised controlled trial [^115BqsT2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

Concussion is a common injury in sport. Most individuals recover in 7–10days but some have persistent symptoms. The objective of this study was to determine if a combination of vestibular rehabilitation and cervical spine physiotherapy decreased the time until medical clearance in individuals with prolonged postconcussion symptoms.

Methods

This study was a randomised controlled trial. Consecutive patients with persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following a sport-related concussion (12–30years, 18 male and 13 female) were randomised to the control or intervention group. Both groups received weekly sessions with a physiotherapist for 8weeks or until the time of medical clearance. Both groups received postural education, range of motion exercises and cognitive and physical rest until asymptomatic followed by a protocol of graded exertion. The intervention group also received cervical spine and vestibular rehabilitation. The primary outcome of interest was medical clearance to return to sport, which was evaluated by a study sport medicine physician who was blinded to the treatment group.

Results

In the treatment group, 73% (11/15) of the participants were medically cleared within 8weeks of initiation of treatment, compared with 7% (1/14) in the control group. Using an intention to treat analysis, individuals in the treatment group were 3.91 (95% CI 1.34 to 11.34) times more likely to be medically cleared by 8weeks.

Conclusions

A combination of cervical and vestibular physiotherapy decreased time to medical clearance to return to sport in youth and young adults with persistent symptoms of dizziness, neck pain and/or headaches following a sport-related concussion.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^1142Ay3Z]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Persisting symptoms after SRC

The majority of athletes with SRC recover within the typical timeframe, currently defined as 2 weeks for adults and up to 4 weeks for children. PSaSRC is defined as symptoms that last longer than the typical timeframe.

The pathophysiology underlying PSaSRC is not entirely understood. It is thought PSaSRC is not caused by a single pathologic process, but rather an interaction of postinjury symptoms that are complicated by pre-existing, coexisting and/or resulting biopsychosocial factors.

It is important to perform a thorough evaluation for other etiologies of the symptoms, such that these may be identified and treated appropriately.

Factors that may be associated with greater odds of developing PSaSRC include:

High symptom load immediately after injury
Prolonged strict cognitive and physical rest (more than a few days) after the concussion
Unrecognised, untreated or inadequately treated initial SRC.
Suffering another direct impact to the head or from transmitted (indirect) forces from the body to the head while still symptomatic from a concussion.
Personal or family history of migraine or mood disorder
Premorbid diagnosis of learning difficulties
Family and social stressors
Increased baseline level of SRC symptoms (pre-SRC)

Of all these risk factors, pre-existing mood disorder and high symptom load immediately after injury have been shown to be the most consistent predictors of PSaSRC.

Athletes who are removed from activity immediately after the injury seem to be less likely to develop PSaSRC than those who continue to play immediately after the injury.

Risk for PSaSRC may be reduced by removing the athlete from play immediately after the injury, instituting relative physical and cognitive rest for the first 24–48 hours, and then gradually resuming usual activities that do not exacerbate symptoms.

Early individualised subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise training may reduce the risk for developing PSaSRC.

Treatment of persisting symptoms after SRC

With treatment(s), most athletes with PSaSRC will recover without any long-term sequelae. A small percentage may experience long-term symptoms or deficits.

Athletes with PSaSRC require symptom-targeted treatment which may involve a multidisciplinary team. Treatments that have been shown to be effective in facilitating recovery of specific symptoms for athletes with PSaSRC include cervical spine rehabilitation, subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise training, vestibular and oculomotor therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, academic adjustments and lifestyle adjustments involving sleep, nutrition and hydration. Pharmacologic treatment is used rarely in SRC and selectively for PSaSRC.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^114jFgTe]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that clinical, bedside assessment and treatment of acute post-traumatic BPPV is safe and practical. Trial progression criteria were met, supporting the advancement to a multi-centre effectiveness trial. Repositioning manoeuvres demonstrated a superior resolution rate, but high rates of BPPV recurrence mean optimal timing of treatment remains unclear. BPPV resolution was associated with improved gait speed (itself linked to lower fall risk), while active BPPV was linked to falls. Thus, treating post-traumatic BPPV may modify fall risk.

### Do physical interventions improve outcomes following concussion: a systematic review and meta-analysis? [^111KYFMc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of physical interventions (subthreshold aerobic exercise, cervical, vestibular and/or oculomotor therapies) on days to recovery and symptom scores in the management of concussion.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, CINAHL, Embase, SportDiscus, Cochrane library, Scopus and PEDro.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of participants with concussion that evaluated the effect of subthreshold aerobic exercise, cervical, vestibular and/or oculomotor therapies on days to recovery/return to activity, symptom scores, balance, gait and/or exercise capacity.

Results

Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria: 7 on subthreshold aerobic exercise, 1 on vestibular therapy, 1 on cervical therapy and 3 on individually tailored multimodal interventions. The trials were of fair to excellent quality on the PEDro scale. Eight trials were included in the quantitative analysis. Subthreshold aerobic exercise had a significant small to moderate effect in improving symptom scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.43, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.67, p = 0.001, I² = 0%) but not in reducing days to symptom recovery in both acutely concussed individuals and those with persistent symptoms (SMD = 0.19, 95%CI -0.54 to 0.93, p = 0.61, I² = 52%). There was limited evidence for stand-alone cervical, vestibular and oculomotor therapies. Concussed individuals with persistent symptoms (> 2 weeks) were approximately 3 times more likely to have returned to sport by 8 weeks (relative risk = 3.29, 95%CI 0.30 to 35.69, p = 0.33, I² = 83%) if they received individually tailored, presentation-specific multimodal interventions (cervical, vestibular and oculo-motor therapy). In addition, the multimodal interventions had a moderate effect in improving symptom scores (SMD = 0.63, 95%CI 0.11 to 1.15, p = 0.02, I² = 0%) when compared with control.

Conclusions

Subthreshold aerobic exercise appears to lower symptom scores but not time to recovery in concussed individuals. Individually tailored multimodal interventions have a worthwhile effect in providing faster return to sport and clinical improvement, specifically in those with persistent symptoms.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^111aGeap]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD post-acute mild traumatic brain injury — vestibular and proprioceptive symptoms: We suggest that patients with persistent symptoms of dizziness and imbalance attributed to mild traumatic brain injury be offered a trial of specific vestibular rehabilitation and proprioceptive therapeutic exercise (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The Work Group reviewed two RCTs that suggested specific vestibular and proprioceptive therapeutic exercises may help reduce dizziness symptom severity and improve functional independence in the short term, although there were serious limitations (i.e., high risk of bias, small sample size), which led to concerns about the precision of the estimates reported. Benefits slightly outweigh harms/burdens with participation in specific vestibular therapy, and vestibular/balance therapy should be encouraged in patients with unresolved symptoms of dizziness or imbalance that persist beyond the acute phase (see the Algorithm, Module A: Initial Presentation (> 7 Days Post-Injury)). There is low risk of harm with participation in vestibular rehabilitation. However, the Work Group discourages a prolonged course of therapy in the absence of patient improvement to mitigate negative illness expectations. To minimize the potential negative effects of protracted, ineffective treatment, the Work Group suggests goal-based, functional re-assessment to determine treatment responsiveness by a vestibular rehabilitation provider (i.e., physical therapist or occupational therapist). It is preferred that the rehabilitation provider has acquired post-graduate training specific to vestibular rehabilitation, providers should consider patient preferences, which likely vary, and provocation of symptoms to a moderate level should be expected by patients participating in vestibular rehabilitation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population and testing

This study was approved by our local Institutional Review Board, and all subjects provided informed consent. Then, 27 healthy control subjects (15 females, mean ± SD age 28.50 ± 6.44 years) and 18 patients with subacute PCVD (12 female, age 23.43 ± 4.90 years) were selected for participation in this study (see Table 1). Inclusion criteria for PCVD subjects included (a) a diagnosis of concussion, as defined by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma Task Force (Carroll et al; Kristman et al.), occurring 4–12 weeks prior to enrollment; and (b) clinical evidence for vestibular impairment, including subjective report of dizziness and/or imbalance or abnormal VOMS scores. Prospective participants with abnormal balance but no balance or VOMS abnormalities were not recruited. Exclusion criteria for all subjects were age < 16 years or history of moderate or severe head injury, intracranial hemorrhage, seizure disorder, prior neurological surgery, peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal injuries affecting gait and balance, or chronic drug or alcohol use. Subjects with abnormal head impulse testing or videonystagmography consistent with peripheral vestibular hypofunction or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were also excluded.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^116KpPw6]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

We found an unexpectedly high rate of falls in our cohort despite the young average age of participants, with 11/58 (18.9%) patients reporting a fall during the trial. 7 of the 11 fallers (63.6%) had BPPV at the time of their falls. Falls were equally distributed among treatment groups. Age or gait speed did not differ between fallers and non-fallers; however, non-fallers were able to maintain static balance for a longer duration compared with fallers (95% CI 0.13 to 10.15 p = 0.04) (figure 3).

Self-reported measures

Patients with resolved BPPV demonstrated significant reductions in subjective dizziness scores compared with baseline (p = 0.01), whereas dizziness scores remained unchanged in those without BPPV resolution (online supplemental figure 1). Similarly, Mann–Whitney U-test noted there was a significant different balance confidence (as reported by ABC scores) between baseline and follow-up in those with resolved BPPV (60% to 87%, W = 44, p = 0.04), while differences in those with unresolved BPPV did not show differences (75% to 76.2%, W = 191, p = 0.6). Health status as measured by the EQ-5D index score noted significant improvements in those with resolved BPPV (p = 0.04) but no difference in those with unresolved BPPV (p = 0.2). Mood scores improved significantly in those with both resolved and unresolved BPPV. No significant differences were noted in quality-of-life scores between those with resolved and unresolved BPPV. There were no effects of treatment group on any of the self-reported measures.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^114SbFtg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^112G4QF8]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Measures

Baseline demographics were recorded, including age, gender, mechanism and severity of the head injury, functional status and falls. Primary outcome measures related to feasibility objectives: number of eligible patients, recruitment and retention rates, adverse events and variability in intervention fidelity. Secondary outcomes were collected at baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment and 12 weeks post-treatment and comprised the diagnostic tests for both posterior and horizontal canal BPPV to ascertain resolution and/or recurrence, self-reported measures and objective measures. Recurrence of BPPV was defined as a positive Dix–Hallpike or supine head roll test at the 4- or 12-week follow-up, preceded by a documented negative test (either following treatment or at 4-week follow-up). Self-reported measures included those relating to dizziness and balance (Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scaleand the UCLA Dizziness questionnaire), mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale), health outcome (EQ-5D))and TBI recovery measures (Glasgow Coma Outcome Scoreand Quality of Life after Brain Injury). Bedside objective balance measures included the modified clinical test of sensory interaction in balanceand the modified dynamic gait index; an eight-item measure comprising tasks such as 6 m usual speed ambulation without and with horizontal and vertical head turns. The complete range of measures and the time points at which they were completed are noted in online supplemental table 1).

Statistical analysis

A power calculation was not performed before this study as the primary aim was to assess feasibility. Normality of data was assessed using graphical and statistical methods. For normally distributed data, the means and SD are reported. For non-normally distributed data, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) are reported. χ² or Fisher's exact tests were used to analyse data pertaining to skull fractures (using participants with and without BPPV) and BPPV resolution. Analysis of skull fracture data was completed using data from hospital CT reports. Odds ratios (OR) were used to evaluate categorical frequency. Mann–Whitney U test (non-normally distributed data) and two-way mixed analysis of variance, where group refers to the between-subject factors (manoeuvres vs Brandt–Daroff vs advice) and time refers to the within-subject factors (baseline vs follow-up), analysed treatment effects. Analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (2022.12.0; R Core Team 2021).

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^1165tamF]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Due to a paucity of data relating to trauma settings, treatment of post-traumatic BPPV is based on guidelines developed specifically for idiopathic BPPV. Post-traumatic BPPV differs from idiopathic BPPV in that it is linked to (1) vestibular agnosia (an attenuated vertigo sensation),(2) frequent recurrence and multi-canal involvementand (3) co-occurrence with other vestibular diagnoses. Previous animal model research has suggested post-traumatic BPPV is linked to acute disruption of the inner ear ultrastructure, which persists up to 3 months following injury, thus potentially rendering a single manoeuvre delivered acutely ineffective. Further, studies conducted in idiopathic BPPV have noted links between inflammatory markers and the presence and recurrence of BPPV. Although there is little data regarding inflammatory markers in post-traumatic BPPV, there is literature on persisting pathological inflammation post-TBI. It is thus possible that a post-TBI inflammatory state may affect responses to BPPV treatment.

Thus, given the lack of evidence regarding the assessment and treatment of post-traumatic BPPV, we aimed to determine the safety, practicability and efficacy of managing this common condition, as well as the feasibility of conducting a future effectiveness trial.
