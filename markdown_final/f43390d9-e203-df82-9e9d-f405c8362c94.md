## Question

management of exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of COPD exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its impact. Then, I should verify the initial assessment and differential diagnosis. Next, I will stratify severity and decide on the care setting. After that, I need to outline core pharmacologic treatments, including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics, and confirm dosing and duration. Then, I should review ventilatory support indications and techniques. I will also consider special populations and comorbidities, and finally address prevention, follow-up, and implementation details, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its significance. COPD exacerbations are acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional therapy, with substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost; they accelerate lung function decline and degrade quality of life, and more than 80% are managed as outpatients, though severe events require hospitalization and carry higher risk of readmission and death [^0b500c7d] [^27a42c82] [^25761199].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities. I need to ensure we exclude mimics that can present similarly: pneumonia, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and asthma overlap. A chest radiograph is reasonable when the diagnosis is uncertain or when new focal signs are present, and I should remember that COPD patients frequently have comorbidities that complicate presentation and prognosis [^0b500c7d] [^c25bdd85] [^2bc50d5f].

> I should confirm severity stratification and care setting next. Severity guides location of care: mild cases can be managed in the community with increased bronchodilators, moderate cases often need oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, and severe cases require emergency evaluation and often hospitalization; GOLD defines severe as requiring ED visit or hospitalization and notes that severe exacerbations may involve acute respiratory failure, which mandates closer monitoring and consideration of ventilatory support [^27a42c82] [^25761199].

> Next, I will examine core pharmacologic therapy, starting with bronchodilators. Short-acting inhaled beta-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are first-line to relieve symptoms; I should initiate or optimize long-acting bronchodilators during recovery to reduce future risk, and I need to check inhaler technique at every opportunity because device errors are common and undermine outcomes [^53c9ba8b] [^d4d0182f] [^034b4931].

> Hold on, I should verify corticosteroid dosing and duration. Systemic corticosteroids improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery and hospitalization; a 5-day course is usually sufficient, with 30–40 mg prednisone equivalent daily by mouth preferred if GI function allows, and longer courses do not add benefit while increasing adverse effects such as hyperglycemia; I initially thought 7–10 days might be better, but wait, guidelines and high-quality evidence support ≤ 5 days in most cases [^bc848390] [^89aa9f94] [^f9b201f2].

> I need to check antibiotic indications carefully. Antibiotics are indicated when there is increased sputum purulence plus increased volume and/or dyspnea, or when mechanical ventilation is required; typical empiric choices include amoxicillin–clavulanate, macrolides, tetracyclines, or respiratory fluoroquinolones based on local resistance, and a 5-day course is generally adequate; I should avoid reflex antibiotics in the absence of bacterial features to support stewardship [^d6fce20b] [^388209fb] [^d4d0182f].

> Let me consider ventilatory support, because this is where errors can be costly. Noninvasive ventilation is first-line for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in the absence of absolute contraindications, improving gas exchange, reducing intubation, shortening hospital stay, and improving survival; I should target SpO₂ 88–92% in hypercapnic patients to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia, and if NIV fails or is contraindicated, escalate to invasive ventilation with a plan to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and intrinsic PEEP [^d99d1768] [^a4c255f5] [^a9180eac] [^ed8e4fc9].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly or has significant comorbidities? I should double-check for frailty, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy, and tailor dosing and monitoring accordingly; older adults have higher risks of steroid-induced delirium and glycemic excursions, so I will prefer oral steroids, monitor glucose closely, and consider shorter antibiotic courses when appropriate, while still applying the same evidence-based principles [^3dcdc2ea] [^89aa9f94] [^d6fce20b].

> Next, I should review prevention during and after the exacerbation, because this is a teachable moment. Initiate or optimize long-acting bronchodilators, consider ICS only in frequent exacerbators with eosinophilia or persistent exacerbations despite LABA/LAMA, and arrange pulmonary rehabilitation within about 3 weeks post-discharge; I should also screen for vaccination status, smoking cessation support, and self-management education with action plans, which reduce future events and improve care transitions [^d4d0182f] [^4fe98a1f] [^166bfb2f] [^be29e2ba].

> I will now examine implementation and follow-up details that reduce failures. Discharge bundles should include medication reconciliation, inhaler technique verification with teach-back, written action plan, oxygen saturation monitoring if hypoxic, and follow-up within 7 days; I should confirm that the primary care team receives a concise summary and that the patient understands when to seek urgent care, as communication gaps are common and drive readmissions [^1194d0c8] [^ab8db19b] [^feb0f551].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about novel strategies without evidence. While precision approaches and biomarkers are promising, they are not yet ready for routine care; I should acknowledge heterogeneity and the need for individualized therapy, but continue to apply guideline-concordant care while monitoring emerging data on phenotypes and treatable traits [^336252de] [^da6ed2e8] [^70d2897f].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, stratify severity to choose the right setting, deliver core therapies with correct dosing and duration, deploy NIV promptly when indicated, and seize the opportunity to prevent recurrence through optimized maintenance therapy, rehabilitation, and education. This aligns with GOLD and ATS/ERS guidance and maximizes the chance of faster recovery and fewer future exacerbations [^53c9ba8b] [^d4d0182f] [^0e391d55].

---

The cornerstone of COPD exacerbation management is **short-acting bronchodilators** (SABA ± SAMA) for rapid symptom relief [^53c9ba8b], with **systemic corticosteroids** (≤ 5 days) to improve lung function, oxygenation, and shorten recovery [^bc848390] [^f9b201f2], and **antibiotics** (≤ 5 days) when sputum is purulent or there is increased dyspnea/volume, to reduce relapse and hospitalization [^d6fce20b] [^388209fb]. Noninvasive ventilation is indicated for **acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** to reduce intubation and mortality [^d99d1768] [^42fec73b]. Supportive care includes controlled oxygen (target SpO2 88–92%) [^a9180eac], hydration, and thromboprophylaxis. After stabilization, optimize long-acting bronchodilators, consider ICS if frequent exacerbations or eosinophilia, and arrange pulmonary rehabilitation within 3 weeks [^4fe98a1f] [^166bfb2f]; provide self-management education and address comorbidities to prevent recurrence [^be29e2ba] [^2bc50d5f].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Bronchodilators

- **Short-acting bronchodilators**: SABA (e.g. albuterol) ± SAMA (e.g. ipratropium) are first-line for rapid symptom relief and improved airflow [^53c9ba8b] [^d4d0182f].
- **Long-acting bronchodilators**: Initiate or optimize LABA/LAMA during recovery to reduce future exacerbation risk [^d4d0182f] [^11f4aeb1].

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids improve FEV₁, oxygenation, and shorten recovery and hospitalization; use **≤ 5 days** (e.g. prednisone 40 mg daily) [^bc848390] [^f9b201f2]. Oral administration is preferred unless gastrointestinal function is compromised [^df05fec4].

---

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are indicated for increased sputum purulence plus volume and/or dyspnea, or when mechanical ventilation is required; use **≤ 5 days** [^d6fce20b] [^388209fb]. Empiric choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate, macrolides, tetracyclines, or fluoroquinolones, guided by local resistance patterns [^d6fce20b].

---

### Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)

NIV is **first-line for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure** (pH ≤ 7.35) to improve gas exchange, reduce intubation, and improve survival [^d99d1768] [^42fec73b]. Contraindications include respiratory arrest, hemodynamic instability, facial trauma, or inability to protect the airway.

---

## Supportive care

- **Oxygen therapy**: Controlled oxygen to target SpO₂ 88–92% to avoid hypercapnia [^a9180eac].
- **Hydration and nutrition**: Maintain adequate hydration and nutrition to support recovery.
- **Thromboprophylaxis**: Use LMWH or fondaparinux to prevent VTE in hospitalized patients.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Pulmonary rehabilitation within 3 weeks post-discharge improves exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life [^4fe98a1f] [^166bfb2f]. Self-management education with action plans reduces healthcare utilization and improves adherence [^be29e2ba] [^485c8b3b].

---

## Prevention of future exacerbations

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to reduce exacerbation risk [^notfound].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended [^bde7aacd].
- **Long-term pharmacotherapy**: Consider ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA for frequent exacerbations or high eosinophils [^d4d0182f] [^90565f29].
- **Long-term macrolides**: Consider in frequent exacerbators despite optimal inhaled therapy [^d2f9c850] [^9a49e3b8].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor symptoms, lung function, and oxygenation during the acute episode and recovery [^notfound]. Arrange **early follow-up within 4 weeks** to reassess symptoms, inhaler technique, and adherence, and to adjust therapy [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and anxiety/depression should be identified and managed [^2bc50d5f]. In elderly patients, tailor therapy to comorbidities, polypharmacy, and fall risk [^3dcdc2ea].

---

Effective COPD exacerbation management centers on **bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics** when indicated, with NIV for hypercapnic failure, and transitions to optimized maintenance therapy and rehabilitation to prevent recurrence.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^a5714eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^9c993736]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^2eb27961]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Hospital management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0cd3f95f]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often complicated by episodes of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, which may lead to escalation of therapy and occasionally emergency department visits and hospitalization. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have a negative impact on quality of life and hasten the decline of lung function. They also significantly contribute to the direct and indirect healthcare costs of this disease. Severe exacerbations (those leading to hospital admission) have been associated with significant poor outcomes including an increased risk of readmissions and mortality. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of hospital readmission in the United States. In this review, we will provide a broad overview on the etiology, assessment, management, discharge planning, and follow-up care of patients hospitalized with AECOPD.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^10fc1cda]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^a9929985]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^336252de]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with a significant mortality, health and economic burden. Their diagnosis, assessment and management remain suboptimal and unchanged for decades. Recent clinical and translational studies revealed that the significant heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of exacerbations could be resolved by grouping them etiologically. This is anticipated to lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that underlie each type of exacerbation and to allow the introduction of precision medicine interventions that could improve outcomes. This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations.

### Practical management problems of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly: acute exacerbations [^3dcdc2ea]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPDs) have numerous causes and are associated with increased mortality and hospitalization, especially in older patients. The urgent need to identify and enable timely treatment of ECOPDs is a necessity for physicians worldwide. This review will highlight the causes and optimal combinations of available treatments for such events in older populations.

Recent Findings

The exact definition of exacerbations is lacking; however, it is agreed that such events are considered episodes of worsening of symptoms, leading to morbidity and death. The aging process is a consistent determinant for ECOPD events and is associated with worsening of COPD stages. The incidence of ECOPD rises across the worsening stages of COPD. Studies have shown that the frequency of exacerbations increases with age and correlated clinical outcomes are poorer than in younger patients. The risk of mortality has also been shown to be significantly higher after a hospital admission following an acute exacerbation. At the moment, the need to rapidly and correctly treat acute exacerbations is crucially important in the rapidly growing elderly population.

Summary

ECOPDs are extremely dangerous events for older patients with severe stages of COPD. There is an urgent need to identify risk factors, identify tolerable treatment guidelines and manage acute exacerbations in older patients with COPD.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^0cd090e9]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

---

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^f310acaf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

### Research opportunities in the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^91de9a1a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are a common problem in the emergency department. Despite considerable research involving the management of this disease over the past decade, much remains unclear from an emergency medicine perspective. Increased research would better guide the management of these complex patients from the perspectives of the patient, the caregiver, and society. The major areas of research can be divided into diagnosis, therapy, and education. The reliability and validity of different definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be assessed. The utility and performance characteristics of diagnostic testing need to be determined for this difficult patient population. Specific diagnostic tests include measures of dyspnea, spirometry and exercise tolerance, measures of gas exchange, airway inflammation, and chest imaging. It remains unclear which patient-specific therapies (oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and methylxanthines) should be used and monitored. Finally, the utility of education of both health care providers and patients and how it may be applied to the acute setting need to be addressed.

The vision: personalised management of COPD exacerbations

Assessment, management and prevention of exacerbations are anticipated to change significantly in the future. As described, the heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of COPD exacerbations can be resolved by grouping them aetiologically. Therefore, the main challenge to tackle is the development and validation of accurate biomarkers for early characterisation of the different types of exacerbations, which clearly extend beyond bacterial, viral and eosinophilic exacerbations that were discussed in detail here (figure 1). Such biomarkers could facilitate optimisation of exacerbation management and development of novel, targeted treatments. Since most exacerbations are addressed in primary care, the selected biomarkers will need to be measurable rapidly, near the patient, and simple, to facilitate implementation in primary care. RCTs focusing on the management of specific exacerbation subgroups are needed. These are likely to improve the clinical outcomes of exacerbations, but also COPD in general.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a06ec887]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Primer for emergency physicians [^ab8db19b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) impose a significant burden on patients and the emergency health care system. Patients with COPD who present to the emergency department (ED) often have comorbidities that can complicate their management.

Objective

To discuss strategies for the management of acute exacerbations in the ED, from initial assessment through disposition, to enable effective patient care and minimize the risk of treatment failure and prevent hospital readmissions.

Discussion

Establishing a correct diagnosis early on is critical; therefore, initial evaluations should be aimed at differentiating COPD exacerbations from other life-threatening conditions. Disposition decisions are based on the intensity of symptoms, presence of comorbidities, severity of the disease, and response to therapy. Patients who are appropriate for discharge from the ED should be prescribed evidence-based treatments and smoking cessation to prevent disease progression. A patient-centric discharge care plan should include medication reconciliation; bedside "teach-back", wherein patients demonstrate proper inhaler usage; and prompt follow-up.

Conclusions

An effective assessment, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate discharge plan for patients with AECOPD could improve treatment outcomes, reduce hospitalization, and decrease unplanned repeat visits to the ED.

### Complexity in clinical diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bfa577f7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

Research needs

The studies available to date used the criterion of one or more exacerbations in the past year to define a patient with frequent exacerbations. This criterion is inadequate because there are likely different risks (and different responses to pharmacotherapy) for patients depending on both the number and severity of exacerbations. For example, a patient with less than one exacerbation per year would likely be at low risk, patients with one exacerbation per year may have a moderate risk, and patients with two or more exacerbations per year or those with at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization may be at high risk. Trials using risk stratification of exacerbation risks to more precisely target a treatment response are needed. Evidence is also lacking with regard to the subgroup with no history of exacerbations, and trials are needed to better establish the role of triple therapy in this patient population.

Adequately powered, well-designed effectiveness studies (e.g. pragmatic RCTs and nonrandomized studies of interventions), with larger sample sizes, in the area of triple therapy versus dual therapy should be conducted in real-life situations, such as those involving patients older than 80 years of age, those with multiple chronic health conditions, current smokers, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma. The results of such trials could provide much-needed robust evidence for optimal personalized clinical management.

Question 3: In Patients with COPD Who Are Receiving Triple Therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), Should the ICS Be Withdrawn?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA, we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Subgroup analysis

The panel decided a priori that a subgroup analysis would be done for the exacerbation outcome based on patients with a history of one or more COPD exacerbations in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization versus patients with no exacerbation in the past year requiring treatment with antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization.

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, all-cause death, ICU admissions, dyspnea, health-related QOL, and physical activity as critical outcomes.

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

### Development of a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1194d0b8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic lung disease characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow limitation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are defined by worsening in patients' baseline symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum (quantity and purulence); exacerbations become more frequent and severe as the disease progresses. These events constitute the single most important determinant of health status in patients with COPDand account for increased morbidity, frequent emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations and death.

A cornerstone of COPD management is preventing acute exacerbations of COPD and breaking the cycle of recurrence. A large body of evidence supports both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD and improve overall health status. Despite this evidence, important care gaps remain as patients are often discharged from hospital or the ED following an acute exacerbation of COPD with no clear plan to prevent future episodes. Information exchange between hospital, ED and primary care physicians about the acute exacerbation of COPD is often incomplete or unavailable at the first postdischarge outpatient appointment. Often, patients and families assume care coordination responsibilities and personally convey follow-up instructions to primary care physicians. Information is sometimes provided verbally, and patients often struggle with health literacy issues. This creates a critical situation in which inaccurate information is translated from acute to community care settings. There is a need to improve transitions of care for patients with COPD across ED, hospital and community settings and ensure coordination and continuity of care.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^b80663a0]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Quantifying of severity of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: adaptations to the definition to allow quantification [^2ee7999a]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) offer a considerable clinical challenge for clinical practice and drug development. The underlying pathobiology of these characteristic events is unclear. We are far behind other disease areas, such as cardiology, where there are effective approaches for diagnosing and managing acute and potentially fatal events. A joint initiative has begun between the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and the Food and Drug Administration to produce a valid diary card measure of exacerbation severity: the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Test-Patient-Reported Outcome (EXACT-PRO). This article describes the background to this initiative, using the consensus definition of a COPD exacerbation as the starting point from which to propose a new method for quantifying the severity of the event. This approach takes into account the relationships between the symptoms that make up an exacerbation and shows that they can be used in a single continuous severity scale. Methods for defining exacerbation onset and cessation are also proposed.

### Clinical assessment, staging, and epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^314cf515]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are initially assessed to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been made and that relevant differential diagnoses are excluded. Although guidelines provide indicators for use, very little systematic research has been done in initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. Next, the assessment should aim at stratifying patients for risk of poor outcome. For this, predictors of poor prognosis as well as knowledge of favorable treatments can be used. However, no formal and validated staging system exists today. Given the frequency and impact of COPD exacerbations, there seems to be a need for systematic research in this area.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^babbe7fa]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The consequences of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation are many. Adverse effects of an exacerbation include a negative impact on patient quality of life, an effect on symptoms and lung function that are associated with a lengthy recovery, an accelerated rate of decline in lung function and hospital admissions. Moreover, exacerbations may result in significant mortality, particularly in cases that require hospitalization and are associated with a high socioeconomic burden, with exacerbations accounting for most of total COPD healthcare expenditure. Therefore, any COPD exacerbation should not be underestimated given their detrimental impact, and their prevention is a key goal of COPD treatment. It is useful to consider that exacerbations are heterogeneous events and the nature of exacerbations is likely to differ between different subgroups of patients with COPD, such as patients with chronic bronchitis or severe emphysema.

This narrative review focuses on identifying and managing patients with COPD according to their risk and type of exacerbation and discusses current and evolving preventative strategies. Selection of the studies included in the 'Pharmacologic therapies to prevent COPD exacerbations' section of this paper were identified via a PubMed search [details provided in Additional file 1]. Given the nature of this review, the studies referred to herein did not need to adhere to any pre-specified exacerbation definition.

Identifying patients at risk of COPD exacerbations

How do we define an exacerbation of COPD?

Although most guidelines define exacerbations similarly, there are differences in the exact definition used [see Additional file 1: Table S1, which provides a non-comprehensive list of exacerbation definitions used within a selection of societal guideline documents]. Variations in the definition of exacerbations within clinical studies also exist. Clinical trials use event-based definitions of exacerbation, which necessitate an increase in symptoms and the use of healthcare resources, and grade exacerbations based on their severity, e.g. moderate exacerbations as those requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids/antibiotics and severe exacerbations as those necessitating hospitalization. In an attempt to establish a uniform definition of exacerbations to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) task force defined an exacerbation as an increase in respiratory symptoms over baseline that usually requires a change in therapy. It is relevant to note that many exacerbations go unreported and untreated.

Exacerbation diagnosis and treatment

Exacerbations of COPD remain a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and it is necessary to consider (and, where appropriate, rule out) other causes of increased breathlessness in patients with COPD presenting with symptom deteriorations. Conditions mimicking exacerbations include pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus and cardiac failure. Diagnosis of exacerbation therefore requires appropriate clinical assessment and may need further investigation with, for example, chest radiography.

The principles of exacerbation therapy have not changed greatly since the widespread introduction in the 1990s of non-invasive ventilation in preference to doxapram for the treatment of hypercapnoea at exacerbation of COPD. Therapies at exacerbation may be divided into those thought to have a disease-modifying effect, and those aiming to support respiratory function until disease-modifying therapies have had sufficient time to act.

Exacerbation therapy is administered stepwise according to the clinical severity of presentation, and a general scheme is presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that disentangling the concept of exacerbation severity from the severity of the underlying COPD is almost impossible: a patient needing intubation and ventilation at exacerbation may have milder disease with a greater acute deterioration, or more severe underlying disease and a trivial insult.

Figure 1
General scheme for management of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Therapy is added stepwise according to the severity of the presentation. Mild exacerbations may respond to an increase in the dose and/or frequency of inhaled bronchodilators alone. Exacerbations not responding to this require systemic corticosteroids, with the addition of antibiotics if there has been a change in the character of expectorated sputum. Additional interventions such as theophylline may be required where the clinical response is still incomplete. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary at any stage in the presence of new or established respiratory failure. Exacerbation management should also include an assessment and management of comorbidities, and the opportunity should be taken to optimise long-term therapies to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled β₂-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV₁), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

### Acute exacerbations and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c136fe87]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) describe the phenomenon of sudden worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. These exacerbations can range from self-limited diseases to episodes of florid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The average patient with COPD experiences two such episodes annually, and they account for significant consumption of health care resources. Although bacterial infections are the most common causes of AECOPD, viral infections and environmental stresses are also implicated. AECOPD episodes can be triggered or complicated by other comorbidities, such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary emboli, aspiration, pneumothorax), or systemic processes. Pharmacologic management includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics in most patients. Oxygen, physical therapy, mucolytics, and airway clearance devices may be useful in selected patients. In hypercapneic respiratory failure, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time for other therapies to work and thus avoid endotracheal intubation. If the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation, the focus should be on avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and minimizing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. These may require limiting ventilation and "permissive hypercapnia". Although mild episodes of AECOPD are generally reversible, more severe forms of respiratory failure are associated with a substantial mortality and a prolonged period of disability in survivors.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^3de1216a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Phenotypes, etiotypes, and endotypes of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^da6ed2e8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major health problem with a high prevalence, a rising incidence, and substantial morbidity and mortality. Its course is punctuated by acute episodes of increased respiratory symptoms, termed exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD). ECOPD are important events in the natural history of the disease, as they are associated with lung function decline and prolonged negative effects on quality of life. The present-day therapy for ECOPD with short courses of antibiotics and steroids and escalation of bronchodilators has resulted in only modest improvements in outcomes. Recent data indicate that ECOPD are heterogeneous, raising the need to identify distinct etioendophenotypes, incorporating traits of the acute event and of patients who experience recurrent events, to develop novel and targeted therapies. These characterizations can provide a complete clinical picture, the severity of which will dictate acute pharmacological treatment, and may also indicate whether a change in maintenance therapy is needed to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. In this review we discuss the latest knowledge of ECOPD types on the basis of clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, frequency, severity, and biomarkers in an attempt to characterize these events.

### COPD exacerbations: the importance of a standard definition [^62fb3b6b]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Efforts to assess the efficacy of new therapies in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been hampered by the lack of a widely agreed and consistently used definition. A variety of definitions have been used in clinical studies, based on changes in patient symptoms or the requirement for antibiotic therapy, oral steroids or hospitalisation. To date, none of these definitions have been assessed in detail for their reliability, responsiveness and validity determined. Considerable heterogeneity in the aetiology and manifestation of COPD exacerbations makes identification and quantification of defining symptoms extremely difficult. New approaches are therefore being sought with a view to identifying a serum or tissue marker that can be used as a valuable diagnostic tool. Improvements in data recording will also contribute to the accuracy of data retrieval and assessment. If we are to progress to a level of sophistication seen in the diagnosis and management of other diseases, it is evident that considerable research efforts will be required to improve our understanding of COPD exacerbations and develop a standard definition for these events, thereby facilitating the assessment of therapeutic approaches.

### Management of severe COPD [^bc866025]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the burden of the disorder will continue to increase over the next 20 years despite medical intervention. Apart from smoking cessation, no approach or agent affects the rate of decline in lung function and progression of the disease. Especially in the later phase, COPD is a multicomponent disorder, and various integrated intervention strategies are needed as part of the optimum management programme. This seminar describes largely non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving health status and function of disabled patients. Exacerbations become progressively more troublesome as baseline lung function declines, commonly necessitating hospital admission and associated with the development of acute respiratory failure.

### Pharmacologic management of COPD exacerbations… [^aeda6aa7]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

1, 2 Chronic lower respiratory tract diseases, including COPD, are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the third leading cause of death worldwide. 3, 4 Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations of symptoms resulting in the need for additional treatment. Acute exacerbations of COPD are generally characterized by increased dyspnea, increased frequency and severity of cough, and potentially increased sputum. 5 Patients experiencing acute exacerbations of COPD are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity, lower quality of life, increased hospital admissions, and a progressive decline in lung function. 6–13. The goals for management of acute exacerbations of COPD include symptom resolution and recovery from the exacerbation episode via improving airflow and gas exchange in addition to reducing lung inflammation. Prevention or reduction of severity of subsequent exacerbation episodes is also a goal for many management and prevention strategies.

Typical interventions used for the management of COPD exacerbations include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. Surprisingly, there is limited evidence for many of these treatments in this population. 17 Lack of access to health care services, in addition to other social determinants of health that affect patients' ability to obtain services, could be a significant impediment to implementation of these recommendations. Practices should consider screening for social determinants of health and help address those issues by developing and maintaining a directory of resources for patients. 50 Increasingly, private and governmental insurers are employing case/care managers to assist patients and clinicians in obtaining the additional resources needed for supporting patients who face challenging situations.

Clinicians may also consider the availability of telemedicine resources for counseling and follow-up for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. TECHNIQUES FOR IMPLEMENTATION Chronic care management can be effectively implemented by primary care practices to manage patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and COPD. It is a model that has been used to educate and empower patients to track, prevent, and self-manage symptoms, leading to earlier reporting of COPD exacerbations to primary care physicians and reducing use of the emergency department. 52 Another study assessed the effectiveness of an integrative approach with both telemedicine and discharge bundles. Patients in the integrative approach group had lower rates of hospital admissions and lower rates of readmission to the hospital for exacerbation episodes.

53 For acute treatment, integration of guideline recommendations for order sets have been used to standardize treatment of patients who present with acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^22664f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^11f4aeb1]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural trajectory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening of symptoms that results in additional therapy. In many cases, exacerbations are triggered by respiratory tract infections (predominantly viral, but also bacterial) and environmental factors such as air pollution, yet in approximately one third of cases, the cause remains unknown.

COPD exacerbations have a marked negative effect on both the patient and underlying disease processes, and can result in hospitalization and readmission, an increased risk of death and a significant reduction in health status. Exacerbations are also associated with long-term decline in lung function and a high socioeconomic cost. Thus, optimizing the prevention and management of COPD exacerbations is an important clinical issue.

A key step towards meeting this goal is to identify patients at greatest risk of exacerbation. The 'frequent exacerbator' phenotype (≥ 2 exacerbations/year) describes patients who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, in contrast to infrequent exacerbators. The exacerbator phenotype, which remains relatively stable over time, has a complex pathophysiology and is prevalent across all disease severities, but is more common in patients with worse lung function.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides treatment recommendations for patients who are at high risk of exacerbation: a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination are recommended as primary choice treatment for these patients. Although the GOLD strategy document was developed with an international audience in mind, some countries and regions (e.g. Spain, UK, South America, and Canada) follow guidance outlined in their own recommendations as well.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients at high risk of exacerbation with concomitant asthma, or who experience further exacerbations following initial bronchodilator treatment. However, there is widespread evidence of inappropriate use of ICS in patients at low risk of exacerbation. Considering the known risks associated with long-term ICS use, only patients carefully considered as suitable candidates should receive treatment with the appropriate ICS and associated dose, such that treatment benefit will outweigh any potential risk.

Exacerbation risk in COPD: Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are episodes of acute respiratory symptom worsening often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation (see Chapter 4). ECOPD are key events in the natural history of the disease because they impact significantly on the health status of the patient (often for a prolonged period of time), enhance the rate of lung function decline, worsen the prognosis of the patient and are associated with most of the healthcare costs of COPD. ECOPD rates vary greatly between patients and during follow-up.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — risks and action plans note that COPD exacerbations increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, with heightened risk in the first 30 days persisting for up to 1–2 years, and that mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. An updated Cochrane review concluded that COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational component, in conjunction with ongoing support, reduced in-hospital healthcare utilization and increased the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a profound effect on the patient's health status and decline in lung function; they also impose a significant burden on healthcare resource utilization. Prevention and treatment of exacerbations is listed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as among the major objectives of COPD management, and it is therefore an important outcome measure when studying any new agent. This article discusses pharmacologic therapy and other measures for preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations due to exacerbations of COPD.

### Global initiative for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive lung disease. the 2020 GOLD science committee report on COVID-19 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bde7aacd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised many questions about the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether modifications of their therapy are required. It has raised questions about recognizing and differentiating coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Science Committee used established methods for literature review to present an overview of the management of patients with COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether patients with COPD are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high community prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should only be used when it is essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. Patients with COPD should follow basic infection control measures, including social distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask or face covering. Patients should remain up to date with appropriate vaccinations, particularly annual influenza vaccination. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an acute COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate-to-severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung strategy in patients with COPD and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients who developed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual COPD protocols. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^89cb74bd]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. In this section, we review (1) the epidemiology of this condition; (2) the etiology — many patients with AECOPD are thought to have a combination of viral and bacterial infections, which contribute to their exacerbation. Bacterial organisms are isolated more commonly after viral infections in patients with COPD. The role that bacterial infections play in AECOPD remains a very controversial topic; (3) the use of diagnostic procedures; (4) efficacy of antibiotics; (5) clinical parameters to stratify patients' severity; (6) different groups of antibiotics that can be used; and (7) other therapies, including bronchodilators. We summarize the current literature, with special emphasis on the assessment of the long-term impact of this condition.

### The reliability and validity of patient-reported chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^a8443570]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite the increasing awareness of their pathogenesis and clinical consequences, research on and clinical management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease (AECOPDs) have been hindered by the lack of a consistent and reliable definition. Symptom-based definitions of exacerbations are sensitive to events and account for unreported exacerbations. Event (healthcare utilization)-based definitions are somewhat more definitive but miss unreported events. Objective quantification of symptoms in AECOPD is now possible with the development of the Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT-PRO), a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure.

Recent Findings

Several studies have revealed that unreported AECOPDs are more frequent than reported events and are associated with long-term adverse consequences. New antibiotic development for AECOPD has been hampered by the lack of validated measures for resolution of exacerbations. As a result of these observations, a unique collaborative effort between academia, industry and regulatory agencies resulted in the development of the EXACT-PRO. It consists of 14 questions that generate a score between 0 and 100, and it has been shown to have excellent reliability and validity.

Summary

In the absence of a reliable biomarker, the definition and measurement of exacerbations has been subjective and imprecise. PRO measures such as EXACT can provide much needed objectivity in assessing symptom-defined exacerbations, which may translate into a uniform outcome measure in clinical trials. With further development and validation, it may have a role in clinical practice in the earlier detection of exacerbations, stratification of an exacerbation severity and the assessment of clinical response to treatment.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV₁), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^eac85a5d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The diagnosis of COPD involves a comprehensive assessment of symptoms, lung function tests (spirometry), and physical examination. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides guidelines for diagnosis and staging, which inform treatment decisions. According to GOLD criteria, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 0.7 is diagnostic for COPD. Managing COPD requires a multifaceted approach, including pharmacological interventions (such as steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics), pulmonary rehabilitation, and ventilator support. Stable COPD is characterized by a period of time when the patient's symptoms are stable and not experiencing an acute exacerbation. During this period, patients may experience symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing, but these symptoms are typically manageable with medication and other treatments. Conversely, post-exacerbation COPD (PECOPD) patients are those who have recently experienced an acute exacerbation of COPD and are in the recovery phase. These patients are at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations, hospital readmissions, and mortality, and require careful management to prevent further decline and improve outcomes.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^070f74b3]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

The natural disease course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often punctuated by exacerbations: acute events of symptom worsening associated with significant morbidity and healthcare resource utilization; reduced quality of life; and increased risk of hospitalization and death. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommend that patients at risk of exacerbations (GOLD Groups C and D) receive a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination, respectively, as preferred initial treatments. The latter recommendation is based on recent trial evidence demonstrating the superior efficacy of a fixed-dose LABA/LAMA over an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA in exacerbation prevention. ICS in combination with a LABA is also indicated for prevention of exacerbations, but the use of ICS is associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as pneumonia, and offers limited benefits beyond those provided by LABA or LAMA monotherapy. In this review, we examine evidence from a number of pivotal studies of LABAs and LAMAs, administered as monotherapy or as part of dual or triple combination therapy, with a specific focus on their effect on exacerbations. We also discuss a new proposed treatment paradigm for the management of COPD that takes into account this recent evidence and adopts a more cautious approach to the use of ICS. In alignment with GOLD 2017, we suggest that ICS should be reserved for patients with concomitant asthma or in whom exacerbations persist despite treatment with LABA/LAMA.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^f9b201f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66).FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^4cb950b8]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

### Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in United States emergency departments, 2010–2018 [^a7e5610a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. and worldwide. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are important adverse events in the natural history of the disease. Frequent exacerbations (2 + per year) are associated with higher mortality, reduced quality of life and a faster lung function decline than those with infrequent exacerbations (0–1 per year). AECOPD often results in emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for approximately 0.6–1.5 million ED visits each year in the U.S. Understanding the epidemiology of ED visits for AECOPD may help monitor the disease burden and quality of care for stable COPD.

Some earlier research has reported the epidemiology of ED visits for AECOPD. For example, Tsai et al. found a persistently high burden of ED visits for AECOPD during 1993–2005. In addition, the overall concordance with guideline-recommended care for AECOPD was only moderate during that study period. Afterward, there have been few studies investigating ED visits for AECOPD patients. No studies, however, have examined this issue since the inception of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2014, which may have affected the rate of hospitalization through the ED. In addition, several COPD practice guidelines, including the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, highlight important advances in the management of stable COPD. Specifically, whether new therapeutics, such as dual bronchodilators and/or long-term non-invasive ventilation use, would have affected ED visits and hospitalizations for AECOPD remains unknown.

To address these knowledge gaps, we analyzed recent data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2010 to 2018. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the incidence of and hospitalization for AECOPD in the ED, and (2) to investigate factors associated with the disease burden of AECOPD.

### Managing COPD exacerbations in primary care [^feb0f551]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common but underdiagnosed lung condition that is frequently managed inappropriately. It impacts poorest communities most, where health inequalities are greatest. New acute symptoms of breathlessness, cough, sputum production and wheeze should prompt clinical suspicion of underlying COPD in someone who is a current or ex-smoker (or has exposure to other risk factors) and be followed by referral for quality-assured spirometry once recovered. Management of COPD exacerbations in primary care includes use of short-acting bronchodilators if mild, and antibiotics and a short course of oral prednisolone if moderate/severe. Hospital at home schemes are safe and effective and should be considered for some patients exacerbating in the community; these are increasingly supported by remote monitoring ('virtual wards'). New or worsening hypoxia is an indication for hospital admission and therefore oxygen saturation monitoring is an important part of exacerbation management; clinicians should be aware of patient safety alerts around use of pulse oximeters. Exacerbations drive poor health status and lung function decline and therefore asking about exacerbation frequency at planned reviews and taking action to reduce these is an important part of long-term COPD care. An exacerbation is an opportunity to ensure that fundamentals of good care are addressed. Patients should be supported to understand and act on exacerbations through a supported self-management plan; prompt treatment is beneficial but should be balanced by careful antibiotic and corticosteroid stewardship. COPD rescue packs on repeat prescription are not recommended.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^938f9b97]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inhaled corticosteroids compared with long-acting β₂-agonists — evidence includes seven randomized trials (5,997 participants) of good quality with a duration of 6 months to 3 years, and although these treatments can sometimes be taken together, the value of the two individual components is unclear.
