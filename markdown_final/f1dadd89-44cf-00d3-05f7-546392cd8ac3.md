## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best describes what the IP protocol is primarily concerned with. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core function of IP in the TCP/IP stack. Then, I should verify which answer choices align with that function and which conflate IP with other layers or protocols. Next, I will check for any subtle traps in wording that might mislead toward reliability or direct-link assumptions. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and briefly justify why the alternatives are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the foundational role of IP. IP is a network-layer protocol whose primary responsibility is addressing and routing packets across interconnected networks, moving datagrams from source to destination without guaranteeing delivery, order, or reliability, which are handled by higher layers like TCP or by link-layer mechanisms. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overstating reliability here — yes, IP is best-effort and connectionless, so reliability is not its job.

> Now, I will examine the options that most closely match this role. Option D, "Routing packets through the network", directly corresponds to IP's core task of forwarding packets based on destination addresses across multiple hops. Option A, "Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected", sounds tempting because it mentions multi-hop communication, but hold on, I should verify — reliability and message reassembly are not IP's responsibilities; that's TCP's domain, so A overstates what IP does. Option F, "Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines", is off target because IP operates beyond single links and again, reliability is not its mandate. Let me reconsider: D remains the most accurate and concise match for IP's primary concern.

> Next, I should review the distractors that reflect other layers or functions. User interfaces and network management belong to application-layer tools and protocols, not IP, so B is out. Coordinating hardware components is a link-layer or physical-layer function, not IP, so C is incorrect. Power control is unrelated to IP's mandate, so E is not relevant. Ensuring compatibility between different network technologies is a broader interoperability goal achieved by multiple layers and standards, not a primary IP function, so G is too broad. Monitoring traffic speed is a measurement and management task, not IP routing, so H is not correct. Operating system differences are handled by the host's networking stack and APIs, not by IP itself, so I is not accurate. Security of data transmission is addressed by protocols like IPSec at the network layer, but that is a secondary or add-on role rather than IP's primary concern, so J is not the best answer here.

> I should double-check the wording of the best option to ensure there's no hidden pitfall. Option D is precise: IP's primary concern is routing packets through the network, which captures addressing, forwarding, and multi-hop delivery without implying reliability or session management. The alternatives either add reliability guarantees that IP does not provide or drift into functions handled by other layers or administrative tools, making D the clearest and most accurate choice.

> Final answer: D. Routing packets through the network.

The IP protocol is primarily concerned with **routing packets** through the network by providing addressing and forwarding functions that enable data to traverse multiple networks from source to destination. It is a **connectionless, best-effort protocol** that does not guarantee reliable delivery, order, or error correction; those features are handled by higher-layer protocols like TCP. IP also supports fragmentation and reassembly of packets to accommodate varying network MTUs, but its core role remains routing and delivery across interconnected networks.

---

## Core functions of the IP protocol

### Addressing and identification

IP assigns unique **IP addresses** to devices, enabling identification and location of hosts across networks. It also supports hierarchical addressing, which facilitates efficient routing and network organization.

---

### Packet routing and forwarding

IP determines the **best path** for packets to travel from source to destination using routing tables and protocols (e.g. OSPF, BGP) [^notfound]. Routers forward packets based on destination IP addresses, enabling communication across diverse network topologies [^115P5fXD].

---

### Fragmentation and reassembly

IP fragments large packets to meet the **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** requirements of different networks and reassembles them at the destination, ensuring compatibility across heterogeneous network infrastructures [^notfound].

---

### Connectionless communication

IP operates as a **connectionless protocol**, sending packets independently without establishing a dedicated connection. This approach enhances scalability and efficiency but does not guarantee delivery or order.

---

## Limitations of the IP protocol

While IP is fundamental to networking, it has **limitations**:

- **No reliability**: IP does not guarantee packet delivery, order, or error correction; these are handled by higher-layer protocols like TCP [^notfound].
- **No security**: IP lacks built-in security features, necessitating additional protocols like IPSec for secure communication.
- **Best-effort delivery**: IP operates on a best-effort basis, meaning packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order.

---

## Comparison with other protocols

| **Feature** | **Ip** | **Tcp** | **Udp** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Reliability | No | Yes | No |
| Connection-oriented | No | Yes | No |
| Error correction | No | Yes | No |
| Use cases | Routing, addressing | Reliable data transfer | Streaming, gaming |

---

## Conclusion

The IP protocol is primarily concerned with **routing packets** through the network, providing addressing, forwarding, and fragmentation capabilities. It is a connectionless, best-effort protocol that enables scalable, efficient communication across interconnected networks, while relying on higher-layer protocols for reliability and security.

### Boosting reservoir computing with brain-inspired adaptive control of E-I balance [^1129cYTY]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This asymmetrical preference toward inhibition is consistent with prior findings by deGraaf et al. who showed that inhibition-dominated networks maintain balanced neuronal input and exhibit diverse firing rate variability, whereas excitation-dominated networks suffer from saturated firing rates. The latter reduces the effective dimensionality of network activity, leading to overly simplified output patterns. In line with these findings, our results suggest that while reservoirs can tolerate excess inhibition, increased excitation degrades performance, highlighting a fundamental asymmetry in how neural networks process information.

The mechanisms governing E–I balance in biological brains are complex, ranging from anatomical constraints, such as fixed excitatory-to-inhibitory ratios, to dynamic synaptic adjustments that actively maintain equilibrium. One well-known anatomical constraint is Dale's Law, which states that a given neuron releases either excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters, but not both. While this principle is crucial in biological systems, our results suggest it is not essential for effective reservoir computation. Even when we shuffled synaptic weights, breaking the strict segregation of E and I neurons, we observed similar computational performance (see Supp. Figure 3). This principle likely evolved as a consequence of biological constraints during neural development, where excitatory and inhibitory neurons develop distinct morphologies and neurotransmitter systems. However, further study is warranted to better understand the role of distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations in shaping network dynamics and computational properties. Notably, we find that strong RC performance in balanced and slightly over-inhibited regimes remains consistent whether E–I balance is tuned by adjusting the strength of inhibitory connections or by varying the proportion of inhibitory neurons (see Supp. Figure 1), suggesting flexibility in how balance can be implemented in artificial systems.

To reach an appropriate level of local balance in our reservoir computing models, we introduced an inhibitory adaptation rule that dynamically tunes inhibitory synapses at the neuronal level. While this rule draws inspiration from biological principles of firing rate homeostasis, it is not intended as a direct model of neural E–I regulation. Instead, it serves as a computationally efficient mechanism for improving reservoir function by leveraging biologically motivated constraints.

### Randomized controlled trial of E-counseling for hypertension: REACH [^116gj2Dg]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of internet-based interventions to improve hypertension management is not established. We evaluated the therapeutic benefit of e-counseling by adapting best evidence guidelines for behavioral counseling.

Methods and Results

This multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial included assessments at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months. Participants were 35 to 74 years of age and diagnosed with hypertension: systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP) 130 to 180/85 to 110 mmHg. BP was assessed by automated office measurement. E-Counseling used multimedia and interactive tools to increase motivation and skill for self-care (exercise, diet, medication adherence, and smoking cessation). Control used self-care education. Frequency of contact by our e-platform was equal for both trial arms. Primary end points were change at 4 and 12 months in systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, total lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and Framingham 10-year cardiovascular risk index. Intention-to-treat analysis used generalized linear models adjusted for baseline measures, sex, and medications. Among 264 participants, mean age was 57.6 years (SE, 0.6), 58% were women, with 83% on antihypertensive medications. At 12 months, e-counseling versus control evoked greater reduction in systolic BP (-10.1 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), -12.5, -7.6] versus -6.0 mmHg [95% CI, -8.5, -3.5]; P = 0.02); pulse pressure (-5.2 mmHg [95% CI, -6.9, -3.5] versus -2.7 mmHg [95% CI, -4.5, -0.9]; P = 0.04), and Framingham risk index (-1.9% [95% CI, -3.3, -0.5] versus -0.02% [95% CI, -1.2, 1.7]; P = 0.02), respectively. Among males in e-counseling versus control, 12-month end points included lower diastolic BP (P = 0.01), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.04), total lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.03), and a trend for total lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first double-blind randomized trial of e-counseling for hypertension. Added benefit for medical therapy was achieved by combining available technology with a clinically organized protocol of motivational and cognitive-behavioral counseling.

### Selecting and describing control conditions in mobile health randomized controlled trials: a proposed typology [^116S7qYH]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ethics

One issue not addressed by our scheme, but of paramount importance, is the ethical dimension of study design. Selecting a control condition has ethical implications around access to care, scientific rigor, and bias. Particularly in under-resourced settings and when working with vulnerable populations, No Treatment control conditions may be inappropriate as they may involve withholding interventions with known therapeutic value. In contexts where trust is limited between community members and academic research teams, providing an active control may be necessary for building trust and completing recruitment and enrollment goals for an RCT. In these contexts, it may be more appropriate to provide at least a minimal degree of intervention (e.g. TAU-Minimal), for example links to publicly available online resources. As a program of research matures (e.g. moves through the stages of intervention development), increasingly rigorous and theoretically therapeutic control conditions may be warranted, both for ethical (e.g. beneficence and non-maleficence)and scientific reasons (i.e. determining how a novel treatment compares with established treatments). As a general rule, clinical trials should only be run when there is the expectation that the treatment being studied may be beneficial (i.e. equipoise). The ethical use of digital health tools remains an active area of investigation, with frameworks emerging but none yet consistently adopted.

Application to meta-analysis

The proposed coding schemes are intended to be helpful for meta-analysts faced with categorizing the diverse range of control conditions used in mHealth RCTs. At a minimum, we hope this helps avoid considering control conditions to be a monolithic category. Distinguishing between controls intended to be therapeutic and not intended to be therapeutic provides perhaps the simplest theoretically justified categorization. New meta-analyses sensitive to the impact of controls groups may provide more accurate effect size estimates and results of prior meta-analyses may need to be reexamined in light of these considerations.

### Boosting reservoir computing with brain-inspired adaptive control of E-I balance [^114HjSbK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Reservoir computers (RCs) are a class of recurrent neural networks that incorporate brain-inspired principles and provide an efficient alternative to deep learning. With fixed random internal connections and trained output weights, they simplify learning but remain sensitive to hyperparameters governing activation and connectivity. While various hyperparameters are commonly tuned, the relative balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals — fundamental to brain function — is typically fixed in RCs. Here, we investigate tuning this balance and show that strong performance consistently arises in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, not excitation-dominated ones. Further, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E-I balance to achieve target firing rates, reducing hyperparameter tuning costs and yielding up to 130% performance gains in memory capacity and time-series prediction. Incorporating heterogeneity in firing-rate targets further enhances robustness. These findings highlight dynamic adaptation as a promising design principle, improving RC performance while offering insights into neural computation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^11392SEF]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Sidebar E: Asthma education and self-management support — Patients and caregivers should be informed of the diagnosis of asthma, their current understanding and treatment adherence should be assessed, they should be provided evidence-based education and materials/resources, and they should be given the opportunity to ask questions so they can fully understand their asthma; consistent follow-up should ensure confidence to self-manage and take a more active role with their healthcare team. Asthma education should include basic pathophysiology of asthma, typical asthma symptoms, how to identify well-controlled asthma, asthma patterns (exercise, nocturnal symptoms, and seasonal allergens) and risk factors, asthma exacerbations and precipitating triggers, goals of treatment and use of Asthma Action Plan, medication use (e.g., what it does, how to use it, potential side effects, and rationale for why each medication was selected) including assessment of device technique, how to recognize loss of asthma control and steps to take to regain control of symptoms, and when and how to seek emergency care for asthma exacerbations. The guideline further states to consider a personalized written asthma action plan and consider a team approach to asthma management, and to address lifestyle changes and psychosocial considerations.

### Awareness of tobacco industry tactics among tobacco control communities in Thailand and its association with attitudes towards tobacco industry and perceptions of e-cigarettes [^113pqi4R]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco industry denormalisation is a key strategy recommended by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control as it is associated with reducing smoking behaviours and positively influencing public and policymakers' opinion towards tobacco control. However, studies of awareness of tobacco industry tactics among public health players and policymakers in low-income and middle-income countries are limited.

Methods

We conducted an online survey of individuals who had been involved in tobacco control in Thailand. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between awareness of tobacco industry tactics and different attitudes towards tobacco industry and perceptions towards e-cigarettes, controlling for role in tobacco control and demographics among 441 respondents.

Results

Of the respondents, 11.3% had never heard of any tobacco industry tactics, whereas 11.1% had heard of all tactics asked in the survey. Tobacco industry tactics which were less known by participants were intimidation (30.6%) and illicit trade (37.4%). Participants who were more aware of tobacco industry tactics were more likely to have negative attitudes towards the tobacco industry and e-cigarettes. Compared with active experts of the Provincial Tobacco Products Control Committee and provincial public health officials who work in tobacco control programmes, advocates who worked for civil society organisations in tobacco control were more aware of tobacco industry tactics and had less favourable perceptions of e-cigarettes.

Conclusion

This study emphasises the importance of educating public health professionals and policymakers about tobacco industry behaviour, especially in the era of e-cigarettes.

### E-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid-toward common ground and a rational approach [^117WKyvu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Common Ground and Context

The real danger related to e-cigarettes is that they are implemented instead of, rather than alongside, other tobacco control policies (attractive to neoliberal governments), that they are used by the tobacco industry to argue that other policies are unnecessary, and that they divert the efforts and attention of the tobacco control community away from smoking, giving the impression that the problem has somehow been dealt with.

We need clarity around our shared objectives: that smokers quit smoking, that children don't start smoking, that non-smokers — especially young people — don't vape, and that the tobacco industry is forced to end, and to make reparations for, mass killing for profit. A more coherent and constructive approach that acknowledges shared concerns, and the shared evidence base, is needed. A suggested framework is set out in Figure 1.

### Isolation and characterization of E. coli O157: H7 novel bacteriophage for controlling this food-borne pathogen [^111umM8H]. Virus Research (2022). Medium credibility.

E. coli O157: H7 is known as a high-risk food-born pathogen, and its removal is vital for maintaining food safety. The increasing trend of food-borne diseases caused by this bacterium and other pathogens indicates the low efficiency of the methods to remove pathogens from foodstuffs. One of the new and effective methods is to use of a bio-control agent called bacteriophage, which has shown good function in eliminating and reducing pathogens. In this study, a novel bacteriophage was isolated and identified from the slaughterhouse wastewater to control E. coli O157: H7. This bacteriophage belonged to the Myoviridae family. Two bacterial genera including E. coli and Salmonella, were allocated to determine the bacteriophage host range; the result showed that the anti- Salmonella effect of phage was low. The phage was stable at high temperature (80 °C) and caused an acceptable reduction in the E. coli O157: H7 (4.18 log CFU / mL for 10 h). The isolated bacteriophage was corroborated to be completely safe based on the whole genome sequencing and lack of any virulence factor from the host bacteria. Considering the characteristics of this phage and its function in vitro, this bacteriophage may be used as an effective bio-control agent in foods with the possible E. coli O157: H7 -induced contamination.

### Data-driven control of complex networks [^112Rd9sk]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Data-driven minimum-energy control

By letting Q = 0 and R = I in Eq. (4), we recover a data-driven expression for the T -step minimum-energy control to reach y f. We remark that the family of minimum-energy controls has been extensively employed to characterize the fundamental capabilities and limitations of controlling networks, e.g. see. After some algebraic manipulations, the data-driven minimum-energy control input can be compactly rewritten as (Supplementary Note 5)The latter expression relies on the final output measurements only (matrix Y T) and, thus, it does not exploit the full output data (matrix Y 1: T −1). An alternative control expression isThis is a simple, suboptimal data-based control sequence that correctly steers the network to y f in T steps, as long as y f belongs to the range space of Y T (a condition that is normally satisfied when p randomly generated data are available). Further, and more importantly, when the input data samples are drawn randomly and independently from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and finite variance, Eq. (6) converges to the minimum-energy control in the limit of infinite data (Supplementary Note 6).

Figure 3 a compares the performance (in terms of control effort and error in the final state) of the two data-driven expressions in Eqs. (5) and (6), and the model-based control as a function of the data size N. While the data-driven control in Eq. (5) becomes optimal for a finite number of data (precisely, for N = m T independent data), the approximate expression in Eq. (6) tends to the optimal control only asymptotically in the number of data (Fig. 3 a, left). In both cases, the error in the final state goes to zero after collecting N = p data (Fig. 3 a, right). For the approximate control in Eq. (6), we also establish upper bounds on the size of the dataset to get a prescribed deviation from the optimal control, in the case of Gaussian input data. Our nonasymptotic analysis indicates that this deviation is proportional to the worst-case control energy required to reach a unit-norm target. This, in turn, implies that networks that are easy to control require fewer trials to attain a prescribed approximation error (Supplementary Note 6).

### Harm reduction at the crossroads: the case of e-cigarettes [^1142cM3g]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The recent popularity of electronic (e)-cigarettes and their rapid uptake by youth has ignited the debate about their role as a harm-reduction strategy. Harm reduction in the context of tobacco control contends that in societies that have achieved considerable success in curbing smoking, leaving the remaining hard-to-quit smokers with an abstinence-only option is unfair, especially when less-harmful choices are available. On one side of the debate are those who call for caution in endorsing such products until critical pieces of evidence about their safety and potential become available, whereas the other side argues that waiting until all questions about e-cigarettes are answered is dogma driven. In this piece, I try to discuss the unresolvable contention between harm-reduction goals of offering safer options to smokers, and those of e-cigarette makers of being commercially viable and profitable.

### Methodology for ACOEM's occupational medicine practice guidelines-2025 revision [^114Ur62y]. ACOEM (2025). High credibility.

ACOEM Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines methodology — controlled for co-interventions quality rating specifies that this criterion evaluates the degree to which the study design controlled for multiple interventions; rating is "0" if there are multiple interventions or no description of how this was avoided but likely present, and unaddressed issues or qualitative descriptions without detailed logs or other means are scored "0"; rating is "0.5" when there is some mention and some details indicating at least partial control (e.g., prohibited medications and procedures); rating is "1.0" when there is a clear description of how co-interventions were avoided, with documentation such as log records for medication use, an appropriate list of prohibited medications, additional exercises, and types and frequencies.

### Target control of complex networks [^112QVREn]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Target controllability

To quantify the efficiency of target control for a specific fraction f, we define the target controllability parameter α D ≡ P D / N D (Methods section) and investigate it for both random and local control schemes, as shown in Fig. 4a, d, respectively. Note that for f = 1, we have α D = 1 as target control reduces to full control. In Fig. 4 the black lines denote the neutral condition (α D = f) and serve as a benchmark because they mean that controlling an f fraction of target nodes requires an f fraction of the driver nodes needed for full control, that is, P D = fN D. In each figure, UB denotes the upper bound of the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control an f fraction of target nodes, predicted by the structural control theory (Supplementary Note 3). Likewise, GA denotes the results of the greedy algorithm and LB (Supplementary Note 3) denotes the lower bound, which is obtained by the first step of the GA (Methods section). Figure 4b shows the results of random target control of ER networks. Here the GA curve is above the neutral line (α D > f), which indicates that the target control is less efficient than the neutral expectation. Figure 4c shows the results of random target control on SF networks and the GA curve is almost at the neutral line (α D ≈ f), which indicates that target control is as efficient as the neutral expectation. If we apply the local target control scheme to an ER network, we observe reduced efficiency for f < 0.5 (minus symbol in Fig. 4e) and enhanced efficiency for f > 0.5 (plus symbol in Fig. 4e). Figure 4f shows the case of local target control on SF networks, charactering that the target control is more efficient (that is, α D < f).

### Design principles for engineering bacteria to maximise chemical production from batch cultures [^113BiRWF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Comparing the Pareto fronts between all eight circuit topologies, we found that the highest productivity and yields are achieved by circuits with a single common motif — inducer-deactivation of the expression of the host enzyme E (Fig. 2 a, motifs at top). Circuits without this motif achieved lower productivity and yields (Fig. 2 a). This suggests that forcibly redirecting metabolic flux from growth to the product precursor s i is necessary to maximise production performance. If we remove control on the synthesis pathway enzymes from the dual-control circuit (Fig. 2 a, orange compared to red circuits) the achievable productivity and synthesis are not significantly affected, suggesting activating expression of synthesis enzymes is unnecessary. Our simulations of the dynamics showed that reducing translational precursor e, by inducing a deactivated expression of E only, for instance, drives an increase in the translation of all enzymes, i.e. product synthesis enzymes (E p, T p) and nutrient transporter (T) (see Supplementary Note SN4). Thus deactivation of host enzyme E indirectly causes the expression of synthesis enzymes to increase, creating an effective regulatory response similar to the dual-control circuit (see Supplementary Notes SN4, SN5). The indirect regulatory increase in expression is observed for any constitutively expressed enzymes, in any of the topologies (Supplementary Note SN5). As a design principle, therefore, the simpler 'one-sided' switch design to deactivate host enzymes may be sufficient for achieving near-optimal performance of the dual-control switch. Moreover, we found that the performance of this 'one-sided' switch compared to the dual-control is generally robust to increases in the burden of the synthesis pathway, i.e. increases in the size and turnover rate of the synthesis pathway enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 15, yellow vs red curves). However, if synthesis enzymes are strongly burdensome, i.e. have very slow turnover or are very large (many codons) compared to native enzymes, then performance of dual-control circuits is superior (Supplementary Fig. 15).

### Fearful temperament and the risk for child and adolescent anxiety: the role of attention biases and effortful control [^115kR4tM]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Fearful temperament represents one of the most robust predictors of child and adolescent anxiety; however, not all children with fearful temperament unvaryingly develop anxiety. Diverse processes resulting from the interplay between automatic processing (i.e., attention bias) and controlled processing (i.e., effortful control) drive the trajectories toward more adaptive or maladaptive directions. In this review, we examine the associations between fearful temperament, attention bias, and anxiety, as well as the moderating effect of effortful control. Based on the reviewed literature, we propose a two-mechanism developmental model of attention bias that underlies the association between fearful temperament and anxiety. We propose that the sub-components of effortful control (i.e., attentional control and inhibitory control) play different roles depending on individuals' temperaments, initial automatic biases, and goal priorities. Our model may help resolve some of the mixed findings and conflicts in the current literature. It may also advance our knowledge regarding the cognitive mechanisms linking fearful temperament and anxiety, as well as facilitate the continuing efforts in identifying and intervening with children who are at risk. Finally, we conclude the review with a discussion on the existing limitations and then propose questions for future research.

### Trade law and effective electronic cigarette regulation design [^115pJGwe]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

This special communication provides recommendations for policymakers on how to regulate electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) without violating international trade rules. Concerns are increasing that e-cigarette consumption poses serious harms to health, prompting a recent call to action from the WHO for regulations to lower the appeal of e-cigarettes and address the threat they pose to global populations. Despite this call, no agreement on an appropriate regulatory approach has been reached between the parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control or in any other multilateral forum. In the absence of multilateral consensus, states have implemented a diverse range of frameworks, including restrictions on packaging, marketing and advertising of e-cigarettes, stringent product standards or even bans on e-cigarettes, sometimes with exceptions for use as a tobacco smoking cessation aid. There is a risk that some of these approaches may be challenged as a restriction of rights that are protected in World Trade Organization agreements, including the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The authors explain how different types of e-cigarette regulations engage protection under international trade rules and offer recommendations for how states can formulate public health justifications that ensure these regulations do not breach international trade rules. The authors also recommend that states work toward international consensus or guidelines, which can support the legitimacy of e-cigarette regulations in the event of a challenge.

### E-cigarette use among adolescents: are we doing enough? [^114B8tjW]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes contain a highly addictive substance and potentially harmful chemicals, and they should not be accessible to adolescents. It is clear that tight regulation of the sale, promotion, and content of e-cigarettes is needed to prevent the initiation and use, and increase the safety of these products. Sadly, the available evidence suggests that e-cigarettes could halt or even reverse the declining use of tobacco products among adolescents. Moving forward, it is important that high quality data on the health effects of e-cigarettes, as well as on effective vaping prevention messaging to adolescents, are collected to inform targeted national and global e-cigarette control and prevention strategies.

### Electronic cigarette use among adults in 14 countries: a cross-sectional study [^114PEECm]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Over 18 million adults reported current using e-cigarettes in the 14 countries and considerable variations in e-cigarette use were observed across countries and population subgroups with certain sociodemographic characteristics. While continued progress has been made globally in curbing the tobacco use epidemic, efforts are warranted to address the shifting landscape with introduction of new and emerging tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Progress in reducing e-cigarette use and addressing associated behaviors varies across countries. Opportunities exist for countries to develop and implement evidence-based policies and strategies related to the use of e-cigarettes. Continued surveillance and monitoring of e-cigarettes and other new and emerging tobacco products is critical to informing tobacco control policy, planning, regulation, and practice worldwide.

### Preparedness and response for chikungunya virus introduction in the americas [^115NyM2B]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Outbreak intervention for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics — controlling an epidemic of CHIKV or a series of outbreaks over a larger geographic scale requires activating a command center (Emergency Operations Center), either physical or virtual, where epidemiologists, entomologists and vector control specialists, educators, and media communicators can jointly plan, work, and evaluate progress. Epidemiological services need to be organized so that daily, detailed reports are sent to authorized personnel, and an efficient system of communications is established allowing for feed-back reports and acknowledgements (by e-mail, fax, telephone, etc.). Population engagement includes orienting the population at large through the media on infection risk and how families and communities can contribute, with daily reporting to the press of affected communities so residents and local authorities can take appropriate actions (e.g., proper use of repellents, elimination of all standing water, organizing clean-up campaigns), and dissemination must ensure that no personal information or identifiers are released to the public at any time. Clinical and operational measures further include ensuring that infected and febrile persons are protected from mosquito bites by using bednets at home and in hospitals, and orienting vector control operations through real-time epidemiological and entomological assessments of CHIKV transmission indicating the specific areas that need to be treated.

### A fast and accurate method for genome-wide scale phenome-wide G × E analysis and its application to UK biobank [^11478pYP]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

The etiology of most complex diseases involves genetic variants, environmental factors, and gene-environment interaction (G × E) effects. Compared with marginal genetic association studies, G × E analysis requires more samples and detailed measure of environmental exposures, and this limits the possible discoveries. Large-scale population-based biobanks with detailed phenotypic and environmental information, such as UK-Biobank, can be ideal resources for identifying G × E effects. However, due to the large computation cost and the presence of case-control imbalance, existing methods often fail. Here we propose a scalable and accurate method, SPAGE (SaddlePoint Approximation implementation of G × E analysis), that is applicable for genome-wide scale phenome-wide G × E studies. SPAGE fits a genotype-independent logistic model only once across the genome-wide analysis in order to reduce computation cost, and SPAGE uses a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the test statistics for analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios. Simulation studies show that SPAGE is 33–79 times faster than the Wald test and 72–439 times faster than the Firth's test, and SPAGE can control type I error rates at the genome-wide significance level even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. Through the analysis of UK-Biobank data of 344,341 white British European-ancestry samples, we show that SPAGE can efficiently analyze large samples while controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios.

### Application of optimal band-limited control protocols to quantum noise sensing [^114ao5q2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Industrial, metrological, and medical applications provide a strong pull for advanced nanoscale sensing techniques, exploiting the exquisite sensitivity of quantum coherent systems to their environments –. Qubits naturally exhibit broadband coupling to their environments, but the application of a temporally modulated driving field can alter their frequency response in a desired way. For instance, application of modulation which periodically flips the qubit's state has allowed for a narrowband spectral response, which may be tuned by adjusting the interpulse spacing or extending the sequence duration. This general approach to "dynamical decoupling noise spectroscopy" has seen broad adoption in quantum information –, as well as in nanoscale diamond sensors for biomedical and physics-based applications –. However, control implemented in this form suffers from the significant complication of spectral leakage, where signals outside of a target sensing frequency band can contribute to the sensor's response (Fig. 1 b), and if not properly accounted for, can lead to bias when estimating the spectral density of a signal from experimental data.

Illustration of frequency response of time–domain control protocols. a Sensor signal for a driven qubit is derived from the spectral overlap of the noise and control, producing a detectable rotation error. b Sensor spectral response for a given control protocol (inset) may show leakage outside of the desired target band, which makes an undesired contribution to the signal in a. c, d Sample control sequences for flat-top echo protocols and their DPSS-modulated counterparts.

### E-cigarettes and cancer patients [^117Lbosr]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing popularity and availability of electronic cigarettes (i.e., e-cigarettes) in many countries have promoted debate among health professionals as to what to recommend to their patients who might be struggling to stop smoking or asking about e-cigarettes. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines for using e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, some health professionals have urged caution about recommending them due to the limited evidence of their safety and efficacy, while others have argued that e-cigarettes are obviously a better alternative to continued cigarette smoking and should be encouraged. The leadership of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer asked the Tobacco Control and Smoking Cessation Committee to formulate a statement on the use of e-cigarettes by cancer patients to help guide clinical practice. Below is this statement, which we will update periodically as new evidence becomes available.

### Is e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults associated with later smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115d3gBe]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary measures

Effect estimates were reported as ORs (and converted where necessary). ORs of the association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette use were combined using a random-effects model. All unadjusted ORs were calculated using observed data points that were obtained from the original study or directly from the author if insufficient information was provided in the original study. Calculated effect sizes were double checked by the review team.

Adjusted ORs were reported as they were in the original study and adjusted risk ratios were converted to ORs using a modified version of a formula published in the Cochrane Handbook (Section 12.5.4.4): OR = (−RR+RR×ACR) / (RR×ACR−1), where OR = odds ratio; RR = risk ratio; ACR = assumed control risk (calculated on a per study basis as the risk of later smoking among controls).

Synthesis and results

In a random-effects model, we calculated the pooled ORs from unadjusted and adjusted ORs for ever cigarette use at follow-up among never smokers at baseline, in ever compared with never e-cigarette users at baseline. Where multiple exposure or outcome measures were included in the original study, this estimate was used in the main analysis. If ever use of e-cigarettes was not reported, then the main effect reported in the study was included in our main analyses.

Where possible (ie, where more than one study was available), we also analysed the results in a series of subgroups — we pooled odds for: (i) ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and ever versus never smoking at follow-up; (ii) ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and current (past 30 days) versus non-current use of cigarettes at follow-up, and (iii) current versus non-current e-cigarette use at baseline and ever versus never smoking at follow-up. In retrospective studies, measures of e-cigarette use prior to smoking were treated as baseline and smoking status at the time of the study was treated as the follow-up. We aimed to pool the results of regular (at least monthly for > 6 months) cigarette use at follow-up among never smokers at baseline, in regular compared with non-regular e-cigarette users at baseline; however, insufficient data were available to do so.

Heterogeneity of study effect estimates can be indicated by an I 2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analysis. All analyses were conducted using Stata SE V.15.1 and Review Manager V.5.

### Nonlinear down-conversion in a single quantum dot [^112BE7i2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

The SDC process in a single QD is schematically outlined in Fig. 1. In an initial step, a resonant TPE of the biexciton statewith energy E B is performed. By driving the system with a tunable, off-resonant control-laser field, a virtual state for the SDC process is defined. From there, spontaneous emission to the ground stateleads to optically controlled single photon emission. The SDC-emission energy E SDC is therefore correlated with the control-laser energy E C and the simple energy-conservation E B = E C + E SDC holds. Please note that in Fig. 1 we only show the scenario where the virtual state is defined relative to. In an equivalent scenario the virtual state can be defined relative to(see Fig. 2).

### E-cigarettes: unstandardized, under-regulated, understudied, and unknown health and cancer risks [^116D2Cc5]. Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes have the ability to deliver nicotine in a manner that is similar to, and, theoretically, safer than, combusted tobacco. However, these devices are extremely heterogeneous and regulation has struggled to keep up with their rapid evolution. A compilation of early data suggest that e-cigarettes may contain numerous toxic substances, including known carcinogens. However, there are few data available on the short- and long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, including any potential effect on cancer risk. Until more is known, e-cigarettes should not be considered a safe alternative to combusted tobacco use.

### Impact of a web-based tool (webCONSORT) to improve the reporting of randomised trials: results of a randomised controlled trial [^114b4UNV]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The CONSORT Statement is an evidence-informed guideline for reporting randomised controlled trials. A number of extensions have been developed that specify additional information to report for more complex trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using a simple web-based tool (WebCONSORT, which incorporates a number of different CONSORT extensions) on the completeness of reporting of randomised trials published in biomedical publications.

Methods

We conducted a parallel group randomised trial. Journals which endorsed the CONSORT Statement (i.e. referred to it in the Instruction to Authors) but do not actively implement it (i.e. require authors to submit a completed CONSORT checklist) were invited to participate. Authors of randomised trials were requested by the editor to use the web-based tool at the manuscript revision stage. Authors registering to use the tool were randomised (centralised computer generated) to WebCONSORT or control. In the WebCONSORT group, they had access to a tool allowing them to combine the different CONSORT extensions relevant to their trial and generate a customised checklist and flow diagram that they must submit to the editor. In the control group, authors had only access to a CONSORT flow diagram generator. Authors, journal editors, and outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of CONSORT items (main and extensions) reported in each article post revision.

Results

A total of 46 journals actively recruited authors into the trial (25 March 2013 to 22 September 2015); 324 author manuscripts were randomised (WebCONSORT n = 166; control n = 158), of which 197 were reports of randomised trials (n = 94; n = 103). Over a third (39%; n = 127) of registered manuscripts were excluded from the analysis, mainly because the reported study was not a randomised trial. Of those included in the analysis, the most common CONSORT extensions selected were non-pharmacologic (n = 43; n = 50), pragmatic (n = 20; n = 16) and cluster (n = 10; n = 9). In a quarter of manuscripts, authors either wrongly selected an extension or failed to select the right extension when registering their manuscript on the WebCONSORT study site. Overall, there was no important difference in the overall mean score between WebCONSORT (mean score 0.51) and control (0.47) in the proportion of CONSORT and CONSORT extension items reported pertaining to a given study (mean difference, 0.04; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10).

Conclusions

This study failed to show a beneficial effect of a customised web-based CONSORT checklist to help authors prepare more complete trial reports. However, the exclusion of a large number of inappropriately registered manuscripts meant we had less precision than anticipated to detect a difference. Better education is needed, earlier in the publication process, for both authors and journal editorial staff on when and how to implement CONSORT and, in particular, CONSORT-related extensions.

In addition to these 4 steps, the EIPAC framework includes 5 process-based conditions that ensure that the decision-making process is viewed as fair and transparent by all involved parties (Box 2). The conditions help to actively involve relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process and take account of their perspectives, to prioritize transparency and accountability to all parties, and to create mechanisms to re-evaluate decisions as new information emerges.

Box 2.
Process Conditions for Ethical Decision Making

Empowerment – Include all affected parties in the decision-making process as much as possible, with efforts to minimize power differences and optimize effective opportunities for participation.
Publicity – Ensure that the decision-making process is transparent and accessible to relevant stakeholders.
Relevance – Decisions should be made based on reasons (eg, best available evidence, ethical principles, standards and policies) that "fair-minded" people can agree are relevant under the circumstances.
Revisions and appeals – Create opportunities to revisit and revise decisions when new evidence or considerations arise, as well as mechanisms to challenge decisions and resolve disputes.
Compliance – Prioritize accountability, ensuring that the decision-making process is in alignment with the 4 other process conditions.

EVALI overview and ATS workshop priorities — E-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) is described as a severe pulmonary illness officially identified in 2019 and primarily linked to vitamin E acetate (VEA) in e-liquids mainly from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarettes, largely from "informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers"; contributing factors included more than 13 million individuals using e-cigarettes with youth prevalence of 25% in 2018 without federal regulation and manufacturing controls. The workshop was convened in 2021 to identify and prioritize research and regulatory needs and identified an urgent need for a national EVALI case registry and biorepository, physician education on screening for and documenting e-cigarette exposure, continued messaging on the risks of e-cigarette use, investment in research on EVALI and potentially harmful e-cigarette additives, regulation of e-cigarettes, and development of manufacturing standards.

### Target control of complex networks [^115ioBVM]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

We study two distinct schemes for choosing the subset of nodes we wish to control. In the random scheme, a fraction f of nodes are chosen uniformly at random. In the local scheme, the chosen nodes form a connected component, capturing a well-defined local network neighbourhood. To develop an efficiency measure of target control, we compare P D, which is the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control the fraction f of target nodes, with fN D, which is the corresponding relative fraction of the driver nodes needed for full control. If P D is less than fN D then target control is more efficient than full control for a given f. We also establish the overall target control efficiency by considering the integrated efficiency across the entire range of 0 < f ≤ 1. For both scale-free (SF)and Erdös–Rényi (ER) networks, we find that in general, local target control is more efficient than random target control. More surprisingly, we find that degree heterogeneous networks, such as SF networks, have higher specific and overall target control efficiency than degree homogeneous networks, for both random and local schemes, when the average degree of the network is large. In contrast, for full control, degree homogeneous networks, such as ER networks, are more efficient than the corresponding degree heterogeneous networks. Finally, we apply our methods to real data, confirming that many real-world networks display high efficiency of target control.

### Guidance on the use of social media in reproductive medicine practice [^115Df9G9]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Social media governance and patient interactions — policies, security controls, and etiquette — states that "Ideally, practices should create formal policies about the plans and expectations of account management", including elements such as "the frequency with which the site will be monitored, the minimum frequency with which new posts will be added, identification of specific personnel who are responsible for maintaining the posts (with plans for backup personnel as needed)", and protocols for posts that "contain inflammatory content, reveal private health information, make requests for clinic or physician contact, or solicit medical advice". It notes that "Security settings should be adjusted so that 'tags' (i.e., identifiers that may be attached to a comment or video posted online) from consumers are blocked or must be approved by authorized administrators of the accounts", and that "Security settings also can be adjusted so that only authorized page administrators can post content if desired". Practices "should also be familiar with their institutional or group policies regarding the use of social media", "should direct all online traffic to the practice's professional page and discourage staff from sending 'friend' requests to, or accepting requests from, patients directly", and that many professional organizations "recommend or insist on encouraging patients to 'follow' a practice or professional profile on social media". It emphasizes that etiquette applies equally online and that "Providers and patients also should not exchange protected health information through accounts on social media, as these channels are not encrypted".

### Regulation profiles of e-cigarettes in the United States: a critical review with qualitative synthesis [^111TPNL4]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, highly targeted regulation profiles, such as those aimed at youth protection, are popular in the US, while radical, multi-targeted regulation profiles remain relatively unusual. Differences in states' approaches to regulation may be due to the ease of implementing youth-specific restrictions, as compared to regulations aiming to restrict product use for all consumers. Given the lack of data concerning their safety as consumer products, and their potential efficacy as smoking cessation devices, it is unclear to what extent and by what means e-cigarettes should be regulated. In the meantime, regulations should remain highly adaptable in order to respond to any emerging evidence concerning this new product's potential harms and benefits.

### What are the respiratory effects of e-cigarettes? [^111gETwW]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Differences in regulatory approaches

Given uncertainties in health effects and harm reduction potential, different regulatory approaches have been adopted in different countries, with the UK at one extreme promoting the use of e-cigarettes for harm reduction, and the US, the European Union, and other countries on a spectrum from harm reduction to a principle of precaution. The position of respiratory and other academic and public health societies has generally emphasized a precautionary approach, with the notable exception of the UK's Royal College of Physicians. For example, a recent European Respiratory Society panel concluded that as the chronic effects of e-cigarette use are unknown, no evidence shows that they are safer than other tobacco products and that, on the basis of current knowledge, negative health effects cannot be excluded.

### Randomized controlled open-label trial of vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzer and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent response [^116yK6bj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

A 1-year multicenter prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on the effects of vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent response in hemodialysis patients.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Major inclusion criteria were use of high-flux polysulfone dialyzers with 50–70 ml/min β2-microglobulin clearance over 3 months, transferrin saturation over 20%, same erythropoiesis-stimulating agent for over 3 months, and hemoglobin at 10–12 g/dl. Hemodialysis patients were placed in four interventional groups: two hemoglobin ranges (10.0–10.9 or 11.0–11.9 g/dl) and two dialyzers. Patients were randomly assigned by central registration to a vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers or polysulfone control group. Primary end point was relative erythropoiesis resistance index at baseline between groups at 12 months. Erythropoiesis resistance index was defined as total weekly erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose divided by hemoglobin.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences in age or sex. There was no significant difference in relative erythropoiesis resistance index between vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers and control groups at 12 months (vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers: 1.1, control: 1.3). The vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers group showed better relative erythropoiesis resistance index than the control group at 11.0–11.9 g/dl hemoglobin (vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers: 1.0, control: 1.4 at 12 months, significant difference) but no difference at 10.0–10.9 g/dl hemoglobin.

Conclusions

The overall relative erythropoiesis resistance index showed no difference between the vitamin E-bonded polysulfone dialyzers and control groups, although the change in relative erythropoiesis resistance index differed according to hemoglobin level.

### Electronic cigarettes: product characterisation and design considerations [^116RGX51]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

Microprocessors, programmable logic units, integrated circuits and other electronic components may be incorporated into some e-cigarette products. The electronic components may be used to power components and in conjunction with a liquid crystal screen to display and/or record operating state parameters, such as battery life, use frequency per day, average use cycle and safety warnings. However, the microprocessor may also have additional functions such as the ability to control integrated MEMS (eg, pumps and/or motors) that deliver specifically programmed product quantities or concentrations. One patent describes Bluetooth communication protocol integration and multiple smoking software programs based on fluid type and user preference.

The presence of microprocessors and memory chips in e-cigarettes raises concerns about the collection and use of personal privacy information. A microprocessor may facilitate consumer data collection for dissemination to a third party, either wirelessly by Bluetooth or through the universal serial bus (USB) interface when the battery is recharged. Data may include the smoker's personal information (eg, gender, age, address), smoking topography and possibly health-related data. Of further concern is the ability of the software and microprocessor to directly or covertly manipulate nicotine delivery, and software viruses.

Some e-cigarettes may be used while connected by USB cord to a power source. Additionally, some e-cigarettes may be powered by permanent rechargeable battery (a manufacturer-supplied sealed unit), a non-rechargeable battery or a user-replaceable battery (rechargeable or non-rechargeable). Portable chargeable carrying cases are available for remote e-cigarette charging for some brands. Nickel-cadmium (NiCad), nickel metal-hydride (NiMh), lithium ion (Li-ion), alkaline and lithium polymer (Li-poly), and lithium manganese (LiMn) batteries may be used to power e-cigarettes.

### RadNuc: a graphical user interface to deliver dose rate patterns encountered in nuclear medicine with a 137Cs irradiator [^117Qhhjq]. Nuclear Medicine and Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The temporal variations in absorbed dose rates to organs and tissues in the body are very large in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine. The response of biological endpoints of relevance to radiation safety and therapeutic efficacy is generally modulated by dose rate. Therefore, it is important to understand how the complex dose rate patterns encountered in nuclear medicine impact relevant biological responses. Accordingly, a graphical user interface (GUI) was created to control a cesium-137 irradiator to deliver such dose rate patterns.

Methods

Visual Basic 6.0 was used to create a user-friendly GUI to control the dose rate by varying the thickness of a mercury attenuator. The GUI facilitates the delivery of a number of dose rate patterns including constant, exponential increase or decrease, and multi-component exponential. Extensive visual feedback is provided by the GUI during both the planning and delivery stages.

Results

The GUI controlled irradiator can achieve a maximum dose rate of 40 cGy/h and a minimum dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h. Addition of machined lead blocks can be used to further reduce the minimum dose rate to 0.0001 cGy/h. Measured dose rate patterns differed from programmed dose rate patterns in total dose by 3.2% to 8.4%.

Conclusion

The GUI controlled irradiator is able to accurately create dose rate patterns encountered in nuclear medicine and other related fields. This makes it an invaluable tool for studying the effects of chronic constant and variable low dose rates on biological tissues in the contexts of both radiation protection and clinical administration of internal radionuclides.

### Aliskiren [^114E4ZpV]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Aliskiren tablets are a renin inhibitor (RI) indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or greater who are at least 6 years of age, to lower blood pressure.

Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

1.1 Hypertension

Aliskiren tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and in pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or greater who are at least 6 years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with aliskiren tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Another article about E-cigarettes: why should I care? [^117AoGdW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Two recent comprehensive reviews of the scientific evidence on e‐cigarettes help to define the state of the science around e‐cigarettes. Admittedly, the science is in a state of flux and evolving rapidly. 1, 2 The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on the public health consequences of e‐cigarettes, and a new evidence review on e‐cigarettes and heated tobacco products commissioned by Public Health England both come to similar conclusions. 1, 2 Both reports acknowledge that available evidence indicates that e‐cigarette use is less risky than use of combustible tobacco cigarettes, that e‐cigarettes may be helpful to smokers who are trying to stop smoking cigarettes, and that e‐cigarettes should not be used by non‐smokers, especially youth. However, both reports also state that e‐cigarettes contain constituents that are not inert and are likely to have some negative health effects on their own. The reports also note the need for more research to better understand which patients might be most likely to benefit from e‐cigarette use to support complete cessation, who should avoid using them, and what the overall population health benefits might ultimately be.

### Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter [^112htS7w]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Exact analytic calculation shows that optimal control protocols for passive molecular systems often involve rapid variations and discontinuities. However, similar analytic baselines are not generally available for active-matter systems, because it is more difficult to treat active systems exactly. Here we use machine learning to derive efficient control protocols for active-matter systems, and find that they are characterized by sharp features similar to those seen in passive systems. We show that it is possible to learn protocols that effect fast and efficient state-to-state transformations in simulation models of active particles by encoding the protocol in the form of a neural network. We use evolutionary methods to identify protocols that take active particles from one steady state to another, as quickly as possible or with as little energy expended as possible. Our results show that protocols identified by a flexible neural-network ansatz, which allows the optimization of multiple control parameters and the emergence of sharp features, are more efficient than protocols derived recently by constrained analytical methods. Our learning scheme is straightforward to use in experiment, suggesting a way of designing protocols for the efficient manipulation of active matter in the laboratory.

### Integrating IT into the radiology environment [^115P5fXD]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Rather than perpetuating the struggle, "who controls the PACS, Radiology or Information Technology (IT)", Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula (CHOMP) took the approach of incorporating IT support within the Radiology Department. CHOMP faced the challenge of staffing Radiology computer systems and networks by using a two-pronged approach; promoting and training clinical staff in IT functions and transferring an experienced IT person into the Radiology Department. Roles and responsibilities are divided. CHOMP's IT Department supports the Radiology Department's desktop devices, PCs, printers, and standard peripherals; while the department's DICOM print and archive network, specialized hardware (e.g. Merge DICOM interface computers), and applications are supported by the Radiology Department. The IT Department provides operating system support for multi-user VMS, Unix, and NT-based systems, e.g. Sun Solaris for the DICOM archive, and Windows NT for Mitra PACS Broker, the HL7/DICOM interface engine. IT also supports network communications, i.e., network electronics (routers, switches, etc.), TCP/IP communications, and network traffic analysis; and OS operations support for major Radiology systems, e.g. back-ups and off-site tape storage. Radiology staff provides applications support and troubleshooting, including analyst functions for RIS; and are the first point of contact with the Radiology systems vendors, e.g. GE Medical, or Siemens. The Radiology Department's senior IT person, the Clinical Technology Coordinator, transferred from CHOMP's IT Department after 7 years in that department. She performs analysis and design associated with Radiology's computer systems, coordinates development of the department's strategic plan, evaluates vendor proposals, and assists the department with product and application selection. Her IT experience and growing knowledge of Radiology's clinical tasks enhances communications between the Radiology and IT departments. Formal meetings between the two departments are held monthly; informal and project-related meetings and discussion are frequent and vital to the continued good relationship between them. When CHOMP either upgrades or replaces its DICOM archive, and Radiology becomes completely filmless, the vendor's contract will include an on-site vendor-supplied picture archiving and communications systems support person for at least 6 months after deployment, to insure a better knowledge transfer. Having an on-site support person would have reduced the number of technical challenges the Radiology Department has faced over the past 2 years. Finding and maintaining qualified staff versed in both IT and Radiology has been and will continue to be difficult. A blend of IT and Radiology support staff and open communication between the departments is working for CHOMP.

### Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide [^117JTaxU]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS

Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with nadolol and bendroflumethiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide tablets are not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed combination represents the dose titrated to the individual patient's needs, it may be more convenient than the separate components.

### Equity as the fourth' E' in the '3 E' s' approach to injury prevention [^114Goocc]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

The education, engineering and enforcement (3 E's) approach to injury prevention is grounded in assumptions that it is effective for everyone; however, evidence demonstrates that it fails to consider opportunities for all populations to experience safe and injury-free lives. In this way, the 3 E's approach does not support health equity in the injury prevention field. In this brief report, we argue that a fourth E, equity, must also be used with the 3 E's approach to injury prevention.

### Primary care-relevant interventions for tobacco and nicotine use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^114Sq4Gr]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Interventions to discourage the use of tobacco products (including electronic nicotine delivery systems or e-cigarettes) among children and adolescents may help decrease tobacco-related illness and injury.

Objective

To update the 2013 review on primary care-relevant interventions for tobacco use prevention and cessation in children and adolescents to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsyINFO, and EMBASE (September 1, 2012, to June 25, 2019), with surveillance through February 7, 2020.

Study Selection

Primary care-relevant studies; randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized controlled intervention studies of children and adolescents up to age 18 years for cessation and age 25 years for prevention. Trials comparing behavioral or pharmacological interventions with no or a minimal tobacco use intervention control group (eg, usual care, attention control, wait list) were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tobacco use initiation; tobacco use cessation; health outcomes; harms.

Results

Twenty-four randomized clinical trials (N = 44 521) met inclusion criteria. Behavioral interventions were associated with decreased likelihood of cigarette smoking initiation compared with control interventions at 7 to 36 months' follow-up (13 trials, n = 21 700; 7.4% vs 9.2%; relative risk [RR], 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73–0.92]). There was no statistically significant difference between behavioral interventions and controls in smoking cessation when trials were restricted to smokers (9 trials, n = 2516; 80.7% vs 84.1% continued smoking; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93–1.01]). There were no significant benefits of medication on likelihood of smoking cessation in 2 trials of bupropion at 26 weeks (n = 523; 17% [300 mg] and 6% [150 mg] vs 10% [placebo]; 24% [150 mg] vs 28% [placebo]) and 1 trial of nicotine replacement therapy at 12 months (n = 257; 8.1% vs 8.2%). One trial each (n = 2586 and n = 1645) found no beneficial intervention effect on health outcomes or on adult smoking. No trials of prevention in young adults were identified. Few trials addressed prevention or cessation of tobacco products other than cigarettes; no trials evaluated effects of interventions on e-cigarette use. There were few trials of pharmacotherapy, and they had small sample sizes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Behavioral interventions may reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation in nonsmoking children and adolescents. Research is needed to identify effective behavioral interventions for adolescents who smoke cigarettes or who use other tobacco products and to understand the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^114s6cCu]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

E-cigarettes or or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) have rapidly gained popularity in the U.S. Controversy exists about the safety and efficacy of ENDS. The American College of Preventive Medicine's Prevention Practice Committee undertook a consensus-based evidence review process to develop a practice statement for the American College of Preventive Medicine.

Methods

A rapid review of the literature was performed through June 2017 to identify efficacy, patient-oriented harms, and the impact on population health.

Results

On an individual level, limited evidence suggests that ENDS may be effective at reducing cigarette use among adult smokers intending to quit. There is insufficient evidence addressing potential long-term harms of ENDS, and limited evidence is available about short-term harms of ENDS and the impact of secondhand exposure. Although ENDS appear safer than combustible cigarettes, they are not without risk. Among youth there is no known benefit and significant concern for harm. On a population level, there may be significant harms associated with ENDS, particularly among youth nonsmokers. The long-term balance of potential benefits versus harms from the individual and population perspectives are unclear.

Conclusions

The American College of Preventive Medicine developed practice recommendations that include encouraging screening for ENDS use, strategies to prevent the initiation of ENDS use in nonsmokers, particularly in youth, adoption of a harm reduction model for smokers intending to quit in those who refuse or fail to quit with evidence-based smoking-cessation methods, recommendations on policy and regulatory strategies to decrease public use of ENDS and regulation of their components, and future research needs.

### Cost effectiveness of guided internet-based interventions for depression in comparison with control conditions: an individual-participant data meta-analysis [^117AaxmV]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2017. We used key terms for depression, Internet‐based treatments, and cost‐effectiveness analyses (see Supporting Information). Furthermore, we asked experts and the authors of the selected studies if they were aware of other related studies. No language restriction was applied. There was no published protocol for this study. Additional information on the methods of this study can be found in the Supporting Information.

Two reviewers (SK and JEB) independently examined the eligibility of the identified studies and reached consensus on which studies to include in the review. We included (a) randomized controlled trials, (b) comparing a guided Internet‐based intervention, (c) to a control condition (e.g. care as usual, waiting list), (d) aimed at adults with depression or subclinical depression (based on a structured clinical interview or on elevated depressive symptomatology in a self‐report measure), and (e) included measurements of depressive symptom severity, and healthcare utilization and productivity losses.

2.2 Collection of IPD

We contacted the first authors of each study that met our inclusion criteria to ask for permission to access their primary dataset. We provided the authors with an overview of our study and a list of variables that we wished to acquire. We received data that were strictly anonymous making it impossible to track the identity of any of the participants.

### Disease-economy trade-offs under alternative epidemic control strategies [^116Tvq7A]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Methodological contributions

Our first contribution is methodological: we construct a data-driven, theoretically-consistent coupled epi-economic model which can be used to study important properties of novel pathogens in economies. We emphasize two core model features. First, regardless of control strategy, in our model the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic spreads rapidly in the population, with peak daily incidence early in the epidemic (Fig. 2 A, C), and final proportions of the population exposed (Fig. 2 C) are largely unaltered. A plausible blanket lockdown designed to minimize total cases (see SI 4.1) can indeed reduce cases relative to targeted or voluntary isolation strategies, however it leads to a rebound (Fig. 2 A) when the lockdown is relaxed. This rebound is observed in all blanket lockdown scenarios considered, including when the lockdown is combined with additional non-pharmaceutical interventions such as shifting to more online activity — SI Figs. S 7, S 11 and S 13. In the discussion we describe how blanket lockdowns may still have useful complementarities with targeted isolation despite the potential for rebounds. All "control" strategies nevertheless significantly outperform a "no control" strategy where neither individuals nor a social planner optimize behavior (shown in SI Fig. S 3). Second, under a targeted isolation strategy, disease control does not come at as large an economic cost as under voluntary isolation or a case-minimizing blanket lockdown (Fig. 2 B, C). In aggregate terms, targeted isolation converts an historically severe recession (66% peak-to-trough contraction under voluntary isolation, 84% under the blanket lockdown) to a mild and not-atypical one (3% peak-to-trough contraction). By coordinating individuals' behavior over the course of the epidemic, targeted isolation can minimize the disease-economy trade-off imposed by voluntary isolation and blanket lockdown strategies.

E-cig and vaping product use — associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemiology and clinical features include that as of February 2020, more than 2800 cases of EVALI have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, resulting in 68 deaths. Seventy-seven percent of those diagnosed with EVALI are under 35 years of age (median age, 24 years) and 68% are male, and the typical clinical presentation of EVALI includes respiratory and gastrointestinal complaints; presence of systemic inflammation, particularly marked leukocytosis; and chest imaging showing bilateral, multifocal ground-glass opacifications. Lipoid pneumonia had been suggested as the responsible pathophysiology based on several cases where BAL fluid from admitted patients revealed the presence of lipid laden macrophages; however, a recent study described the pathologic examination of lung biopsies from patients with EVALI where the findings were more consistent with airway-centered chemical pneumonitis rather than lipoid pneumonia. In the majority of cases (more than 80%), patients vaped products containing THC, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana, and EVALI has been linked to vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent found in most THC-containing e-liquids; the dramatic rise in EVALI related to THC-containing vape devices has prompted the FDA to prepare upcoming regulation on the use and commercialization of vaping devices that contain substances other than nicotine, and similarly, several states are already working on a series of regulations to control these devices as well as flavorings.

### Effects of vitamin E on stroke subtypes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114LcRxW]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Results

Fig 1summarises the process of identifying eligible randomised controlled trials. After title and abstract evaluation, we were left with 22 articles. We excluded 14 more articles not meeting our inclusion criteria after evaluating the full text articles: eight articles presented subgroup or additional analyses of trials already included; one article was a meta-analysis; one article reported a follow-up of less than a year; one study did not have a placebo control group; two trials used tocopheryl nicotinate, not α-tocopherol (vitamin E); and one study was not a randomised controlled trial. We identified one additional articleby manually searching reference lists of included articles and reviews. Thus, nine trials were included in this analysis.

Fig 1 Flow chart of identifying and including trials

Study characteristics

The characteristics of the included randomised controlled trials are summarised in the table. The total number of participants in the trials was 118 765 (59 357 randomised to vitamin E and 59 408 to placebo). One study did not specify the method of analysis, all other trials were analysed according to the intention to treat principle.

### Neural network-based bluetooth synchronization of multiple wearable devices [^1174CrpM]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The adoption of Bluetooth-based wearable devices for the collection of physiological data in real-world scenarios, has seen a steady increase, primarily due to their portability, convenience, and safety attributes. Most applications, including those within the health sector, require collection from multiple devices. However, current time synchronization methods for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) multi-channel systems cannot satisfy the requirement of accurate mutual synchronization (i.e. multiple wearables performing a group activity in unison). Here, we present an application-level solution for Bluetooth synchronization to remotely control wearable devices and ensure mutual synchronization without placing an undue burden on the hardware.

Bottlenecks from the BLE protocol are mostly due to channel jamming and multiple-user functionality. Integrating these wearable devices with an ad hoc protocol (i.e. ANT+, WiFi, Zigbee) in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band of the wireless medium can solve the problem. However, if a wearable includes an ad hoc wireless protocol (thus replacing BLE), power consumption figures and physical size of the wearable device normally increase, and a non-standardized auxiliary receiver at the remote end is required because these wireless protocols are typically proprietary. Given the widespread use of BLE in many electronic devices (e.g. laptops, mobiles, and tablets), wireless synchronization across multiple wearables via BLE is preferable because it maintains standardized and secured connectivity. BLE-based wearable device synchronization is achievable with specific hardware-software co-design, as detailed in this work.

### The dengue-specific immune response and antibody identification with machine learning [^113tv31C]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, we evaluated the physicochemical composition of the repertoire and CDR3 length (Fig. 3b). As a hallmark of glycan-binding capability, considering that dengue protein E is glycosylated, we characterized the percentage of polar amino acids Cysteine (C), Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q), Serine (S), Threonine (T) and Tyrosine (Y)and the number of Y in the CDR3 sequences, and compared these parameters in control mice, EDIII-2 and Whole E-2 immunized mice for heavy and light chains. The reason for selecting also Y counts alone as a parameter lies in the fact that it has already been established that the amino acid Y plays a crucial role in the paratope of DENV broadly neutralizing antibody CDR3s which bind to certain epitope structures on dengue protein E through Y-repeated motifs such as YYY or YYYY –. Control, EDIII and Whole E had similar CDR3 length frequency distributions, with most of the CDR3s having a length between 4 and 19 amino acids for the heavy chains and between 7 and 11 amino acids for the light chains. Moreover, for heavy chain CDR3s long 4 to 16 amino acids, the Y counts and polar amino acid percentage per CDR3 were similar among the control, EDIII-2 and Whole E-2 groups. When analyzing longer heavy chain CDR3 (≥ 17 amino acids), the control was highly different from the two DENV-immunized datasets: EDIII and Whole E developed long CDR3 with high Y counts and enrichment (higher frequency) in the polar amino acids C, N, Q, S, T, Y. With regards to the light chains, CDR3 longer than 11 amino acids showed no Y except for the length of 16 amino acids in the control, while EDIII presented Tyrosines in CDR3 long 12, 15 and 16 amino acids and Whole E presented Tyrosines in 12, 13, 17, and 20 amino acids long CDR3s. Interestingly, the maximum number of Y per heavy chain CDR3 present in Whole E cohort (n = 8) was double than the one for the light chains (n = 4), suggesting that the composition of Y in the heavy chain CDR3 is more relevant for dengue antigen binding with respect to the light chain CDR3. Control light chain CDR3 longer that 11 amino acids contained polar amino acids only for a length of 16 amino acids while EDIII contained polar amino acids in lengths 12, 15, 16, 17 amino acids and Whole E in more lengths, specifically 12, 13, 14, 17, 20 amino acids. We observed that mice immunized with other antigens such as OVA or HbsAg did not develop antibodies with long CDR3s (i.e. > 28 a.a. Supplementary Fig. 3a) and the CDR3 lengths distribution was largely overlapping between the control and OVA-/HbsAg-immunized mice, within the ranges between 4 a.a. and 20 a.a. of length. There was no enrichment in polar amino acids in the repertoire of control, OVA- and HbsAg-immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e) compared to DENV (Fig. 3b). Collectively, dengue protein immunization imprints on the antibody repertoire a signature with longer CDR3 sequences which are rich in polar amino acids, especially for the heavy chain and, to a minor extent, for the light chains. These longer CDR3 sequences might enable simultaneous binding of anti-DENV antibodies with polar amino acids to epitopes on the envelope protein E glycans and to other epitopes on the amino acid backbone of protein E.

### Caffeine citrate (Cafcit) [^113ZHKEp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Overall, the reported number of adverse events in the double-blind period of the controlled trial was similar for the CAFCIT (caffeine citrate) and placebo groups. The following table shows adverse events that occurred in the double-blind period of the controlled trial and that were more frequent in CAFCIT-treated patients than placebo.

In addition to the cases above, three cases of necrotizing enterocolitis were diagnosed in patients receiving CAFCIT (caffeine citrate) during the open-label phase of the study.

Three of the infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis during the trial died. All had been exposed to caffeine. Two were randomized to caffeine, and one placebo patient was "rescued" with open-label caffeine for uncontrolled apnea.

Adverse events described in the published literature include: central nervous system stimulation (i.e., irritability, restlessness, jitteriness), cardiovascular effects (i.e., tachycardia, increased left ventricular output, and increased stroke volume), gastrointestinal effects (i.e., increased gastric aspirate, gastrointestinal intolerance), alterations in serum glucose (i.e., hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia), and renal effects (i.e., increased urine flow rate, increased creatinine clearance, and increased sodium and calcium excretion). Published long-term follow-up studies have not shown caffeine to adversely affect neurological development or growth parameters.

A published randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in premature infants with birthweights of 500–1250 grams studied the safety of caffeine citrate in apnea of prematurity (NCT00182312). This trial randomized approximately 2000 premature infants with a mean gestational age of 27 weeks at birth. The median duration of caffeine therapy was 37 days. Prior to discharge home, death, ultrasonographic signs of brain injury, and necrotizing enterocolitis were not more common in the caffeine citrate group compared to the placebo. At follow up at both 18 months and 5 years corrected age, death was not more common in the caffeine citrate treated group compared to placebo, nor did caffeine citrate use adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Electronic nicotine-delivery systems for smoking cessation [^115Q3Np3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Electronic nicotine-delivery systems - also called e-cigarettes - are used by some tobacco smokers to assist with quitting. Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of these systems is needed.

Methods

In this open-label, controlled trial, we randomly assigned adults who were smoking at least five tobacco cigarettes per day and who wanted to set a quit date to an intervention group, which received free e-cigarettes and e-liquids, standard-of-care smoking-cessation counseling, and optional (not free) nicotine-replacement therapy, or to a control group, which received standard counseling and a voucher, which they could use for any purpose, including nicotine-replacement therapy. The primary outcome was biochemically validated, continuous abstinence from smoking at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included participant-reported abstinence from tobacco and from any nicotine (including smoking, e-cigarettes, and nicotine-replacement therapy) at 6 months, respiratory symptoms, and serious adverse events.

Results

A total of 1246 participants underwent randomization; 622 participants were assigned to the intervention group, and 624 to the control group. The percentage of participants with validated continuous abstinence from tobacco smoking was 28.9% in the intervention group and 16.3% in the control group (relative risk, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.43 to 2.20). The percentage of participants who abstained from smoking in the 7 days before the 6-month visit was 59.6% in the intervention group and 38.5% in the control group, but the percentage who abstained from any nicotine use was 20.1% in the intervention group and 33.7% in the control group. Serious adverse events occurred in 25 participants (4.0%) in the intervention group and in 31 (5.0%) in the control group; adverse events occurred in 272 participants (43.7%) and 229 participants (36.7%), respectively.

Conclusions

The addition of e-cigarettes to standard smoking-cessation counseling resulted in greater abstinence from tobacco use among smokers than smoking-cessation counseling alone. (Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and others; ESTxENDS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03589989.).

### Nanosecond optical switching and control system for data center networks [^113iUuaY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We have presented and experimentally demonstrated a nanosecond optical switching and control system for optical DCNs based on the label control mechanism, OFC protocol, and the clock distribution to enable nanosecond data recovery. Optical label channels deliver the allocated time, the label signals for the nanosecond packets forwarding, and the OFC protocol signals to resolve the packet contention. Experimental results confirmed an overall 43.4 ns optical switching and control system operation, 3.1 ns data recovery time without BCDR receivers, and a packet loss rate less than 3.0E-10 after 10 days of continuous and stable network operation. Those results pave the way to the practical deployment of high capacity and low latency optical DCN architectures based on distributed nanosecond optical switches with the nanosecond control system.

High-radix switches in large-scale networks can reduce switch count and hops, thereby decreasing the flow completion time and power consumption. The radix of currently proposed fast optical switches is less than that of the electrical switches, even if the feature of the theoretically unlimited optical bandwidth per port can properly compensate for this radix deficiency. For the next research step, the design of large-radix optical switches will further improve the network performance with the capability to build a fully flat network. Moreover, the flexible adjustment of the optical packet length in real-time is of key importance to adapt the network workload and thereby fully utilize the optical bandwidth. The automatic adjustment mechanism based on the traffic load prediction is a promising solution for future research. Furthermore, a fast and scalable hardware design of Push-In-Extract-Out (PIEO) scheduler proposed and implemented in refs. could be deployed in the FPGA-based ToR to flexible manage the optical packet forwarding and thereby improving the network throughput. WDM channels destining to different racks can be deployed at the optical ToR to improve the switching capability. Combining the linear regression algorithm proposed in ref. the WDM wavelength could be fast tuned to adapt the various traffic pattern.

### Low-dose photodynamic therapy promotes vascular E-selectin expression in chest malignancies, improving immune infiltration and tumor control [^116465o3]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

E-selectin is essential for tumor control following low-dose photodynamic therapy

In both our PM and NSCLC models, we monitored the tumor response to L-PDT in the presence or absence of an E-selectin blocking antibody (figure 3A). We found that tumor growth was significantly decreased in the L-PDT treatment group compared with controls (online supplemental figure 6A, B). This translated into a significant increase in mouse survival of the L-PDT group compared with controls in both models (median survival of 10 and 47 days in the L-PDT group vs 6 and 34 days in the control group of PM and NSCLC models, respectively, p < 0.05, figure 3A–C). Interestingly, when L-PDT treatment was performed in the presence of an E-selectin blocking antibody, tumor growth and survival were comparable with controls in both models (figure 3B, C, online supplemental figure 6A, B). Furthermore, because our NSCLC mouse model can spontaneously metastasize from the orthotopic location, we determined, for each animal, the presence of macroscopic metastasis (confirmed microscopically) in the control, L-PDT and L-PDT+E-selectin blocking antibody groups. Remarkably, the percentage of animals bearing metastases was strongly reduced in the L-PDT group (30%) compared with the L-PDT+E-selectin blocking antibody (90%) and control (NT, 80%, figure 3D and online supplemental figure 6C) groups.

### Disease-economy trade-offs under alternative epidemic control strategies [^114oRAg3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Public policy and academic debates regarding pandemic control strategies note disease-economy trade-offs, often prioritizing one outcome over the other. Using a calibrated, coupled epi-economic model of individual behavior embedded within the broader economy during a novel epidemic, we show that targeted isolation strategies can avert up to 91% of economic losses relative to voluntary isolation strategies. Unlike widely-used blanket lockdowns, economic savings of targeted isolation do not impose additional disease burdens, avoiding disease-economy trade-offs. Targeted isolation achieves this by addressing the fundamental coordination failure between infectious and susceptible individuals that drives the recession. Importantly, we show testing and compliance frictions can erode some of the gains from targeted isolation, but improving test quality unlocks the majority of the benefits of targeted isolation.

### Constructing and exploring neuroimaging projects: a survey from clinical practice to scientific research [^111a4mBY]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Ethical and privacy issues

Data sharing and releasing is a growing trend with the increasing volume of generated data. However, this trend also brings along a range of ethical and legal concerns and issues that need to be addressed. Data governance is defined as the principles, frameworks, and policies to maintain safety and privacy during all stages of data life.

Ownership

Before analyzing and sharing data, it is essential to establish data ownership. This is especially important in clinical projects involving various departments, including clinical departments like neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry, allied departments like radiology, and some third parties like funding agencies and collaborative institutions. Should there be conflicts about data ownership, the first responsible units of the subjects should have primary control over their raw data, regardless of previous consent. The consent should include clear information about data usage, anonymization, and privacy protection concerns, and provide options for data withdrawal or opting out of certain analyses, ensuring transparency in data handling practices.

The general data protection regulation (GDPR), drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), encompassed the "Rights of data subjects". It outlined specific provisions regarding the protection and management of personal data, ensuring participants' privacy and control over their own information, as well as obligating the researchers to respect and protect the participants and their data. As for the subsequent results derived from the original data, they are primarily the responsibility of the main authors or creators.

Additionally, in cases where multiple individuals or departments have contributed to the data analysis process, building agreements and guidelines before and during the projects is necessary. While decentralized data management is a growing trend, it is vital to consider the context in developing regions where researchers are affiliated with specific hospitals or institutions. It is recommended that these institutions adopt a coordinated approach to project management in situations where different departments or divisions have conflicting interests. This will help ensure a more cohesive and effective process for managing the project.

### Therapeutic deep brain stimulation targeting BNST-NAc circuit driven large-scale brain networks in treatment-resistant depression [^113i6YSH]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, microstate D is associated with negative BOLD activation with dorsal and ventral prefrontal and parietal cortices, which are related to the cognitive control network (CCN). Previous studies have labeled the topography similar to our microstate E as microstate D. Because of identifying a topography resembling the classical microstate D, our results suggest that microstate E may represent a component of this canonical microstate class. Recent studies have also explored inter-network connectivity alterations in depression, revealing reduced connectivity between the anterior DMN and auditory network, as well as between the right frontoparietal network, also known as CCN, and lateral visual network in MDD patients compared to healthy controls. In our study, DBS stimulation increased transition probabilities between microstate A (auditory network) and microstate C (anterior DMN), as well as from microstate E (a subcomponent of CCN) to B (visual network). These findings suggest that BNST-NAc DBS may improve the coordination between external perception and internal cognitive processing, thereby enhancing patients' perception of the external world and their cognitive appraisal of internal thoughts.

Transition probabilities between microstate C and D were reduced under DBS-On condition and were significantly correlated with clinical symptoms. Importantly, time-locked analysis revealed a robust increase in NAc gamma-band (30–100 Hz) power immediately preceding C → D transitions, an effect primarily driven by changes in the aperiodic component of the LFP signal. Conversely, such modulation of gamma power or its aperiodic component was not found preceding D → C transitions. The observed transient rise in NAc gamma-band aperiodic activity may represent an excitatory drive signal that triggers the shift from microstate C (associated with anterior DMN) toward microstate D (associated with CCN). By comparison, the transition from microstate D to microstate C likely reflects a more passive process and thus does not require an excitatory trigger. Notably, previous study has shown that thought rumination in MDD was correlated with increased functional connectivity between DMN and CCN. Therefore, BNST-NAc DBS may stabilize the local striatal circuitry, thereby attenuating the generation of these gamma aperiodic bursts. By suppressing this drive signal, DBS may effectively decouple the DMN and CCN, enabling the brain to escape from an inefficient ruminative cycle.

### Multipurpose self-configuration of programmable photonic circuits [^113P6fWc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Most reported state-of-the-art reconfigurable photonic circuits are configured manually or in a semiautomated manner by means of open-loop control, utilizing look-up tables that includes the pre-characterization of each tuning element and inter-element crosstalk. Although a significant number of proof-of-concepts and standalone components have been demonstrated, this approach does not scale efficiently with the number of tuning elements in complex large-scale circuits, including hundreds or thousands of components and actuators. These circuits demand both a dedicated control system and a software layer to automate their configurations for two reasons. First, the complexity of the targeted operations and nonideal components would lead to configurations that cannot be predicted in terms of pre-characterized data or human experience. Secondly, agile programmable systems require a fast and reliable feedback mechanism to exploit their reconfiguration capabilities.

The former is only one of the many challenges to address in developing large-scale programmable photonic circuits. Limitations connected to fabrication defects, design deviations, passive parasitic effects, power consumption, thermal crosstalk, and robustness of phase shifters must be considered, in conjunction with others connected to reconfiguration speed and enhanced convergence of automated functions. Due to space restrictions, we specifically cover these in Supplementary Note 10. In addition, a significant challenge resides in the efficient management of control circuit complexity, the interfacing of a large number of electronic signals and the associated large number of variables and equations to be solved. Although different in application, recent published chips with similar requirements integrate a great number of optical power monitors and phase shifters. For example, two recent demonstrations integrate 900 optical power monitors and 448 phase shiftersand 1024 phase shifters, respectively, in footprints < 300 mm 2.

### Nanosecond optical switching and control system for data center networks [^116yvo25]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Electrical switching based data center networks have an intrinsic bandwidth bottleneck and, require inefficient and power-consuming multi-tier switching layers to cope with the rapid growing traffic in data centers. With the benefits of ultra-large bandwidth, high-efficient cost and power consumption, switching traffic in the optical domain has been investigated to replace the electrical switches inside data center networks. However, the deployment of nanosecond optical switches remains a challenge due to the lack of corresponding nanosecond switch control, the lack of optical buffers for packet contention, and the requirement of nanosecond clock and data recovery. In this work, a nanosecond optical switching and control system has been experimentally demonstrated to enable an optically switched data center network with 43.4 nanosecond switching and control capability and with packet contention resolution as well as 3.1 nanosecond clock and data recovery.

### Control and context are central for people with advanced illness experiencing breathlessness: a systematic review and thematic synthesis [^1157MENc]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Breathlessness is common and distressing in advanced illness. It is a challenge to assess, with few effective treatment options. To evaluate new treatments, appropriate outcome measures that reflect the concerns of people experiencing breathlessness are needed.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to systematically review and synthesize the main concerns of people with advanced illness experiencing breathlessness to guide comprehensive clinical assessment and inform future outcome measurement in clinical practice and research.

Methods

This is a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. MEDLINE (1946–2017), PsycINFO (1806–2017), and EMBASE (1974–2017), as well as key journals, gray literature, reference lists, and citation searches, identified qualitative studies exploring the concerns of people living with breathlessness. Included studies were quality-assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist and analyzed using thematic synthesis.

Results

We included 38 studies with 672 participants. Concerns were identified across six domains of "total" breathlessness: physical, emotional, spiritual, social, control, and context (chronic and episodic breathlessness). Four of these have been previously identified in the concept of "total dyspnea". Control and context have been newly identified as important, particularly in their influence on coping and help-seeking behavior. The importance of social participation, impact on relationships, and loss of perceived role within social and spiritual domains also emerged as being significant to individuals.

Conclusion

People with advanced illness living with breathlessness have concerns in multiple domains, supporting a concept of "total breathlessness". This adapted model can help to guide comprehensive clinical assessment and inform future outcome measurement in clinical practice and research.

### A randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of vitamin E supplementation for protection against cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy: final results [^116UnKhh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

A randomized, open label with blind assessment, controlled trial was performed to assess efficacy and adverse-event profile of vitamin E, given as supplementation for prophylaxis against cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

Patients and Methods

A total of 30 patients scheduled to receive six courses of cumulative cisplatin-based regimens were randomly allocated to treatment and control groups and were then studied by means of neurological examination and electrophysiological study. Patients assigned to group I (n = 14) orally received vitamin E at a daily dose of 600 mg/day during chemotherapy and 3 months after its cessation were compared to patients of group II (n = 16), who received no vitamin E supplementation and served as controls. The severity of neurotoxicity was summarized by means of a modified Peripheral Neuropathy (PNP) score.

Results

The incidence of neurotoxicity differed significantly between groups, occurring in 3/14 (21.4%) of patients assigned to the vitamin E supplementation group and in 11/16 (68.5%) of controls (p = 0.026). The relative risk (RR) of developing neurotoxicity was significantly higher in case of controls, RR = 2.51, 95% C. I. = 1.16–5.47. Mean PNP scores were 4.99 ± 1.33 for patients of group I and 10.47 ± 10.62 for controls, (p = 0.023). None of the adverse events or deaths occurred, were judged as likely to be related to the vitamin E supplementation.

Conclusion

Vitamin E effectively and safely protects patients with cancer from occurrence of cisplatin neurotoxicity.

### Neural network-based bluetooth synchronization of multiple wearable devices [^113Qpw1d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

BLE is an asynchronous wireless protocol for data transfer and operates assuming either an advertising or a connected mode between two electronic entities. In advertisement mode, a one-to-many network transmission occurs based on the Generic Access Profile (GAP), particularly on a broadcast protocol with no data coherence, security, or encryption. Data on the advertisement header is accessible to every device on the network, thus raising concerns for data security. As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes mandatory when handling personal health data and biometric information, wearables must adhere to the data security regulations, especially while capturing data outside hospital environments or laboratory settings. On the other hand, when BLE operates in connected mode, the data is encrypted before wireless transmission, thus complying with the Generic Attribute Transfer (GATT) protocol from the BLE specifications. The electronics in this mode can accept and acknowledge recurring messages from the remote system to carry out an assigned task (e.g. ascertain predefined or user-defined characteristics to implement a given functionality). For instance, reading the battery status from a wearable using GATT can be achieved using predefined characteristics 0 × 2 A 19 through a return value in the range of 0–100%. GATT protocol is a suitable option for wearables. It enables additional data security and customization while sending commands (a feature that can be enabled or programmed), resulting in increased flexibility in controlling wearable functionality. Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSs) help improve the flexibility in developing wearable devices. Active multitasking and pre-emptive scheduling, advanced power supply control, high responsiveness with predictability, enhanced protection, and a streamlined code development and maintenance approach make RTOSs excellent candidates for standalone wearable systems. To operate with RTOSs, each component in the hardware has to be conceptually classified, systematically outlined, and prioritized for execution. Unlike general-purpose operating systems, the task scheduler in the RTOSs is tightly designed on top of the hardware for appropriate device functionality; thereby, it relies heavily on the system clock and hardware time parameters for performing any designed tasks.

### E-cigarette support for smoking cessation: identifying the effectiveness of intervention components in an on-line randomized optimization experiment [^114Du5nT]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The annual global burden of tobacco smoking includes more than 6 million deaths. Even with the most effective treatments (combined pharmacotherapy + behavioural support), quit rates remain modest. In England, e‐cigarettes (EC) have become the most popular methods of quitting over the last 10 years, supporting approximately 35% of all attempts. There is increasing evidence for their efficacy in promoting quitting over more conventional cessation aids; between 8 to 12% of those making a quit attempt using a nicotine EC typically achieve abstinence at 6 months, compared with 6% of those using nicotine‐replacement therapy (NRT), or 4% of those using behavioural support only or no support. In stop smoking services between 2020 and 2021, approximately 65% of quit attempts involving EC (alone or combined with medication), were successful at 4‐week follow‐up compared with 59% of attempts not involving EC. However, while data from throughout Great Britain shows that, at a population level, approximately three in five smokers report having tried an EC, approximately 65% discontinue use and continue smoking. A recent Cochrane Review pooling randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and uncontrolled observation studies show higher quit rates among those allocated to a nicotine EC condition compared to non‐nicotine EC [relative risk (RR) = 1.94], NRT (RR = 1.53) or behavioural support (RR = 2.61) at 6 months. This would translate to an additional three to six quitters per 100. Given their potential effectiveness and the harm reduction benefits if people fully switch, a clearer understanding of what types of support can help more smokers to fully transition to e‐cigarettes is warranted.

### Quetiapine [^115AKvgD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

### Clinical practice guidelines: remote microphone hearing assistance technologies for children and youth from birth to 21 years [^113MjGiw]. AAA (2018). Medium credibility.

Remote microphone hearing assistance technologies — channel, frequency, synthesis, controls, and programming options are outlined with stated pros and cons. For channel number, Single Fixed is described as easy for personal use without having to worry about changing channels but may cause interference with other FM users in a confined space, whereas Multi-channel Selectable allows changing channel easily and adds flexibility for multiple FM systems in schools but can add complexity and lead to being on the wrong channel inadvertently. Frequency choices include 72–76 mHz, which is compatible with older FM equipment but prone to interference from unwanted sources, and 216–217 mHz, which offers less interference and smaller receivers but is not compatible with older FM equipment. Synthesis options include Direct (user changes channel), giving the user control of switching channels but potentially being tedious if channels must be changed for multiple users, and Automatic (channel changes when in close proximity to receiver), which is convenient when changing channels for more than one user but can cause confusion in large groups because channels may change inadvertently. Controls include AGC with a Trimpot and Volume with a Dial; both are easy to adjust without connecting to PC but can inadvertently be changed. Programmable channels can reduce the number to those frequently used so users do not have to cycle through channels that are never used, but this may restrict flexibility to move equipment to other classrooms.

### Effect of e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone on smoking cessation: a randomized clinical trial [^1166ZdyE]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for smoking cessation remain controversial.

Objective

To evaluate e-cigarettes with individual counseling for smoking cessation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial enrolled adults motivated to quit smoking from November 2016 to September 2019 at 17 Canadian sites (801 individuals screened; 274 ineligible and 151 declined). Manufacturing delays resulted in early termination (376/486 participants, 77% of target). Outcomes through 24 weeks (March 2020) are reported.

Interventions

Randomization to nicotine e-cigarettes (n = 128), nonnicotine e-cigarettes (n = 127), or no e-cigarettes (n = 121) for 12 weeks. All groups received individual counseling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was point prevalence abstinence (7-day recall, biochemically validated using expired carbon monoxide) at 12 weeks, changed from 52 weeks following early termination. Participants missing data were assumed to be smoking. The 7 secondary end points, examined at multiple follow-ups, were point prevalence abstinence at other follow-ups, continuous abstinence, daily cigarette consumption change, serious adverse events, adverse events, dropouts due to adverse effects, and treatment adherence.

Results

Among 376 randomized participants (mean age, 52 years; 178 women [47%]), 299 (80%) and 278 (74%) self-reported smoking status at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Point prevalence abstinence was significantly greater for nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone at 12 weeks (21.9% vs 9.1%; risk difference [RD], 12.8 [95% CI, 4.0 to 21.6]) but not 24 weeks (17.2% vs 9.9%; RD, 7.3 [95% CI, -1.2 to 15.7]). Point prevalence abstinence for nonnicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling was not significantly different from counseling alone at 12 weeks (17.3% vs 9.1%; RD, 8.2 [95% CI, -0.1 to 16.6]), but was significantly greater at 24 weeks (20.5% vs 9.9%; RD, 10.6 [95% CI, 1.8 to 19.4]). Adverse events were common (nicotine e-cigarette with counseling: 120 [94%]; nonnicotine e-cigarette with counseling: 118 [93%]; counseling only: 88 [73%]), with the most common being cough (64%) and dry mouth (53%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults motivated to quit smoking, nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone significantly increased point prevalence abstinence at 12 weeks. However, the difference was no longer significant at 24 weeks, and trial interpretation is limited by early termination and inconsistent findings for nicotine and nonnicotine e-cigarettes, suggesting further research is needed.
