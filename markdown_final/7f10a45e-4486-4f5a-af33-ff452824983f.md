## Question

high dose vitamin A dosing to cure liver failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about high-dose vitamin A dosing to cure liver failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which clinical entities we mean by "liver failure" (acute liver failure versus acute-on-chronic liver failure) and whether any guideline-endorsed role exists for vitamin A in these settings. Then, I should review the direct evidence on vitamin A's hepatic effects, especially reports of toxicity versus benefit. Next, I will consider mechanistic plausibility in the liver, followed by a careful check of major guidelines and standard treatment pathways for liver failure. Finally, I will synthesize the findings into a clear, safety-focused conclusion and practical guidance, verifying there are no overlooked trials suggesting benefit and ensuring that replacement for deficiency is distinguished from harmful pharmacologic dosing [^112Txfat] [^112P7dzw] [^113hES6G].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rapidly evolving syndrome with encephalopathy and coagulopathy in patients without pre-existing cirrhosis, while acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) occurs in the setting of underlying chronic liver disease with acute decompensation and organ failures; neither construct includes vitamin A as disease-modifying therapy in standard care algorithms, so I need to be cautious not to overinterpret micronutrient discussions as curative therapy for failure states [^112Txfat] [^112P7dzw] [^113hES6G].

> Wait, let me verify what the direct clinical evidence shows for vitamin A in the liver. The available reports consistently document hepatotoxicity from excess vitamin A rather than benefit: a BMJ case report describes vitamin A–induced acute liver failure after years of unsupervised antioxidant use, requiring steroids as rescue for the toxicity itself; another report details hypervitaminosis A culminating in orthotopic liver transplantation; and a third case shows portal hypertensive complications including hepatic hydrothorax from long-term high-dose intake, all pointing toward injury rather than therapy [^114C28eS] [^115DgeNY] [^114VhtfB].

> Hold on, I should verify mechanism before drawing conclusions. Vitamin A is fat-soluble, accumulates in hepatic stellate (Ito) cells, and in toxic excess induces stellate cell hypertrophy/activation, pericellular fibrosis, portal hypertension, and can progress to hepatic failure; the described biopsies with Ito cell changes and portal hypertensive physiology despite noncirrhotic architecture corroborate this mechanistic pattern of toxicity rather than hepatoprotection [^115DgeNY] [^114VhtfB] [^1123YXV8].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. Major liver failure guidance emphasizes etiology-specific therapy and supportive care; vitamin A is not proposed as treatment for ALF or ACLF, and in DILI pathways, suspected offending agents (including hepatotoxic supplements) must be stopped immediately with supportive care instituted, which would contraindicate administering high-dose vitamin A in a failure state [^112Txfat] [^1134x8QL] [^111ai8hD].

> I will now examine the standard therapeutic algorithm for ALF to place this in context. Recommended steps include rapid identification and removal of the offending agent, timely antidotes such as N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity and in selected non–acetaminophen cases, organ support in an ICU, prognostication, and early transplant evaluation given low spontaneous survival in idiosyncratic DILI-related ALF; high-dose vitamin A does not appear anywhere in this pathway and would conflict mechanistically with concerns for hepatotoxicity [^1134x8QL] [^114xRKbf] [^115m2ncu] [^112Txfat].

> But wait, what about micronutrient supplementation in cirrhosis or ACLF — could that imply a role here? The ACLF guidance notes that vitamins, including vitamin A, may be supplemented if needed to correct documented deficiencies, which is fundamentally replacement therapy for malnutrition/malabsorption and not pharmacologic "high-dose" therapy to cure liver failure; conflating these would be a mistake, so I need to ensure we differentiate physiologic repletion from toxic supraphysiologic dosing [^113hES6G].

> Hmm, let me consider whether any related vitamin therapies for liver disease suggest a class effect that might apply to vitamin A. Trials of vitamin E in NAFLD/NASH and vitamin D in chronic liver disease focus on histologic or metabolic endpoints and show mixed or uncertain benefit, with safety concerns in some contexts; none of these demonstrate reversal of ALF or ACLF, so there is no translatable precedent for using high-dose vitamins to cure liver failure, and certainly not vitamin A which is itself hepatotoxic in excess [^11592sSr] [^115fVioy] [^113dajdL].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any trial or meta-analysis specifically supporting high-dose vitamin A in liver failure. Re-examining the references and guideline summaries, there are no randomized trials, prospective cohorts, or mechanistic human studies demonstrating therapeutic benefit of high-dose vitamin A in ALF or ACLF; instead, vitamin A appears repeatedly as a causative agent for liver injury within DILI frameworks, reinforcing harm rather than benefit [^1134x8QL] [^1123YXV8] [^112P7dzw].

> Synthesis and conclusion: High-dose vitamin A does not cure liver failure; rather, it is a recognized cause of severe liver injury up to acute liver failure and need for transplantation, and its administration in liver failure is contraindicated outside of carefully monitored physiologic replacement for proven deficiency, which itself should be approached cautiously in cholestatic settings and never as "high-dose" pharmacotherapy for organ failure [^114C28eS] [^115DgeNY] [^114VhtfB] [^113hES6G].

> Practical implications: I need to ensure that in any patient with unexplained ALF or portal hypertension, I carefully elicit supplement use and consider hypervitaminosis A as a potential etiology, promptly discontinue any vitamin A–containing products, deliver guideline-concordant supportive care and antidotes as indicated, and expedite transplant center referral when criteria are met; using high-dose vitamin A as treatment would be unsafe and contrary to evidence and guidance [^1134x8QL] [^112Txfat] [^112P7dzw].

High-dose vitamin A is **not recommended** [^114C28eS] for liver failure because it can cause severe hepatotoxicity [^115DgeNY], including acute liver failure and death. There is **no clinical evidence** that vitamin A improves liver function or outcomes in liver failure; moreover, high doses are hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Management should follow established guidelines, with supportive care [^114zxVa4], N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity [^1134x8QL], and liver transplantation when indicated.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **No evidence**: There is no clinical evidence or guideline support for high-dose vitamin A in liver failure.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: High-dose vitamin A is hepatotoxic [^114VhtfB] and can cause acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and death.

- **Guidelines**: EASL [^114zxVa4] and AASLD [^1134x8QL] recommend supportive care, N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen-related ALF, and liver transplantation when indicated [^114xRKbf].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of high-dose vitamin A

High-dose vitamin A poses **significant risks**, including:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Acute liver injury [^114VhtfB], cirrhosis, and liver failure.

- **Neurologic**: Intracranial hypertension, encephalopathy, and seizures [^115DgeNY].

- **Systemic**: Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and coagulopathy.

- **Mortality**: Increased risk of death from liver failure and complications [^112P7dzw].

## Recommended management strategies for liver failure

Evidence-based management includes:

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| N-acetylcysteine | - Acetaminophen-related ALF [^1134x8QL] <br/> - Early non-acetaminophen ALF | High [^114xRKbf] |
| Supportive care | All liver failure patients | High [^114zxVa4] |
| Liver transplantation | Severe ALF or ACLF with poor prognosis | High [^114zxVa4] |
| Corticosteroids | Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis | High [^113s4LuD] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

High-dose vitamin A is **not recommended** for liver failure because of its hepatotoxicity [^115DgeNY] and lack of benefit. Management should follow established guidelines [^114zxVa4], with supportive care, N-acetylcysteine, and liver transplantation when indicated.

### Steroids as rescue therapy for vitamin A-induced acute liver failure [^114C28eS]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Antioxidant drugs form one of the mainstay therapies for pain management in chronic pancreatitis. Heightened oxidative stress and free radical activity are the targets for the use of antioxidant therapy in chronic pancreatitis pain relief. One of the chief components of these drugs is beta-carotene and vitamin A. Vitamin A is a proven hepatotoxic agent which can lead to liver injury ranging from acute hepatitis to cirrhosis. Here, we present a case of chronic pancreatitis where the patient continued antioxidant therapy unsupervised for seven years and developed vitamin A-induced acute liver failure, which was treated with prednisolone.

### Vitamin A toxicity: When one a day doesn't keep the doctor away [^115DgeNY]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Vitamin A toxicity has been reported to cause severe liver disease and, occasionally, liver failure. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with symptoms of muscle soreness, alopecia, nail dystrophy, and ascites. He continued to deteriorate with the development of refractory ascites, renal insufficiency, encephalopathy, and failure to thrive. A liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of Ito cells and vacuolated Kupffer cells without cirrhosis. His clinical history revealed ingestion of large doses of vitamin A. His worsening clinical situation ruled out the possibility of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation, which resolved the symptoms. Vitamin A toxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. In conclusion, liver transplantation is a valid option if no improvement occurs despite the cessation of the medication.

Management of APAP overdose

After a single-time-point APAP overdose, symptoms of nausea and vomiting ensue within 12–24 hours, peaking at about 72 hours, and resolving rapidly thereafter. The severity of necrosis is linked to the extent of excess dosing and can lead to hyperacute acute liver failure (ALF) because of its rapid onset. Administration of oral or intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an effective antidote, given as a loading dose followed by maintenance doses over several days. If NAC is administered within 12 hours of ingestion, it virtually assures that the liver damage will be minimal. The characteristic laboratory profile of APAP hepatotoxicity includes very high aminotransferase levels with low bilirubin. The coagulopathy can be severe, and a prolonged INR is a bad prognostic sign.

Management in the early hours after an APAP overdose includes activated charcoal by ingestion or gavage, and certainly NAC, even if given more than 12 hours after APAP ingestion. For unintentional cases, NAC is also given, although its efficacy may be limited. Development of signs and symptoms of liver failure (primarily encephalopathy) is concerning, and once they are present, nearly one-third of patients either die or require a liver transplant. The remaining patients make a full and complete recovery within 7 days.

Prognosis

Several prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated including the King's College Hospital score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and the Acute Liver Failure Study Group prognostic index. In countries in which the over-the-counter sale of APAP has been restricted, the incidence of serious APAP overdoses has decreased.

### Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases in adults [^113dajdL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Improving vitamin D status could therefore be beneficial for people with chronic liver diseases.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in adults with chronic liver diseases.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and enquired with experts and pharmaceutical companies about additional trials. All searches were up to November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: We included 27 randomised clinical trials with 1979 adult participants. This review update added 12 trials with 945 participants. We assessed all trials thoroughly.

### Difficulty achieving vitamin D sufficiency with high-dose oral repletion therapy in infants with cholestasis [^117J1JQJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Oral high-dose repletion vitamin D therapy, also known as stoss therapy, can be effective in the treatment of nutritional vitamin D deficiency rickets in infants and young children without liver disease and in patients with cystic fibrosis. However, there is no literature about this approach in infants with new-onset cholestasis.

The study conducted a retrospective chart review of infants with cholestasis from March 2010 to March 2012 at a pediatric tertiary care center. Four cases satisfied the inclusion criteria and were described in detail. All patients received oral high-dose repletion therapy with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) 300,000 IU daily for 2 to 3 days. Follow-up vitamin D levels approximately 4 weeks later showed failure to achieve sufficiency levels (> 20 ng/dL) in any patient.

Unlike infants without liver disease, the use of oral high-dose repletion therapy may not be adequate as treatment of vitamin D deficiency in the setting of cholestasis.

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^115FWrqT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

Until the introduction of direct thrombin inhibitors for oral anticoagulation in 2008, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of this treatment. Still today, quite a number of patients remain on warfarin or phenprocoumon, and there are indications, such as prosthetic heart valves, for which there is no oral therapeutic alternative.

Due to their narrow therapeutic index, treatment with VKA should be monitored by periodic measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure proper efficacy while avoiding excess risk of bleeding.

The commonly used VKAs, warfarin and phenprocoumon, are mainly metabolized by the liver. Dosing recommendations do not suggest adapting the dose to kidney function; however, their use is not encouraged in patients with severe renal failure. Limdi et al. described an increased frequency of supratherapeutic INR levels in patients with chronic renal failure treated with warfarin. Although their use is not recommended in dialysis patients, VKAs are frequently prescribed in these patients as well.

End-stage renal disease is associated with reduced dosing requirements to achieve the target INR as well as the need for more intense INR monitoring to avoid dangerous overanticoagulation. The clinical effect of VKAs is highly dependent on liver function and interactions with drugs influencing liver metabolism. Further, heart failure and several food interactions are known to interfere with VKA activity.

Patients with chronic renal failure often have indications for long-term oral anticoagulation, mostly due to the high risk of thromboembolic events.

### No effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114Rpn7D]. BMC Medicine (2016). High credibility.

This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of high-dose vitamin D oral supplementation conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The trial demonstrated that a nutraceutical intervention based on high-dose vitamin D oral supplementation has no effect on hepatic fat content in T2D patients with NAFLD. Specifically, 24-week cholecalciferol supplementation did not improve transaminases levels or the serum levels of biomarkers specific for hepatic injury and fibrogenesis, such as CK18-M30 and P3NP.

- **Clinical surrogates of liver impairment**: There were no significant changes observed in the AST/ALT ratio and fatty liver index (FLI) after vitamin D supplementation.
- **Metabolic profile and glycemic control**: Despite an aim to study vitamin D's effects on fatty liver in diabetic patients, none of the parameters related to insulin resistance, metabolic profile, and glycemic control showed significant change after 24-week vitamin D treatment compared to the placebo group.
- **Endothelial function and atherosclerosis**: Vitamin D supplementation did not induce any specific effect on endothelial function and subclinical atherosclerosis.
- **Vitamin D levels at baseline**: Not all study participants had low circulating 25(OH)D levels at the baseline. A hypothesis was made that vitamin D supplementation could be beneficial for NAFLD only in patients with hypovitaminosis D. However, ancillary analyses did not support this, as patients with normal or reduced 25(OH)D at baseline had similar responses.

This research highlights the lack of efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on various health parameters in T2D patients with NAFLD.

### Vitamin D replacement for cirrhosis-related bone disease [^115fvr58]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The osteoporotic fracture rate in patients with chronic liver disease is approximately twice that of age-matched control individuals. About 66% of patients with moderately severe cirrhosis and 96% of patients awaiting liver transplantation have vitamin D deficiency. Studies have shown a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and bone density, particularly in the hip.

Previous studies of vitamin D therapy in cirrhosis-related bone disease have had major design flaws. Most reports and guidelines on the treatment of hepatic bone disease have concluded that vitamin D deficiency does not have a significant pathogenetic role in the development of osteoporosis in cirrhosis, and that there is no evidence for a therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplementation. Conversely, it is generally recommended that patients with cirrhosis and low bone density should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation; yet there is a paucity of reliable data on the optimal doses to use, as well as a lack of clearly demonstrated benefit.

We believe that clinical trials of vitamin D therapy in these patients with liver disease are warranted. As low-dose oral supplementation often will not normalize vitamin D levels or suppress parathyroid hormone activity in cirrhotic patients, high-dose, parenteral vitamin D might be preferable, but further long-term studies are required to assess the benefits and safety of this approach.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^115PSccz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Within 2 hours of arrival, the infant received 1 mg intramuscular vitamin K empirically for profound coagulopathy of yet unclear aetiology. Once the initial INR result was obtained, an additional 4 mg intramuscular vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma at 10 mL/kg were administered due to potential for ongoing bleeding apparent on imaging. The decision to give the additional vitamin K was extrapolated from dosing recommendations in biliary atresia and was made in consultation with paediatric pharmacy and paediatric haematology. The infant received packed red blood cells of 15 mL/kg divided into aliquots of 5 mL/kg, each administered over 3 hours, to mitigate the risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload.

### Effect of IV high-dose vitamin C on mortality in patients with sepsis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1154yNvT]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether IV high-dose vitamin C improves the short-term mortality of patients with sepsis.

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We searched EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria. The protocol was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000040528). All analyses were presented with the use of random-effects models. The primary outcome was short-term mortality defined as 28-day, 30-day, or in-hospital mortality.

Two authors independently evaluated the following eligibility criteria: 1) randomized controlled trial, 2) patients with sepsis aged ≥ 18 years, and 3) received intravenous high-dose vitamin C in addition to standard of care, or standard of care alone. Then, two authors independently extracted the selected patient and study characteristics and outcomes from studies that met the above eligibility criteria.

Eleven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,737 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. High-dose IV vitamin C was not associated with a significantly lower short-term mortality (risk ratio 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73–1.06; p = 0.18; I² = 29%) but was associated with a significantly shorter duration of vasopressor use (standardized mean difference, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.07; p < 0.01; I² = 80%).

### Future directions in acute liver failure [^115m2ncu]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) involves severe damage to hepatocytes, with causes ranging from prescription drugs and acetaminophen (APAP) to viruses, malignancies, autoimmune, and rare genetic/metabolic diseases. Despite diverse etiologies, clinical findings are remarkably similar due to the rapid onset of injury leading to hospitalization. Complications, including infectious, bleeding, and vital organ issues, frequently develop within days. Common etiologies include APAP, while rarer causes involve infections such as herpes simplex virus.

Etiologies vary globally, with APAP (paracetamol) overdose prevalent in Europe and other developed regions, whereas viral hepatitis A, B, and E are more common in developing countries. Indeterminate ALF accounts for as few as 5% of cases in well-vetted contexts but can exceed 50% with less extensive testing. In some settings, herbal and dietary supplements contribute more cases than prescription drugs.

APAP overdose appears to be the most common cause of ALF, particularly in North America and Europe. Data from the ALFSG Registry do not indicate a decline in the incidence of APAP ALF over the past 22 years.

### Case report of high-dose hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation [^115VeftH]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man with cryptogenic cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presented for orthotopic liver transplantation. Following organ reperfusion, the patient developed vasoplegic syndrome, with arterial blood pressures of approximately 60–70/30–40 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure [MAP] 90 minutes). He required high-dose norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions, as well as intravenous bolus doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin to reach a goal MAP of greater than 60 mm Hg. There was minimal response to a 2 mg/kg intravenous bolus of methylene blue. Following the administration of 5 g of intravenous hydroxocobalamin, the patient experienced a profound improvement in arterial blood pressure, with subsequent discontinuation of the vasopressin infusion and rapid reduction of norepinephrine infusion from 20 to 2 μg/min.

While there have been several reports of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass, there have been only limited cases of hydroxocobalamin used in liver transplantation, and none with high-dose administration. We present a case of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation that was refractory to high-dose vasopressors and methylene blue but responsive to high-dose intravenous hydroxocobalamin.

### Advicor [^115Eccio]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Advicor should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release (crystalline) niacin. For patients switching from immediate-release niacin to Niaspan, therapy should be initiated with low doses (i.e. 500 mg once daily at bedtime), and the Niaspan dose should then be titrated to the desired therapeutic response (see dosage and administration).

- **Liver dysfunction**: Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients who have substituted sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) niacin products for immediate-release (crystalline) niacin at equivalent doses.

Advicor should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of Advicor.

- **Niacin preparations and lovastatin preparations**: These have been associated with abnormal liver tests. In studies using Niaspan alone, 0.8% of patients were discontinued due to transaminase elevations. In studies using lovastatin alone, 0.2% of patients were discontinued for transaminase elevations.

In three safety and efficacy studies involving titration to final daily Advicor doses ranging from 500 mg/10 mg to 2500 mg/40 mg, ten of 1,028 patients (1.0%) experienced reversible elevations in AST/ALT to more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Three of these ten elevations occurred at doses outside the recommended dosing limit of 2000 mg/40 mg; no patient receiving 1000 mg/20 mg had three-fold elevations.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on acute-on-chronic liver failure [^1147EwZh]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute-on-chronic liver failure, specifically concerning the management of beta-blockers, EASL 2023 guidelines recommend initiating nonselective β-blockers cautiously while closely monitoring blood pressure in patients recovering from an episode of ACLF. Guide dose increases by the mean arterial pressure, recognizing that beneficial effects are limited with a threshold of < 65 mmHg.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^111EMUAy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In specific circumstances of acute-on-chronic liver failure, particularly concerning patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend administering prednisolone or prednisone (40 mg/day) orally. This treatment aims to improve 28-day mortality in patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (MDF ≥ 32, MELD score > 20) in the absence of contraindications.

### Consumption of dietary supplements in a liver transplant population [^116gaCse]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

The extensive use of alternative medicine products, herbal remedies, and vitamins in large doses has reached an all-time high in the general public. Some agents are reported and advertised as immune stimulants and may interfere with patients suffering from immune modification, autoimmune diseases, or transplant recipients. In this report, we present an investigation into the use of herbal remedies and vitamins in our liver transplant population.

We performed an investigation using a questionnaire to determine the use of herbal products and vitamins in our liver transplant population. Medical records were reviewed for each liver transplant recipient who admitted to consuming herbal products or vitamins. Information collected included patient demographics, transplant-related information, laboratory tests, outcomes, and herbs or vitamin products used. A total of 290 patients completed and returned the questionnaire. We found 156 patients admitting to taking more than a standard multivitamin and/or an herbal remedy.

All patients were treated with steroids for allograft rejection and experienced a recurrence of amino transaminases following the removal of steroids. Further investigation into dietary supplements using a patient questionnaire revealed that nearly 50% of patients admitted to using vitamins following transplantation, while 19% used herbal remedies combined with vitamins, with most admitting to using silymarin. One recipient was ingesting colostrum and required admission for the management of allograft rejection, while 5 patients had consumed large amounts of echinacea or CoE.

### Adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B [^112i6TGN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is an immunomodulator that might be involved in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. We investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency on long-term outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

We performed a prospective cohort study of 426 patients with CHB (65% male; mean age, 41 ± 13 years), who were enrolled from 1997 through 2000. Serum levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) were measured on study enrollment (baseline). Patients were followed for 159 ± 46 months until the last clinic visit or death; approximately 33% received antiviral therapy during the follow-up period. The primary outcome was a clinical event, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, complications of cirrhosis, or death.

At baseline, the patients' mean serum level of hepatitis B virus DNA was 5.0 ± 2.1 log₁₀ IU/mL; their mean level of 25(OH)D3 was 24.3 ± 9.4 ng/mL, and 348 patients (82%) had vitamin D deficiency (< 32 ng/mL). Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 did not correlate with cirrhosis or viral load. Ninety-seven patients (22.8%) developed clinical events by a mean time of 118 ± 60 months after study enrollment. Patients who developed clinical events had lower baseline serum levels of 25(OH)D3 (23.2 ± 10.4 ng/mL) than patients who did not (28.2 ± 9.3 ng/mL, P < .001). Low baseline serum 25(OH)D3 was identified as an independent factor associated with clinical events after adjustment for sex, age, and cirrhosis. The adjusted hazard ratio of vitamin D deficiency for clinical events was 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.06–2.43; p = 0.04).

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: Cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, pulmonary and renal considerations: Executive summary [^111TJS46]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In managing acute-on-chronic liver failure, particularly concerning the general principles and precautions, the SCCM 2020 guidelines recommend adjusting the doses of medications that undergo hepatic metabolism based on the patient's residual hepatic function. It is advisable to consult a clinical pharmacist when available.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^111TonBh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

For patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, especially those with alcohol-associated hepatitis, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of pentoxifylline to improve 28-day mortality in patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (MDF ≥ 32, MELD score > 20).

### Xenical [^116pY2zv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions and decreased vitamin absorption**: Xenical may interact with concomitant drugs, including cyclosporine, levothyroxine, warfarin, amiodarone, antiepileptic drugs, and antiretroviral drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Data from a Xenical and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when Xenical is coadministered with cyclosporine. Therefore, Xenical and cyclosporine should not be simultaneously coadministered. To reduce the chance of a drug-drug interaction, cyclosporine should be taken at least 3 hours before or after Xenical in patients taking both drugs. Additionally, for those patients whose cyclosporine levels are being measured, more frequent monitoring should be considered.

	- Patients should be strongly encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement that contains fat-soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because Xenical has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins and beta-carotene [see Dosage and Administration (2), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Furthermore, the levels of vitamin D and beta-carotene may be low in obese patients compared with non-obese subjects. The supplement should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the administration of Xenical, such as at bedtime.

	- Weight loss may affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus. A reduction in dose of oral hypoglycemic medication (e.g. sulfonylureas) or insulin may be required in some patients [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Liver injury**: There have been rare postmarketing reports of severe liver injury.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114u49DJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an overarching term that includes all disease grades and stages, and refers to a population in which ≥ 5% of hepatocytes display macrovesicular steatosis in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause of steatosis (e.g. medications, starvation, monogenic disorders) in people without excessive alcohol intake, defined as less than 20 g/day for women and less than 30 g/day for men. The spectrum of disease includes non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis that may be accompanied by mild inflammation, and non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is additionally characterized by the presence of inflammation and cellular injury (ballooning), with or without fibrosis. NASH may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.

Since June 2023, NAFLD has been replaced by the term 'metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease' (MASLD). The diagnosis of the disease is no longer made by exclusion; the positive diagnostic criteria are in the presence of hepatic steatosis, with one or more of the five cardiometabolic risk factors:

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: ≥ 25 kg/m² (≥ 23 kg/m² for Asians) or waist circumference > 94 cm for males and > 80 cm for females, or ethnicity adjusted.
- **Fasting serum glucose**: ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or two‐hour post‐load glucose levels ≥ 7.8 mmol/L (≥ 140 mg/dL) or glycated haemoglobin ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), or type 2 diabetes, or treatment for type 2 diabetes.
- **Blood pressure**: ≥ 130/85 mmHg or specific antihypertensive treatment.

### Vitamin D loading is superior to conventional supplementation after weight loss surgery in vitamin D-deficient morbidly obese patients: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^11554XvZ]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery is an effective method to treat obesity, (pre)diabetes, and NAFLD in morbidly obese patients and is associated with long-term weight loss and decreased overall mortality. Due to gastric restriction and malabsorption following the gastric bypass procedure, 50–96% of bariatric patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency, in addition to obesity-related nutritional deficiencies.

Only limited data are available regarding the best strategies for treating vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients. The clinical practice guidelines differ among scientific societies and often lack scientifically founded criteria. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials to provide reliable evidence for the recommendations on vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients.

The primary aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of a forced vitamin D dosing regimen (up to three oral loading doses in the first month postoperatively, intervention group) vs. conventional supplementation (placebo with following maintenance doses, control group) on parameters of vitamin D metabolism in morbidly obese, vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB) six months after surgery. Given the high prevalence of liver fibrosis in these patients and the intricate role of vitamin D in this condition, we assessed markers of vitamin D metabolism in liver biopsies from the subgroup of patients affected by significant liver fibrosis.

### Use of a loading dose of vitamin D for treatment of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal failure [^114DT8Pt]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with intestinal failure and short bowel syndrome who have been weaned off parenteral nutrition. Dietary supplementation with vitamin D is necessary to correct this deficiency. In certain cases, a routine supplementation strategy may be ineffective.

We report three cases of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal failure who showed improvement in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after supplementation with a loading dose of 20,000–40,000 IU of vitamin D provided weekly.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^11599niV]. Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Most adults and children with idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) present with a drug latency of 2–24 weeks, although some drugs have an ultrashort (< 7 days) latency. In multiple prospective registry studies, nearly 50% of patients exhibit acute hepatocellular injury, whereas the remainder present with either an acute mixed or cholestatic injury pattern. Once a diagnosis of idiosyncratic DILI is suspected, the suspect agent(s) should be immediately discontinued. Hospitalized patients with severe acute liver injury require careful monitoring for disease progression, and those experiencing acute liver failure (ALF), characterized by coagulopathy and encephalopathy, should be urgently referred to a liver transplant center due to their low likelihood (~25% chance) of spontaneous recovery.

With drug discontinuation, most patients with DILI (80%) fully recover without long-term sequelae. However, up to 10% of patients with severe hepatocellular DILI accompanied by jaundice may be at risk of death due to their liver condition or underlying medical comorbidities. Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with higher total bilirubin and INR levels, as well as lower serum albumin levels at presentation, are at the greatest risk for adverse outcomes. In addition, recent prospective registries have shown that patients with pre-existing liver disease are at a greater risk of adverse hepatic outcomes. A variety of prognostic indices and tools have been proposed to identify patients with DILI at an increased risk of adverse hepatic outcomes.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^115LUN2Q]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical studies testing high doses include the neutral VITdAL‐ICU trial, a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of high-dose enteral vitamin D3 in 475 critically ill medical and surgical patients with 25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/ml. It showed, in a secondary outcome, a significant mortality decrease in patients with decreased vitamin D serum concentrations at randomization (25[OH]D ≤ 12). RECTIFY was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of early single high-dose enteral vitamin D3 in 436 neuro ICU patients with 25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/ml. The RECTIFY trial was stopped at interim analysis for medical futility of the primary outcome, length of hospital stay, following the enrollment of 274 patients.

The VIOLET trial, a 1360 patient multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of patients with high risk for ARDS and mortality randomized to single high-dose enteral vitamin D3 supplementation, showed no benefit. Most recent meta-analyses demonstrated inconclusive results. The meta-analysis of Menger et al. follows the best practice of meta-analyses as recommended by the Cochrane handbook. Although Menger et al. found that vitamin D may be associated with reduced mortality, ICU length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation, the level of certainty is low, and further studies are warranted to confirm these results. Notably, it was further demonstrated that the parenteral administration of vitamin D was associated with a more significant effect on overall mortality than enteral administration, although these results are only hypothetical.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115fVioy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

- **Criteria for considering studies for this review**: We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, publication status, trial design, or date of publication. We excluded studies labelled as 'quasi-randomised' (i.e. pseudo-randomised) because the method of allocation of participants is not truly random.

- **Types of participants**: We included randomised clinical trials involving participants of any age, sex, or ethnic origin with NAFLD. Participants had imaging techniques or histology (evidence of histological damage on liver biopsy, including simple steatosis, fatty infiltration plus non‐specific inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis) showing hepatic steatosis or steatofibrosis (steatosis accompanied by fibrosis), with minimal alcohol intake: preferably a daily alcohol intake less than 20 g in women and less than 30 g in men. According to the new definition, minimal alcohol intake is a weekly intake of 140 g to 350 g for women and 210 g to 420 g for men (average daily 20 g to 50 g for women, 30 g to 60 g for men).

We excluded trials that included people with other causes of hepatic steatosis or steatofibrosis, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, and genetic liver diseases such as Wilson's disease and haemochromatosis. We excluded trials considering people with one or more causes commonly associated with secondary NAFLD (drugs, surgical procedures, and miscellaneous disorders such as abetalipoproteinaemia or hypobetalipoproteinaemia, partial lipodystrophy, environmental toxins, or total parenteral nutrition).

### Risk of overanticoagulation during acute kidney injury in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^111eXdqm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

With this study, we describe for the first time that acute deterioration of kidney function in patients treated with VKAs is associated with a high risk of overanticoagulation. This effect was previously suspected in a case report but had not been systematically analyzed. Our data show that 73% of patients experience an increase in the INR value during AKI when compared to a reference time point with better renal function. Such overshooting anticoagulation is linked to a significant risk of hemorrhage. Women, diabetic patients, and those with a BMI < 25 are particularly at risk. In the majority (55%) of patients on VKAs, the dose of the anticoagulant had to be modified, or the substance discontinued when AKI occurred. Bleeding complications were noted in 24% of patients.

All patients in this series from Germany were treated with phenprocoumon. In other parts of the world, acenocoumarol and particularly warfarin are used as VKAs. All these substances have high plasma protein binding (99%) and are metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. Hepatic clearance is the main elimination pathway. Warfarin and acenocoumarol are mostly metabolized via the 2C9 isoenzyme, while both 2C9 and 3A4 isoenzymes are important for the metabolism of phenprocoumon. Although there is some renal excretion of phenprocoumon, but not acenocoumarol or warfarin, dosing recommendations do not consider renal function except for severe renal failure.

How could AKI lead to a strong increase in the phenprocoumon effect if renal excretion is not very relevant for its excretion? As mentioned earlier, this remains an area for further research.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^1123YXV8]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic (unpredictable) drug-induced liver injury is one of the most challenging liver disorders faced by hepatologists because of the myriad of drugs used in clinical practice, the available herbs and dietary supplements with hepatotoxic potential, the ability of the condition to present with a variety of clinical and pathological phenotypes, and the absence of specific biomarkers. This makes the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury an uncertain process, requiring a high degree of awareness of the condition and the careful exclusion of alternative aetiologies of liver disease. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity can be severe, leading to a particularly serious variety of acute liver failure for which no effective therapy has yet been developed.

### Determination of optimal vitamin D dosage in children with cholestasis [^116Gykjh]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in patients with cholestasis is due to impaired intestinal vitamin D absorption, which results from decreased intestinal bile acid concentration. Patients with cholestasis usually do not achieve optimal vitamin D status when a treatment regimen for children without cholestasis is used. However, data on high-dose vitamin D treatment in patients with cholestasis are limited.

- **Methods**: This study is a prospective study that included pediatric patients with cholestasis (serum direct bilirubin > 1 mg/dL) who had vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25-OHD, < 20 ng/mL). In Phase 1, a single-day oral loading of 300,000 IU (or 600,000 IU if weight ≥ 20 kg) of vitamin D2 was administered, followed by an additional loading if serum 25-OHD < 30 ng/mL, and a 4-week continuation of treatment using a vitamin D2 dose calculated based on the increment of 25-OHD after the first loading. In Phase 2, oral vitamin D2 (200,000 IU/day) was administered for 12 days, followed by 400,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 orally for another 8 weeks if serum 25-OHD < 30 ng/mL.

- **Results**: Phase 1: Seven patients were enrolled. Three out of seven patients had a moderate increase in serum 25-OHD after loading (up to 20.3–27.2 ng/mL). These patients had conditions with partially preserved bile flow. The remaining four patients, who had biliary atresia with failed or no Kasai operation, had low increments of serum 25-OHD. Phase 2: Eleven patients were enrolled. Eight out of 11 patients had a moderate increase in serum 25-OHD after 200,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 for 12 days.

Regarding the medical management of acute liver failure, specifically in relation to hepatic encephalopathy, the EASL 2017 guidelines recommend considering invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in a highly selected subgroup of patients. These patients have progressed to grade 3 or 4 coma, are intubated and ventilated, and are deemed at high risk of intracranial hypertension based on the presence of more than one of the following variables:

- **Young patients**: Individuals with hyperacute or acute presentations.
- **Ammonia level**: Ammonia levels greater than 150–200 mcmol/L that do not drop with initial treatment interventions such as renal replacement therapy (RRT) and fluids.
- **Renal impairment**
- **Vasopressor support**: Patients requiring vasopressor support greater than 0.1 mcg/kg/min.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: New treatments [^111Y7PDh]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The results of these studies with vitamin E need to be balanced against the emerging body of data that vitamin E may increase all-cause mortality, resulting in an additional 39 deaths per 10,000 people for those on high-dose (400 IU/day) vitamin E in a dose-dependent manner starting at 150 IU/day, which is much less than the doses trialled in NASH. Furthermore, vitamin E therapy may be associated with an increase in prostate cancer in men above 50 years old according to a large study of 35,000 patients, and a 20% increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In light of these risks, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend that the use of vitamin E may be considered in nondiabetic adults with NASH but not in diabetic patients or children.

### Niacor [^116VNTem]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Warnings**: Liver dysfunction and skeletal muscle issues should be carefully monitored.

- **Liver dysfunction**: Cases of severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatic necrosis, have occurred in patients substituting sustained-release (modified-release, timed-release) nicotinic acid products for immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid at equivalent doses. Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with nicotinic acid. Serum transaminase levels, including ALT (SGPT), should be monitored before treatment begins, every six weeks to twelve weeks for the first year, and periodically thereafter (e.g. at approximately six-month intervals). Special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels, and in these patients, measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently. If the transaminase levels show evidence of progression, particularly if they rise to three times the upper limit of normal and are persistent, the drug should be discontinued. A liver biopsy should be considered if elevations persist beyond discontinuation of the drug. Nicotinic acid should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of nicotinic acid.

- **Skeletal muscle**: Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been associated with the concomitant administration of lipid-altering doses (≥ 1 g/day) of nicotinic acid and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Physicians contemplating combined therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and nicotinic acid should proceed with caution.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure clinical guidelines [^113s4LuD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In relation to alcohol-related liver disease, particularly in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, the ACG 2022 guidelines advise administering prednisolone or prednisone (40 mg/day) orally. This treatment can improve 28-day mortality in patients with severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (modified discriminant function (MDF) ≥ 32, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score > 20), provided there are no contraindications.

### Hepatic hydrothorax associated with vitamin A toxicity [^114VhtfB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

We report the first case of an adult presenting with respiratory symptoms caused by hepatic hydrothorax secondary to vitamin A intoxication. The patient was a 52-year-old woman who presented to the hospital with progressive dyspnea. Evaluation demonstrated mild elevation of her liver function tests, ascites, and a right pleural effusion. The patient consumed a variety of vitamins, including vitamin A. Her estimated vitamin A intake was at least 162,300,000 international units (IU) over 18 years. She dramatically escalated her dose the year before admission for a total acute dose of 98,550,000 IU, with a daily intake of 270,000 IU. The recommended daily allowance is 4,000 IU. A transjugular liver biopsy revealed histopathologic changes consistent with vitamin A toxicity: hypertrophy and hyperplasia of hepatic stellate cells, focal pericellular fibrosis, mild perivenular fibrosis, and minimal, predominantly microvesicular steatosis. Despite the absence of cirrhosis, pressure readings demonstrated portal hypertension. During her hospitalization, the patient's symptoms and biochemical profile improved. As the large and generally unregulated United States dietary supplement industry continues to grow, it is increasingly likely that individuals will present with the signs and symptoms of vitamin excess rather than vitamin deficiency. Physicians need to remain alert to the varied presentations and toxic manifestations of excessive vitamin use.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^114Spaxa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: Fixed-effect meta-analysis showed similar results to the random-effects model (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.10; I² = 40%; 2 trials, 283 participants).

- **Best-worst-case scenario analysis**: When we assumed that none of the participants lost to follow-up in the experimental intervention group had adverse events, and all those with missing outcomes in the control group had adverse events, we found a similar result (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05; I² = 77%; 2 trials, 283 participants; Analysis 1.12).

- **Worst-best-case scenario analysis**: When we assumed that all participants lost to follow-up in the experimental intervention group had adverse events, and none of those with missing outcomes in the control group had adverse events, we found a similar result (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 283 participants; Analysis 1.13).

- **Risk of bias**: We judged the overall risk of bias in all trials reporting on this outcome to be of some concern, thereby precluding a sensitivity analysis excluding trials at high risk of bias.

### Lortab [^1129Jr9L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most cases of liver injury are linked to the use of acetaminophen at doses exceeding 4000 milligrams per day. These often involve the concurrent use of more than one acetaminophen-containing product. Excessive intake may be intentional, aiming at self-harm, or unintentional as patients seek additional pain relief or unknowingly use multiple acetaminophen products.

The risk of acute liver failure escalates in individuals with pre-existing liver disease and those consuming alcohol while taking acetaminophen. Patients should be instructed to identify acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and avoid using more than one product containing acetaminophen. Medical attention is advised immediately if more than 4000 milligrams are ingested daily, even if the individual feels well.

- **Serious skin reactions**: Rarely, acetaminophen may result in serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and the use of the drug should cease at the first indication of a skin rash or any other hypersensitivity symptom.

- **Hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis**: Post-marketing reports indicate occurrences of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with acetaminophen use, with clinical signs including swelling of the face, mouth, and throat.

### Ultra-high-dose methylcobalamin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A long-term phase II/III randomised controlled study [^112K5Yd6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron degeneration, typically presenting with muscle weakness and atrophy. Respiratory failure due to muscle weakness is the major cause of death. Without mechanical ventilation support, patients succumb to this disease within 3–6 years from its onset.

The widely used drug for ALS, riluzole, provides a modest prolongation of survival (2–3 months) but shows no beneficial effects on muscle strength and little on bulbar function. Moreover, safety concerns, such as liver dysfunction, exist. Edaravone has been approved for retarding the clinical deterioration of ALS, but its effect on survival is unknown.

The deficiency in vitamin B12 is associated with central nervous system lesions, including subacute combined degeneration of the cord, indicating an important function of B12 in the spinal cord and the brain. Methylcobalamin, an active form of vitamin B12 used in Japan to treat peripheral neuropathy and megaloblastic anemia, is a potential candidate for ALS treatment. It functions as a coenzyme for homocysteine remethylation as a methyl donor and inhibits neuronal degeneration by decreasing levels of homocysteine, the accumulation of which contributes to neuronal degeneration in patients with ALS. It also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and Akt to induce neurite outgrowth and prolong neuronal survival. Cyanates/cyanide conjugates of B12 do not act as methyl donors and have not been proven to show these effects.

### Trikafta [^115XsBTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Trikafta can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation and death have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease taking Trikafta, in both clinical trials and the postmarketing setting [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of Trikafta.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating Trikafta. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring for patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt Trikafta for significant elevations in liver function tests or in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. Consider referral to a hepatologist. Follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve, resume treatment only if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk. Closer monitoring is advised after resuming Trikafta [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^116ZWKn6]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical studies testing high doses reveal that few small trials have studied tocopherol (TOC) as a sole intervention in critically ill patients (see Table S16). In traumatic brain injury, a daily dose of 400 IU of vitamin E significantly lowered hospital mortality (16.9%) compared to placebo (29.7%) or low or high doses of vitamin C (26.9% and 30.4%, respectively; P = 0.04). However, these findings are limited by the small sample size (n = 100, divided into four groups), a higher number of patients in a comatose state in the vitamin E group compared to the placebo group, and a reduced effect observed at 6 months (mortality 25% vs. 29.7% in vitamin E and placebo groups, respectively). Two small RCTs (n = 20 and 25) showed benefits in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) concerning Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and APACHE II scores. However, those results are limited due to the small sample size and higher baseline disease severity in the intervention group.

A recent Bayesian meta-analysis suggested, with very low certainty, that TOC ranks best among antioxidants for potential mortality reduction (absolute risk difference, 0.19; 95% CI, −0.54 to 0.16). It may also reduce infectious complications, although the certainty of evidence is very low. A pharmacological dose of TOC has not been defined, and prolonged high daily doses (> 1000 IU/day) may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.

- **Implementation in clinical practice**: The ESPEN guidelines suggest supplementing vitamin E if plasma TOC levels are < 12 µmol/L, starting with 100 mg/day. There is no evidence supporting high doses of vitamin E.

### Acute liver failure [^112P7dzw]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Acute liver failure is a rare and severe consequence of abrupt hepatocyte injury that can evolve over days or weeks to a lethal outcome. A variety of insults to liver cells result in a consistent pattern of rapid-onset elevation of aminotransferases, altered mentation, and disturbed coagulation. The absence of existing liver disease distinguishes acute liver failure from decompensated cirrhosis or acute-on-chronic liver failure.

Causes of acute liver failure include paracetamol toxicity, hepatic ischaemia, viral and autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury from prescription drugs, as well as herbal and dietary supplements. Diagnosis requires a careful review of medications taken and serological testing for possible viral exposure.

Because of its rarity, acute liver failure has not been studied in large, randomised trials, and most treatment recommendations represent expert opinion. Improvements in management have resulted in lower mortality, although liver transplantation, used in nearly 30% of patients with acute liver failure, still provides a life-saving alternative to medical management.

### N-acetylcysteine for non-paracetamol (acetaminophen)-related acute liver failure [^114xRKbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease that may be paracetamol-induced or non-paracetamol-induced. The non-paracetamol-induced acute liver failure has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N-acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol-induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing liver transplantation. Recent randomized clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N-acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when administered during the early encephalopathy stages for patients with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of N-acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N-acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non-paracetamol-related acute liver failure.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (1990 to 25 June 2020).

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO, and monthly thereafter for the first six months, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or if ALT or AST elevations greater than three times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than two times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food. It should be swallowed whole; tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^11592sSr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and maintenance are the basic management strategies for NAFLD, yet these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD; however, there remains uncertainty regarding its effects on individuals with NAFLD.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, compared to placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

Cochrane search methods were used, and the latest search was conducted on February 2, 2024. Randomized clinical trials were included if they compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, against placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. Participants included those with imaging techniques or histology‐proven NAFLD with minimal alcohol intake, as well as those with steatohepatitis who had undergone liver biopsies.

The critical outcomes measured were all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, and serious adverse events. Important outcomes included liver‐related morbidity and health‐related quality of life.

### Effect of high-dose vs standard-dose multivitamin supplementation at the initiation of HAART on HIV disease progression and mortality in Tanzania: A randomized controlled trial [^116dEEV4]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

Large randomized trials have previously shown that high-dose micronutrient supplementation can increase CD4 counts and reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression and mortality among individuals not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, the safety and efficacy of such supplementation have not been established in the context of HAART.

The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that high-dose multivitamin supplementation compared to standard-dose multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of HIV disease progression or death and improves immunological, virological, and nutritional parameters in patients with HIV initiating HAART.

The design was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, conducted over 24 months, involving 3418 patients with HIV who were initiating HAART between November 2006 and November 2008 in 7 clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

- **Intervention**: The provision of daily oral supplements of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E at high levels or standard levels of the recommended dietary allowance.

- **Main outcome measure**: The composite of HIV disease progression or death from any cause.

The results indicated that the study was stopped early in March 2009 due to evidence of increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) in patients receiving the high-dose multivitamin supplement. At the time of stopping, 3418 patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 15 months, and there were 2374 HIV disease progression events and 453 observed deaths, totaling 2460 combined events.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^111tPxE5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline recommends screening for vitamin D deficiency (cutoff < 20 ng/mL) in individuals at high risk for deficiency, including those with hepatic failure, and advises vitamin D supplementation in cases of deficiency. They suggest that vitamin D requirements may be greater for sick patients than for healthy individuals and that serum vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL may have additional benefits in reducing the risk for various disease conditions.

They recommend that all adults who are vitamin D deficient be treated with 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once a week for 8 weeks, or its equivalent of 6,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily, to achieve a serum level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance therapy of 1,500–2,000 IU/day. Furthermore, they have set minimum daily dietary recommendations of vitamin D intake for patients at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, depending on their age group. The extent of the recommended screening indications is limited to hepatic failure and does not cover the full spectrum of liver diseases.

International liver study associations, including EASL and AASLD, recommend fat-soluble vitamin substitution for the management of all patients with cholestatic liver diseases. These recommendations focus mostly on the prevention of osteoporosis. More specifically, they propose clinical assessment of the risk of osteoporosis for all cholestatic patients and emphasize the importance of both identifying reversible risk factors and applying appropriate lifestyle changes.

### Interventional vitamin C: A strategy for attenuation of coagulopathy and inflammation in a swine multiple injuries model [^117D2FUJ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Coagulopathy and inflammation induced by hemorrhagic shock and traumatic injury are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Vitamin C (VitC) is an antioxidant with potential protective effects on the proinflammatory and procoagulant pathways. We hypothesized that high-dose VitC administered as a supplement to fluid resuscitation would attenuate inflammation, coagulation dysfunction, and end-organ tissue damage in a swine model of multiple injuries and hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Male Sinclair swine (n = 24; mean body weight, 27 kg) were anesthetized, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and instrumented for physiologic monitoring. Following stabilization, swine were subjected to shock/traumatic injury (hypothermia, liver ischemia and reperfusion, comminuted femur fracture, hemorrhagic hypotension). They were resuscitated with 500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch and randomized to receive either intravenous normal saline (NS), low-dose VitC (50 mg/kg; LO), or high-dose VitC (200 mg/kg; HI). Hemodynamics, blood chemistry, hematology, and coagulation function (ROTEM) were monitored to 4 hours post-resuscitation. Histological and molecular analyses were obtained for liver, kidney, and lung.

- **Results**: Compared with VitC animals, NS swine showed significant histological end-organ damage, elevated acute lung injury scores, and increased mRNA expression of tissue proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-8, TNFα), plasminogen activation inhibitor-1, and tissue factor. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups on mean arterial pressure or univariate measures.

### Acute-on-chronic liver failure: An update [^116q2gPs]. Gut (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute-on-chronic liver failure:

- **Definition**: ACLF is a syndrome characterized by an acute decompensation of chronic liver disease, which is associated with organ failures and high short-term mortality.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ACLF involves a state of deregulated inflammation, with an initial cytokine burst presenting as systemic inflammatory response syndrome. There is progression to compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome and associated immunoparalysis, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ACLF in the US is estimated at 26.4% in hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ACLF include excessive alcohol consumption, chronic viral hepatitis, and sepsis. Recurrence of chronic viral hepatitis and ongoing alcohol abuse also contribute to the disease. However, in 40–50% of cases, no identifiable trigger can be found.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, it presents with signs of liver failure such as jaundice, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and ascites, with or without extrahepatic organ failure. This includes kidney, circulatory, and respiratory complications that can be further complicated by sepsis. The clinical profile of ACLF is complex and can change over the course of hospital admission.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is generally poor, with substantial short-term mortality.

### Trikafta [^112un3Hx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Trikafta should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). It is not recommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). If used, it should be administered with caution at a reduced dosage, and patients should be monitored closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Warning: Drug-induced liver injury and liver failure**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

Trikafta can cause serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury. Liver failure leading to transplantation and death has been reported [5.1, 6]. Liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) should be assessed in all patients prior to initiating Trikafta [2.1, 5.1]. These tests should be monitored every month for the first six months of treatment, then every three months for the next 12 months, and at least annually thereafter [2.1, 5.1]. Trikafta should be interrupted for significant elevations in liver function tests or signs or symptoms of liver injury. Patients should be monitored closely with clinical and laboratory follow-up until abnormalities resolve [5.1]. Trikafta may be resumed if abnormalities resolve, and only if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk [5.1].

Trikafta should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) [2.3, 5.1, 8.7, 12.3].

### Trikafta [^115xcxkn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatic impairment**:
	- **Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)**: Trikafta should not be used. It has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
	- **Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B)**: Treatment is not recommended. Trikafta should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, it should be administered at a reduced dose with close monitoring of liver function tests [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In a clinical study of 11 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, one subject developed total and direct bilirubin elevations > 2 × ULN, and another developed direct bilirubin elevation > 4.5 × ULN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
	- **Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A)**: No dose modification is recommended, but liver function tests should be closely monitored [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with severe lung dysfunction**:
	- Trial 1 included 18 patients receiving Trikafta with ppFEV1 < 40 at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were comparable to those observed in the overall population.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^112Gpcro]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

Discrepant values for the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 25–30 mmol/L) are reported: 20% of 209 US patients and 80% of 64 Turkish patients with AIH. Deficiency was associated with more severe AIH and with poor treatment response. Supplementation in one study was not of benefit.

We suggest optimizing oral calcium intake and offering vitamin D supplements to patients starting bisphosphonates for osteopenia or osteoporosis. Calcium supplements might also be considered in all patients with poor dietary calcium intake and those at risk of vitamin D deficiency, including those with malabsorption and poor sunlight exposure.

In the early AIH trials, 5–10% of steroid-treated patients (mostly aged under 50 years) developed fractures over 2–3 years. In one large cohort study, 15% of patients sustained at least one fracture. In 35% of patients, fractures were vertebral, and these are often asymptomatic.

Increased bone resorption is demonstrable within days of starting corticosteroids. Increased fracture risk occurs in patients on prednisolone doses as low as 5–7 mg daily and with budesonide at a mean dose of 6 mg daily. The increased risk can persist for up to a year after stopping steroids.

The decision to offer bone-protection agents, usually bisphosphonates, is often based on results of a bone mineral density (DEXA) scan. In 219 patients with long-standing AIH, the average (age-adjusted) DEXA scores were lower than normal, and the prevalence of osteoporosis was 16%. Factors associated with lower bone density included older age and lower BMI.

### Methylcobalamin protects against liver failure via engaging gasdermin E [^114HHEEy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Gasdermin E (GSDME) is a pyroptotic cell death effector and a promising target for pyroptotic tissue injury. Here, we perform high-throughput screening and demonstrate that methylcobalamin (MeCbl), an endogenous coenzyme form of vitamin B12, is a specific GSDME inhibitor and highly effective against cholestatic liver failure. MeCbl specifically blocks GSDME cleavage by directly binding with GSDME. In cholestasis-, cisplatin- or concanavalin A (Con A)-induced male mouse models, MeCbl significantly suppresses liver transaminase activities and inflammation, alleviates hepatocyte death, and reduces mortality of mice by blocking GSDME cleavage. The conserved Cys180 residue in GSDME is essential for caspase-3/GzmB recognition. MeCbl in base-off conformation coordinates to Cys180 to prevent caspase-3/GzmB-GSDME interactions and thereby GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. In summary, our study discovers MeCbl as a specific GSDME inhibitor that is promising for development as an effective drug against cholestatic liver failure, as well as other GSDME-triggered sterile inflammation and/or organ failure.

### Vitamin e for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112xHQrN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Three trials involving 351 participants reported on all-cause mortality with a maximal follow-up of 18 to 24 months. In the Sanyal 2010 trial, causes of death included pneumonia and liver failure secondary to sepsis in a participant with fibrosis. The Lavine 2011 trial reported a death by suicide, while the Bril 2019 trial documented deaths due to ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke in two participants with NASH.

The effect of vitamin E on all-cause mortality, with a risk ratio (RR) of 3.45 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.57 to 20.86, was noted to be very uncertain (I² = 0%; 3 trials, 351 participants, very low certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1). This comparison was made against placebo or no intervention. Two of the trials included participants with biopsy-proven NASH (Bril 2019; Sanyal 2010), while one trial included participants with NAFLD (Sanyal 2010). Vitamin E was administered as 400 IU twice daily in the Lavine 2011 and Bril 2019 trials, and 800 IU daily in the Sanyal 2010 trial.

An insufficient number of trials precluded subgroup analysis.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111ai8hD]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

In addition to general supportive care, drug-specific therapy may be recommended for selected scenarios. For example, there are uncontrolled data demonstrating clinical benefit with carnitine therapy for children with hyperammonemia due to valproate hepatotoxicity. Additionally, cholestyramine may be of value for patients with leflunomide hepatotoxicity because of its prolonged half-life and enterohepatic circulation. Finally, defibrotide, a complex mixture of single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine intestine with antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activity, has been associated with improved survival in patients with severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) following hematopoietic cell transplantation compared to historical controls.

- **Guidance statements**:
	- Most adults and children with idiosyncratic DILI present with an acute liver injury phenotype that may or may not be symptomatic but typically resolves within 6 months of onset without long-term sequelae in 80% of cases.
	- In registry studies, 10% of patients with idiosyncratic DILI are at risk for adverse hepatic outcomes, including acute liver failure (ALF), liver transplantation, and death within 6 months of onset.
	- Because of the low likelihood of spontaneous survival in idiosyncratic DILI-related ALF of only 25%, early transfer of these individuals to a liver transplant center is recommended.
	- Chronic liver injury that persists beyond 6–12 months is observed in 10%–20% of patients with DILI and may be more commonly encountered in those with cholestatic DILI.
