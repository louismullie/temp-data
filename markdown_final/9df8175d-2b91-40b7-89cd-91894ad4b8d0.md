## Question

Management plan for pt with pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management plan for a patient with pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and site-of-care determination. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic workup, including when to obtain cultures and which tests to order. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic choices for outpatients versus inpatients, including severe disease and special populations. After that, I should double-check management of viral-bacterial coinfection, treatment failure and non-responders, and de-escalation. Finally, I will consider supportive care, duration, monitoring, prevention, and documentation with a brief note on special scenarios like aspiration and HAP/VAP.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of initial assessment that drive site-of-care decisions and urgency, because I need to ensure I am applying validated severity tools and recognizing shock or respiratory failure that mandates ICU care. PSI and CURB-65 help with mortality risk stratification, but the ATS/IDSA minor criteria are more informative for ICU-level monitoring decisions when the patient is not yet on vasopressors or a ventilator, and any need for vasopressors or mechanical ventilation is an absolute ICU indication, so I should not delay escalation if those are present [^1125ycQ2] [^116P1eFg] [^111TQhBn].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic confirmation step before antibiotics. Chest radiography remains the standard for diagnosing CAP, but I should not over-rely on symptoms alone, and in settings where imaging cannot be obtained promptly, guidelines allow empiric therapy per local protocols, so I need to balance diagnostic certainty with timely treatment while planning confirmatory imaging as soon as feasible [^11331Ns8] [^115MmjXM].

> I need to check microbiologic testing indications and timing. For hospitalized patients, I should obtain blood cultures before antibiotics, and obtain sputum Gram stain and culture if a good-quality specimen can be processed rapidly, while for outpatients routine cultures are generally unnecessary unless risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens are present, and I should remember that the yield of sputum testing varies by organism and prior antibiotic exposure, so I should tailor testing to pretest probability and illness severity [^112KyGo7] [^117NND7L].

> Next, I should review empiric antibiotic choices for low-risk outpatients without comorbidities. High-dose amoxicillin or doxycycline are preferred first-line options, with a macrolide acceptable only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is below 25%, and I need to ensure I do not overlook macrolide monotherapy in high-resistance regions because that can lead to suboptimal coverage and poor outcomes [^112EaToB] [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].

> Hold on, I should verify the regimen for outpatients with comorbidities. Amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy are acceptable strategies, and I need to individualize based on renal function, QT risk, prior antibiotic exposures, and local resistance patterns to minimize harm and maximize efficacy [^111GDt9s].

> Let me think about inpatients with nonsevere CAP. A beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or doxycycline is recommended, and I should double-check for contraindications such as severe beta-lactam allergy and consider alternatives accordingly, aligning with guideline-concordant combination therapy to capture atypicals and potentially gain a mortality benefit in severe presentations [^111BKnjY].

> For severe CAP requiring ICU care, I should confirm that combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is indicated, and I need to add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only when specific risk factors are present, avoiding routine broad-spectrum escalation that increases toxicity and resistance without benefit. I should also remember that the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline retired the HCAP category, so I must not extend therapy solely on that outdated label [^11724DLT] [^115U4hGg] [^111Lpr3T].

> But wait, what if the patient tests positive for influenza? I should confirm that anti-influenza therapy such as oseltamivir is indicated for all hospitalized adults with CAP and confirmed influenza regardless of symptom duration, and for outpatients with comorbidities or severe illness, while continuing standard bacterial CAP therapy because bacterial-viral coinfection is common and clinically consequential [^113otsea] [^114ACNqt] [^115dbbUh].

> I should double-check the 2025 ATS update on viral testing. If an outpatient without comorbidities has clinical and imaging evidence of CAP and tests positive for a respiratory virus, empiric antibiotics should be avoided, whereas outpatients with comorbidities or inpatients with nonsevere CAP who test positive for a virus should still receive empiric antibiotics due to concern for bacterial coinfection, so I need to align my decision with patient risk and setting [^112S2QnK] [^1153KRfw] [^113Mj7GB].

> Let me reconsider the approach to non-responders. Lack of clinical stabilization by 48–72 hours should trigger a structured reassessment for resistant or atypical pathogens, inadequate source control such as empyema, or an alternative noninfectious diagnosis, and I should obtain a chest CT, consider bronchoscopy with BAL, repeat cultures, and broaden therapy only if new risk factors or data emerge, rather than reflexively escalating without a target [^111Ewmrk] [^116ErqJ6].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are embedded. De-escalation to the narrowest effective agent based on culture and clinical response around day 3 is recommended for HAP/VAP and is reasonable to apply by analogy to CAP when data support narrowing, and I should avoid unnecessary prolonged therapy because it increases adverse events and resistance without improving outcomes [^112vfNNp] [^115ThFVL] [^112dRMcG].

> Next, I should review supportive care essentials. Maintain adequate oxygenation with a goal SpO2 of at least 90–92 percent, provide IV fluids judiciously to avoid both hypoperfusion and fluid overload, monitor for sepsis and ARDS, and use clinical stability criteria to guide oral step-down and discharge planning rather than radiographic lag, which often trails clinical recovery [^11422hz5].

> I will now examine duration and step-down. For most CAP, a minimum of 5 days is sufficient if the patient achieves clinical stability within 48–72 hours, switching to oral therapy with the same agent or class when stable, while extending to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas, and I should confirm stability using heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygenation before stopping IV therapy or discharging [^11422hz5].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and follow-up steps. Assess and update pneumococcal and influenza vaccination status before discharge, provide smoking cessation counseling, and arrange close follow-up within 1–2 weeks with a repeat chest radiograph at about 6–8 weeks to exclude underlying malignancy if the patient is older or a smoker, as delayed resolution may signal an alternate diagnosis [^112KyGo7] [^114QxmG1].

> Let me first confirm documentation and quality metrics. Record severity scores, empiric rationale, microbiology results and timing, antibiotic start times, de-escalation rationale, and stability criteria met, because adherence to these process measures correlates with improved outcomes and aligns with core ED and inpatient quality indicators for CAP care [^111AsKbs] [^112wCsxK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include MRSA coverage broadly in severe CAP, but I should correct that. Routine MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage is not indicated unless specific risk factors are present, so I must individualize based on prior colonization, prior IV antibiotics, local epidemiology, and Gram stain findings rather than apply a blanket approach that increases toxicity and resistance [^11724DLT] [^111Lpr3T].

> I should also consider special scenarios. For aspiration pneumonia, standard CAP regimens are appropriate and routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended in severe CAP with aspiration risk, but I need to ensure swallow evaluation and a plan to restore safe swallowing to prevent recurrence, and for suspected HAP/VAP, I should follow IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines with attention to local antibiograms, MRSA risk factors, and de-escalation principles rather than CAP pathways [^115Lwwfx] [^112Yr1De] [^1136Dzsk].

A pneumonia management plan centers on **early recognition** and **rapid intervention** to reduce morbidity and mortality [^114cq6uM]. Use **CURB-65 or PSI** for severity and site-of-care decisions [^113EgfRb]; obtain blood and sputum cultures before antibiotics when feasible [^112KyGo7]; and start empiric therapy within 4–6 hours [^111AsKbs], tailoring to local resistance and patient risk factors [^111Lpr3T]. Provide supportive care (oxygen, fluids, vasopressors as needed) [^114cq6uM]; monitor for clinical stability at 48–72 hours [^11422hz5]; and adjust therapy to culture results, aiming for 5–7 days total (7 days for MRSA/Pseudomonas) [^11422hz5]. Address complications, apply antimicrobial stewardship, and arrange follow-up with vaccination and prevention counseling [^112KyGo7].

---

## Initial assessment and severity stratification

Use **CURB-65** (confusion, urea > 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate ≥ 30, BP < 90/60, age ≥ 65) to guide site-of-care and mortality risk [^113EgfRb], and **PSI** for detailed risk stratification and disposition decisions [^11331Ns8]. Assess for **hypotension requiring vasopressors or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation**, which mandate ICU admission [^116P1eFg] [^115Akds1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Chest radiography**: Confirm diagnosis and assess extent [^11331Ns8].

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain before antibiotics in hospitalized patients [^112KyGo7].

| MRSA risk | Add vancomycin or linezolid [^112jJNwE] |
| Pseudomonas risk | Use two antipseudomonal agents from different classes [^111bvyr5] |

---

## Supportive care

- **Oxygen**: Maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^notfound].

- **Fluids**: Judicious IV fluids for sepsis/septic shock [^notfound].

- **Vasopressors**: For persistent hypotension despite fluids [^notfound].

- **Ventilatory support**: Noninvasive or invasive as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Reassess clinically at **48–72 hours** for stability (vital signs, oxygenation, mental status) [^11422hz5]. Modify therapy based on **culture results, clinical response, and local resistance patterns** [^112dRMcG]. Pursue de-escalation to the narrowest effective agent [^112vfNNp].

---

## Duration of therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days**, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^11422hz5]. Extend to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas infections [^11422hz5].

- **ARDS**: Lung-protective ventilation strategies [^notfound].

---

## Antimicrobial stewardship

Perform **routine de-escalation** to narrow-spectrum therapy based on cultures [^112vfNNp]. Limit duration to the shortest effective course [^11422hz5]. Avoid unnecessary dual anaerobic coverage in aspiration pneumonia [^115Lwwfx].

---

## Follow-up and prevention

Arrange **clinical reassessment within 1–2 weeks** after discharge. Administer **pneumococcal and influenza vaccines** as indicated [^112KyGo7]. Provide smoking cessation counseling and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation when appropriate [^112KyGo7].

---

A structured plan with **early recognition, severity-based care, appropriate empiric therapy, supportive measures, and vigilant monitoring** optimizes outcomes and minimizes complications.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric Staphylococcus aureus coverage and MRSA risk factors: The panel recommend that all empiric regimens include an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus, and the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Although 10% (95% CI 6%–14%) of HAP cases are attributable to MRSA, this was insufficient justification to target MRSA in all HAP patients. Factors that probably increase MRSA risk include prior known MRSA colonization detected via nasal or respiratory cultures or nonculture screening, a high-quality Gram stain showing numerous and predominant gram-positive cocci in clusters, hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant or the prevalence is not known (with the 20% threshold arbitrarily chosen), and intravenous antibiotic treatment during the prior 90 days. When MRSA coverage is chosen, the guideline panel prefers vancomycin or linezolid, noting similar clinical outcomes and that final choice rests on blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults: management principles to improve outcomes [^111Vy5ui]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1). Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure".

### Improving outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia [^115T3ckC]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a pervasive disease that is encountered in outpatient and inpatient settings. CAP is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease and accounts for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. This update reviews current advances that can be used to promote improved outcomes in CAP.

Recent Findings

Early recognition of CAP and its severe presentations, with appropriate site of care decisions, leads to reduced patient mortality. In addition to traditional prognostic tools, certain serum biomarkers can assist in defining disease severity and guide treatment and management strategies. The use of macrolides as part of combination antibiotic therapy has shown beneficial mortality effects across the CAP disease spectrum, especially for those with severe illness. When treating community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, use of an antitoxin antibiotic is likely to be valuable. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids may prevent delayed clinical resolution in selected patients with severe CAP. Recent data expand on the interaction of CAP with comorbid disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, and its impact on mortality in CAP patients.

Summary

Improved diagnostic tools, optimized treatment regimens, and enhanced understanding of CAP-induced perturbations in comorbid disease states hold promise to improve patient outcomes.

### Processes of care for community-acquired pneumonia [^112wCsxK]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical and economic outcomes in hospitalized patients with CAP directly are related to the way that certain processes of care are executed at the local-hospital level. For each process of care, a clear and evidence-based recommended course of action should be stated. Having an unambiguous action plan helps to develop process-of-care indicators and to educate healthcare workers. Improving processes of care is a secure way to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with CAP.

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) — de-escalation versus fixed therapy recommendation states: For patients with HAP/VAP, we suggest that antibiotic therapy be de-escalated rather than fixed (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). De-escalation refers to narrowing an empiric broad-spectrum regimen by changing the antimicrobial agent or moving from combination therapy to monotherapy, whereas fixed therapy refers to maintaining a broad-spectrum regimen until therapy is completed.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^111AsKbs]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) — burden, core measures, and early antibiotics — is characterized by high impact and variable practices: CAP is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 1.7 million hospital admissions per year, and CAP-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $9 billion annually. Core ED measures for CAP include blood culture collection prior to first antibiotic administration, administration of initial antibiotics within 6 hours of ED arrival (previously within 4 hours), and appropriate antibiotic selection. Attempts to increase the proportion treated in less than 4 hours resulted in an additional 17% of patients being unnecessarily treated with antibiotics; among ED patients with respiratory complaints, 1,948 were evaluated and only 198 were ultimately diagnosed with CAP, such that if half received empiric antibiotics at least 40% would have received them unnecessarily. Reported practice patterns include that 37% of academic EDs administer antibiotics before obtaining chest radiograph.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

GRADE classification of recommendation strength — strong versus conditional — is outlined with explicit implications for patients, clinicians, and policymakers as follows: Strong Recommendation "We recommend… " indicates that most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, and the recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators. Conditional Recommendation "We suggest… " indicates the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances; and policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders with policies more likely to vary between regions and performance indicators focusing on adequate deliberation about management options.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^116ErqJ6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Approach to the patient with unresponsive pneumonia – differential diagnosis

When faced with a non-responding patient with pneumonia, the critical care team must consider three broad possibilities (Fig. 2): 1) their prognostication regarding the expected time to improvement is unrealistic; 2) the antimicrobial treatment is inappropriate due to antimicrobial resistance, the presence of an unexpected infectious agent including a nosocomial pathogen or insufficient source control (e.g. empyema); 3) the patient is suffering from a viral or non-infectious process.

Expected recovery time

Determining the expected recovery time for critically ill patients with pneumonia is not a precise science; nonetheless, it is dependent upon a multitude of factors previously detailed. Delay in initiating appropriate empiric antibiotics or under resuscitation are modifiable risk factors that could result in delayed recovery time or adverse outcomes. While failure of a patient with sCAP to clinically stabilize after 72h of antibiotic therapy has been previously defined as "treatment failure", this time frame may be too long to wait before initiating a re-evaluation of the diagnosis in a critically ill patient. Since appropriate recovery time cannot be accurately estimated, clinicians caring for critically ill patients diagnosed with pneumonia who fail to respond within 72h of antibiotic therapy or who are clinically worsening prior to 72h should reconsider the initial diagnosis and seek both infectious and non-infectious explanations for the patients' unanticipated clinical course (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^1176jSt6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treated as outpatients, the majority of data regarding CAP management is provided by hospitals, either from emergency department or inpatients. This was already noted in the first CAP guidelines, published in 1993, and the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist nowadays. These include the uncertainty of the initial diagnosis and risk stratification, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the overgrowing of antibiotic resistance bacteria and the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, unveiling the role of virus. Diagnostic uncertainty may lead to antibiotic overuse and bacteria resistance. Novel antibiotics along with diagnostic improvement, related to the use of lung ultrasound and point-of-care biomarkers testing, may help to improve CAP treatment. Prevention, especially the use of antipneumococcal vaccine, is instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the outpatient setting. However, most research is focused on hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in improving outcomes, as well as to the execution of stewardship programs that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

### Guidelines and critical pathways for severe hospital-acquired pneumonia [^114Y4fE1]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early, appropriate, and adequate empiric therapy can increase the chance of survival. In 1995, the American Thoracic Society provided guidelines for the initial treatment of immunocompetent HAP patients, which is one of the principal HAP management approaches available to physicians today. However, these guidelines have several important limitations, including a lack of recommendations for duration of therapy and no recognition of newer drugs such as cefepime, trovafloxacin, and meropenem. Furthermore, they fail to distinguish among similar compounds (ie, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) or to recommend specific antibiotics. The clinician using these guidelines needs to address local patterns of antimicrobial resistance, especially in ICUs. Effective computerized antibiotic management programs that incorporate information on local patterns of antimicrobial resistance can assist physicians in empiric therapy decision making, improve patient quality of care, and reduce medical costs.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^112N586C]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection in that the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Current data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition. Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in the home: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical position statement [^112XQgju]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

The number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are being treated at home is increasing for a variety of reasons. These reasons include the increased availability and cost considerations of oral antibiotics that have been shown to be effective, as well as the consideration of patient and family preferences. However, there is still considerable variability in strategies for the management of patients with CAP. This American College of Chest Physicians position statement, which was cosponsored by the American Academy of Home Care Physicians, provides recommendations on the various aspects of home care for patients with this condition. Included are recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis in the home environment and the determination of the site of care, and an outline of an in-home management plan. The position statement also provides recommendations for issues related to patient and caregiver commitment to the plan, and for monitoring and follow-up. Recommendations are directed toward immunocompetent adult patients with CAP who are at home or in other unskilled residential facilities. These patients can include previously healthy individuals or chronically ill individuals who choose not to go to the hospital, or hospitalized patients who are completing a hospital discharge plan. The recommendations in this statement take into consideration the best course of action for the patient, as determined by incorporating the most recent evidence with clinician judgment and patient preferences. These recommendations also consider the available resources. Therefore, these recommendations may not apply to every patient, and interventions may need to be structured based on the individual. In addition to providing recommendations for the home care management of patients with CAP, we hope that this clinical policy statement will alert readers to the need for more scientific evidence related to the clinical and psychosocial issues associated with managing this condition.

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^117CFqhd]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Immune-related (IR)-pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic: multidisciplinary recommendations for diagnosis and management [^111wrVNd]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Recommendations: group representation and input

In response to the need for clear and concise recommendations for the management of IR-pneumonitis in the setting of the global COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations were drafted with multidisciplinary cross-institutional input from medical oncology, infectious diseases including hospital epidemiology and infection control, pulmonary medicine and radiology subspecialists with expertise in IR-pneumonitis and COVID-19. The most pressing clinically-relevant questions and recommendations were discussed using an iterative, modified Delphi methodology.

Recommendation objectives

The primary objectives of this position paper are to outline diagnostic evaluation and management principles for IR-pneumonitis in the setting of COVID-19. This includes emerging issues related to appropriate: (1) isolation procedures, (2) imaging and interpretation, (3) adaptations to invasive testing for IR-pneumonitis, (4) adaptations to current medical management of IR-pneumonitis, (5) immunosuppressive therapy for steroid-refractory IR-pneumonitis, and (6) management of suspected concurrent IR-pneumonitis and COVID-19 infection.

Strengths and limitations of recommendations

The recommendations in this clinical guidance document represent expert opinion that is based on limited and primarily retrospective data. Recommendations are subject to change as new data become available.

Clinical considerations and recommendations

Previous to the COVID-19 pandemic, published consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IR-pneumonitis had been developed by multiple oncologic societies. We propose that selected recommendations within these guidelines be adapted in the context of COVID-19, and outline these changes in table 1. These recommendations provide overall guidance in common clinical scenarios, however specific management decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, weighing individual risks/benefits in the context of patient goals, comorbidities, disease status, and provider safety. In addition, wherever possible, multi-specialty input should be sought.

### Antimicrobial stewardship in the management of community-acquired pneumonia [^1163kJUn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antimicrobial stewardship can be applied to the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to optimize management while maintaining or improving the quality of patient outcomes. We discuss such applications, in general, and review the relevant recent literature.

Recent Findings

Clinical pathways or care plans are a means to standardize care for a given disease state and thus improve or optimize the utilization of treatment modalities while at the same time maintaining or improving patient outcomes. Most recent publications describe the application of clinical pathways for the management of CAP in both pediatric and adult populations, reporting success in achieving compliance with national treatment guidelines. As a variation of clinical management pathways, audit tools have also been described that assist in determining the location and length of therapy and proper route of administration of antimicrobial agents with the aim of optimal resource utilization. Emerging rapid diagnostic tools allowing for early identification of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility have great promise for early optimization of therapy for CAP.

Summary

There is a growing body of evidence that antimicrobial stewardship initiatives can be applied successfully and effectively to the management of CAP, benefiting both healthcare systems and patients. Such successful applications will likely grow as new techniques and technologies continue to evolve.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114xWhbT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^112KyGo7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2–3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

In those patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, mortality is 15%. Close to 90% of deaths attributed to pneumonia are in patients older than 65 years. This article provides the emergency physician with an understanding of how to make the diagnosis, initiate early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, risk stratify patients with respect to the severity of illness, and recognize indications for admission. The discussion is balanced with an emphasis on cost-effective management, an understanding of the changing spectrum of pathogenesis, and a cognizance toward variable and less common presentations.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

### Clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the emergency department [^112bZTuo]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical policy represents an approach that emphasizes key clinical information to determine the severity of CAP. By using this approach, a determination of whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or inpatient may be made. Recommendations about the utility of ancillary studies and the use of antibiotics are also given. As more of the questions are answered through controlled studies, an evidence-based approach to this problem will become increasingly important in improving the outcome of patients with CAP.

### Pneumonia in the emergency department [^1128nK9k]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Pneumonia remains one of the most common reasons for admission of emergency department (ED) patients to the hospital. Pneumonia also remains one of the most common causes of death in our patients. As with many emergent conditions, the ED management of these patients initiated by ED physicians contributes greatly to the survival and successful management of these patients. Specifically, the recognition of severe pneumonias, precise choice of diagnostic tests, and appropriate antibiotics can have an impact on the outcome.

Uncomplicated pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — management plan, follow-up, and monitoring: Patients with uncomplicated pulmonary coccidioidomycosis should have a management plan that incorporates regular medical follow-up, health education, and a plan for physical reconditioning (strong, low), although there is no published evidence that periodic reassessment, patient education, or physical reconditioning improves patient outcomes. Regular follow-up over several months following diagnosis is emphasized; if the symptoms of an untreated patient are still worsening, frequent follow-up visits or telephone contact on a weekly basis might be appropriate, whereas if there is clear evidence of improvement, a return visit might be appropriate in 2–4 weeks, with after the initial 2 or 3 visits, intervals typically ranging from 1 month to several months, and by 2 years patients who received no antifungal therapy for their uncomplicated coccidioidal pneumonia typically no longer require regular follow-up. Worsening respiratory symptoms should prompt reevaluation and new focal symptoms outside of the chest that persist should be brought to medical attention; laboratory monitoring may include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which typically would not be measured any more frequently than weekly, recognition that procalcitonin levels are typically not elevated in primary coccidioidal pneumonia, and demonstration that the CF or quantitative IDCF antibody concentration decreases as infection resolves; patients may better recognize improvement when asked to compare their state with 1 week or 1 month earlier.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, and the prognosis is important in determining the site of care. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, but the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection. Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis; however, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory items can help estimate the short-term risk for death and, along with the patient's psychosocial characteristics, determine the appropriate site of treatment.

HAP/VAP antibiotic de-escalation — For patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), we suggest that antibiotic therapy be de-escalated rather than fixed (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks clarify that de-escalation refers to changing an empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to a narrower regimen by changing the antimicrobial agent or changing from combination therapy to monotherapy, whereas fixed therapy refers to maintaining a broad-spectrum regimen until therapy is completed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients: 2024 update [^114QxmG1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory illness is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst infectious diseases worldwide and a major public health issue. Even though most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This document reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. Imaging recommendations for adults presenting with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations are discussed. Finally, guidelines for follow-up imaging in suspected pneumonia cases to ensure occult malignancy is not overlooked. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or intermediate, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.
