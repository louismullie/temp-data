## Question

Can I give viagra for those who have hypogonadism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Viagra sildenafil can be prescribed for patients with hypogonadism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hypogonadism relates to erectile dysfunction and what is considered first line ED therapy. Then, I should review high quality guidelines for ED when low testosterone is present. Next, I will examine randomized and supportive evidence for sildenafil monotherapy versus combination with testosterone. After that, I need to check key safety issues and monitoring for both drugs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway with dosing, exceptions, and counseling, making sure I verify each step against the cited guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because I need to ensure we are not conflating diagnoses. Hypogonadism is a syndrome of low testosterone plus symptoms such as low libido and erectile dysfunction, whereas erectile dysfunction is a symptom complex with multiple etiologies for which oral PDE5 inhibitors like sildenafil are first line in the general ED population [^114eqZHH] [^117DtUMB]. Hold on, I should verify how guidelines integrate low testosterone into ED care, and here the European Academy of Andrology recommends initiating testosterone replacement in men with confirmed hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction, while the EAU 2025 highlights TRT first in symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED and favors combination in more severe ED, and the AUA advises that PDE5 inhibitors can be offered broadly for ED but may be more effective when combined with testosterone in men with deficiency [^112K91o1] [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3] [^117DtUMB].

> Here is the direct answer, but wait, let me phrase it carefully so I do not overstate. Yes, sildenafil can be prescribed to men with hypogonadism, but I should emphasize that in confirmed hypogonadism with mild ED, guidelines prioritize testosterone therapy first, whereas in moderate to severe ED or in PDE5 inhibitor nonresponders, combining testosterone with a PDE5 inhibitor is often recommended, and if TRT is contraindicated or refused, sildenafil monotherapy remains a reasonable symptomatic option after counseling [^112K91o1] [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3] [^117DtUMB].

> I will now examine the evidence for sildenafil alone in hypogonadal men, and I need to be precise about what was actually tested. A pivotal randomized trial in men with ED and low testosterone found that after optimizing sildenafil, adding testosterone gel did not significantly improve erectile function versus placebo, which initially seems to imply sildenafil monotherapy is insufficient, but wait, that implication is backwards since the trial actually shows that when sildenafil is optimized, additional testosterone adds little in that specific context, so sildenafil alone can be effective for many men even with low testosterone, although it does not treat the underlying androgen deficiency or libido symptoms [^112uciFB]. Let me also consider complementary data suggesting PDE5 inhibitors may be less effective in some hypogonadal states and that androgen status can modulate nitric oxide synthase and PDE5 signaling, which supports the biological rationale for restoring testosterone in selected nonresponders or in those with severe ED and symptomatic hypogonadism [^1157PSqw] [^114WKCrF] [^117SLCm7].

> Next, I should review whether combination therapy helps when sildenafil alone fails, and I must separate lower credibility studies from guidance. Randomized and observational studies in hypogonadal men unresponsive to sildenafil showed that adding testosterone to ongoing sildenafil improved erectile function and satisfaction, providing a clinical signal consistent with the mechanistic rationale that testosterone can restore PDE5 responsiveness in corpora cavernosa, and this is reflected in EAU and AUA guidance endorsing combination in more severe ED or in men with testosterone deficiency who respond suboptimally to PDE5 inhibitors [^116yCouR] [^117SwWTU] [^114WKCrF] [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3].

> Before choosing therapy, I need to ensure the diagnosis of hypogonadism is correct, and I should double-check laboratories. Confirm low morning total testosterone on at least two separate days, consider free testosterone when total is borderline or SHBG is altered, evaluate for reversible causes or medications that suppress the axis, and remember that any man with ED warrants assessment for hypogonadism, especially in diabetes or high risk metabolic phenotypes [^113WCKUP] [^114mNUJU] [^116v16Zb] [^111K8ekU] [^116LMSro] [^113WtFom].

> Now, let me integrate this into a practical decision pathway, and I should verify it aligns with the cited guidance. In symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED, start testosterone replacement with appropriate monitoring and reassess erectile function and libido after a defined interval, while in moderate to severe ED or in men failing a correctly used PDE5 inhibitor, prefer combination therapy from the outset or by adding TRT, and if TRT is contraindicated or declined, treat ED symptomatically with sildenafil while addressing other contributors and counseling on expected benefits [^112K91o1] [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3] [^117DtUMB] [^112uJAkp].

> Let me specify sildenafil use because incorrect use is a common cause of nonresponse, and I should double-check dosing. Typical adult dosing is 50 mg about one hour before sexual activity with allowance to titrate to 100 mg once daily maximum, taken on an empty stomach when possible, with sexual stimulation required for effect and with education on alcohol and timing interactions to maximize efficacy per guideline advice on proper PDE5 inhibitor use [^114xYUWu] [^117DtUMB] [^113qGcLa] [^1163xXQg].

> I need to check safety and contraindications for sildenafil, and I should not miss the absolutes. Do not use with nitrates or with riociguat because of severe hypotension risk, use caution in men with significant cardiovascular disease, counsel on rare risks such as NAION and sudden hearing loss, and discuss common adverse effects such as headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances which are more frequent than placebo but usually mild to moderate [^117DtUMB] [^1179DQLF] [^111pMShk].

> For testosterone therapy, I should confirm absolute and relative contraindications and set a monitoring plan. Avoid initiating TRT in men with prostate or breast cancer, markedly elevated PSA without urologic evaluation, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, hematocrit above 54 percent, recent myocardial infarction or stroke, uncontrolled heart failure, untreated severe sleep apnea, or documented thrombophilia, and if used, obtain baseline hematocrit and PSA with DRE when appropriate, then recheck hematocrit and testosterone at 3 to 6 months and 12 months and annually, monitor PSA with age and risk tailored intervals, and pause TRT if hematocrit exceeds 54 percent or if PSA rises beyond guideline thresholds while arranging urologic evaluation [^112uJAkp] [^111SoYaH] [^112vT6mz] [^116ZgBM1] [^116YU4Cx] [^114KeVjE] [^112YEy14].

> But wait, what if TRT is not an option or the patient has fertility goals, because I need to ensure we do not suppress spermatogenesis inadvertently. In men who desire current or future fertility or who decline TRT, consider symptomatic management with sildenafil and discuss off label alternatives such as clomiphene citrate which can raise endogenous testosterone without impairing spermatogenesis, while strictly avoiding testosterone in men with absolute contraindications or high oncologic risk [^1143rJ7P] [^111pMShk] [^112uJAkp].

> Finally, I should confirm follow up expectations and reinforce counseling, and I need to check that timelines are evidence informed. Reassess sexual function and symptoms at 3 to 6 months and by 12 months after starting TRT with earlier checks for hematocrit and testosterone per EAU and EAA schedules, stop TRT if no symptomatic benefit by 12 months per ACP guidance, and remind patients that testosterone may enhance PDE5 inhibitor responsiveness in selected cases but that correct PDE5 use remains crucial for efficacy [^115uFZrG] [^112vT6mz] [^117Ubn9i] [^115YLhe3] [^113qGcLa].

Yes, **Viagra (sildenafil) can be given to men with hypogonadism who have erectile dysfunction** [^117DtUMB], as it is effective and safe when used appropriately [^114eqZHH] [^115HveZe]. However, **testosterone therapy is first-line** [^112K91o1] for symptomatic hypogonadism [^112XtTwV] with mild ED, and PDE5 inhibitors are added if ED persists or is severe [^116TpRFf]. Sildenafil does not treat **hypogonadism itself**, so testosterone replacement should be initiated to address the underlying deficiency [^112K91o1]. Always screen for contraindications [^1179DQLF] (e.g. nitrates [^111pMShk], severe cardiovascular disease) and monitor for adverse effects [^111uvhgG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major urology and endocrinology societies provide clear recommendations on **the use of PDE5 inhibitors** [^115HveZe], including sildenafil, in patients with hypogonadism:

- **EAU 2025 guidelines**: Recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) as first-line treatment [^112K91o1] in patients with symptomatic hypogonadism and mild erectile dysfunction (ED). For more severe forms of ED, a combination of PDE5 inhibitors and testosterone therapy is recommended [^116TpRFf].

- **AUA 2018 guidelines**: Recommend offering approved oral PDE5 inhibitors [^117DtUMB], including sildenafil, as a treatment option for ED, unless contraindicated. The guidelines also emphasize that PDE5 inhibitors may be more effective when combined with testosterone therapy [^115YLhe3] in patients with testosterone deficiency.

- **EAA 2020 guidelines**: Recommend initiating testosterone replacement therapy [^1117GZML] to improve libido, erectile function, and sexual satisfaction in patients with hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction.

---

## Efficacy of sildenafil in hypogonadal patients

Sildenafil improves erectile function in hypogonadal men [^115HveZe]. However, efficacy may be limited in patients with severe testosterone deficiency because testosterone plays a crucial role in regulating nitric oxide synthase and PDE5 expression in erectile tissue [^114WKCrF] [^1157PSqw]. Accordingly, **testosterone replacement therapy may enhance sildenafil efficacy** [^117SwWTU] in hypogonadal patients who do not respond adequately to sildenafil alone [^114WKCrF].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

Sildenafil is generally safe and well-tolerated, but key **safety considerations and contraindications** must be reviewed when prescribing it to hypogonadal patients:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Sildenafil can cause vasodilation and hypotension, which may pose risks in patients with cardiovascular disease. It is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates or guanylate cyclase stimulators due to the risk of severe hypotension [^111pMShk] [^111NSheM].

- **Adverse effects**: Common adverse effects of sildenafil include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances [^115HveZe]. Serious adverse events are rare but may include cardiovascular events and priapism [^111uvhgG].

- **Drug interactions**: Sildenafil may interact with other medications commonly used in hypogonadal patients, such as antihypertensives and alpha-blockers, potentially increasing the risk of hypotension [^111pMShk].

---

## Clinical scenarios for sildenafil use in hypogonadism

Based on current guidelines and clinical evidence, **sildenafil can be appropriately prescribed** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment approach** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic hypogonadism with mild ED | Testosterone replacement therapy as first-line treatment [^112K91o1] [^112XtTwV] |
| Symptomatic hypogonadism with moderate to severe ED | Combination therapy with testosterone replacement and sildenafil [^116TpRFf] [^115YLhe3] [^117SwWTU] |
| Hypogonadal patients unresponsive to sildenafil alone | Addition of testosterone replacement therapy to enhance sildenafil efficacy [^114WKCrF] [^116yCouR] [^111xKr6W] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring and follow-up** are essential when prescribing sildenafil to hypogonadal patients. Clinicians should assess efficacy, monitor for adverse effects [^115uFZrG], adjust therapy as needed, and educate patients on correct use [^113qGcLa] and potential side effects to optimize outcomes [^117DtUMB].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, sildenafil (Viagra) can be prescribed safely and effectively [^115HveZe] to patients with hypogonadism who experience erectile dysfunction. Testosterone replacement therapy should be considered the **primary treatment** [^112K91o1] for symptomatic hypogonadism [^112XtTwV], particularly in cases of mild ED. Combination therapy with testosterone and sildenafil is recommended [^116TpRFf] for patients with more severe ED or those who do not respond adequately to sildenafil alone. Clinicians should carefully assess cardiovascular risk [^111pMShk], monitor for adverse effects [^111uvhgG], and provide patient education [^1163xXQg] to ensure safe and effective treatment outcomes.

### Oral sildenafil citrate (viagra) for erectile dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of harms [^111uvhgG]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize and compare evidence on harms in sildenafil- and placebo-treated men with erectile dysfunction (ED), a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The rates of any adverse events (AEs), most commonly reported AEs, withdrawals because of adverse events, and serious adverse events were ascertained and compared between the sildenafil and placebo groups. Results of men with ED were stratified by clinical condition(s), and statistical heterogeneity was explored. Meta-analyses based on a random-effects model were also performed.

A total of 49 RCTs were included. Sildenafil-treated men had a higher risk for all-cause AEs (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.76), including headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances compared with placebo-treated men. The magnitude of excess risk was greater in fixed- than in flexible-dose trials. The rates of serious adverse events and withdrawals because of adverse events did not differ between sildenafil and placebo groups. A higher dose of sildenafil corresponded to a greater risk of AEs. The increased risk of harms was observed within and across clinically defined specific groups of patients.

There was a lack of RCTs reporting long-term (> 6 months) harms data. In short-term trials, men with ED randomized to sildenafil had an increased risk of all-cause any AEs, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances.

What is the most important information I should know about Viagra?

Viagra can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly to an unsafe level if taken with certain other medicines. Do not take Viagra if you are on any medicines called "nitrates", commonly used to treat chest pain (angina). A sudden drop in blood pressure can result in dizziness, fainting, or more severe conditions such as a heart attack or stroke.

Do not take Viagra if you are using medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators, which include riociguat (Adempas®), a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

It is essential to inform all your healthcare providers that you are taking Viagra. If you require emergency medical care for a heart condition, your healthcare provider needs to know the last time you took Viagra.

Stop sexual activity and seek medical help immediately if you experience symptoms like chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex. Sexual activities can put extra strain on your heart, particularly if your heart is weak due to a prior heart attack or heart disease. Consult with your doctor to determine if your heart is healthy enough for sexual activity.

### An update on new oral PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of erectile dysfunction [^114LHhf4]. Nature Reviews. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

The management of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been revolutionized by the discovery of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, which have been commercially available for more than a decade and are the first-line therapeutic option for men with ED. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil were approved by the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA for the treatment of ED due to their high efficacy rates and favorable safety profiles. However, despite the fact that more than 50 million patients with ED worldwide have been successfully treated with one of these PDE5 inhibitors, some men — most notably those with severe neurologic damage, diabetes mellitus, or severe vascular disease — are resistant to the currently available drugs and require more invasive treatments, such as intracavernosal injection therapy. Partly as a consequence of this, research into alternative therapeutic approaches continues, including the development of new PDE5 inhibitors, centrally acting pharmaceutical agents, and the application of molecular technologies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy.

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose-optimized regimens, both all-cause and lack of efficacy withdrawals, reported in about 5600 men, were lower with sildenafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 23 (17 to 37) and 25 (21 to 34), respectively. Adverse event withdrawals were higher with sildenafil than with placebo, with an NNH of 120 (67 to 560).

Particular adverse events were reported in 2600 to 6300 men and were generally higher with sildenafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events, which were not different. NNH values varied between 4.9 (4.2 to 6.0) for men reporting at least one adverse event (49% of men taking sildenafil), to 18 (15 to 23) for men reporting dyspepsia. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 17% of men taking sildenafil, followed by flushing reported in 13% and dyspepsia in 7.8%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and frequently transient.

### Testosterone therapy in erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism [^114WKCrF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Laboratory experiments indicate that the nitric oxide erectile pathway is testosterone-dependent. Castration induces erectile dysfunction (ED) and reduces nitric oxide synthase and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) levels in erectile tissue. Furthermore, castration causes apoptosis, adversely affecting smooth muscle content and penile hemodynamics, leading to veno-occlusive dysfunction. Testosterone therapy reverses these structural, biochemical, and physiological changes. In humans, testosterone therapy improves erectile function in men with hypogonadism. However, the efficacy of testosterone monotherapy may not be adequate due to the multifactorial nature of the pathophysiology of ED.

- **Methods**: Preliminary data from a number of studies have been reviewed.

- **Results**: There is emerging evidence-based support for the benefits of combining testosterone and PDE5 inhibitors. A recently published multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of testosterone gel 1% plus sildenafil compared to placebo gel plus sildenafil in producing an erectile response in hypogonadal men who had previously failed with sildenafil alone for ED. Screening revealed a prevalence of hypogonadism in ED patients who had failed prior sildenafil treatments. The double-blinded treatment phase, following randomization, lasted 12 weeks. Testosterone therapy with testosterone gel significantly improved erectile function in response to sildenafil. Additionally, it significantly improved orgasmic function and patient satisfaction.

Conclusion: It is important to screen all men with ED for hypogonadism.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought randomized trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, with placebo or active comparator, in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomized trial.

For inclusion, a trial had to be randomized and double-blind, use one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in the home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of 10 men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilizing reporting of randomization, blinding, and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and the country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^112pEH3V]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In boys with a well-established diagnosis of central hypogonadism, treatment should not be delayed beyond the age of 12 years to avoid the psychosocial burden and the negative effect that the delay in exposure to sex steroids may have on the skeleton and pubertal growth spurt. Similarly, treatment is initiated even if a differential diagnosis between constitutional delay of puberty and central hypogonadism could not be resolved. Although all treatments are off-label, the protocol of intramuscular testosterone administration with progressive increase, already described for primary hypogonadism, is the most widely used. The initial doses (approximately 50 mg every 4 weeks) are too low to inhibit the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis in boys with constitutional delay of puberty, allowing testosterone administration to be stopped if testicular volume reaches 4 ml.

A frequently used alternative is to administer testosterone for 6 months, discontinue it for 3 months, and observe whether testicular volume progresses. In a few cases, patients feel satisfied with the androgenic effects and are not willing to discontinue testosterone administration. Treatment discontinuation can then be delayed until full development is attained, approximately 3 years after the initiation of treatment. In such cases, a longer washout period (approximately 6 months) is needed to confirm that no spontaneous development occurs, given that the full dosage of 250 mg every 4 weeks inhibits the HPT axis. It is essential to monitor the potential side effects of androgen treatment on hematocrit and liver function.

Regarding the medical management of male hypogonadism, particularly in relation to testosterone therapy, the Endocrine Society's 2018 guidelines recommend against initiating testosterone replacement therapy in patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)**: Patients with this condition should not commence therapy.
- **Palpable prostate nodule or induration**: Any palpable abnormalities should be evaluated before considering therapy.
- **Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > 4 ng/mL**: Or, a PSA level > 3 ng/mL if combined with a high risk of prostate cancer, without further urological evaluation.
- **Breast or prostate cancer**: Patients with these cancers should avoid testosterone therapy.
- **Elevated hematocrit**: Therapy should be withheld if hematocrit levels are high.
- **Thrombophilia**: Known thrombophilic disorders contraindicate therapy.
- **Recent myocardial infarction or stroke**: Within the last 6 months, therapy should not be initiated.
- **Uncontrolled heart failure (HF)**: Therapy should only be considered once heart failure is controlled.
- **Untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea**: Treatment should not be started without addressing severe sleep apnea.

### Treatment of erectile dysfunction: What should we do next [^113HMNNA]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Because sildenafil (Viagra) is scheduled to become clinically available soon, urologists in Japan must prepare for changes in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The drug will surely influence our clinical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the dysfunction. We discuss this issue, referring to both the favorable and unfavorable effects that the drug may bring. We also propose several future studies that should be undertaken, including those on testosterone replacement therapy. Additionally, we present results from our experiment using testosterone replacement therapy in aged rats and speculate on the mechanism by which hormone replacement impacts the sex center of the brain.

### Natestonasal gel [^113WCKUP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to initiating Natesto, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

- **Dosing and administration**: The recommended dose of Natesto is 11 mg of testosterone (2 pump actuations; 1 actuation per nostril) administered intranasally three times daily for a total daily dose of 33 mg. Serum total testosterone concentrations should be checked periodically, starting as soon as one month after initiating treatment with Natesto. When the total testosterone concentration consistently exceeds 1050 ng/dL, therapy with Natesto should be discontinued. If the total testosterone concentration is consistently below 300 ng/dL, an alternative treatment should be considered.

### European academy of andrology (EAA) guidelines on investigation, treatment and monitoring of functional hypogonadism in males: Endorsing organization: European Society of Endocrinology [^112vT6mz]. Andrology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for male hypogonadism, specifically in terms of clinical and laboratory monitoring, the EAA 2020 guidelines recommend measuring hematocrit levels 3–6 months after initiating testosterone replacement therapy and then annually. If hematocrit is greater than 54%, testosterone replacement therapy should be discontinued until hematocrit decreases to a safe level. Patients should be evaluated for hypoxia and sleep apnea. Consider reinitiating testosterone replacement therapy at a reduced dose.

### Improved sexual function with testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men: real-world data from the Testim Registry in the United States (TRiUS) [^112eRuCp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of erectile dysfunction (ED) patients treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors do not show improved sexual function, which may be due in part to low serum testosterone. Hypogonadal patients already receiving testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can still suffer from symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In these patient populations, augmenting with or switching TRT treatment may improve sexual function.

- **Aim**: To determine if 12-month treatment with a testosterone gel improves sexual function in hypogonadal men, as measured by the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI), and in subgroups defined by low testosterone, PDE5 inhibitor use, and prior TRT.

- **Methods**: The Testim Registry in the United States (TRiUS) was a large (N = 849) multicenter registry of hypogonadal men treated with Testim (testosterone 1%) topical gel and followed for 12 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Data collected at suggested visits (baseline; 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) included total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), BMSFI scores, physical exam, and body measurements.

- **Results**: TRiUS had 271 patients with baseline testosterone and BMSFI measurements. At 12 months of TRT, TT and FT levels significantly increased from baseline (P < 0.001), with mean ± standard deviation final TT = 17.37 ± 8.61 nmol/L (500.6 ± 248.2 ng/dL) and FT = 240.1 ± 296.0 pmol/L (69.2 ± 85.3 pg/mL). The mean total BMSFI score significantly increased from baseline at 12 months (27.4 ± 10.3 to 33.8 ± 9.8, P < 0.001) and at each visit in all domains (sex drive/libido, erectile function).

### Testosterone and the cardiovascular system: A comprehensive review of the basic science literature [^11338M6D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Because of the increase in the number of prescriptions and use of testosterone in adult males for the treatment of hypogonadism, low libido, and weakness, an investigation of the effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system in basic science studies was carried out. The benefits of testosterone relating to the cardiovascular system are as follows. Testosterone has been shown to exhibit potential antiarrhythmic properties by decreasing action potential duration, early after depolarizations, and shortening the QTc interval. Testosterone has also been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size compared with that in subjects not treated with testosterone by modulating the myocardial K ATP channel, enhancing vasodilation, improving lipid metabolism, and improving DM.

These conclusions do not come without controversy. Much of the literature suggests that testosterone attenuates atherosclerosis, but some studies suggest otherwise. Further deleterious effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system have been shown in studies on vasoconstriction, inflammation, and death signaling. These findings suggest that testosterone may simultaneously benefit and harm the cardiovascular system through different pathways. The complexity of this relationship is obvious, and thus additional basic science studies are required for a better understanding of the relationship between testosterone and the cardiovascular system.

### Oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatments for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HveZe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common male sexual disorder. The relative benefits and harms of pharmacologic therapies for ED, as well as the value of hormonal testing in men with ED, are uncertain.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the efficacy and harms of oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and hormonal treatments for ED and assess the effect of measuring serum hormone levels on treatment outcomes for ED.

- **Data sources**: English-language studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, AMED, and SCOPUS through April 2009; trial reference lists also were scanned.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of oral PDE-5 inhibitors and hormonal treatments for ED, and observational studies reporting measurement of serum hormone levels, prevalence of hormonal abnormalities, or both in men with ED.

- **Data extraction**: Two independent reviewers abstracted data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics; efficacy and harms outcomes; and prevalence of hormonal abnormalities.

- **Data synthesis**: Data, primarily from short-term trials (≤ 12 weeks), indicate that PDE-5 inhibitors were more effective than placebo in improving sexual intercourse success (69.0% vs. 35.0%). The proportion of men with improved erections was significantly greater among those treated with PDE-5 inhibitors (range, 67.0% to 89.0%) than with placebo (range, 27.0% to 35.0%). The PDE-5 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk for any adverse events compared with placebo (for example, relative risk with sildenafil, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.53 to 1.93]).

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction if symptoms do not improve.

### Does sildenafil combined with testosterone gel improve erectile dysfunction in hypogonadal men in whom testosterone supplement therapy alone failed [^111xKr6W]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of testosterone gel (T-gel) alone and in combination with sildenafil in hypogonadal patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 49 hypogonadal men (mean age 60.7 years) with ED participated for a mean of 20.2 months. Blood was tested for total and bioavailable testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen levels. Sexual function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire and a global assessment question (GAQ). Men received 1% 5 gm T-gel for 6 months, and 100 mg sildenafil was added to those who responded "no" to the GAQ after 3 months on testosterone supplements.

- **Results**: A total of 31 patients reported significant improvement in the sexual desire domain (from a mean ± SD of 4.2 ± 0.8 to 8.6 ± 0.4) and erectile function (EF) domain (from 13.6 ± 1.9 to 27 ± 0.8) following treatment with testosterone supplement alone. One patient was excluded from the study after developing urinary retention, and 9 reported irritation at the gel application site. Despite normalization of total and bioavailable testosterone values and significant improvement in sexual desire domain scores, the EF of 17 men remained less than 26, or they responded "no" to the GAQ. These men received combined T-gel and sildenafil, after which all graded EF greater than 26 and responded positively to the GAQ.

- **Conclusions**: Combined treatment with sildenafil and T-gel has a beneficial effect on ED in hypogonadal patients in whom treatment with testosterone supplement alone failed.

### The effects of treating male hypogonadism on couples' sexual desire and function [^115jQxoC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a common endocrine condition characterized by low levels of testosterone (T) and marked by numerous symptoms, one of which is low sexual desire. Studies comparing T delivery systems have suggested that hypogonadal men's partners may be at risk from exposure to T gels. Little other mention is found of the impact of hypogonadism and its treatment on a man's partner and the couple's sexual function.

- **Aim**: To assess sexual desire and sexual function in hypogonadal men and their female partners before and after treatment with T replacement therapy.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one hypogonadal men and 18 partners were recruited from a tertiary endocrine clinic and were compared with a control group of 20 eugonadal age-matched men and their partners. All men had baseline blood tests to confirm their status as hypogonadal or eugonadal, and hypogonadal men repeated tests at 3-month intervals. All participants completed the Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI) and sexual function questionnaires at baseline and at 3-month intervals until the hypogonadal men attained normal T levels.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: Pre- and post-treatment SDI and sexual function questionnaires were compared once T normalization was achieved. Between- and within-group comparisons were carried out.

- **Results**: Pretreatment hypogonadal men recorded lower levels of sexual desire and function than controls but significantly improved once hypogonadism was corrected. Eugonadal controls recorded no significant changes in either sexual desire or function during the study. Partners of the hypogonadal men reported…

### Testosterone treatment comes of age: New options for hypogonadal men [^115ESkDg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Male hypogonadism is one of the most frequent yet underdiagnosed endocrinopathies. The required testosterone treatment is straightforward and highly effective when properly administered. Although testosterone has been available for clinical use for seven decades, until recently, the treatment modalities were suboptimal.

Subdermal testosterone pellets, which require minor surgery for insertion, often cause local problems. Injectable testosterone enanthate, long the most frequently used administration method, lasts two to four weeks but initially produces supraphysiological levels and low levels before the next injection. Oral testosterone undecanoate must be taken three times daily and has an uncertain absorption pattern, leading to peaks and valleys in serum testosterone levels throughout the day.

With the advent of transdermal testosterone preparations, it became possible for the first time to achieve desired physiological serum levels. Scrotal testosterone patches initially fulfilled this requirement, followed by nonscrotal skin patches that unfortunately cause considerable skin reactions, including erythema and blisters. Recently introduced invisible transdermal testosterone gels have increased application intervals and are gradually replacing other modalities. A mucoadhesive buccal testosterone tablet with sustained release is also a competing modality. Finally, injectable testosterone undecanoate in castor oil has been developed into a true depot preparation, requiring only four injections per year for replacement therapy.

### Randomized study of testosterone gel as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone [^117SwWTU]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

We compare the efficacy of testosterone gel (T-gel) versus placebo as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone.

- **Materials and methods**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study was performed. A total of 75 hypogonadal men (18 to 80 years old, morning serum total testosterone 400 ng/dl or less) with confirmed lack of response to sildenafil monotherapy were randomized (1:1) to receive a daily dose of 1% T-gel or 5 gm placebo gel as adjunctive therapy to 100 mg sildenafil during a 12-week period. Subjects were evaluated for sexual function, primarily based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), quality of life, and serum testosterone levels at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12.

- **Results**: Testosterone-treated subjects had greater improvement in erectile function compared to those who received placebo, reaching statistical significance at week 4 (4.4 vs 2.1, p = 0.029, 95.1% CI 0.3, 4.7). Similar trends were observed for improvements in orgasmic function, overall satisfaction, total IIEF score, and percentage of IIEF responders. T-gel significantly (p ≤ 0.004) increased total and free testosterone levels throughout the study, although no significant correlations were made between testosterone levels and the IIEF at endpoint.

- **Conclusions**: T-gel taken with sildenafil may be beneficial in improving erectile function in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who are unresponsive to sildenafil alone.

### Is sildenafil citrate associated with an amelioration of the symptomatology of androgen decline in the aging male [^117SLCm7]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

We examined whether treatment of erectile dysfunction with sildenafil citrate is associated with amelioration of the symptomatology of androgen decline in the aging male, and whether this alters the endocrine pattern.

- **Materials and methods**: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with sildenafil citrate was conducted in 60 men (age range 47 to 75 years) who presented with erectile dysfunction and screened positively for androgen decline in the aging male by the questionnaire of the same name. The patients were randomized to receive sildenafil citrate or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and were crossed over after 3 months of treatment for an additional 3 months. The evaluation included the International Index of Erectile Function and Aging Male Symptoms questionnaires, hormonal profiles, total testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone.

- **Results**: A total of 40 patients completed the study. Compared to placebo, sildenafil citrate improved erectile function (52.7 ± 2 vs 39 ± 1.9, p < 0.001) and Aging Male Symptoms score (33.5 ± 1.3 vs 28.6 ± 1.3, p < 0.001) in the total group. Breakdown into hypogonadal and normal men showed that the International Index of Erectile Function score improved more in normal men (Delta 18.5 ± 3.6) than in hypogonadal men (Delta 6.7 ± 2.7). There were no differences in improvement on the Aging Male Symptoms questionnaire between hypogonadal and normal men. No treatment changes were observed in total testosterone and bioavailable testosterone.

- **Conclusions**: In the total group of patients, sildenafil citrate was associated with an improvement in erectile function and symptoms of androgen decline in aging males.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113mwFg4]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Men with hypogonadism prescribed daily 1% generic testosterone gel use 30 tubes or packets per month; the starting dose for women with HSDD should be one-tenth of a tube or packet each day or 3 tubes per month. Resealable tubes are much preferred to packets to avoid evaporation and resulting change in testosterone concentration in the gel; tubes should be specified when prescribing testosterone gel. Using resealable tubes at room temperature, one-tenth of a male dose is approximately 4 drops/day. With the 1% cream available in Australia, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg/day testosterone (0.5 ml), which may be titrated to 10 mg/day (1.0 ml) as needed.

These topical preparations should be applied to a skin surface, typically the back of the calf or the upper outer thigh (at least an hour after shaving) or the buttock. The patient should be counseled about potential transference of testosterone from the application site to the skin of individuals (young children, female partners) and pets with whom the woman has close contact, while the risk of exposure to a male partner is minimal. The FDA warnings for men should be explained to women, including the need to wash hands immediately with soap and water after application of gel. If contact does occur, the residual testosterone can be washed off with soap and water. Long-term continual exposure may result in signs of virilization, changes in body hair, and acne, although these adverse effects are described in case reports of transference from men to women and children.

Patients should be monitored for clinical response to treatment.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^1118po7j]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

There were 35 included studies using sildenafil, treating 7,135 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of the men, 3,279 received placebo and 3,856 sildenafil, of whom all but 90 took licensed doses of 25 to 100 mg. Optimized dosing with 25–100 mg was most used (2,546 men), followed by 100 mg (506) or 50 mg (370). All were placebo-controlled with no active comparator. Quality scores were high, with 11 trials scoring 5 of 5 points, 17 scoring 4 points, six 3 points, and two 2 points. One further study used a withdrawal model after successful treatment, and information from the 205 men in this study was not included in this analysis.

There were eight included studies using tadalafil, treating 2,071 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of these, 632 received placebo and 1,439 tadalafil, of whom all but 35 took licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg. All were placebo-controlled with no active comparator. Doses of 20 mg (1,258) or 10 mg (109) were most frequent, with no dose-optimized studies. Quality scores were high, with two trials scoring 5 of 5 points, one scoring 4 points, four 3 points, and one 2 points. One further trial was a population dose-response study and was not included.

There were seven included studies with vardenafil, treating 3,374 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of these, 1,067 received placebo and 2,307 vardenafil, all at licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg.

### Testosterone therapy can enhance erectile function response to sildenafil in patients with PADAM: a pilot study [^111eyZGb]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest a direct relationship between free testosterone and cavernous vasodilatation. Some men with erectile dysfunction (ED) associated with partial androgen deficiency in aging men (PADAM) might possibly benefit from testosterone undecanoate therapy (TRT).

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of testosterone undecanoate in facilitating the erectile response and patient satisfaction with sildenafil in men aged 40–70 years with PADAM symptoms.

- **Design and methods**: This prospective study included 40 patients recruited following a sildenafil therapeutic trial. Total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured to calculate the free androgen index. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured and repeated two months after treatment. A rating score was used for PADAM symptoms, and the 5-point abbreviated version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was used to assess erectile function.

Men failing to respond to sildenafil were randomized into two groups: one receiving sildenafil plus continuous TRT (group 1ST), and the other receiving TRT alone (group 1T). Men partially responding to sildenafil were randomized into two groups: one receiving sildenafil plus continuous TRT for two months (group 2ST), or sildenafil alone (group 2S). Treatment efficacy was assessed by analysis of between-group differences.

- **Results**: Groups 1T, 2S, and 2ST showed significant improvement in PADAM scores (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Patients receiving both sildenafil plus continuous TRT (groups 1ST and 2ST) showed significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores (P < 0.5, paired t-test).

### Cardiovascular health, erectile dysfunction, and testosterone replacement: Controversies and correlations [^112BEEBm]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease share a similar underlying pathophysiology, and low serum testosterone, known as hypogonadism, is a significant player in both conditions. Hypogonadism is a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and worsened mortality, thus influencing physicians to recommend testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men. However, at least four recent reports suggest that testosterone replacement may worsen cardiovascular risk, heightening hesitancy in the medical community to treat patients with hypogonadism with testosterone. This review highlights the triad of cardiovascular disease, erectile dysfunction, and testosterone therapy and provides the physician with some guiding principles for navigating these recent concerns.

### After sildenafil: Bridging the gap between pharmacologic treatment and satisfying sexual relationships [^117XbcE5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a prevalent and distressing problem. The availability of sildenafil citrate has significantly altered the way in which erectile dysfunction is treated. While this medication is extremely effective in restoring erectile function, it is often necessary to ensure that the partner is actively involved in treatment, since many men are in relationships characterized by sexual apathy and avoidance as well as relationship conflict. These problems, if left untreated, can thwart the transition from sexual abstinence to sexual intimacy. Suggestions are offered for evaluating and intervening with men and their partners who are planning to resume a sexual life with sildenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction.

### Recent advancement in the treatment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism [^111TiXG7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

All treatments used in pediatric patients with hypogonadism are off-label. Intramuscular testosterone administration is the most frequently used therapy to provoke genital enlargement in childhood or achieve the full development of secondary sexual characteristics and growth spurts in adolescents. While this is the only option for patients with primary hypogonadism, the administration of gonadotropins or GnRH may represent a more physiological therapy in boys with central hypogonadism.

Clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to assess whether gonadotropin treatment yields better results than initial androgen replacement followed by gonadotropin treatment in adulthood when fertility is sought. Other possibilities based on recently developed technologies, such as Leydig cell or spermatogenic development in vitro, represent stimulating alternatives.

### Effect of testosterone replacement on response to sildenafil citrate in men with erectile dysfunction: A parallel, randomized trial [^112uciFB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Erectile dysfunction and low testosterone levels frequently occur together. The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of testosterone to sildenafil therapy improves erectile response in men with erectile dysfunction and low testosterone levels.

- **Design**: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00512707).

- **Setting**: The trial was conducted at an outpatient academic research center.

- **Participants**: Men aged 40 to 70 years with scores of 25 or less for the erectile function domain (EFD) of the International Index of Erectile Function, total testosterone levels less than 11.45 nmol/L (< 330 ng/dL), or free testosterone levels less than 173.35 pmol/L (< 50 pg/mL).

- **Intervention**: Sildenafil dose was optimized, and 140 participants were randomly assigned to 14 weeks of daily transdermal gel containing either 10-g testosterone for 70 participants or placebo for the remaining 70 participants. All participants were included in the primary analysis, although 10 in the testosterone group and 12 in the placebo group did not complete the study.

- **Results**: At baseline, the two groups had similar EFD scores. Administration of sildenafil alone was associated with a substantial increase in EFD score (mean, 7.7 [95% CI, 6.5 to 8.8]); however, the change in EFD score after randomization did not differ between the groups (difference, 2.2 [CI, -0.8 to 5.1]; P = 0.150). The findings were similar for other domains of sexual function in younger men, more obese men, and men with lower baseline testosterone levels or an inadequate response to sildenafil alone.

### Randomized study of testosterone gel as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone [^116yCouR]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

We compare the efficacy of testosterone gel (T-gel) versus placebo as adjunctive therapy to sildenafil in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who do not respond to sildenafil alone.

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study was performed. A total of 75 hypogonadal men (aged 18 to 80 years, with morning serum total testosterone of 400 ng/dl or less) who had a confirmed lack of response to sildenafil monotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a daily dose of 1% T-gel or 5 gm placebo gel as adjunctive therapy to 100 mg sildenafil over a 12-week period. Subjects were evaluated for sexual function, primarily based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), quality of life, and serum testosterone levels at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12.

Testosterone-treated subjects experienced greater improvement in erectile function compared to those who received placebo, with statistical significance reached at week 4 (4.4 vs. 2.1, p = 0.029, 95.1% CI 0.3, 4.7). Similar trends were observed for improvements in orgasmic function, overall satisfaction, total IIEF score, and percentage of IIEF responders. T-gel significantly (p ≤ 0.004) increased total and free testosterone levels throughout the study; however, no significant correlations were found between testosterone levels and the IIEF at endpoint.

T-gel taken with sildenafil may be beneficial in improving erectile function in hypogonadal men with erectile dysfunction who are unresponsive to sildenafil alone.

### Clomiphene citrate: A potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^1143rJ7P]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Hypogonadism is a global issue among men, leading to sexual, physical, and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the primary treatment for male hypogonadism, although it comes with side effects, including subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off-label therapy for a subset of hypogonadal males, particularly those with current or future fertility desires. There is limited literature on the use of CC for men with hypogonadism. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

In this single-centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome was hormonal evaluation, including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes were hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication, and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

A total of 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH, and FSH levels increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16 nmol/L, with a biochemical increase observed in 89% of the patients. In those who continued CC treatment, elevated TT levels were maintained after 8 years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced improvement in hypogonadal symptoms. LH at the lower end of the normal range before CC treatment predicted a better TT response.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115frEKF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

When considering medical management for male hypogonadism, particularly testosterone therapy, the guidelines from the Endocrine Society in 2018 recommend discussing the potential risk of prostate cancer with the patient. For patients aged 40–69 who are at increased risk of prostate cancer — such as African Americans or those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer — monitoring options should be offered if hypogonadism is being evaluated for testosterone therapy.

### Symptomatic benefits of testosterone treatment in patient subgroups: A systematic review, individual participant data meta-analysis, and aggregate data meta-analysis [^1121QL3c]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy is known to improve sexual function in men younger than 40 years with pathological hypogonadism. However, the extent to which testosterone alleviates sexual dysfunction in older men and men with obesity is unclear, despite the fact that testosterone is being increasingly prescribed to these patient populations. We aimed to evaluate whether subgroups of men with low testosterone derive any symptomatic benefit from testosterone treatment.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate characteristics associated with symptomatic benefits of testosterone treatment versus placebo in men aged 18 years and older with a baseline serum total testosterone concentration of less than 12 nmol/L. We searched major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and clinical trial registries for reports published in English between Jan 1, 1992, and Aug 27, 2018. Anonymized individual participant data were requested from the investigators of all identified trials. Primary (cardiovascular) outcomes from this analysis have been published previously. In this report, we present the secondary outcomes of sexual function, quality of life, and psychological outcomes at 12 months. We conducted a one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis with a random-effects linear regression model and a two-stage meta-analysis integrating individual participant data with aggregated data from studies that did not provide individual participant data. This study is registered with appropriate ethical standards.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111ejDpg]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

All studies provided background information on participants. Typically, men had to have a history of erectile dysfunction of at least three to six months, and the average age of men was generally in the mid-50s or older. Some studies had enriched enrolment in which previous unsuccessful treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor was an exclusion criterion. This exclusion applied to five of eight tadalafil studies and six of seven vardenafil studies, but none of the sildenafil studies. One vardenafil study included only men previously unresponsive to sildenafil.

Studies almost always documented that a PDE-5 inhibitor was to be taken as needed to a maximum of one treatment a day, with the additional instruction for sildenafil and vardenafil that the dose be taken about an hour before intercourse. Some studies provided information on the number of doses actually taken. Many of the dose-optimised studies reported the proportion of men on the maximum dose at the end of the study, which was always over 50%, and typically 60–80%. Trial duration was typically four to 12 weeks, with 12 weeks being the most common duration.

A number of different conditions causing erectile dysfunction were studied. All three PDE-5 inhibitors had a similar proportion of men with mixed aetiology (organic, psychogenic, or mixed) and diabetes. Erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy was studied for tadalafil and vardenafil, but not sildenafil. None of the studies of sildenafil after prostatectomy could be included, mainly because they were not randomised.

### Modern pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction: evolving concepts with central and peripheral acting agents [^1127vFxY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for men experiencing erectile dysfunction has undergone dramatic advances over the past 5 years with the introduction of an effective oral agent. Sildenafil has increased the pool of couples seeking treatment for this important health issue as well as expanding the numbers of physicians treating it. Research into the growing field of erectile dysfunction is expanding at a rapid pace. Independent investigators worldwide now regularly contribute to our body of scientific knowledge. Novel oral therapies targeted at specific points along the erectile cascade are undergoing pre-clinical and early-phase registration trials with the promise of rapid action, extended duration of responsiveness, and an improved side effect profile. In this review, we have highlighted recent information on the next generation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and summarized the evolving research into centrally acting agents, which may lead to effective combination therapy.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, including the Patient Information and Instructions for Use. Inform them of the contraindications of using sildenafil with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. Also, inform patients that sildenafil is marketed as Viagra for erectile dysfunction, and they should not take Viagra or other PDE-5 inhibitors while on sildenafil.

Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes while taking sildenafil, as it may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Additionally, advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they experience a sudden decrease or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, while taking sildenafil.

### A 4-year update on the safety of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^115qjgFr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile dysfunction. Despite its established safety profile, concern about its cardiovascular safety persists among some physicians and the general public. This concern has stemmed primarily from sporadic reports of adverse events published in the literature and sensationalized by the media. However, the only absolute contraindication for sildenafil is concurrent use of nitrates. Because sildenafil has been on the market for 4 years and under clinical investigation for even longer, we can now evaluate its long-term safety in men who have been taking the drug for several years.

- **Overall safety profile**: We reassess the overall safety profile of sildenafil by reviewing the initial controlled clinical trials and open-label studies. We present new data from patients who have been exposed to sildenafil for up to 4.5 years. We also evaluate the results from independent postmarketing studies.

- **Cardiovascular-specific results**: We review the cardiovascular-specific results from the clinical trials, long-term extension, and postmarketing studies.

- **Visual system effects**: Lastly, we review the specific effects on the visual system based on findings from studies conducted during drug development and postmarketing.

### Combining testosterone and PDE5 inhibitors in erectile dysfunction: basic rationale and clinical evidences [^1157PSqw]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and the decline of testosterone levels are frequently observed with age and in illnesses that have a common basis of endothelial damage.

- **Objectives**: To review molecular mechanisms underlying androgen action upon its receptor and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) expression and regulation by testosterone in cavernous tissue and their clinical implication in the treatment of ED refractory to PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is).

- **Methods**: From January 2003 to May 2006, we performed an extensive, unsystematic MEDLINE literature search reviewing relevant data on basic and clinical studies regarding the efficacy of combination therapies.

- **Results**: Most trials using testosterone alone for the treatment of ED in hypogonadal men suffer from methodological problems and report inconsistent results. However, these trials generally suggest that testosterone is superior to placebo. Orally effective PDE5-Is, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil, may be ineffective depending on the demonstration of testosterone regulation of PDE5 expression in the human corpus cavernous, and their efficacy may be enhanced by testosterone adjunction whenever necessary.

- **Conclusions**: Screening for hypogonadism in all men with ED is necessary to identify men with severe hypogonadism and some cases of mild to moderate hypogonadism who may benefit from testosterone treatment. Identification of threshold values for testosterone supplementation to appropriately benefit from PDE5-Is failure may improve clinical management of unresponsive patients with minimized unwanted effects.

### Adjunctive use of AndroGel (testosterone gel) with sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction in men with acquired androgen deficiency syndrome after failure using sildenafil alone [^111Qkz4G]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether combination therapy with testosterone gel (T-gel) and sildenafil citrate is effective in achieving adequate potency in subjects with low-normal serum testosterone levels in whom sildenafil alone has failed, 90 men (aged 32 to 72 years) were evaluated from July 2000 to June 2001. These men had undergone 3 months of sildenafil therapy at the maximal recommended dose (100 mg), with at least three attempts at intercourse during the 3-month period, which had failed. Among them, 24 men had testosterone levels less than 400 ng/dL (range 92 to 365, mean 231.4) and were subsequently started on 1% T-gel monotherapy (AndroGel, 5 g daily). After 4 weeks of T-gel alone (week 4), sildenafil citrate (Viagra, 100 mg) was added to the treatment regimen for an additional 12 weeks (through week 16). Potency was defined as the ability to have at least one episode of satisfactory intercourse during the treatment period.

All the men had normalized serum testosterone levels after 4 weeks of T-gel monotherapy (range 424 to 596 ng/dL, mean 525). However, none of the men regained potency. At week 16, almost all (22 of 24, 92%) of the men reported improved potency with combination therapy. Improvement in erection quality was also observed.

The results of this study support the use of T-gel with sildenafil citrate in men with low-normal serum testosterone levels in whom sildenafil alone fails. It also underscores the numbers of men with low to low-normal testosterone levels who would benefit from testosterone screening when evaluated for erectile dysfunction.

### Psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes affecting treatment choice in men receiving sildenafil citrate and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^114PCRjg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil are efficacious and well-tolerated treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED), preference studies have shown that patients may favor one medication over the other.

- **Aim**: To determine whether psychosocial outcomes differed when men with ED received tadalafil compared with sildenafil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included a treatment preference question, Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), and Drug Attribute Questionnaire.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study. After a 4-week baseline, men with ED (N = 367; mean age = 54 years; naïve to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy) were randomized: tadalafil for 12 weeks then sildenafil for 12 weeks or vice versa (8-week dose optimization/4-week assessment phases). During dose optimization, patients started with 10 mg tadalafil, or 25 or 50 mg sildenafil and could titrate to their optimal dose (10 or 20 mg tadalafil; 25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil). Medications were taken as needed. Patients completing both 12-week periods chose which medication to continue during an 8-week extension.

- **Results**: Of 291 men completing both treatment periods, 71% (N = 206) chose tadalafil and 29% (N = 85) chose sildenafil (P < 0.001) for the 8-week extension. When taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil, men had higher mean endpoint scores on PAIRS Sexual Self-Confidence (tadalafil = 2.91 vs. sildenafil = 2.75; P < 0.001) and Spontaneity Domains (tadalafil = 3.32 vs. sildenafil = 3.17; P < 0.001) and a lower mean endpoint score on Time Concern.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^1143pKL6]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Men were recruited for a men's health study without mention of erectile dysfunction. At the screening visit for this sildenafil flexible-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, written informed consent was obtained, and demographic data and the patient's history of risk factors were collected. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating center, and the study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Men aged 30 years or older who presented with at least one risk factor or comorbidity for erectile dysfunction (controlled hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, metabolic syndrome, stable coronary artery disease, diabetes, depression, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²), or waist circumference ≥ 40 inches) and who had not been previously diagnosed with erectile dysfunction were eligible for screening.

Key exclusion criteria included hypotension, anticipated nitrate or nitric oxide donor treatment, significant cardiovascular disease within the past three months, and previous use of more than six doses of any phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.

Men were asked the screening question, "Do you have erectile dysfunction?" and were administered the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF). Those who answered "no" or "unsure" to the erectile dysfunction question were further assessed.

### Testosterone cypionate [^114kkr5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to initiating testosterone cypionate, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least two separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.

Testosterone cypionate injection is for intramuscular use only. It should not be given intravenously. Intramuscular injections should be given deep in the gluteal muscle.

The suggested dosage for testosterone cypionate injection varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individual patient. Dosage is adjusted according to the patient's response and the appearance of adverse reactions.

- **Inducing pubertal changes**: Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males. Some experts advocate starting with lower dosages and gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes, while lower dosages may be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration for both determining the initial dose and adjusting the dose.

- **Replacement in hypogonadal males**: For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit. Warming and shaking the vial should redissolve any crystals that may have formed during storage.

### Therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction after 6 months of treatment with tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil: Results from the erectile dysfunction observational study (EDOS) [^114S5nKV]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

This observational study was conducted across Europe to assess health outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) who took tadalafil, sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), or vardenafil HCl (vardenafil) for six months.

Therapy effectiveness and patient satisfaction were evaluated using established and new questions on erectile function. Behavioral, psychological, and relationship outcomes were assessed using the short form of the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (SF-PAIRS).

In nine European countries at 904 sites, 8047 patients were enrolled, and 94% (7560) selected either tadalafil (5315), sildenafil (1252), or vardenafil (993) for treatment at baseline. Of the 7560 patients, 3998 (52.9%) took the same drug for six months. Baseline characteristics across the three treatment groups were comparable: mean age approximately 56 years, moderate or severe ED, and mean International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score about 13.

Tadalafil, sildenafil, and vardenafil were therapeutically effective and improved patient satisfaction in 40–58% of men who completed six months of a single therapy. Patients taking tadalafil consistently had numerically higher levels of therapeutic effectiveness and satisfaction compared with those who took sildenafil or vardenafil. The three cohorts had statistically significant changes from baseline in response to SF-PAIRS, and there were significant differences, in favor of tadalafil, among cohorts in the Time Concerns domain.

In conclusion, this large observational study mimicked a routine clinical setting.
