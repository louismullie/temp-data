## Question

What does a facial HSV rash look like?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a facial HSV rash (orolabial herpes) looks like. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causal agent and pathophysiology. Then, I should define the typical anatomic distribution and lesion evolution. Next, I will characterize hallmark symptoms and associated findings. After that, I need to review atypical or severe presentations, including in special populations. Finally, I should differentiate HSV from similar dermatoses and briefly note evidence-based management that clarifies time course and response to early therapy [^1125c4TM].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and causal agent: orolabial herpes on the face is most commonly due to HSV-1, which infects mucocutaneous surfaces and establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglia with episodic reactivation along sensory branches to the perioral skin and lips, producing recurrent lesions at stereotyped sites, a neurotropic behavior that explains localization and recurrence patterns [^111TZGkf] [^1125c4TM].

> I will now examine the typical anatomic distribution and evolution of lesions; hold on, I should verify the sites most often affected and the expected timeline: lesions cluster on the vermilion border of the lip and immediate perioral skin, may extend to the nose or adjacent cheek through local spread, begin as erythematous papules that evolve into grouped vesicles, then erosions with honey-colored crust within 48–72 hours, and generally resolve over 7–10 days without scarring in immunocompetent hosts [^1125c4TM] [^115c8XK2].

> Let me think about the morphology and prodrome; hmm, wait a minute — these are sometimes described as umbilicated vesicles and pustules on an erythematous base, but hold on, I should verify whether umbilication is a defining feature in HSV on the face: umbilication is classically a poxvirus/molluscum clue, so I should correct myself and emphasize that HSV presents as painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base with a prodrome of tingling, burning, or pain rather than pruritus, with pain typically predominating over itch before vesiculation [^1125c4TM] [^1175tjH5].

> Next, I should review associated findings that round out the clinical picture; wait, let me verify oral and nodal involvement: cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy is common, gingival erythema and oral mucosal vesicles or erosions can coexist especially in primary episodes, and systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, or headache are more prominent in primary infection than in recurrences, with lip erythema and edema frequently observed during active episodes [^1125c4TM] [^11613rnX].

> I need to ensure I consider atypical or severe presentations; hold on, I should verify which phenotypes appear in high-risk groups and with autoinoculation: in immunocompromised patients, HSV can present as chronic, hyperproliferative or hypertrophic plaques rather than classic vesicles; ocular involvement from periocular spread can lead to keratitis; and autoinoculation can produce multifocal lesions beyond the perioral region, such as eyelids or chest, even in otherwise healthy infants, necessitating vigilance for herpetic keratitis when periocular lesions occur [^115YpKtY] [^111htcG8] [^115T7uin].

> But wait, what if this is not HSV; I should double-check key differentiators from similar dermatoses: HSV tends to be localized and clustered at the perioral area, whereas primary varicella and many viral exanthems are generalized, and zoster is typically dermatomal with unilateral distribution; clinical algorithms for vesiculobullous eruptions emphasize distribution, grouping, and evolution; HSV can also trigger erythema multiforme with target lesions, which should not be confused for primary HSV lesions; and rare mimics such as tularemia can present with vesicles and may be misdiagnosed as herpetic infection, underscoring the need for careful pattern recognition and, when atypical, targeted testing [^115rqsu6] [^114qTLAM] [^115CNRv2] [^111cu3y8].

> I should confirm recurrence behavior and site specificity; let me verify whether recurrences tend to localize: recurrent HSV-1 labialis characteristically reappears at the same or closely adjacent sites, a pattern documented with long-term spatial mapping showing millimeter-level recurrence clustering over years, consistent with reactivation along the same trigeminal sensory pathways [^111wZegu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management, but a brief evidence check can reinforce recognition by timing of symptom resolution; I need to check the impact of early antiviral therapy: patient-initiated oral valacyclovir started at prodrome or early macule stage can abort about half of episodes and shortens pain and episode duration when initiated within the first hours, which aligns with the observed rapid evolution from vesicle to crust over days; topical penciclovir is labeled for labial use on the lips and face but should be kept away from mucous membranes and eyes, and persistent or worsening lesions warrant evaluation for secondary infection or atypical HSV manifestations [^117U2CUP] [^113eTF3Q] [^116n95aP].

> Final synthesis — let me reconsider to ensure internal consistency: a facial HSV-1 rash (orolabial herpes) is best recognized as a localized, recurrent eruption of painful, grouped vesicles on an erythematous base centered on the vermilion border and perioral skin, often preceded by tingling or burning; lesions may coalesce, erode, and crust within 2–3 days, resolving in roughly a week; cervical/submandibular nodes and concomitant oral mucosal erosions can occur, especially in primary disease; recurrences tend to localize to the same site; atypical hypertrophic plaques can occur in immunocompromised hosts, and autoinoculation can seed periocular or truncal sites with risk of keratitis; differentiation from VZV and other vesiculobullous or targetoid eruptions hinges on distribution, grouping, and evolution patterns, with confirmatory testing reserved for atypical courses [^1125c4TM] [^115c8XK2] [^115T7uin] [^111htcG8] [^114qTLAM].

---

The HSV rash on the face is characterized by **grouped vesicles on an erythematous base** that evolve through a predictable sequence: **prodrome → vesicles → ulcers → crusts** [^1125c4TM] [^115c8XK2]. Lesions are typically perioral but can involve the nose, cheeks, or chin, and are often **recurrent at the same site** due to trigeminal ganglion latency [^111TZGkf] [^1177dpvy]. Diagnosis is clinical [^1125c4TM] but can be confirmed by PCR or viral culture [^115nZrHV]; early antiviral therapy shortens duration and reduces complications [^117U2CUP] [^116n95aP].

---

## Clinical appearance and progression

The HSV facial rash follows a characteristic progression, beginning with a **prodromal phase** of tingling, burning, or itching 6–24 hours before visible lesions [^115c8XK2], followed by a **vesicular phase** characterized by grouped, clear vesicles on an erythematous base that typically appear periorally but may also involve the nose, cheeks, or chin [^1125c4TM]. Within 1–2 days, vesicles rupture to form shallow, painful ulcers, then develop yellow-brown crusts that heal over 7–10 days and usually do not scar [^116n95aP].

---

## Typical locations

HSV facial lesions **most commonly** occur at the following sites:

| **Location** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Lips (herpes labialis) | Most common site; "cold sores" or "fever blisters" [^1125c4TM] |
| Perioral region | Around the mouth, including the vermilion border [^1125c4TM] |
| Nose | Nasal ala and external nares [^115c8XK2] |
| Cheeks and chin | Less common but possible [^113pBMta] |
| Eyelids and periorbital area | Can cause herpetic keratitis, a serious complication [^1125c4TM] [^113bBhAm] |

---

## Differences between primary and recurrent infections

Primary and recurrent HSV infections **differ in severity**, duration, and associated symptoms [^1125c4TM] [^11613rnX]:

| **Feature** | **Primary infection** | **Recurrent infection** |
|-|-|-|
| Severity | More severe | Milder |
| Duration | Longer (2–3 weeks) | Shorter (7–10 days) |
| Systemic symptoms | Common (fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy) | Rare or mild |
| Lesion distribution | Widespread, multiple sites | Localized, recurrent at same site |
| Example | Primary gingivostomatitis | Herpes labialis ("cold sores") |

---

## Triggers for recurrence

HSV establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglion [^111TZGkf], and **reactivation is triggered by** emotional or physical stress [^111wZegu]; febrile illnesses or upper respiratory infections; ultraviolet sun exposure [^115c8XK2]; hormonal changes such as menstruation; and immunosuppression including HIV infection, chemotherapy, or corticosteroid use, precipitating recurrence [^116SSbF4].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with laboratory confirmation when needed [^1125c4TM]:

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Highly sensitive and specific; preferred method [^115nZrHV].

- **Viral culture**: Useful but less sensitive than PCR [^115nZrHV].

- **Tzanck smear**: Rapid but nonspecific; shows multinucleated giant cells [^1157uvtW].

- **Serology**: Limited utility; not useful for acute diagnosis [^11613rnX].

---

## Potential complications

HSV facial infections can lead to **significant complications**, particularly in immunocompromised individuals:

- **Herpetic keratitis**: Corneal infection leading to blindness [^1125c4TM] [^113bBhAm].

- **Eczema herpeticum**: Disseminated infection in atopic dermatitis patients [^112QQ7Q6].

- **Secondary bacterial infection**: Common, especially in immunocompromised patients [^1157uvtW].

- **Encephalitis**: Rare but severe complication [^117Mw76i].

---

## Treatment options

Antiviral therapy is the **mainstay of treatment**, and early initiation (**within 48 hours**) is crucial for optimal outcomes [^116n95aP]:

- **Acyclovir**: Oral or topical; effective in reducing duration and severity [^116n95aP].

- **Valacyclovir**: Oral; convenient dosing, effective for facial HSV [^117U2CUP].

- **Famciclovir**: Oral; effective alternative [^112gsVBK].

- **Topical antivirals**: Penciclovir cream for localized lesions [^113eTF3Q].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures include **avoiding triggers** through stress management, sun protection, and minimizing known precipitants, as well as hygiene measures — avoiding shared personal items, maintaining hand hygiene, and avoiding close contact during active lesions [^115c8XK2] [^115T7uin]. Prophylactic antivirals are used for frequent recurrences or in immunocompromised patients [^116n95aP].

---

The HSV facial rash is a **grouped vesicular eruption** on an erythematous base, with a predictable progression and recurrent pattern due to trigeminal latency [^1125c4TM] [^111TZGkf]. Early recognition and **antiviral therapy** are essential to reduce duration, severity, and complications [^117U2CUP].

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of facial herpes simplex virus infection [^117U2CUP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). High credibility.

The objective of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial was to investigate valacyclovir as a treatment for facial herpes simplex virus (HSV) outbreaks. In total, 308 otherwise healthy outpatients self-initiated therapy with valacyclovir, either 1000 mg twice daily for 1 day or 500 mg twice daily for 3 days, for the treatment of one facial HSV episode. Aborted lesions were the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included episode and pain resolution, as well as lesion healing. By regimen (1 or 3 days), aborted lesions occurred in 42.2% versus 46.7% of patients, with a treatment difference of -4.5% (95% confidence interval, -16.3% to 7.4%; p = 0.49). Subgroup findings showed that about half the episodes aborted when therapy started during the prodrome/macule stages or within 6 hours of the first symptoms. Episode and pain resolved rapidly, with results similar for both treatments. Adverse events were infrequent and similar for the two regimens.

### Defining nervous system susceptibility during acute and latent herpes simplex virus-1 infection [^111TZGkf]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are neurotropic human pathogens that infect and establish latency in peripheral sensory neurons of the host. Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) readily infects the facial mucosa, which can result in the establishment of a latent infection in the sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (TG). From latency, HSV-1 can reactivate and cause peripheral pathology following anterograde trafficking from sensory neurons. In rare circumstances, HSV-1 can migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE), a devastating disease of the CNS. It is unclear whether HSE results from viral reactivation within the TG, direct primary infection of the olfactory mucosa, or other infected CNS neurons. Areas of the brain susceptible to HSV-1 during acute infection are not well-defined. Furthermore, whether the CNS is a true reservoir of viral latency following the clearance of the virus during acute infection is unknown.

This review identifies sites within the brain susceptible to acute infection and capable of harboring latent virus. Additionally, we address findings of HSV-1 lytic gene expression during latency and comment on the pathophysiological consequences HSV-1 infection may have on long-term neurological performance in animal models and humans.

### Recent advance in management of herpes simplex in Japan [^11613rnX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex, a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), is transmitted through contact with the skin or mucous membranes and establishes latency in the sensory ganglia for the rest of the host's life. HSV occasionally reactivates and forms blisters around the lips or genitalia in some patients. Repeated overt symptoms, and much more frequent, subclinical reactivations in the mucosa, make the host retain anti-HSV immunity continuously, resulting in maintaining a steadily elevated antibody titer at any point after infection.

Clinical symptoms differ in primary infection and recurrence. Primary infections sometimes manifest as severe symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy, in addition to blisters or erosions of the skin, gingiva, lips, and oral mucosa, while reactivation herpes is generally mild. Diagnosing typical herpes simplex is not difficult, but when the course and manifestations are atypical, definitive tests to identify HSV infection are limited since serology is not useful except with primary infection.

For treatment, safe and effective oral antiviral drugs are available. Patient-initiated therapy is a new method of administration labeled in Japan. Amenamevir, an inhibitor of viral helicase primase, is available in Japan and labeled in addition to treating herpes zoster. These new diagnostic and therapeutic tools should be used for better management of herpes simplex.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Various infections, autoimmune, and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are commonly seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is straightforward and obvious. Nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both inexperienced and expert clinicians.

We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms for the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. Several aspects are focused on when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, history of comorbidities, medication intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is placed on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign, self-limiting conditions.

### Herpes simplex virus infections [^1177dpvy]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family. Recognized since ancient Greek times, the virus frequently infects humans, causing a range of diseases from mild, uncomplicated mucocutaneous infections to those that are life-threatening. In the past 50 years, substantial advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of HSV have led to insights into disease pathogenesis and management. This review provides a contemporary interpretation of the biological properties, function, epidemiology, and treatment of HSV diseases.

### Selective retention of virus-specific tissue-resident T cells in healed skin after recovery from herpes zoster [^116VFS4p]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

In persons with HZ, systemic VZV-specific T cells are elevated, and reactivating ganglia and HZ rashes become intensely inflamed with T cell infiltrates. T cell recruitment and enrichment in VZV-infected skin may mirror the well-documented herpes simplex virus (HSV) phenotype since the pathogeneses of reinfection by these related neuro- and skin-tropic alphaherpesviruses are similar. Yet, there are major temporal differences in HSV and VZV recurrences. Ganglionic reactivation and axonal delivery of HSV-2 to skin occur repeatedly at the same sites, leading to frequent, short (hours to days) bursts of detectable virus. This provides intermittent boosts of inflammatory stimuli and HSV antigen that maintain local HSV-2-specific T cells in the skin and reproductive tract between recurrences, even during chronic antiviral therapy. In contrast, VZV lingers for up to several weeks following HZ before clearance, leaving a healing skin site devoid of viral antigen. HZ recurrences are uncommon in immunocompetent persons and seldom occur twice in the same dermatome, suggesting local, site-specific protective immunity. Animal models are not amenable to study the local retention of VZV-specific T RM. Mouse models of local skin infection by other skin-tropic viruses, such as HSV-1 and vaccinia, show disparate anatomical localization of virus-specific T RM after viral clearance. HSV-1 systems that lack epithelial reactivation show profoundly localized long-term retention of T RM with prompt antiviral function. In contrast, local skin vaccinia infection leads to disseminated skin CD8 T RM in mice.

### Red face revisited: Flushing [^11478a32]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The term "red face" is reserved for lesions located exclusively or very predominantly on the face, resulting from changes in cutaneous blood flow triggered by multiple different conditions. Facial erythema may not only present clinically as a distinct entity but can also be a sign of other diseases. Patients with a red face challenge clinicians to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on the date and mode of appearance, characteristics of the erythema, functional signs, and associated systemic manifestations.

In most cases, the cause is a benign disease such as rosacea, contact dermatitis, photodermatosis, or climacterium, and a thorough history and physical examination is enough to make a diagnosis. However, facial erythema may also present as a symptom of drug allergies, cardiac disease, carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis, and anaphylaxis, as well as some rare causes such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pancreatic cell tumor, and renal carcinoma, where further laboratory, radiologic, or histopathologic studies are required. In this review, the mechanisms of flushing, its clinical differential diagnosis, and management of various conditions that cause flushing are discussed.

### Herpes simplex virus epidemiology and ocular importance [^113bBhAm]. Cornea (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to review the changing epidemiology of herpes simplex disease and correlate it with the epidemiology of ocular herpes simplex disease.

The method involves a review of pertinent reports in the world literature about the epidemiology of herpes simplex, specifically focusing on ocular herpes simplex.

In terms of results, in developed countries, many individuals are reaching adolescence and adulthood without prior herpesvirus infection. Herpes simplex genital infection is increasing at a rapid rate in sexually active adolescents and adults, with about one in six adults now infected in the United States. Similar statistics are confirmatory worldwide in developed countries. Active herpes simplex infection is a risk factor for the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. The Herpetic Eye Disease Study, along with prior studies from Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, provides us with the epidemiology of ocular herpes simplex. Recent studies suggest an older age of onset and perhaps overall more severe ocular disease as compared with older literature.

In conclusion, herpes simplex is a significant health concern at present, with genital infections increasing in epidemic proportions. This is also reflected in a rise in the incidence of neonatal herpes. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is being acquired for the first time in an older age group. A significant and increasing proportion of genital herpes is caused by HSV-1. Serologic studies are no longer as useful in distinguishing orofacial herpes from genital herpes. More acute retinal necrosis syndrome…

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^115yvpAc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy. In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). High credibility.

The EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of combination therapy with IV acyclovir and systemic corticosteroids for the medical management of herpes zoster, specifically herpes zoster oticus. This recommendation applies to patients with herpes zoster oticus involved with the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) or those experiencing severe pain and multiple cranial nerve palsies.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing WHO priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^116i9M77]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

In 2001, in response to the substantial burden of HSV-2 and a growing body of evidence linking HSV-2 to HIV prevalence and incidence, the WHO hosted a 3-day workshop to set research priorities for HSV-2 in LMICs. Setting health research priorities is essential for optimized use of research resources, particularly important for resource-poor countries. Priorities are best developed through the application of defined methodologies by multiple stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and service users.

The workshop brought together a broad range of regional and disciplinary expertise. The participants were from Europe (n = 18), Africa (n = 10), North America (n = 7), and Asia (n = 1). Their expertise spanned areas of biochemistry, clinical medicine, program interventions, and mathematical disease modeling. Most of them represented well-established global health research organizations and educational institutions. Most of the organizations present originated from high-income countries, such as the United States (6 institutes) and the UK (14 organizations and educational institutions). Eight institutions were based in LMICs: Zimbabwe (n = 3), Uganda (n = 3), South Africa (n = 1), and India (n = 1).

The workshop included expert presentations, plenary dialogues, and breakout discussion groups. On the final day, a list of recommendations made during the discussions was examined and prioritized in five key areas: HSV-2 epidemiology, HSV-2 diagnostics, HSV-2/HIV interactions, HSV-2 control measures, and HSV-2 mathematical models.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^115rqsu6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?**
	- A. Allergic contact dermatitis
	- B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
	- C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
	- D. Coxsackie A infection
	- E. Herpes zoster infection

- **Answers**:
	- A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
	- B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
	- C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
	- D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
	- E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herp…

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^1118kGyS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek, along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

- **Question 1**: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
- **A. Treponema pallidum**: Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
- **B. Monkeypox virus**: Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases has been documented.
- **C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**
- **D. Candida albicans**
- **E. Non-infectious inflammation**

### A distinctive erythematous macular exanthem of the adult: A new entity [^115T5qBA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Delineating a new exanthem is difficult. Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities.

- **Objectives**: To report 29 cases of an acute, self-limiting exanthem never described before.

- **Methods**: Clinical description, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other laboratory investigations.

- **Results**: The eruption starts with bright pink-red, slightly oedematous macules symmetrically arranged on the trunk. The lesions tend to coalesce and spread to the limbs, on which they may acquire a marginated annular appearance. Notably, the lesions invariably spare the face (including oral mucous membranes), palms, and soles. The eruption is pruritic and lasts 20–30 days, clearing spontaneously. The disease has a predilection for men aged 17–56 years and occurs mostly between spring and summer. Serological tests, PCR assays, and investigations for bacteria, parasites, or viruses were consistently negative.

- **Conclusions**: The clinical picture does not recall any of the classical exanthems or their atypical forms.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^116n95aP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia, and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The decision to treat relabial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, while those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with more than five episodes per year, severe recurrences, or unrecognizable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations.

### Is herpes simplex a systemic disease [^116SSbF4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Orofacial herpes simplex virus infections are usually caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 infections have been accepted as a sexually transmitted disease. HSV establishes a latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia of the host and remains there for life. HSV primarily affects the skin and genitalia; however, in immunocompromised patients, it may cause local infection with extensive skin involvement, chronic herpetic ulcers, or widespread mucous membrane damage. It can also lead to systemic infections localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal tract, and ocular system. Usually, HSV infections are within the domain of dermatology. However, the accumulating evidence for the disease's localization in many systems of the human body allows us to question: Is herpes simplex a systemic disease?

### Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus in HIV patients [^115YpKtY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

In conclusion, HSV lesions in HIV patients can present as chronic, hyperproliferative plaques as opposed to the classic acute ulcerative lesions. Knowledge of this presentation will motivate the physician to be diligent in the diagnostic workup, which may necessitate repeat biopsies and cultures. Due to the high incidence of resistant isolates, sensitivity testing and knowledge of antiviral mechanisms will facilitate treatment in an HIV patient.

### Clinical manifestations and treatment considerations of herpes simplex virus infection [^112NnLnP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) types 1 and 2 cause infections manifesting as dermatologic, immunologic, and neurologic disorders. Some of the most important manifestations and complications of HSV infection are considered within a neuroanatomic context. This discussion should aid in understanding the pathogenesis and, in some cases, the diagnosis and management of associated HSV-related diseases.

The sensory nervous system, rather than the skin and mucous membranes, is the primary target of HSV infection. With the intention of extending the benefits of acyclovir, valacyclovir is now being explored in a number of HSV-related conditions. This review extends contemporary thinking about how new antiherpetic drugs might be put to greater therapeutic use in the future.

### Characteristics of herpes simplex virus infection and pathogenesis suggest a strategy for vaccine development [^113nf9qe]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

Interactions of herpes simplex virus (HSV) surface glycoproteins and tegument proteins with cellular components interfere with host defense. At least five glycoproteins — gB, gC, gD, gH, and gL — have been demonstrated to enable interactions with epithelial cellular receptors or immune cells. These interactions promote virus entry or proliferation and even disrupt innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, some tegument proteins play important roles in viral proliferation, virulence, and host immunity evasion by interacting with cellular molecules.

### Erythema multiforme [^115CNRv2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be idiopathic. The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization.

A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need for antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment, which will be detailed in this review, as well as the etiologic treatment.

The management of persistent or recurring erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Spatial mapping of long-term recrudescent herpes simplex labialis [^111wZegu]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old immunocompetent subject, who was a dermatologist, observed the onset of clinically apparent labial HSV at the age of 19. His primary infection had been subclinical; subsequently, HSV-1 disease was confirmed serologically. He recorded the frequency of recrudescent eruptions of HSV-1 from 42 to 79 years of age (1983–2020), and he drew rough maps of the sites of the outbreaks. With millimeter precision, he created detailed maps of the HSV-1 outbreaks, allowing for the exact localization of each outbreak over a period of 11 years (2008–2018).

Exhaustive searches of the literature show that no other such long-term monitoring and careful measurements of HSV-1 outbreaks have ever occurred. Additionally, the spatial recurrence of the events may shed some light on how the recrudescences can re-emerge in the same physical site for years.

During the first 11 years of overt disease, the subject applied trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 100% (wt/vol) to many of the affected sites, but he observed neither increased nor decreased frequency of outbreaks from its use. The size, duration, and location of outbreaks remained unchanged. During the subsequent 27 years of observation, the subject avoided any therapeutic intervention, enabling a 38-year long-term recording of the natural history of recrudescent labial HSV, premised on the lack of impact from the initial TCA use. Outbreaks occasionally followed sun exposure or upper respiratory viral infections but mostly followed fatigue and lack of sleep.

The subject observed 177 recurrences during those 38 years, with a mean of 4.66 episodes per year.

### Famciclovir [^1177KLHb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Famciclovir may be taken with or without food. If you are taking famciclovir for outbreaks of cold sores or genital herpes, take the medication as soon as you experience the first symptoms of the infection, such as itching, redness, pain, burning, or tingling, or when the sore appears. If you take too much famciclovir, contact your healthcare provider or proceed to the nearest hospital emergency room immediately.

- **What should I avoid while taking famciclovir**: You should avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness, sleepiness, or confusion during treatment with famciclovir.

- **What are the possible side effects of famciclovir**: The most common side effects include headache and nausea. These are not all the possible side effects of famciclovir. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088.

- **How should I store famciclovir**: Store famciclovir at room temperature, between 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C). Keep famciclovir and all medications out of the reach of children.

- **General information about the safe and effective use of famciclovir**: Famciclovir is not a cure for cold sores or genital herpes and it is not known if famciclovir can stop the spread of herpes to others. If you are sexually active, you can pass herpes to your partner even while taking famciclovir. Transmission to a partner can occur even if you do not have active symptoms. To reduce the risk of spreading genital herpes, practice safer sex and avoid sexual contact with your partner during an outbreak.

### Viral exanthems: An update on laboratory testing of the adult patient [^115nZrHV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Although classic viral exanthems of childhood are well described, they are rarely differentiated in adults. Laboratory techniques for viral identification have advanced without substantial literature to guide dermatologists in conducting cost-effective and diagnostic viral panels. Certain clinical features, such as petechiae, vesicles, and dusky macular or morbilliform exanthems, strongly indicate a viral exanthem. Differentiating between drug-induced and viral causes of morbilliform eruptions has been challenging. However, with further diagnostic refinement, unnecessary workups of an exanthem and unneeded discontinuation of drugs might be avoided. We review viral exanthems based on clinical features and discuss the available and optimal laboratory techniques to assist dermatologists in a targeted workup.

### Denavir [^113eTF3Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Denavir is intended only for topical use on herpes labialis on the lips and face. No data are available for application to human mucous membranes, and it is not recommended for such use. Care should be taken to avoid application in or near the eyes, as it may cause irritation. Lesions that do not improve or worsen during therapy should be evaluated for secondary bacterial infection. The effect of Denavir has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

### Age-dependent assortativeness in herpes simplex virus type 1 oral transmission in the United States: A mathematical modeling analysis [^116j2VsA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a highly infectious and globally prevalent lifelong infection, typically acquired during childhood. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2020, 122.2 million new HSV-1 infections occurred worldwide among individuals aged 0–49 years, contributing to 3779.1 million prevalent infections and a global prevalence of 58.6% in this age group. HSV-1 infection is characterized by frequent subclinical infectious shedding and symptomatic reactivation in a subset of infected individuals.

The virus is primarily transmitted through contact with cold sores or oral secretions during asymptomatic shedding. This transmission can occur through practices that are particularly common among children, such as sharing utensils, cups, bottles, or food; kissing and other close face-to-face interactions; chewing on shared objects like toys; and sharing personal items like toothbrushes or lip balm.

While symptomatic infection often manifests as oral or facial lesions, HSV-1 infection can also cause a wide range of clinical presentations, including herpetic whitlow, gingivostomatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and corneal blindness. The virus can also be transmitted through oral sex or sexual intercourse, resulting in genital herpes infection; however, prior oral HSV-1 infection substantially reduces the risk of acquiring genital HSV-1. In many high-income countries, improved hygiene and living conditions have reduced the prevalence of oral infections during childhood, contributing to an increasing trend in the sexual acquisition of HSV-1.

### Heterogeneous cutaneous findings associated with intrauterine HSV infection: A case series and literature review [^114EK79T]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection acquired in utero may present with non-vesicular dermatologic findings in affected newborns, posing a diagnostic dilemma. We aimed to describe and assess the range of non-vesiculobullous skin lesions that neonates with intrauterine HSV infection may manifest at birth.

- **Methods**: We collected a multicenter case series and conducted a literature review of neonates with intrauterine HSV infection presenting with non-vesiculobullous cutaneous lesions.

- **Results**: Twenty-two cases were reviewed, including six managed clinically by members of our team and 16 identified in the literature. Four (18%) were associated with twin pregnancies, and thirteen (59%) cases occurred in premature infants. Only four (18%) mothers had a documented history of HSV infection. Twelve (55%) cases resulted in poor outcomes, including long-term neurologic sequelae or death. Cutaneous manifestations included erosions, ulcerations, crusted papules or plaques, calcinosis cutis, excoriations, macules (erythematous, hypopigmented, or hyperpigmented), cutaneous atrophy, contractures, and bruising. About one-third of neonates developed new-onset vesicular lesions within a week of birth; in each of these cases, accurate diagnosis and therapy were delayed until the appearance of vesicles.

- **Conclusions**: The range of dermatologic findings associated with intrauterine HSV is extremely broad, and the various morphologies present at birth likely reflect different stages of the ongoing evolution of an HSV infection that began in utero. Clinicians should have an awareness of this variability to improve early diagnosis and care.

### Viral infections of the face [^113pBMta]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Viral infections affecting the face may cause significant morbidity, cosmetic disfigurement, and psychological distress. The success of therapy requires a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the clinical signs and symptoms. Some viruses, such as Papillomaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Polyomaviridae, primarily infect the facial skin. Others, like those from the parapox virus group, affect the face infrequently. Occasionally, facial involvement can be part of a more generalized eruption and systemic symptoms in viral infections caused by Todaviridae, Flaviviridae, Arenaviridae, and Flaviviridae.

Clinical diagnosis can be challenging in various viral diseases when they occur in nonendemic geographic areas. This review focuses on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of viral illnesses with facial skin involvement.

### Mucocutaneous ulcers in an immunocompromised patient [^113nCrsJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Cutaneous manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
	- B. Cutaneous cytomegalovirus (CMV)
	- C. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG)
	- D. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
	- E. Behçet's disease (BD)

- **Answers**:
	- A. SLE – Incorrect. Oral ulceration is common in SLE, especially during flaring. Cutaneous ulcerations are more likely associated with SLE vasculitis on the lower extremities. The pathology would show leukocytoclastic vasculitis, not the cytoplasmic inclusions seen in Fig 2.
	- B. CMV – Correct. Ulcers are the most common cutaneous manifestation of cutaneous CMV infection. Histopathology for cutaneous CMV shows neutrophilic vasculitis and enlarged endothelial cells with large basophilic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by a clear halo (Fig 2). This patient was susceptible to CMV infection due to chronic immunosuppression.
	- C. PG – Incorrect. Even though PG can develop in the setting of immunosuppression, the ulcers most commonly occur on the arms and legs, and the ulcers are usually ill-defined with gray overhanging borders, unlike this patient. PG is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and acute myelogenous leukemia.
	- D. HSV – Incorrect. Morphologically, HSV can present very similarly to CMV. CMV may have a deeper, more ragged border. However, the patient was polymerase chain reaction-positive for genital HSV on a prior inpatient admission and received acyclovir, but the ulcers remained. On pathology, cellular margination, molding, and multinucleation are more characteristic of HSV infections.
	- E. BD – Incorrect. Behçet's disease is generally characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, which differ from the presentation in this patient.

### Herpes simplex transmission to chest and face through autoinoculation in an infant [^115T7uin]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). High credibility.

A 4-month-old female infant presented with a vesicular lesion on her left hand present since 1 day. A few days prior to presentation, she had a similar lesion on the lower lip. Two days after presentation, she returned with new lesions on her thorax and upper eyelid. PCR of the vesicle was positive for herpes simplex virus type 1. The transmission to her chest and face probably resulted from autoinoculation, caused by rubbing of the hand on other parts of the body. Transmission of herpes simplex through skin-to-skin contact is a common route of infection in people engaging in contact sports. Antiviral therapy was started because of the extensiveness and expansion of lesions and risk of developing herpetic keratitis. The patient completely recovered. This case shows that in an otherwise healthy infant, multiple herpetic skin lesions were not due to disseminated infection, but through autoinoculation.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: Challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^111htcG8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

HSV is a linear double-stranded DNA virus that is classified as an α-member of the Herpesviridae family. Primary infection results after HSV spreads via direct contact with the mucous membrane of the host. In the case of ocular infections, the virus is transported following primary retrograde infection via sensory neurons to establish latency in the trigeminal ganglia; here, it remains asymptomatic until reactivation of the virus leads to secondary or recurrent infections. The host cell's DNA polymerase, located in the nucleus of the cell, is required for HSV to transcribe and replicate.

Herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) comprises three major subtypes: epithelial, stromal, and endothelial. Clinical findings in epithelial keratitis include geographic corneal ulcers with a dendritic tail or dendritic keratitis. This occurs after direct invasion by the virus and is the most common subtype. Stromal keratitis develops as a result of the immune response to the virus. The stromal subtype can be further divided into disciform keratitis, immune stromal keratitis, and necrotizing keratitis. Endothelial keratitis manifests as rejection line-like keratic precipitates and stromal edema. Variation in presentation between different subtypes has posed a challenge in accurately diagnosing this condition.

### Human herpes simplex labialis [^115c8XK2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Humans are the natural host for eight of more than 80 known herpes viruses. Infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are ubiquitous worldwide and highly transmissible. Herpes simplex labialis (HSL) is the best-recognized recrudescent infection of the lips and perioral tissues caused by HSV-1. Facial lesions of HSL may be unsightly, frequent outbreaks unpleasant, and the infection itself more severe locally and systemically in immunocompromised people. This article highlights the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic features and management issues for HSL.

### Clinical and laboratory features of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: A case-control study [^115AYAf4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can cause significant morbidity and mortality but can be difficult to identify, particularly in neonates without a vesicular rash.

- **Objective**: To determine the unique clinical and laboratory features of neonates with and without HSV infection admitted to Texas Children's Hospital during a 14-year period.

- **Methods**: An historic case-control study of all hospitalized neonates with laboratory-confirmed HSV infection and a restricted sample (ratio 1:4) of HSV test-negative hospitalized neonates. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical and laboratory factors associated with neonatal HSV infection.

- **Results**: Forty cases and 160 comparison subjects were identified. The following factors were associated with neonatal HSV infection by univariate analysis: maternal primary HSV infection, maternal fever, vaginal delivery, prematurity, postnatal HSV contact, vesicular rash, hypothermia, lethargy, seizures, severe respiratory distress, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, elevated hepatic enzymes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and proteinosis. Factors not associated with neonatal HSV infection were fever, total peripheral white blood cell count, and red blood cells in the CSF. For neonates presenting without a vesicular rash, maternal fever, respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, and CSF pleocytosis were independently associated with HSV infection.

- **Conclusions**: Inclusion of the newly appreciated features of maternal fever, respiratory distress, and thrombocytopenia might improve the identification of neonatal HSV infection.

### Characterizing the transitioning epidemiology of herpes simplex virus type 1 in the United States: Model-based predictions [^1116NF7Y]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent lifelong infection that appears to be undergoing an epidemiologic transition in the United States (US). Using an analytical approach, this study aimed to characterize HSV-1 transitioning epidemiology and estimate its epidemiologic indicators — past, present, and future.

- **Methods**: An age-structured mathematical model was developed to describe HSV-1 transmission through oral and sexual modes of transmission. The model was fitted to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, 1976–2016 data series.

- **Results**: HSV-1 seroprevalence was projected to decline from 61.5% in 1970 to 54.8% in 2018, 48.5% in 2050, and 42.0% in 2100. In individuals aged 0–19 years, seroprevalence was projected to be approximately 30%, while it remained around 60% in adults. Meanwhile, the number of new infections per year (oral and genital) was persistent at 2,762,000 in 1970, 2,941,000 in 2018, 2,933,000 in 2050, and 2,960,000 in 2100. Of this total, genital acquisitions contributed 252,000 infections in 1970, 410,000 in 2018, 478,000 in 2050, and 440,000 in 2100 — a quarter of which are symptomatic with clinical manifestations. For those aged 15–49 years, nearly 25% of incident infections are genital. Most genital acquisitions (> 85%) were due to oral-to-genital transmission through oral sex, as opposed to genital-to-genital transmission through sexual intercourse.

- **Conclusion**: HSV-1 epidemiology is undergoing a remarkable transition in the US, with less exposure in childhood and more in adulthood, and less oral but more genital acquisition.

### Viral infections in critical care: A narrative review [^117Mw76i]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1

Although many patients infected with HSV1 will be asymptomatic, primary HSV1 can present as gingivostomatitis or pharyngitis, and painful vesicular lesions may be observed. Of more relevance to ICU clinicians is HSV encephalitis, which may occur as both a primary infection (most commonly in children and young people) or following reactivation of latent infection. This is most reliably diagnosed by molecular testing of the cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis may be supported by neuro-imaging (MRI) with characteristic temporal horn involvement. Treatment is with the antiviral acyclovir, started upon clinical suspicion rather than delayed pending diagnostic confirmation to limit cerebral damage.

Herpes simplex virus 1 is commonly detected in the respiratory secretions of ventilated patients and is associated with severity of illness, duration of ventilation, and severity of critical illness-induced immunoparesis. In most cases, this is thought to reflect viral reactivation due to the loss of host-immune control of the virus, and it is rare to find convincing evidence of herpes pneumonitis (cytological evidence of viral cell inclusions; positive HSV viral cell culture; and pneumonitis without other explanation). The use of antiviral treatment in these patients is not generally recommended, and there is a lack of randomized trial evidence to support its use. However, in a retrospective study, patients with high viral load (> 10^5 HSV copies.ml^−1) detected by bronchoalveolar lavage sampling showed marked improvement with acyclovir compared with patients with low viral load.

### A report of three cases and review of intrauterine herpes simplex virus infection [^112q6zk2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Intrauterine herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is often omitted from descriptions of neonatal HSV disease. Previous characterizations of intrauterine HSV infection limit manifestations to the triad of cutaneous, central nervous system (CNS), and ophthalmologic findings. We report three cases of intrauterine HSV infection and provide a contemporary literature review of this disease.

- **Methods**: Cases published between 1963 and January 2009 were identified. Selected cases fit the clinical description of intrauterine HSV infection, had manifestations present at birth, and had virologic confirmation of infection.

- **Results**: This review yielded 64 cases, three of which were our own, of intrauterine HSV infection. Less than one-third fit the typical triad. Of the patients with cutaneous findings at birth, 24 (44%) had manifestations other than vesicles or bullae. Confirmation of HSV infection by culture of cutaneous lesions present at birth was delayed beyond 72 hours after birth in 15 patients and occurred at a median of 10 days of age. Nine of these patients had lesions at birth that were neither vesicles nor bullae, and 14 cases were confirmed by culture of new vesicles.

- **Conclusions**: More than two-thirds of reported cases do not present with the typical triad. Cutaneous findings are not limited to vesicles or bullae. A high index of suspicion and recognition of varied cutaneous manifestations is necessary to diagnose infants with intrauterine HSV infection.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^112TtTFx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has the potential for significant complications in immunocompromised hosts. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions for those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

### Is prophylactic acyclovir treatment warranted for prevention of herpes simplex virus infections in facial burns? A review of the literature [^113Dzfnq]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Both cosmetic facial resurfacing and facial burns cause an injury to the dermal layer of the skin. This injury renders the patient susceptible to primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or, more commonly, to HSV reactivation. This, in turn, can lead to bacterial superinfection, possibly resulting in scarring and systemic dissemination in the immunosuppressed burn patient. HSV reactivation rates have been reported to be up to 50% in cosmetic procedures without acyclovir prophylaxis and up to 25% in patients with burn injury.

Currently, acyclovir prophylaxis is a common practice in facial resurfacing, but no such recommendations have been issued for patients with burn injury. HSV usually presents in a febrile burn patient between the first and third postburn weeks as a cluster of small, umbilicated vesicles or vesicopustules on an erythematous base found within or around the margins of healing partial-thickness wounds. Diagnosis is confirmed through viral culture from the base of an unroofed vesicle, and treatment is begun with intravenous acyclovir.

Antiviral prophylaxis should be strongly considered for HSV infection prevention in patients with major burn injury, particularly with burns involving the face. Acyclovir is the primary drug of choice, and contact precautions should be practiced. High suspicion levels and alertness to this entity can help prompt diagnosis and timely treatment while alleviating late complications.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Spatial mapping of long-term recrudescent herpes simplex labialis [^111dFKhx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) infections, both primary and reactivation, have been repeatedly studied, but only for short periods of time. The long-term (years) natural history of recrudescent (clinically apparent) outbreaks of oral-labial HSV infection is not well characterized. We have found no report that describes the long-term (i.e. > 6 months), continuous natural history of labial HSV-1 clinical expression. This case study helps to fill that knowledge gap in that it records the frequency of HSV-1 outbreaks over a span of 38 years and the precise location of outbreaks over a span of 11 years.

### Life-threatening cutaneous viral diseases [^114s8aJH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Most viral infections present with a cutaneous eruption that, in the majority of cases, is self-healing. Only in rare instances is the eruption accompanied by constitutional symptoms, and even more rarely, irreversible damage may occur or death may ensue. As with other infectious diseases, prognosis depends on the status of immunologic surveillance.

Immunodepressed patients are, therefore, at the greatest risk. However, it has become more evident that even in immunocompetent patients, eruptions previously considered benign diseases may result in complications and even death. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction assays has enabled the attribution of conditions to specific viral infections, which was not possible in the past. Therefore, dermatologists may come across, directly or during consultation, patients presenting with skin lesions that may be related to a viral disease and could lead to severe systemic complications.

Dermatologists, however, may not be prepared for such developments. Thus, the goal of this article is to suggest some of the possibilities. Discussing all the viral diseases that may present with cutaneous manifestations would be cumbersome; thus, this article will focus on those diseases that may endanger the life of a patient seeking dermatologic advice and who does not initially appear to have severe systemic involvement.

### Congenital herpes simplex virus in the newborn: A diagnostic dilemma [^1151DcUF]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Although congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is rare, it is associated with severe morbidity. We report a 36-week gestational age infant who presented with atypical skin lesions, presumably mitigated by exposure to maternal antiviral suppressive therapy. The initial absence of typical herpetic vesicles and lack of viral detection in skin lesions delayed the correct diagnosis, highlighting the importance of differentiating HSV from other neonatal rashes.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^1129LaiG]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Varicella zoster, commonly referred to as chickenpox, is a respiratory infectious disease that causes a characteristic red rash and pox on the skin surface. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which also causes shingles, often referred to as herpes zoster. Chickenpox symptoms typically arise 1 to 3 weeks after exposure to an infected individual, and a newly infected individual is infectious for around a week, starting 1 to 2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptoms last approximately 2 weeks, after which the virus retreats to the nerve ganglia in the spine. By the age of 15, nearly all children have antibodies to VZV, whether from natural infection or vaccination. In 10 to 30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles, typically in adults aged over 60. The VZV vaccine prevents infection with VZV in children, while a booster dose, referred to as a shingles vaccine, later in life suppresses VZV reactivation in adults.

Cutaneous manifestations of congenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been classically described as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. We report two cases of HSV infection wherein both infants presented at birth with widespread erosions and an absence of vesicles or vesicopustules. The presence of skin lesions at birth, neurologic changes seen on radiographic imaging, and a cesarean section delivery in one case suggests intrauterine transmission in both neonates.

### Characteristics of herpes simplex virus infection and pathogenesis suggest a strategy for vaccine development [^112LJQK7]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the alpha subfamily of the human herpesvirus family and includes HSV1 and HSV2, which are responsible for pandemics of various herpes diseases. Both pathogens have similar structural characteristics and are of concern worldwide, not only because the clinical outcome of oral or genital ulcerative lesions has long‐lasting impacts on patient quality of life, but also because ocular herpes can lead to blindness, and neonatal herpes or encephalitis can result in higher death rates. In addition, the viruses show higher infection rates in various age groups. Although observations of epidemics in various areas have described different pandemics, infection rates of at least 30% to 60% for HSV1 and 10% to 25% for HSV2 have been recognized by most researchers, and approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported annually.

It is not surprising that a viral disease with such severe clinical outcomes and such a strong spreading trend has been targeted for prophylactic vaccine development. At the time of writing, more than 10 HSV prophylactic vaccines, mainly vaccines targeting HSV2, have been developed and evaluated in human clinical trials. These vaccines contain antigens that effectively stimulate immune responses and immune memory, as measured by the indicators of neutralizing antibody and specific cellular immune responses in animals or humans. These data suggest that the viral antigens selected and designed for vaccines are effective and that the host immune system is capable of recognizing HSV.

### Erythema multiforme [^116USwR5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), and less commonly other agents such as poxviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2, although some EM cases remain idiopathic. Epidemiological data on EM are scarce, with an estimated prevalence ranging between 0.01% and 1%. EM predominantly affects young adults with a female preponderance and has a worldwide distribution without any ethnic predilection. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by raised acral target lesions on the skin, sometimes involving mucous membranes, causing significant morbidity, impaired food intake, acute pain, hospitalization, and possible long-term sequelae. The treatment is mainly symptomatic, and the use of systemic corticosteroids remains debated.

The objective of this review is to detail a pragmatic approach to EM, focusing on the identification of triggers, red flags, and management, and providing a roadmap for future research. New concepts regarding nosology and severity will also be provided.

### Chronic pain and infection: Mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^1175tjH5]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus is prevalent globally, with most individuals infected by either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). Infection typically occurs through contact with mucosal surfaces or abraded skin. While acute symptoms may present, the majority of infected individuals remain asymptomatic. HSV-1 and HSV-2 engage sensory ganglia, establishing lifelong latency. Dormancy and reactivation cycles are frequent, especially at mucocutaneous sites, such as vesicular lesions at the vermilion border of the mouth or herpetic whitlow on the fingers of medical and dental professionals. These cycles are often preceded by prodromal symptoms like burning, itching, or pain.

Highly morbid painful neurological manifestations are possible. HSV-1 is linked with encephalitis and herpes keratitis, the latter presenting with ocular pain and ranking as a leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Due to its capability to establish latency in cranial ganglia, HSV-1 could also lead to Bell's palsy, which sometimes includes pain. Conversely, HSV-2 is associated with meningitis, ascending thoracic or lumbosacral myelitis, and lumbosacral radiculitis and might exacerbate these symptoms in patients with HIV. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are also implicated in central spontaneous pain through glial activation, although the incidence and mechanisms are not well-understood. Antiviral treatments can reduce symptom severity and duration, though they do not eliminate the virus.

Hepatitis C virus, belonging to the Flaviviridae family, infects approximately 190 million individuals globally. The virus replicates up to 10 trillion copies daily without…

### Hospital risk management of cutaneous herpes simplex virus infection [^115yqkma]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of cutaneous herpes simplex infection (CHSI) has dramatically changed over the past several decades. Valaciclovir is one of a new generation of antiviral medications that has expanded treatment options for the most common cutaneous manifestations of herpes simplex virus. However, the efficacy and safety of formulations with different doses of valaciclovir remain unclear.

- **Aim**: To carry out hospital risk management by ascertaining the incidence and risk of CHSI in patients during treatment with varying doses of valaciclovir.

- **Methods**: The PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched from database inception up to the time of writing. Efficacy of drug treatment was measured by average easement score (AES). Safety was characterized as the proportion of patients with drug adverse reactions (DARs) such as fever, dizziness, headache, anxiety, irritability, and yellowing of the skin. Outcomes for continuous and dichotomous data were estimated by standard mean difference (SMD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively.

- **Results**: Five randomized controlled trials involving 1753 randomized participants for efficacy assessment and 1874 randomized participants for safety assessment were identified. Valaciclovir dose increasing from 1000 mg/day improved AES only moderately but significantly promoted the incidence of DARs. Twice-daily treatment showed no increase in therapeutic effect but greatly increased DAR incidence. The valaciclovir dose that produced a reduction in AES was 1000 mg/day: SMD = -0.73 (95% CI -0.98 to 0.48; P < 0.05).

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: A natural history modelling study [^1179eUbN]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

The GUD estimates build on published WHO estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, meaning the issues and assumptions affecting the infection estimates, including data availability, generalizability, and quality, are carried forward to the GUD estimates. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection estimates were not produced separately by sex for all regions, meaning GUD estimates for HSV-1 may not fully capture differences by sex. However, the infection estimates were informed by systematic reviews up to August 2018 and represent the best attempt to quantify HSV-2 and genital HSV-1 prevalence and incidence globally by age and sex.

In some countries, such as the United States, an "epidemiological transition" has already occurred whereby rates of oral HSV-1 infection during childhood have declined, and rates of genital HSV-1 infection have increased due to decreased immunity to HSV-1 on entering adulthood, possibly combined with increasing rates of oral sex. In the most recent prospective evaluation of GUD among women with new HSV infection in North America, 62% of HSV GUD first episodes were caused by HSV-1. Our estimate for the Americas was similar, with 55% of first episodes due to HSV-1. Such trends may be occurring elsewhere in the world. Although the potential for genital HSV-1 infection post-childhood is uncertain, our analyses suggest that genital HSV-1 only makes a small contribution to all GUD globally, given the vastly greater number of HSV-2 recurrences.

Similarly, a third limitation concerns the availability, quality, and representativeness of natural history data. Studies differed on a number of factors, leading to variability in results.

### Detection of differences in genomic profiles between herpes simplex virus type 1 isolates sequentially separated from the saliva of the same individual [^1144Pby3]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is assumed to cause recrudescent lesions, usually through endogenous recurrence and rarely through exogenous re-infection. The occurrence of exogenous re-infection in genital and corneal HSV infections has been previously demonstrated using genomic analysis, while exogenous re-infection in oral-facial HSV infections has not been shown.

- **Objectives**: To confirm the occurrence of exogenous HSV re-infection in oral-facial HSV infections.

- **Study design**: Seven isolates (isolates 1–7) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were sequentially separated from the same individual. Genomic profiles of HSV-1 isolates were studied by analysis of 20 RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) and by the determination of nucleotide sequences of a PCR-amplified DNA fragment encompassing reiteration VII (a hypervariable region) that belongs to sequences containing short tandem repeats.

- **Results**: Isolates 1–5 were the same (F83 genotype) and isolates 6 and 7 were the same (F84 genotype), although isolates 1–5 were markedly different from isolates 6 and 7 in genomic profiles.

- **Conclusions**: The infection associated with isolates 6 and 7 was due to exogenous re-infection with F84 genotype virus, thus indicating the occurrence of exogenous HSV re-infection in oral-facial HSV infections.

### Cutaneous infections caused by herpesviridae: A review [^1157uvtW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The herpes family of viruses accounts for a significant proportion of human cutaneous disease. Although most episodes of viral infection can be diagnosed clinically, a small subset of these outbreaks will require biopsy for histologic interpretation and diagnosis. Most herpesviruses cause characteristic architectural and cytologic changes in the context of active infection, whereas the effects of some will not manifest until the future as malignant disease. Other infections may go unnoticed secondary to a lack of specific histologic findings. Because herpesviruses cause such a wide spectrum of cutaneous conditions, it is prudent that pathologists be aware of the varied clinical and histopathologic presentations so that these infections will not persist undiagnosed. Additionally, methods of virus detection will be briefly reviewed.

### Thymidine kinase sequence analysis of herpes simplex virus type 1 strains present in different compartments in an atypical impetiginous rash on the lesional skin of a burn patient [^112jc6Fj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 23-year-old male burn patient with an unusual herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin manifestation. The clinical symptoms and results of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) UL23 polymorphism analysis from saliva and lesional skin underscore the need for performing molecular analysis of HSV-1 infections in burned patients presenting unusual skin lesions.

### Tularemia with vesicular skin lesions may be mistaken for infection with herpes viruses [^111cu3y8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The original reports of human infection with Francisella tularensis noted vesicular skin rash as a manifestation. We present two cases of tularemia initially diagnosed as herpes simplex or varicella zoster infection. Clinicians must recognize the cutaneous manifestations of tularemia and be able to distinguish these from lesions seen with herpes viruses.

### Erythema multiforme [^1161bAv9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ninety percent of erythema multiforme (EM) cases reported in the medical literature are triggered by infections, with the most common being herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV1 is more frequently associated with EM than HSV2. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is the second most commonly associated infection after HSV. Currently, the World Health Organization has declared clusters of respiratory illness in children in northern China and worldwide, partly due to MP and COVID-19. These clusters need to be followed closely as they might be associated with increasing incidences of EM.

SARS-CoV-2 has been recently linked to EM. The reported patients classically developed EM lesions after experiencing classic COVID-19 symptoms. Most patients had only skin involvement with minimally symptomatic mucosal involvement. EM was not associated with a worse outcome of the disease. Medical literature has linked other infectious agents to the development of EM.

Vaccinations were also reported as EM triggers. These include pneumococcal vaccinations, measles-rubella, smallpox, rabies, HPV, rotavirus, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, meningitis, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B. All available COVID-19 vaccines were associated with EM. The range of disease onset after vaccination was 3 days to 2 weeks, and the clinical pattern resembled the one following COVID-19 infection.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^1117LNtj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old man presented with multiple, bilaterally symmetrical, erythematous papular-vesicular lesions distributed over his neck, anterior trunk, posterior trunk, and upper arms (Figures 1 and 2). The face, mucosa, and lower limbs were spared. The skin lesions were mildly pruritic and appeared 4 days after the onset of fever, cough, and malaise. He had a history of varicella in childhood. His complete blood count, liver and kidney parameters, and C-reactive protein were within normal limits. IgM antibodies were negative for varicella infection. A Tzanck smear, carried out from a vesicle, showed many acantholytic cells with lymphocytes. Giant cells suggestive of herpes simplex virus infections were not found (Figure 3). The SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab showed COVID-19 positivity. A diagnosis of varicella-like exanthem secondary to COVID-19 was made. The patient was advised home isolation and managed conservatively. The patient's skin and systemic symptoms subsided within 1 week.

- **Figure 1**: Multiple erythematous papular-vesicular lesions over the neck, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk.
- **Figure 2**: A close-up view of the rash.
- **Figure 3**: Tzanck smear of a vesicle showed many acantholytic cells and a lymphocyte.

The vesicular lesions in COVID-19 are uncommon, typically seen in middle-aged patients and associated with intermediately severe disease. The prevalence of vesicular rash ranges from 3.77% to 15% in this disease. The cytokine storm secondary…

### Diffuse skin-colored papules in a child [^113wCTh5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What group of viruses is implicated in this skin disease?
	- A. Human papillomavirus
	- B. Coxsackievirus
	- C. Poxviridae
	- D. Herpes viruses
	- E. Polyomaviridae

- **Answers**:
	- A. Human papillomavirus – Correct. Beta human papillomaviruses are a group of DNA viruses implicated in the production of various warts on the skin. Specifically, more than 20 different strains of HPV have been implicated in EV. Some strains of HPV, namely HPV-5, -8, and -14, are associated with higher oncogenic potential of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with EV. Skin lesions are thought to develop as a result of the cumulative cocarcinogenic effects of genetics, HPV, and ultraviolet radiation. Malignancy is usually observed approximately 20–30 years after the formation of benign lesions. The patient in this case was investigated for low-risk and high-risk HPV strains using an in situ hybridization assay. The results of these investigations were negative, and the patient was most likely infected with an alternative HPV strain that has been associated with EV.
		- **Low-risk HPV strains**: 6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, 69, 70, 71, E6/E7
		- **High-risk HPV strains**: 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 83, E6/E7
	- B. Coxsackievirus – Incorrect. Coxsackieviruses are associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Typical cutaneous lesions include red vesicular macules, papules, and blisters on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands, and ulcerative oral lesions.
	- C. Poxviridae – Incorrect. Poxviridae are associated with molluscum contagiosum (i.e. molluscum contagiosum virus). Typical cutaneous lesions include clusters of indur.

### Herpes simplex virus-specific immune responses in subjects with frequent and infrequent orofacial recrudescences [^112yeXYC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Following the primary infection of the orofacial region with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, the virus remains latent in the ganglia for the lifetime of the host but can reactivate at intervals and cause recrudescent lesions. The frequency of these episodes varies considerably from one individual to another.

- **Objectives**: To compare immune responses in two groups of subjects: those with frequent orofacial lesions, defined as 10 or more per year (n = 12), and those with infrequent lesions, defined as three or fewer per year (n = 20).

- **Methods**: Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from each individual for the series of immunological tests listed in the following results section.

- **Results**: Although IgG titres specific for HSV, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were not different between the two groups, there was a significantly higher HSV-specific IgE titre in the frequent group. The percentages of CD3-, CD4- and CD8-positive cells in peripheral blood, assessed by flow cytometry, and the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to the non-specific mitogen concanavalin A, did not differ between the two groups. T-cell responses to HSV were assessed by in vitro lymphoproliferation with tritiated thymidine incorporation and subsequent calculation of the stimulation index; cytokine production [interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10] into the culture supernatant as a result of the stimulation was measured by ELISAs. The mean ± SEM stimulation index was 4.1 ± 0.2 in the subjects with frequent lesions and 11.8 ± 3.1.

### Diagnosis of herpes simplex virus-induced erythema multiforme confounded by previous infection with Mycoplasma pneumonia [^111DTv1U]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction often related to viral infections or medications. Infection-induced EM is typically self-limited and is commonly caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP); recurrent EM is almost always associated with HSV. We present a concise overview of diagnostic techniques for HSV and MP, as repeatedly elevated MP titers in our case led to a delayed diagnosis of HSV-induced EM.

### A case of Ramsay Hunt-like syndrome caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 [^114no6yA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We report an immunocompetent patient with auricular and facial vesicles associated with painful paresthesias and facial paralysis, consistent with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, due to herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2. Clinical and laboratory-proven acyclovir resistance developed during therapy. Immunologic assays revealed normal reactivity to HSV-2.

### Famciclovir [^112gsVBK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Famciclovir is a prescription antiviral medicine used in adults with a normal immune system to treat outbreaks of cold sores, genital herpes, and shingles (herpes zoster). It also decreases the number of genital herpes outbreaks. In adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is used to treat outbreaks of herpes in or around the mouth, genitals, or anal area.

- **Lack of information on safety and effectiveness**:
	- It is not known if famciclovir is safe and effective for the first outbreak of genital herpes.
	- Its effectiveness in treating shingles in the eye(s) or for people with weakened immune systems, other than for the treatment of herpes in people with HIV, is also unknown.
	- Safety and effectiveness in black and African American people with genital herpes outbreaks have not been established.
	- The effectiveness of famciclovir in children is not known.

- **Allergy warning**: Do not take famciclovir if you are allergic to any of its ingredients or to Denavir® (penciclovir cream). See the end of this patient information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in famciclovir tablets.

- **Medical conditions disclosure**: Before taking famciclovir, inform your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

### Characterization of herpes simplex virus infections seen in the pediatric dermatology office [^111f5fdL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atypical and severe clinical manifestations of primary and recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections may present to a pediatric dermatologist for evaluation. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical features of the population diagnosed with HSV referred to a pediatric dermatology office.

- **Methods**: This retrospective case series examined patients diagnosed with HSV in a pediatric dermatology practice at an academic medical center from 2005 to 2015. Characteristics of the population were collected and analyzed.

- **Results**: In this study of 48 children diagnosed with HSV, 33% presented at age 2 years or younger, with approximately half having exhibited initial symptoms before 2 years of age; 39.6% of the population had six or more outbreaks per year. The outbreaks were equally divided between unifocal and multifocal presentations, with 60% of children without any labial or mucosal involvement. Suppressive treatment was initiated in 33% of patients; the average age at initiation was 6 years.

- **Conclusion**: Our data characterize a subset of immunocompetent young children who present to pediatric dermatologists with frequent HSV outbreaks that are often multifocal and involve cutaneous sites, with or without mucosal involvement.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are often tasked with diagnosing a variety of skin conditions across diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis relies on the identification of primary lesions, using morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. Moreover, the distribution and grouping of lesions help support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, through clinical experience, use pattern recognition — consciously or unconsciously — to develop their differential diagnosis after having previously observed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are commonly encountered in clinical dermatology practice. This study reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and offers an approach to diagnosis.

### Eczema herpeticum in pregnancy and neonatal herpes infection [^112QQ7Q6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Eczema herpeticum is caused by herpes simplex infection of atopic dermatitis. The infection typically causes a vesiculopustular rash but can disseminate and be life-threatening.

- **Case**: A primigravida with a history of eczema and hypogammaglobulinemia presented at 28 weeks of gestation with preterm labor, fever, and extensive rash. After failed tocolysis, she delivered vaginally. Prompt treatment with parenteral acyclovir was initiated for both patients based on a clinical diagnosis of maternal eczema herpeticum. Cultures confirmed the diagnosis of eczema herpeticum, and a rectal swab of the infant was positive for herpes simplex virus. The mother and infant did well.

- **Conclusion**: Early diagnosis and treatment of eczema herpeticum are necessary to prevent poor outcomes in pregnancy. Prophylactic acyclovir may help prevent eczema herpeticum in pregnancy.
