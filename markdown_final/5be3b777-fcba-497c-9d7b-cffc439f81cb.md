## Question

Is leflunomide an appropriate treatment for a deep neck space infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether leflunomide is an appropriate treatment for a deep neck space infection and how to manage leflunomide if a patient with rheumatoid arthritis presents with a DNSI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard-of-care for DNSIs and their urgency. Then, I should verify leflunomide's mechanism, labeled uses, and infection-related safety warnings. Next, I will check whether any guideline or trial supports leflunomide as therapy for DNSIs. After that, I need to consider the impact of immunosuppression on DNSI outcomes and what to do if the patient is already on leflunomide. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-backed recommendation and confirm there are no confounding mimics on imaging that could alter management.

> Let me first confirm the nature and urgency of DNSIs, because I need to ensure we are not underestimating the risk; deep neck infections spread along fascial planes, can progress rapidly, and require prompt airway assessment, imaging to define extent, and timely source control and antibiotics to prevent mediastinitis, sepsis, or death [^114yLHCg] [^113CfNew] [^115psjnn] [^115w2pAU].

> I should double-check the common sources and pathogens so that the therapeutic frame is clear; odontogenic infections are the leading etiology in adults, and microbiology is typically polymicrobial with streptococci, staphylococci including MRSA, and anaerobes, which is why initial IV therapy targets these organisms pending cultures, with MRSA coverage in high-risk settings [^116VgZWR] [^115w2pAU] [^112PzAt3].

> Now, I need to verify exactly what leflunomide does; leflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, suppressing de novo pyrimidine synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation, and it is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis and certain off-label autoimmune conditions, but it has no intrinsic antibacterial activity and carries warnings about serious infections and sepsis, warranting extreme caution or avoidance during active infection [^1159ucuZ] [^116Crjms].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without examining host factors; immunosuppression is a known risk factor for developing complicated DNSIs and worse outcomes, and both epidemiologic data in RA and case experience with biologics highlight an increased propensity for serious head and neck infections in immunomodulated patients, which means adding further immunosuppression during an active DNSI could plausibly worsen the course [^112H1VzX] [^115aYtLs] [^1176ZR3d].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline or trial supports leflunomide as therapy for DNSIs; IDSA-aligned management centers on prompt surgical drainage when an abscess is present and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics with MRSA coverage as indicated, and I find no evidence supporting immunosuppressants like leflunomide for treatment of acute bacterial DNSIs; in fact, there are case reports of severe sepsis and deep-space abscesses occurring in patients receiving leflunomide, underscoring potential harm rather than benefit in this context [^112PzAt3] [^115w2pAU] [^115B5X3F].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should ensure we are not conflating DNSIs with sterile inflammatory mimics; calcific tendinitis of the longus colli can mimic retropharyngeal infection on imaging, and in that specific mimic NSAIDs — not antibiotics or surgery — are appropriate, but that is distinct from a true DNSI where source control and antibiotics are required, so I need to rely on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI features to avoid misclassification before finalizing therapy [^1121UsvH] [^113CfNew].

> I will now examine the practical question of what to do if the patient is already taking leflunomide at DNSI presentation; given the FDA warnings about serious infections and the drug's long half-life via its active metabolite, the prudent, common practice is to hold leflunomide during the acute infection and only reconsider it after full clinical resolution in coordination with rheumatology, while recognizing that immunosuppressive effects may persist for weeks [^115B5X3F].

> Next, I should review immediate management priorities to ensure nothing is missed; secure the airway early when threatened, obtain urgent contrast-enhanced imaging to define drainable collections, initiate empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics with MRSA coverage where appropriate, and proceed to surgical drainage for abscess source control, especially for odontogenic or multispace disease, with culture-directed adjustments thereafter [^115psjnn] [^113CfNew] [^112PzAt3] [^115w2pAU] [^116VgZWR].

> Let me synthesize and state the answer clearly, while sanity-checking for contradictions; leflunomide is not an appropriate treatment for deep neck space infection because it is an immunosuppressive DMARD without antimicrobial activity and with infection warnings, and in patients who develop a DNSI while on leflunomide, it should be held during the acute episode while standard care focuses on airway, imaging, surgical source control, and targeted IV antibiotics, with reinitiation considered only after recovery [^112PzAt3] [^115B5X3F].

---

No, leflunomide is **not indicated** for deep neck space infections (DNSIs) because it is an immunosuppressive DMARD without antibacterial activity [^116Crjms] [^115B5X3F]. DNSIs require **prompt antibiotics and surgical drainage** to prevent life-threatening complications [^114yLHCg] [^115w2pAU]. Leflunomide use in DNSIs could worsen outcomes by increasing infection risk and delaying healing [^115B5X3F]; it is contraindicated in severe infections and should be discontinued if a serious infection occurs. Management should follow standard care with broad-spectrum antibiotics, surgical drainage, and close monitoring [^112H1VzX].

---

## Pharmacological properties of leflunomide

Leflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thereby reducing pyrimidine synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation; it is used for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis [^115B5X3F] [^116Crjms]. It has **no direct antibacterial activity** and is not indicated for bacterial infections [^116Crjms].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for DNSI management

DNSIs are serious infections that can rapidly progress to airway compromise, mediastinitis, sepsis, and death; **prompt diagnosis and treatment** are essential [^114yLHCg] [^111wKFKN]. Standard management includes:

- **Broad-spectrum antibiotics**: Empiric coverage for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including MRSA and Gram-negative organisms [^113ymE1U] [^112PzAt3].

- **Surgical drainage**: Early drainage of abscesses or collections to prevent complications [^115w2pAU] [^116VgZWR].

- **Airway management**: Secure the airway when compromise is imminent [^115psjnn].

- **Imaging**: CT or MRI to define extent and guide intervention [^113CfNew] [^1143BQbL].

No evidence or guideline supports the use of **leflunomide for DNSIs** [^116Crjms].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of leflunomide in DNSIs

Leflunomide's immunosuppression can **increase the risk and severity of infection**, including opportunistic and serious infections [^114oYP5T] [^1176ZR3d]. In DNSIs, this may lead to:

- **Increased infection severity**: Higher risk of progression and complications [^115FuksP].

- **Delayed healing**: Impaired immune response and tissue repair.

- **Serious adverse effects**: Hepatotoxicity, hematologic abnormalities, and severe skin reactions [^1168uL1k] [^114oYP5T].

Given these risks, leflunomide is **contraindicated in severe infections** and should be discontinued if a serious infection occurs.

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

There is **no clinical evidence** that leflunomide improves DNSI outcomes; its immunosuppressive effects may worsen infections, increase complications, and delay recovery [^116Crjms].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

For **effective DNSI management**, care includes:

- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum agents tailored to culture results [^116VgZWR].

- **Surgical drainage**: Early intervention to prevent complications [^115w2pAU].

- **Supportive care**: Airway management, analgesia, and close monitoring [^114yLHCg].

Immunosuppressive agents like leflunomide are **not recommended** [^116Crjms].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Leflunomide is **not indicated** for DNSIs because it lacks antibacterial activity and carries immunosuppressive risks [^116Crjms] [^114oYP5T]. Management should rely on antibiotics, surgical drainage, and supportive care; leflunomide should be avoided in severe infections.

### MRI of acute neck infections: evidence summary and pictorial review [^114yLHCg]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections are associated with a high complication rate and significant mortality. Aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage of abscesses is usually required. The exact origin, location, and extent of infection may be difficult to define accurately on clinical examination. Therefore, medical imaging has a significant role in diagnosing and treating these patients. The main roles of imaging are to confirm the diagnosis, provide relevant differential diagnoses, demonstrate the presence, location, and extent of surgically drainable abscesses, and reveal the origin of the infection.

Emergency neck imaging has traditionally been performed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). However, limited soft tissue contrast, uncertainty in separating purulent from non-purulent fluid collections, and artifacts from bone and dental implants may compromise accurate delineation of neck disease. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be a feasible, accurate, and reliable first-line imaging method in deep neck infections, as it offers excellent soft tissue discrimination and does not involve ionizing radiation.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to provide a comprehensive array of MRI studies of the most commonly encountered deep neck space infections. We will review patient selection, MRI sequences and protocoling, pertinent normal radiological anatomy, typical edema patterns, and imaging patterns of various types of abscesses with important caveats. After reading this review, radiologists should be able to…

The objective of this study was to review our experience with deep neck abscesses and identify unique trends in our patient population.

- **Study design**: Case series with chart review.

- **Subjects and methods**: Patients with deep neck space abscesses between 2001 and 2006 were evaluated. Peritonsillar abscess, superficial craniocervical infection, and salivary gland infections were excluded from the study population. A total of 106 cases were reviewed.

- **Results**: Dental infections were identified as the most common cause of deep neck abscesses (49.1%). Comorbidities included substance abuse (53.7%), psychiatric illness (10.4%), hypertension (9.4%), head and neck cancer (6.6%), and diabetes mellitus (5.7%). All patients received systemic antibiotics, eight required tracheotomy, 85 underwent surgical drainage in the operating room, and 11 had bedside drainage. The median hospital stay was two days, with the lower quartile at three days and the upper quartile at four days (range, 1 to 27 days). Patients with comorbidities or concurrent illness tended to stay longer (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). There were six complications and no mortality.

- **Conclusion**: Substance abuse and poor orodental hygiene are significant predisposing factors to deep neck abscesses. Effective management continues to favor a combination of early surgical drainage and systemic antibiotics.

### Retropharyngeal abscess in the setting of immune modulation for rheumatoid arthritis [^1176ZR3d]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Participants should, by the conclusion of this presentation, be familiar with the management of serious head and neck infections occurring in patients using biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Present a case**: The case involves a 62-year-old woman with a retropharyngeal abscess. Her medical history was significant for rheumatoid arthritis treated with abatacept, a T-cell immune modulator. She presented with progressive odynophagia and neck pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a large retropharyngeal abscess extending to the superior mediastinum with bilateral pleural effusions. Transcervical incision and drainage were performed, and infectious disease consultation was obtained. Full recovery was achieved following a month-long course of intravenous antibiotics.

- **Review of literature**: The literature on the relationship between biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis and head and neck infections was examined.

Biologic agents that achieve selective immune modulation have revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is a small but significant risk of serious infection that accompanies these drugs. Otolaryngologists should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of serious head and neck infections in patients who are on biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis.

### A case of severe staphylococcal septicaemia: Septic arthritis and a mediastinal abscess following leflunamide therapy for rheumatoid arthritis [^1159ucuZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

This highly unusual case illustrates how a potentially life-threatening complication may develop insidiously in the context of immunosuppression. A 46-year-old woman presented with increasing malaise and a marked inflammatory response due to immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Based on microbiological findings, the patient was treated for systemic staphylococcal infection with a prolonged antibiotic course.

- **Treatment and procedures**: Incision and drainage procedures were performed on associated, non-resolving abscesses at various sites. One particular lesion in the breast was slow to heal and monitored via ultrasound imaging. Cross-sectional imaging later revealed that it was a large mediastinal abscess, eroding the manubrium and lying in close proximity to the aorta.

The patient was eventually referred to a cardiothoracic unit for complete evacuation of this lesion. Following a prolonged illness and treatment period, the patient recovered well and successfully resumed employment.

### MRI of acute neck infections: Evidence summary and pictorial review [^1121UsvH]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscle is an inflammatory reaction to calcification in the tendon of the longus colli muscle. Signs and symptoms include neck pain, stiffness, fever, and dysphagia, which can simulate those of a deep neck infection. On MRI, the longus colli prevertebral muscles and surrounding soft tissues are edematous, and patients have thick RPE, mostly in the cranial part of the retropharyngeal space (Fig. 36). Amorphous calcifications within the longus colli muscle tendons may be more easily detected on CT. Detecting the hypointense calcification and thereby differentiating calcific tendinitis from deep neck infection and abscess formation is critical because the former can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs without any antibiotics or surgery.

Axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted (a) and sagittal T2-weighted (b) images show massive swelling of the longus colli muscles and retropharyngeal tissues (arrows). A sagittal non-contrast CT (c) shows a pathognomonic finding of amorphous calcifications of the longus colli muscle (arrows).

Some patients with cervical tenderness and pain present with unclassified vascular and perivascular changes on imaging at the level of the carotid bifurcation, previously reported as carotidynia. More recently, this specific entity of idiopathic carotid inflammation has been introduced as TIPIC syndrome (transient perivascular inflammation of the carotid artery). Ultrasound appears.

### Clinical trial design and dissemination: Comprehensive analysis of clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed data since 2005 [^1154a4xC]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Of 27,835 phase II-IV studies, 10,554 (37.9%) disclosed the results through structured submission to clinicaltrials.gov, 8,338 (29.95%) through a journal article, and 3,808 (13.7%) through both resources. Scientific articles were published in 1,454 titles of diverse nature and varying impact factors. These ranged from prestigious general medical journals (BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine) to narrower focus, specialist journals with no impact information available.

Journal publication status depended on study design. Trials reporting the use of randomization were more likely to be published than non-randomized studies (35.0% (6,895/19,711) vs. 18.2% (1,408/7,748)), and large trials enrolling more than 100 participants were more likely to be published than studies with less than 100 participants (39.3% (5,541/14,106) vs. 20.5% (2,753/13,422)).

In general, studies whose results were disclosed in the form of a scientific publication were more likely to follow the ideal randomized clinical trial design paradigms than were those whose results were submitted through other means.

### Mycophenolate mofetil and leflunomide: Promising compounds for the treatment of skin diseases [^114AZN9z]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

In the past decade, there has been enormous progress in the understanding of the pathomechanisms of immune-mediated diseases, leading to major advances in immunotherapeutic strategies. As a consequence, the armamentarium of specific and nonspecific immune-modulating and immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of skin diseases has been widely extended. Among the nonspecific immunomodulators, mycophenolate mofetil and leflunomide show promising effects in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory skin disorders. Both compounds inhibit a key enzyme in nucleotide biosynthesis, a step that is pivotal for the production of cytotoxic T cells and antibody formation. They do not act in the nucleus, which may explain their advantageous side-effect profile.

### Challenging airways in deep neck space infections [^115psjnn]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Skilful airway management is critical in deep neck space infections. Although relatively uncommon, this spectrum of disease presents a clinical challenge for otolaryngologists and anesthetists. There is currently no universal agreement on the ideal method of airway control for these patients because this depends on various factors, including available local expertise and equipment. We review the literature and discuss the available options for airway management in these head and neck emergencies. Special consideration is given to awake fiberoptic intubation and tracheotomy under local anesthesia. Relevant anatomy, routes of spread, and microbiology of deep neck space infections are also briefly discussed.

### Leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis: Recommendations through a process of consensus [^115eeAgy]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine, by consensus, the optimal use of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a multidisciplinary panel of experts conducted meta-analyses of available data.

A multidisciplinary panel of experts in RA was convened. Important questions regarding the use of leflunomide in the treatment of RA were defined by consensus at an initial meeting. Each question was allocated to subgroups of two or three members, who worked separately to prepare a balanced opinion based on published literature, data from individual patients participating in phase II and phase III clinical trials provided by Aventis, and data from a USA-based medical claims database (AETNA). The full group then reconvened to agree on an overall consensus statement. Recommendations concerning efficacy and tolerability versus comparator drugs and placebo were derived from two new meta-analyses.

Leflunomide was found to be at least as effective as sulphasalazine and methotrexate and equally well tolerated on meta-analysis of trial data. Overall withdrawal rates for all adverse events were similar for all three drugs. Avoiding the loading dose reduces 'nuisance' side effects (e.g. nausea) but probably delays the onset of action. Adverse events could usually be managed by dose reduction and/or symptomatic therapy.

On the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost, leflunomide should be considered in patients with RA who have failed first-line DMARD drug therapy. In refractory cases, leflunomide may be used in combination with, for example, methotrexate before biological treatments.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and National Early Warning Score [^117CabjT]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

This case is illustrative of how patients can present with severe, localized deep neck space infections, but with little evidence of physiological compromise even at a late stage. We hope that this will be instructive to individuals working in primary care or emergency medicine settings, and we identify a short list of 'red flag' symptoms that should prompt triage to a severe category and urgent referral to the appropriate specialty.

The NEWS algorithm was introduced in 2012 to allow prompt recognition of acutely unwell patients, with particular emphasis on the recognition of patients with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), a common and life-threatening complication of aggressive or inadequately treated infective processes. NEWS is now a standard tool within UK healthcare. However, in deep space infections of the head and neck, the close proximity of vital anatomical structures, in particular the larynx, means that local compressive and inflammatory effects of the disease can cause airway loss rapidly, before signs of SIRS become evident.

We propose, therefore, a simple addition to the evaluation of patients who present with any history of potential infection in the head and neck region. Primary care, emergency medicine, or nursing staff with a triage role should specifically seek and document evidence of the 'red flag' signs and symptoms demonstrated in box 1. If any of these are present, patients should be escalated to an area where close observation is possible and the appropriate specialty informed as a matter of urgency. Within the UK, this is usually the protocol followed.

### Deep neck space infections: A retrospective review of 173 cases [^116VgZWR]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to review our recent experience with deep neck infections and emphasize the importance of radiologic evaluation and appropriate treatment selection in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: The records of 173 patients treated for deep neck infection at the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of Dicle University Hospital from 2003 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Their demographics, symptoms, etiology, seasonal distribution, bacteriology, radiology, site of deep neck infection, durations of hospital admission and stay, treatment, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. The findings were compared to those in the available literature.

- **Results**: Dental infection was the most common cause of deep neck infections (48.6%). Peritonsillar infections (19.7%) and tuberculosis (6.9%) were also common causes. Pain, odynophagia, dysphagia, and fever were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Radiologic evaluation was performed on almost all patients (98.3%) to identify the location, extent, and character (cellulitis or abscesses) of the infections. Computed tomography was performed in 85.3% of patients. The submandibular space was the most commonly involved site (26.1%), and in 29.5% of cases, the infection involved more than one space. All patients received intravenous antibiotic therapy. Surgical intervention was required in 95 patients (59.5%), whereas 78 patients (40.5%) were treated with intravenous antibiotics alone. Life-threatening complications developed.

### Fulminating deep tissue space infection with presenting initially as a sore throat [^116gNqSw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Management of sore throat requires robust decision-making to successfully balance the conflicting risks of unnecessary antibiotic use against those of untreated bacterial infection. We present a case of fulminant sepsis caused by Streptococcus constellatus, presenting initially as a sore throat and managed conservatively. Despite subsequent appropriate antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage, contiguous spread ultimately involved the deep neck spaces, mediastinum, and thoracic wall, and was complicated by severe aspiration pneumonia, pharyngocutaneous, and bronchopleural fistulation. The complexity and widespread extent of the infected spaces, in conjunction with the catabolic response to sepsis, created a life-threatening situation. Surgical closure of the pharyngeal defect, using a pectoralis-major pedicle flap, was successfully undertaken to ensure source control of the infection and heralded a complete recovery. We describe our management of this case, discuss the approach to the management of patients presenting with a sore throat, and review the literature on S. constellatus infections.

### Use of combination of leflunomide with biological agents in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^111ud3h5]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

An Expert Panel Meeting was held in May 2004 to assess experience with combination therapy with leflunomide and biological agents in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), to identify both the optimal use of such combinations and precautions for use. Eleven published prospective or retrospective studies were reviewed, principally evaluating the combination of leflunomide with infliximab, as well as patient registry data. Available data suggest that combination therapies are more efficacious than monotherapies, reflecting the complementarity of mechanisms of action.

Information on side effects remains contradictory, and tolerability of these combinations may vary between different patient groups. In some studies, tolerability is equivalent to that seen with monotherapy; in others, a high rate of adverse events has led to frequent treatment discontinuation. Dermatological reactions may be a specific side effect of these combination therapies.

- **Combination therapy justification**: Combination therapy is considered justified for treatment of patients diagnosed early who are at risk for rapid progression and for patients who fail to respond to monotherapy. The majority of participants favored adding biological agents to a previously established leflunomide monotherapy rather than starting both treatments simultaneously.

- **Caution with combination therapy**: On the other hand, combination therapy should be considered with caution in patients with a history of treatment failure, with hepatic comorbidity, or with other autoimmune diseases, and in immunocompromised patients.

When considering the initiation of combination therapy, it is important to provide full information.

### A pain in the neck — imaging in neck sepsis [^1143BQbL]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Deep neck infection has a high morbidity and mortality, and the extent of infection is often difficult to estimate clinically. The complex anatomy and the communication between neck spaces mean that infection can spread along fascial planes, leading to life-threatening complications such as airway compromise, vascular erosion/thrombosis, neural dysfunction, and ultimately descending necrotizing mediastinitis. Imaging plays an important role in identifying the extent of infection and the presence of complications.

### Is conservative treatment of deep neck space infections appropriate [^111wKFKN]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

A 31-patient prospective series on deep neck infections was managed at Hospital Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, Spain.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was conducted from January 1994 to December 1997, including all parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal infections. Clinical and radiologic findings and length of hospital stay were registered. Medical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was instituted, and surgery was reserved for those patients not responding to medical treatment.

- **Results**: Twenty-four patients (77.42%) had parapharyngeal, 3 (9.68%) retropharyngeal, and 4 (12.90%) mixed infections. Based on clinical and CT findings, 19 cases (61.29%) were considered abscesses and 12 (38.71%) cellulitis. Medical treatment was successful in all but 3 cases (90.32%), with no major complications. All patients were discharged from the hospital within 20 days after admission (mean, 8.09 days).

- **Conclusions**: Despite the wide use of antibiotics, deep neck space infections are commonly seen. Although most reports are based on surgical treatment followed by antibiotics, medical treatment could be as successful as open surgical drainage in most cases.

### Severe deep neck space infection caused by [^114Atmt6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman was acutely referred to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery at Aalborg University Hospital due to rapidly progressing neck swelling, fever, and dysphagia. Clinical examination revealed submental swelling, trismus, and laryngeal inflammation. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed infection in the deep neck spaces with multiple abscesses. The patient underwent acute surgery, and antimicrobial therapy was initiated. She was transferred to an intensive care unit. Three additional surgical procedures were needed before sufficient drainage was achieved. There was growth of different oral commensals from four separate pus aspirates, while Eggerthia catenaformis was cultured in all samples. Due to the extent of the infection, the patient stayed in the intensive care unit for 16 days but recovered completely due to adequate surgery and antimicrobial therapy for four weeks. Here we present the third reported case of a severe deep neck space infection with multiple abscesses due to E. catenaformis.

### Deep neck space infections: Changing trends in pediatric versus adult patients [^115QjR11]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

We studied the clinical presentation and microbiology of patients with deep neck space infection in a developing nation to aid in determining the relevant, appropriate, and effective empirical antimicrobial treatment. We have also described the demographic data of pediatric versus adult patients and the predominant age-related subtypes of deep neck space infections.

A retrospective review of the data from patients with deep neck space infections during a 5.5-year period was conducted at the academic teaching hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. The diagnosis of deep neck space infection was determined from clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. All the patients had undergone abscess drainage via needle aspiration or surgical drainage using a sterile technique. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were performed. The results were recorded, and statistical analysis was performed.

A total of 107 children and 52 adults with deep neck space infections were included in the present study, with 121 and 70 pus specimens retrieved. The male/female ratio was 1.14:1 for the pediatric group (57 boys [53%] and 50 girls [47%]). The adult group included 33 men (63%) and 19 women (37%). The male/female ratio for the adult group was 1.74:1. In the pediatric group, the mean age was 5.8 years (range, 2 months to 15 years). The age distribution was subcategorized into younger than 2, 2 to 10, and older than 10 years. Of the 107 children, 51 were younger than 2, 50 were aged 2 to 10, and 6 were older than 10.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and National Early Warning Score [^116QiYNy]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Infections of the deep spaces of the neck are potentially life-threatening and require urgent specialist intervention. Prompt recognition of deep neck space infections is mandatory; delay in treatment increases the risk of disease progression, including airway loss and mortality.

Deep neck space infections are a common and life-threatening presentation to emergency departments (EDs) worldwide. They can arise from localized infections of many head and neck structures, most commonly from carious dentition. Other causes include tonsillar abscesses, submandibular gland infections, and foreign bodies.

Treatment is primarily surgical; however, it is important to acknowledge the advances in imaging and antimicrobial therapy that have reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with deep neck infections over the last 50 years. Despite these improvements, patients with infections of the head and neck spaces can decompensate dramatically if not identified and treated early.

Decompensation can lead to airway obstruction, pericarditis, mediastinitis, septic embolization, thoracic empyema, dural sinus thrombosis, intracranial abscess, septic shock, and mortality. It is therefore paramount for primary care and ED colleagues to rule out any red flag signs and symptoms to enable urgent diagnosis and medical and surgical intervention.

The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was first designed in 2012 to help standardize the identification of acutely unwell patients and considers the following parameters: respiration rate, oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, and pulse.

### Deep neck space infection extending to the mediastinum that was treated conservatively [^111bL2Lv]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Deep neck space infections (DNSIs) are challenging to diagnose and manage. A female ex-smoker presented with difficulty breathing and chest pain and was initially treated for exacerbation of emphysema with intravenous antibiotics. The ear, nose, and throat team were later asked to review the patient for left submandibular swelling and odynophagia. Due to limited availability during COVID-19, a CT of the neck was performed 10 days later. It showed an extensive retropharyngeal collection from the level of the vallecula to just above the carina. Normally, a DNSI extending to the mediastinum would require prompt surgical management; however, the patient was clinically well once imaged, so the abscess was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics.

### Chronic sphenoiditis with deep neck space extension: Case report with review of the literature and postulated mechanisms for extracranial extension [^112mM4jP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Isolated primary sphenoid sinusitis is a rare occurrence, estimated to make up less than 3% of sinus infections. The posterior anatomic location of the sphenoid makes treatment challenging when it becomes infected. Complications involving intracranial extension to surrounding structures often result in cranial nerve deficits due to their proximity. A single case of chronic sphenoiditis with direct extracranial extension into the prevertebral space is reported, with a discussion on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management.

A 46-year-old female patient with diffuse headaches radiating into the neck and throat was evaluated in the office. Computed tomography demonstrated sphenoiditis with direct extension into the prevertebral space. Imaging revealed a purported route of direct extension through the clinoid and directly into the clivus to form an abscess in the longus colli muscle. The patient underwent endoscopic surgical management, including drainage of the prevertebral abscess, and has since made a full recovery. This is the first reported case of direct extension of sphenoiditis into the prevertebral space.

The findings highlight the importance of aggressive treatment of chronic sphenoid infections to prevent detrimental complications. Computed tomography imaging proved an advantageous imaging modality to demonstrate bony erosion and sinus tracts from the skull base to the deep neck space.

### Update 2011: Leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis - strengths and weaknesses [^114LVwsE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Leflunomide is often used as a first-choice disease-modifying antirheumatic drug after methotrexate. New data are available for its efficacy and safety in both monotherapy and in combination with biologicals.

Recent data on efficacy demonstrate comparable effect sizes for leflunomide and methotrexate in the treatment of signs and symptoms, especially when used in combination with tumor necrosis factor-blocking agents and rituximab. Equipotency has also been demonstrated by a recent radiographic outcome study on methotrexate and leflunomide monotherapy.

Pharmacogenetic studies indicate an impact of polymorphisms on the variability in serum levels of leflunomide, with potential relevance to effectiveness and tolerability in individual patients. Genetic factors are also likely to contribute to the significantly increased risk for leflunomide-induced pulmonary disease reported in Asia. Pre-existing interstitial lung disease, as well as methotrexate-induced pneumonitis, have been identified as risk factors for leflunomide-induced pulmonary disease, limiting the use of leflunomide as an alternative to methotrexate under these conditions.

Effectiveness of leflunomide renders it a potent treatment option in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the known tolerability issues result in less favorable adherence to therapy, constituting a weakness. Documented data from large registries indicate that leflunomide is safe, provided that contraindications and monitoring recommendations are observed.

### Deep neck cellulitis: A challenging diagnosis [^1174Ksmj]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, under immunosuppressive therapy, was referred to the emergency department for severe progressive neck pain and fever, with one week of evolution. She was unable to perform neck mobilization due to intense pain. She also experienced dysphagia. Examination of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx showed no alterations. She had an increased C-reactive protein level. Central nervous system infections were excluded through a lumbar puncture. A CT scan was normal; however, an MRI showed T2 hyperintensity of the retropharyngeal and prevertebral soft tissues of the neck without signs of abscess. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

- **Complications of deep neck infection**: These include abscess formation, venous thrombosis, and mediastinitis. In this case, no complications occurred.

A high degree of clinical suspicion is essential as deep neck infections need to be promptly diagnosed and treated, given their rapidly progressive nature, especially in immunocompromised patients.

### Aubagio [^112Vr9MN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available human data are limited. Prospectively reported data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports encompassing more than 150 pregnancies in patients treated with teriflunomide and more than 300 pregnancies in patients treated with leflunomide have not demonstrated an increased rate of congenital malformations or miscarriage following teriflunomide exposure in the early first trimester when followed by an accelerated elimination procedure. Specific patterns of major congenital malformations in humans have not been observed.

Limitations of these data include an inadequate number of reported pregnancies from which to draw conclusions, the short duration of drug exposure in reported pregnancies, which precludes a full evaluation of fetal risks, incomplete reporting, and the inability to control for confounding factors such as underlying maternal disease and use of concomitant medications.

### Diflunisal [^1153hUQa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Other reactions have been reported in clinical trials or since the drug was marketed, but occurred under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established. However, in these rarely reported events, that possibility cannot be excluded. Therefore, these observations are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians.

- **Respiratory**: Dyspnea.

- **Cardiovascular**: Palpitation, syncope.

- **Musculoskeletal**: Muscle cramps.

- **Genitourinary**: Nephrotic syndrome.

- **Special senses**: Hearing loss.

- **Miscellaneous**: Chest pain.

A rare occurrence of fulminant necrotizing fasciitis, particularly in association with Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus, has been described in persons treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including diflunisal, sometimes with fatal outcomes. (See also precautions, General.)

In addition, a variety of adverse effects not observed with diflunisal in clinical trials or in marketing experience, but reported with other non-steroidal analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents, should be considered potential adverse effects of diflunisal.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. This article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations.

The 14 developed recommendations address several aspects of adult rhinosinusitis:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Recommendations focus on diagnostic accuracy, emphasizing the importance of ancillary tests for confirming diagnosis and guiding management. These include radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function.

- **Systemic and topical therapy**: The guideline addresses the judicious use of both systemic and topical therapies.

- **Chronic conditions**: It emphasizes identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify the management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised states, and ciliary dyskinesia.

An updated guideline is necessitated by new clinical trials, systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

- **Methods**: This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition). It summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures.

The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, and family medicine.

### The increased risk of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus neck abscesses in young children [^113ymE1U]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

To analyze the microbiological origins of deep neck space infections requiring surgical intervention in a pediatric population, this retrospective cohort study was conducted. The study population (N = 136) included all pediatric patients surgically treated for deep neck space abscesses in a metropolitan tertiary care children's hospital over the course of 5 years (September 2004–August 2009). Demographic and clinical information was compared with microbiological isolate data.

Microbiological analysis of 118 bacterial isolates demonstrated 49 (42%) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 35 (30%) methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and 34 (28%) non-S. aureus (N-SA) isolates. The median age was 16 months (range, 1 month–13 years). Patients under 16 months of age were 10 times more likely to have an S. aureus (SA) infection versus N-SA (P < 0.0001). MRSA comprised the majority of all SA isolates (58%). Eighty percent of all SA abscesses were located in the lateral neck. African American pediatric patients accounted for 70% of all deep neck space infections and 86% of all MRSA infections. Clindamycin resistance was noted in 8% (4/49) of all community-acquired MRSA isolates.

Children younger than 16 months and/or with lateral neck abscesses are at a significantly increased risk of having an SA infection, the majority being MRSA.

### Clinical trial design and dissemination: Comprehensive analysis of clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed data since 2005 [^112qb4pQ]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Establishing links between trial registry records and published results, we linked the trial registry records to the disclosed results, either deposited directly on clinicaltrials.gov or published as a journal article, to determine whether the results of a particular trial had been disseminated. We implemented the approach described by Powell-Smith and Goldacre to identify eligible trials that should have publicly disclosed results. These were studies concluded after January 2006 and by July 2015, to allow sufficient time for publication of results of studies that had not filed an application to delay submission of the results based on the "first_received_results_disposition_date" field in the registry. We included studies from all organizations, even minor institutions, regardless of how many trials they funded. The selection process led to a dataset of 45,620 studies, including 27,835 efficacy trials (phase II-IV), as summarized by the flow diagram in supplementary file 1.

For each eligible trial, we used two methods to search for published results. Firstly, we searched for structured reports submitted directly to the results database.

### Multispace deep fascial infection in the head and neck patient complicated with Guillain-Barre syndrome: Case report with a literature review [^112S8bWR]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is the most prevalent and severe form of acute paralytic neuropathy, commonly triggered by infections and characterized by an abnormal autoimmune response. Reports of multispace deep fascial infection (DFI) in the head and neck complicated by GBS are exceedingly rare. We report a 69-year-old woman with DFI who developed postoperative limb weakness. GBS was diagnosed following a neurology consultation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) puncture examination. The patient was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, as well as supportive care and rehabilitation exercise. After our treatment, the patient was discharged successfully. GBS is a rare complication after head and neck surgery. When progressive weakness occurs in a patient with DFI, the possibility of GBS should be considered, and CSF and electrophysiological examinations should be performed as soon as possible. For patients with DFI complicated by GBS, prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and National Early Warning Score [^114Tn7hA]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Blood tests confirmed the clinical suspicion of an acute inflammatory condition. The full blood count showed a haemoglobin level of 119 g/L, a white cell count of 17.1 × 10⁹/L, with a neutrophil count of 9.5 × 10⁹/L, and a platelet count of 575 × 10⁹/L. Urea and electrolytes were normal, and the CRP was 145.

An orthopantomogram (OPG) demonstrated periapical radiolucencies on both the lower right second and third molars, strongly suggesting an odontogenic source (see Figure 1). An urgent contrast-enhanced CT of the neck revealed a large collection in the deep peritonsillar and parapharyngeal spaces (2.7 cm in maximum diameter), located close to the pterygoid plates, and identified a superficial component buccal to the mandible (see Figures 2–5).

### Deep neck infection: Analysis of 185 cases [^112H1VzX]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

This study reviews our experience with deep neck infections and tries to identify the predisposing factors of life-threatening complications.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections in the Department of Otolaryngology at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1997 to 2002. Their demographics, etiology, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, duration of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes were reviewed. The attributing factors to deep neck infections, such as the age and systemic diseases of patients, were also analyzed.

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-five charts were recorded; 109 (58.9%) were men, and 76 (41.1%) were women, with a mean age of 49.5 ± 20.5 years. Ninety-seven (52.4%) of the patients were older than 50 years old. There were 63 patients (34.1%) who had associated systemic diseases, with 88.9% (56/63) of those having diabetes mellitus (DM). The parapharyngeal space (38.4%) was the most commonly involved space. Odontogenic infections and upper airway infections were the two most common causes of deep neck infections (53.2% and 30.5% of the known causes). Streptococcus viridans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common organisms (33.9%, 33.9%) identified through pus cultures. K. pneumoniae was also the most common infective organism (56.1%) in patients with DM. Of the abscess group (142 patients), 103 patients (72.5%) underwent surgical drainages. Thirty patients (16.2%) had major complications during admission, and among them, 18 patients received treatment for those complications.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: Identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^112zFG8s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections is crucial for healthcare providers. Identifying the risk factors associated with these infections can lead to better prevention and treatment strategies.

- **Risk factors**: A variety of risk factors contribute to the recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections. These include previous infection history, compromised immune functions, and environmental exposure.

- **Treatment strategies**: Effective treatment strategies need to be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account their unique medical history and the specific characteristics of the infection. Optimizing antibiotic use and employing adjunctive therapies can significantly reduce recurrence rates.

Healthcare professionals should remain vigilant in monitoring patients with known risk factors to prevent repeated infections.

### Real-world evidence for increased deep neck infection risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^115aYtLs]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and deep neck infection (DNI).

- **Study design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Methods**: Patients newly diagnosed with RA between 2000 and 2011 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Moreover, patients without RA were randomly selected and matched at a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, urbanization level, income, and diabetes mellitus. The patients were followed up until death or the end of the study period (December 31, 2013). The primary outcome was the occurrence of DNI.

- **Results**: In total, 30,207 patients with RA and 120,828 matched patients without RA were enrolled. Patients with RA had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of DNI than those without RA (P < 0.001). The adjusted Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that RA was significantly associated with a higher incidence of DNI (hazard ratio: 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.26–3.46, P < 0.001). Therapeutic methods (surgical or nonsurgical) did not differ significantly between the patients with RA-DNI and those with non-RA-DNI. Patients with RA-DNI had higher rates of tracheostomy, mediastinitis, mediastinitis-related mortality, and overall mortality than patients with non-RA-DNI, although these differences were without statistical significance. RA patients receiving no therapy experienced higher rates of DNI compared with those receiving methotrexate alone, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or biologic therapies.

- **Conclusion**: This study is the first to investigate the association between RA and DNI.

### Designing development programs for non-traditional antibacterial agents [^111A88mL]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Despite their non-inferiority designs, these trials focus on future superiority (Table 4). Although it may be important to reserve new interventions for future use as a matter of stewardship, that decision is for regulators, prescribers, and payers to consider; it does not dictate whether the study itself evaluates a worthwhile clinical question.

Ideally, superiority trials should be conducted exclusively in patients with infections resistant to available therapies, as they would potentially derive direct clinical benefit from participation, resulting in stronger data. However, as noted, the logistics of such designs may be impractical until fully drug-resistant bacteria become endemic, which would signal a global public health calamity. It would be unethical to delay the development of novel antibiotics until resistant diseases become more widespread, as superiority trials might only then be feasible.

For these reasons, if these new products are deemed to have sufficient social value, the impracticality of superiority designs and the absence of certain concerns associated with non-inferiority designs may render non-inferiority designs acceptable.

However, the question remains: is it justified to ask patients facing serious infection to risk treatment with an investigational product in a non-inferiority trial when they likely…

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and National Early Warning Score [^111UKcKk]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

**Learning points**: Prompt recognition of deep neck space infections is mandatory; delay in treatment increases the risk of disease progression, including airway loss and mortality. Algorithms designed to detect systemic physiological upset do not always reflect the severity of localized deep neck infections. The National Early Warning Score cannot be used alone to assess the severity of deep neck space infections, and further work to design and evaluate appropriate algorithms is needed. An ideal algorithm would ensure that patients are treated in the appropriate area of the hospital and referred promptly to the appropriate specialists.

### Characterizations of life-threatening deep cervical space infections: A review of one hundred ninety-six cases [^1168bcTt]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of deep cervical space infections has decreased after the introduction of antibiotics and improvement of oral hygiene, but they still may be lethal, especially when life-threatening complications occur. This article aims to identify predisposing factors related to complicated deep cervical space infections and prolonged hospitalization.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical records of 196 patients with deep neck infections during the period from March 1996 to February 2002. Among these patients, 15 developed lethal complications. For data analysis, multiple regression and logistic regression with dummy variables were used.

- **Results**: In multiple regression analysis, it was found that patients with advanced age, neck swelling, trismus, underlying diseases, complications, and C-reactive protein levels greater than 100 microg/mL had prolonged hospital stays, with statistical significance (P < 0.05) achieved. In logistic regression, male patients and those with neck pain exhibited a negative correlation, reaching statistical significance (P < 0.05). Conversely, patients with neck swelling and respiratory difficulty showed a positive correlation, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). This indicates that female patients, those with neck swelling, and those experiencing respiratory difficulty were more likely to have complicated deep neck infections.

Complicated deep neck infections remain potentially fatal; however, morbidity and mortality can be reduced. It is crucial for doctors to pay more attention to these predisposing factors.

### Arava [^112AVSab]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Trial 1, a 2-year study, randomized 482 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of at least 6 months' duration to leflunomide 20 mg/day (n = 182), methotrexate 7.5 mg/week increasing to 15 mg/week (n = 182), or placebo (n = 118). All patients received folate 1 mg BID. The primary analysis was conducted at 52 weeks, with blinded treatment extending to 104 weeks.

Overall, 235 of the 508 randomized treated patients (482 in primary data analysis and an additional 26 patients) continued into a second 12 months of double-blind treatment (98 leflunomide, 101 methotrexate, 36 placebo). The leflunomide dose continued at 20 mg/day, and the methotrexate dose could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/week. In total, 190 patients (83 leflunomide, 80 methotrexate, 27 placebo) completed 2 years of double-blind treatment.

Trial 2 randomized 358 patients with active RA to leflunomide 20 mg/day (n = 133), sulfasalazine 2.0 g/day (n = 133), or placebo (n = 92). The treatment duration was 24 weeks. An extension of the study was an optional 6-month blinded continuation of Trial 2 without the placebo arm, resulting in a 12-month comparison of leflunomide and sulfasalazine.

Of the 168 patients who completed 12 months of treatment, 146 patients (87%) entered a 1-year extension study of double-blind active treatment (60 leflunomide, 60 sulfasalazine, 26 placebo/sulfasalazine). Patients continued on the same daily dosage of leflunomide or sulfasalazine that they had been taking at the completion of Trial 2. A total of 121 patients (53 leflunomide, 47 sulfasalazine, 21 placebo/sulfasalazine) completed the 2 years of double-blind treatment.

### A severe deep neck odontogenic infection not prioritised by the emergency department triage system and National Early Warning Score [^111so67F]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Our patient developed respiratory complications postoperatively related to the inability to clear secretions effectively, extending his hospital stay; it is uncertain if this could have been avoided had a tracheostomy been performed.

Where pathology prevents complete physical examination, adequate imaging must be arranged. Imaging of deep neck space infections is vital to confirm the diagnosis, define the extent of the infection, identify any complications such as mediastinitis, and provide a baseline for monitoring progression and resolution.

Contrast-enhanced CT scans are beneficial when a deep neck space abscess is suspected. They are fast, accurate, and clearly demonstrate the extent of infection, distortion of anatomical structures, or vascular compromise. In two-thirds of cases with trismus, clinical examination alone underestimated the extent of the infection compared with contrast-enhanced CT.

Ultrasound can be useful for demonstrating drainable collections; however, due to anatomical constraints, it can be difficult for evaluating deep structures of the neck, and the pressure of the ultrasound probe on inflamed tissues can be very painful for the patient.

Postoperative imaging can be beneficial in showing any postoperative complications, where it is useful to diagnose early to reduce significant morbidity and mortality. However, in the UK, postoperative CT imaging is not routinely performed due to the increased radiation dose to the patient and financial constraints, relying instead on clinical examination and trends in blood tests.

Ludwig's angina is a deep neck space infection defined as a rapidly progressive bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular space. Despite being an uncommon entity in developed countries and the reduction of mortality and morbidity due to the modern era of antibiotics, improved imaging, and airway management, it is still an important and potentially life-threatening condition. The authors present three cases of Ludwig's angina that occurred in a developed country, requiring admission to an intensive care unit and extensive surgical and medical treatment.

### Leflunomide use and risk of lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic literature review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^111qADck]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). High credibility.

To evaluate the relative risk (RR) of pulmonary disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with leflunomide (LEF), we searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to April 15, 2014. We included double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LEF versus placebo or active comparator agents in adults with RA. Studies with fewer than 50 subjects or lasting shorter than 12 weeks were excluded. Two investigators independently searched the databases, and all authors reviewed the selected studies. We compared RR differences using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method to assess total respiratory adverse events, infectious respiratory adverse events, noninfectious respiratory adverse events, interstitial lung disease, and death.

Our literature search returned 5,673 results. A total of eight studies, four with placebo comparators, met our inclusion criteria. There were 708 respiratory adverse events documented in 4,579 participants. Six cases of pneumonitis occurred, all in the comparator group. Four pulmonary deaths were reported, none in the LEF group. LEF was not associated with an increased risk of total adverse respiratory events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56–1.78) or infectious respiratory adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.58–1.82). LEF was associated with a decreased risk of noninfectious respiratory adverse events (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41–0.97).

Our study found no evidence of increased respiratory adverse events in RCTs of LEF treatment.

### Magnetic resonance imaging findings in pediatric neck infections-a comparison with adult patients [^1165vU7h]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections are defined as infections that spread along the fascial planes and spaces of the head and neck. Differences in the anatomical proportions of the neck, as well as the proportional distribution and function of the neck lymph nodes between children and adults, may lead to dissimilar manifestations of the disease process. In adults, lymph nodes located in the retropharyngeal space, for example, tend to undergo atrophy and are thus not involved in infectious diseases to the same extent. Further, the clinical presentation and microbiology of deep neck space infections seem to vary between children and adults.

Deep neck infections and associated abscesses pose a risk of serious complications in children as well as adults, including airway compromise, vascular complications, septicemia, and mediastinitis. Deep neck abscesses are often treated with intravenous antimicrobial drugs and surgical incision and drainage. In clinical practice, determining whether the symptoms and findings reflect tissue cellulitis or phlegmon rather than true abscess formation can be challenging. Imaging can aid the diagnostic process by differentiating findings between cellulitis and abscess and may thus suggest conservative treatment as the primary choice if no abscess is detected. It has been estimated that 10–15% of deep neck infections in pediatric patients could be successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics alone. Precise determination of abscess location and extension, and the exclusion of possible life-threatening complications, also helps in planning the course of management.

### Avsola [^115Ls53i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Adverse reactions in adults**: The data described herein reflect exposure to infliximab in 4,779 adult patients (1,304 patients with RA, 1,106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1,373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2,625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. One of the most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g. dyspnea, flushing, headache, and rash).

### Comparison of registered and published outcomes in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review [^113C7ysS]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Nine studies compared registered and published primary outcomes for trials with industry funding and those without. One study found that industry-sponsored trials were significantly less likely to have outcome inconsistencies than trials with other funding sources. The remaining eight studies observed no significant relationship between funding source and outcome consistency.

The authors of three studies compared primary outcome consistency between general medical journals and specialty journals. Of these, one study compared trials published in general medical journals to those published in specialty surgical journals, finding a higher rate of outcome inconsistencies among surgical journal trials. Another study compared trials published in general medical journals to those in gastroenterology journals, while the last study compared trials from general medical journals with those published in cardiology, rheumatology, or gastroenterology specialty journals. Neither of the latter two studies observed a difference in discrepancy rate by journal type.

Eight studies analyzed the impact of changes to registered primary outcomes on the statistical significance of published primary outcomes for included trials. An additional study reported the impact of an outcome change for a single trial, finding this change to favor statistical significance of the published outcome. When assessable, outcome changes frequently favored the publication of statistically significant results.

### Effectiveness of leflunomide in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in clinical practice [^116K21Uo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of leflunomide in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) as used in actual clinical practice. The methods involved a retrospective review of medical records of patients with JIA who initiated leflunomide treatment between April 2001 and October 2006. Data derived from these charts included patient baseline characteristics, reason for starting leflunomide, adverse events, joint outcomes, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) scores, visual analog scale pain and well-being scores, and treatment status.

The results indicated that fifty-eight patients (33 female, 25 male) were included in this study. Forty-eight patients were switched from methotrexate (MTX) to leflunomide, primarily because of MTX-related adverse events, and leflunomide was added to ongoing MTX in 10 patients. The mean duration of leflunomide therapy was 1.45 years. The mean swollen joint count decreased from 1.40 at treatment initiation to 0.60 at last follow-up, while the mean tender joint count decreased from 1.83 to 0.29. Improvements were also observed in CHAQ, pain, and well-being scores. At the last follow-up, 44.8% of patients were continuing leflunomide therapy, 29.3% had discontinued because of remission, and the rest had discontinued treatment because of side effects (22.4%) or other reasons (3.4%).

In conclusion, leflunomide treatment, as employed in actual clinical practice, was well tolerated and resulted in substantial improvements in joint and functional status outcomes in children with JIA. Approximately 30% of the patients attained remission.

### Etanercept, infliximab, and leflunomide in established rheumatoid arthritis: Clinical experience using a structured follow-up programme in southern Sweden [^116MNaae]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of prospectively monitoring treatment efficacy and tolerability of infliximab, etanercept, and leflunomide over a two-year period in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using a structured protocol in clinical practice.

- **Methods**: All patients with RA at seven centers in southern Sweden, for whom at least two disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, had failed or not been tolerated, were included. They started treatment with either infliximab, etanercept, or leflunomide. These patients were evaluated at predefined times using a standardized protocol that included items required for evaluating responses according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. All adverse events were recorded using World Health Organization terminology, and concomitant treatment and survival while receiving a drug were also documented.

- **Results**: During the study, 166 patients were treated with etanercept, 135 with infliximab, and 103 with leflunomide. The treatment response as determined by the ACR and EULAR response criteria was similar for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. The TNF blockers performed significantly better than leflunomide, both as determined by the response criteria and by survival on drug analysis. After 20 months, 79% and 75% of patients continued receiving etanercept or infliximab compared to only 22% who started on leflunomide. The spectrum of side effects did not differ from those previously reported in clinical trials. The initial two-year experience provided insights into the protocol for postmarketing surveillance of etanercept.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116zHKhf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Antibiotic utilization and role

Historically, antibiotics prescribed for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been chosen empirically, as swabs for culture have not been routinely taken in clinical practice. The choice of agent and the duration of its prescription have varied considerably based on the clinician's training and experience, as well as the clinical setting. Numerous guidelines have been developed to rationalize antibiotic prescription for this indication. However, there are practical challenges in applying treatment guidelines, particularly those developed in different healthcare environments. These challenges include variable treatment costs and antibiotic resistance rates. The global consumption of broader spectrum antibiotics nearly doubled from 2000 to 2015, and prescribing for CRS remains one of the most common indications. Furthermore, in some countries, many antibiotics are dispensed without a prescription.

Although several antibiotics are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) or unspecified rhinosinusitis (RS), no antibiotic has FDA approval specifically for treating CRS. Despite this, antibiotics are still commonly prescribed for this indication. In the United States, the antibiotic classes most commonly prescribed for CRS consultations between 2006 and 2010 were penicillins/beta-lactams (33%), macrolides (26%), and quinolones (19%). In a 2015 survey, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the drug of choice for adult and pediatric CRS patients among private practitioners in South Korea. In contrast, hospital-based doctors preferred macrolides for adult CRS patients and third-generation cephalosporins.

### Leflunomide for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review and metaanalysis [^113mqFmf]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

To systematically review the evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy and toxicity of leflunomide for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a comprehensive search was conducted.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline, Embase, Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register for human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials up to December 2001. Additionally, we hand-searched reference lists and conference proceedings and consulted content experts. Relative benefit (RB), weighted mean differences, or standardized mean differences with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.

- **Results**: Six RCTs totaling 2,044 patients with RA were included in this review. Using specific criteria, all trials were considered of high methodological quality. Leflunomide improved the ACR20 response rate roughly two times over placebo both at 6 months (RB = 1.93, 95% CI 1.51, 2.47) and at 12 months (RB = 1.99, 95% CI 1.42, 2.77). Other clinical outcomes of disease activity, function, and radiological scores were significantly better for leflunomide patients than those taking placebo. No significant differences for most of the outcomes were observed between leflunomide and sulfasalazine (SSZ) or methotrexate (MTX). Adverse events were more common in the leflunomide group, but withdrawal rates were fewer than for placebo. Overall, withdrawal rates and adverse events in the leflunomide group were not different from SSZ or MTX.

- **Conclusion**: Leflunomide improves all clinical outcomes and delays radiographic progression at 6 and 12 months of RA treatment compared to placebo.

### Clinical and prognostic significance of emergency MRI findings in neck infections [^113CfNew]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Deep neck infections present challenges, even in modern medicine, due to their complex anatomy and potentially lethal complications. The true extent of the infection is difficult to assess clinically; therefore, emergency imaging is often required to determine the exact location and extent of the disease. In suspected neck infection cases, CT has traditionally been the first-line imaging method. However, distinguishing between reactive non-suppurative edema and true abscesses in deep neck spaces using CT may be challenging. This distinction is critical for choosing the appropriate treatment: abscesses usually require surgical drainage, whereas infections without abscesses usually resolve after conservative treatment. MRI provides excellent soft-tissue characterization, surpassing that of CT in the imaging evaluation of neck infections. Although MRI is often considered time-consuming and challenging for acutely ill patients, emergency neck MRI has recently shown to be feasible and to have superior diagnostic accuracy to that previously reported for CT.

- **Anatomy of the retropharyngeal space**: The retropharyngeal space is a deep neck space between the visceral fascia anteriorly and prevertebral fascia posteriorly. This space is further divided by the thin alar fascia into the true retropharyngeal space anteriorly and the danger space posteriorly. The true retropharyngeal space extends from the skull base to the upper mediastinum, whereas the danger space extends further down to the level of the diaphragm. Both the true retropharyngeal space and the danger space may serve as conduits of disease propagation.

### Arava [^115B5X3F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent that inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, and has antiproliferative activity. Several in vivo and in vitro experimental models have demonstrated its anti-inflammatory effect.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide's in vivo activity. Plasma concentrations of the parent drug, leflunomide, have been occasionally seen at very low concentrations. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide have primarily examined the plasma concentrations of teriflunomide.

- **Absorption**: Following oral administration, peak teriflunomide concentrations occurred between 6 to 12 hours after dosing. Due to the very long half-life of teriflunomide (18–19 days), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinical studies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady-state teriflunomide concentrations. Without a loading dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady-state plasma concentrations would require about two months of dosing. The resulting plasma concentrations following both loading doses and continued clinical dosing indicate that plasma teriflunomide concentrations are dose proportional.

- **Effect of food**: Coadministration of leflunomide tablets with a high-fat meal did not have a significant impact on teriflunomide plasma concentrations.

- **Distribution**: Teriflunomide is extensively bound.
