## Question

cbc vs cbc with diff

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between a complete blood count (CBC) and a complete blood count with differential (CBC with diff), including when to order each, how to interpret results, and how to avoid overuse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and what the differential adds. Then, I should verify the clinical indications where the differential meaningfully changes management. Next, I will review evidence on overuse and stewardship strategies. After that, I need to check special populations and guideline-backed scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight pitfalls and exceptions, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't gloss over basics. A standard CBC reports red cell parameters, hemoglobin/hematocrit, platelets, and a total white blood cell count, whereas a CBC with differential breaks down the WBC into neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, providing absolute counts and sometimes percentages, which is essential for characterizing leukocytosis or leukopenia and detecting abnormal morphologies or blasts that suggest hematologic disease [^c9e0fa44] [^b53bf659].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering the differential every time. I need to check where it truly changes management. The differential is critical when evaluating suspected infection or sepsis, hematologic malignancy, immunologic disorders, drug-induced cytopenias, and in neonatal sepsis risk stratification; for example, neutrophil predominance supports bacterial infection, eosinophilia suggests allergic or parasitic disease, and blasts or abnormal lymphocyte morphology flag leukemia or lymphoma, prompting urgent hematology referral and bone marrow evaluation [^82ff2d94] [^eaffd491] [^2580cc30] [^7af8c61f] [^25490e91].

> Wait, let me verify the overuse signal so I don't overstate utility. Multiple stewardship studies show that routine CBC with differential is frequently ordered without incremental benefit, driving unnecessary manual reviews, delays, and costs; interventions such as EMR reprioritization, clinical decision support alerts, and middleware algorithms that cancel same-day repeats reduce CBC with diff volumes by roughly 20–30% without harming care, and physician surveys indicate many CBC/diff parameters are rarely used in routine practice [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92] [^efac9b69] [^dff9ee02] [^68d94c03].

> I should double-check special populations where the differential is non-negotiable. In pediatrics, guidelines endorse CBC with differential for suspected acute bacterial arthritis, neonatal sepsis evaluation, and Down syndrome health supervision; in oncology and hematology, NCCN mandates CBC with differential for initial workup and surveillance in ALL, AML, CLL, and multiple myeloma; in HIV care, DHHS ties CBC with differential to CD4 monitoring and ongoing toxicity surveillance; and in rheumatology, ACR recommends periodic CBC with differential for agents like hydroxychloroquine and colchicine to detect cytopenias [^f880b4f3] [^7af8c61f] [^f62d4fa0] [^286bf7d0] [^bf8c4230] [^80c6d589] [^f3707293] [^1d4b27c3] [^806693c7] [^eda4ed7d] [^c69aac90].

> Let me consider the neonatal context carefully because interpretation is age-dependent. In the first 72 hours of life, WBC and ANC have poor discrimination for sepsis at birth but improve with age; very low ANC carries high likelihood ratios for infection, and both manual and automated differentials can quantify the immature-to-total neutrophil ratio, though automated IG parameters perform comparably to manual bands in some neonatal cohorts, which supports judicious use rather than defaulting to manual differentials [^25490e91] [^df4a7657].

> Next, I should review stewardship tactics so I can give actionable advice. EMR nudges that deprioritize CBC with diff, hard stops for repeat same-day orders, education on when the diff changes management, and cost/turnaround time feedback reduce low-value testing; middleware that converts repeat CBC with diff to CBC alone within 24 hours has been sustainably implemented, and point-of-care CBC with 5-part differential can expedite care in select settings while maintaining accuracy, though I need to ensure quality controls and operator training are in place [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92] [^efac9b69] [^4c18d873] [^ad36b4cb].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is anemia or thrombocytopenia rather than leukocyte disorders. I should confirm that a basic CBC often suffices for anemia workups, where MCV, reticulocytes, and smear guide diagnosis; the differential adds little unless there is concurrent leukopenia/leukocytosis or suspected marrow failure, so defaulting to CBC alone in straightforward anemia is reasonable and aligns with primary care and specialty guidance [^bfa5fd37] [^d31e2f66].

> I will now examine how to interpret results so I don't miss red flags. A left shift with bands and immature granulocytes supports bacterial infection, eosinophilia points to allergy or parasites, lymphocytosis with atypical forms suggests viral illness, and blasts or dysplastic changes mandate hematology referral; emerging parameters like monocyte distribution width can enhance early sepsis detection in the ED, but I should confirm that these are adjuncts to, not replacements for, clinical judgment and source control [^8517e656] [^45fa6c5a] [^32ef9dd2].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions where a basic CBC could miss critical information. In patients with cytopenias on therapy, unexplained leukocytosis, fever in immunocompromised hosts, or suspected marrow infiltration, a differential is essential to detect lineage-specific suppression, leukemic blasts, or toxic changes; conversely, in stable, non-acute follow-up for chronic disease where trends in hemoglobin or platelets are the focus, a CBC alone is often adequate, especially if prior differentials were unremarkable [^b9772091] [^11bc3699] [^eaffd491].

> Let me reconsider the practical decision framework to ensure it's balanced. Order CBC with differential when the clinical question involves infection, hematologic malignancy, immunologic disease, drug toxicity, or neonatal risk; consider a basic CBC for routine screening, stable chronic disease follow-up, or isolated anemia/thrombocytopenia without leukocyte abnormalities; and use stewardship tools to avoid repeats and low-yield orders, documenting the clinical rationale when requesting the differential to support appropriate use [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92] [^efac9b69].

> Finally, I should confirm that I'm not overlooking operational nuances. Manual differentials are resource-intensive and should be reserved for flagged automated results or specific clinical questions; storage time can degrade differential accuracy, so timely processing matters; and when NRBCs are present, I need to correct the WBC count to avoid spurious leukocytosis, which is a common pitfall in neonates and certain anemias [^aa69728d] [^fd966ca3].

CBC with differential is indicated when **clinical context requires leukocyte subset analysis** (e.g. infection, hematologic malignancy, immunologic disorders, or drug-induced cytopenias) [^82ff2d94] [^eaffd491] [^b9772091] [^11bc3699]. Routine CBC without differential is appropriate for **stable patients without suspected leukocyte abnormalities** (e.g. routine anemia screening, stable chronic disease follow-up) [^bfa5fd37] [^d31e2f66]. Using CBC with differential only when indicated reduces unnecessary testing, costs, and turnaround delays without compromising care [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92] [^efac9b69].

---

## Clinical indications for CBC with differential

CBC with differential is **essential when leukocyte subsets inform diagnosis or management**:

- **Infection**: Suspected bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; sepsis evaluation [^82ff2d94] [^b0d94d9a].
- **Hematologic malignancy**: Suspected or known leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloproliferative disorders [^eaffd491] [^2580cc30].
- **Immunologic disorders**: Suspected immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease [^11bc3699].
- **Drug-induced cytopenias**: Medications with myelosuppressive risk (e.g. clozapine, methotrexate, azathioprine) [^b9772091] [^312c607d].
- **Neonatal care**: Suspected sepsis or hematologic disorders in newborns [^7af8c61f] [^25490e91].

---

## Clinical scenarios where CBC without differential is sufficient

CBC without differential is appropriate when **leukocyte subsets are unlikely to change management**:

- **Routine screening**: Anemia screening, stable chronic disease follow-up [^bfa5fd37] [^d31e2f66].
- **Stable patients**: No suspected infection, malignancy, or immunologic disorder.
- **Cost-conscious settings**: Reducing unnecessary testing and costs [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92].

---

## Impact of unnecessary CBC with differential testing

Unnecessary CBC with differential testing **increases costs**, laboratory workload, and turnaround times, and may delay care. Stewardship interventions (education, EMR changes, clinical decision support) reduce unnecessary orders without adverse outcomes [^f788bab2] [^ea84ce92] [^efac9b69].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Cbc with differential recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected infection | Yes | Identify leukocyte abnormalities guiding diagnosis and treatment [^82ff2d94] [^b0d94d9a] |
| Suspected hematologic malignancy | Yes | Essential for diagnosis and monitoring [^eaffd491] [^2580cc30] |
| Immunologic disorders | Yes | Evaluate immune cell subsets [^11bc3699] |
| Drug-induced cytopenias | Yes | Monitor for myelosuppression [^b9772091] [^312c607d] |
| Neonatal care | Yes | Evaluate for sepsis and hematologic disorders [^7af8c61f] [^25490e91] |
| Routine screening | No | Unlikely to change management [^bfa5fd37] [^d31e2f66] |
| Stable chronic disease follow-up | No | Unlikely to change management [^d31e2f66] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Use CBC with differential when **leukocyte subsets are likely to change diagnosis or management** (infection, malignancy, immunologic disease, drug-induced cytopenias, neonatal care) [^82ff2d94] [^eaffd491] [^b9772091] [^7af8c61f]. Use CBC without differential for routine screening or stable follow-up when leukocyte subsets are unlikely to alter care [^bfa5fd37] [^d31e2f66]. This approach reduces unnecessary testing, costs, and delays while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

### Impact of interventions to change CBC and differential ordering patterns in the emergency department [^f788bab2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A CBC with leukocyte differential (CBC-DIFF) is a frequently ordered emergency department (ED) test. The DIFF component often does not add to clinical decision making. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a performance improvement project on CBC ordering.

Methods

ED orders for CBC-DIFF were identified through the laboratory information system. Two interventions were evaluated: an educational intervention regarding CBC-DIFF uses and a reprioritization of ED CBC-DIFF and CBC in the electronic medical record (EMR) orders. Pearson χ2 tests were used to assess for differences in the proportions.

Results

There was no difference in the proportion of CBC tests performed after the education intervention (175/6,192, 2.8% [95% CI, 2.39%-3.21%] vs 219/6,270, 3.5% [95% CI, 3.05%-3.95%]). There was a significant increase in CBC samples ordered following the EMR intervention (604/6,044, 9.1% [95% CI, 8.37%-9.83%]; P < .01).

Conclusions

Reprioritizing EMR laboratory orders can reduce overutilization of CBC-DIFF testing.

### Clinical decision support to improve CBC and differential ordering [^ea84ce92]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Complete blood count and differential (CBC diff) is a common laboratory test that may be overused or misordered, particularly in an inpatient setting. We assessed the ability of a clinical decision support (CDS) alert to decrease unnecessary orders for CBC diff and analyzed its impact in the laboratory.

Methods

We designed 3 CDS alerts to provide guidance to providers ordering CBC diff on inpatients at frequencies of daily, greater than once daily, or as needed.

Results

The 3 alerts were highly effective in reducing orders for CBC diff at the frequencies targeted by the alert. Overall, test volume for CBC diff decreased by 32% (mean of 5257 tests per month) after implementation of the alerts, with a corresponding decrease of 22% in manual differentials performed (mean of 898 per month). Turnaround time for manual differentials decreased by a mean of 41.5 minutes, with a mean decrease of up to 90 minutes during peak morning hours.

Conclusions

The 3 CDS alerts successfully decreased inpatient orders for CBC diff and improved the quality of patient care by decreasing turnaround time for manual differentials.

### An electronic health record-based solution to reduce the volume of CBC differentials performed on inpatients [^4c18d873]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to investigate the use of same-day, repeat complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential orders in a large pediatric institution and design an intervention to limit CBC with differential testing and, thereby, manual differential performance to once per calendar day, without placing a burden on ordering clinicians.

Methods

We created a seamless electronic health record (EHR)-based back-end workflow that reaccessions CBC with differential orders to a CBC without differential if a CBC with differential has been resulted within that calendar day. Clinicians have an opportunity to override at the time of test order entry in the EHR.

Results

Repeat CBC with differential orders originated predominantly in intensive care units (ICUs) and oncology inpatient units and accounted for 18% of all CBC with differential orders. Implementation of our EHR workflow led to an average annual reduction of 9% in CBC with differential tests and a 16% reduction in manual differentials performed. This change amounts to a combined annual cost savings (direct cost of testing plus laboratory technologist time) of approximately $45000 and improved CBC with differential test turnaround times.

Conclusions

Our EHR-based solution resulted in a substantial and sustained decrease in CBC with differential tests and manual differential slide reviews performed in a critically ill pediatric population. This approach is a potential alternative to traditional educational and other clinician-dependent stewardship interventions that aim to improve test utilization.

### Optimization of laboratory ordering practices for complete blood count with differential [^dff9ee02]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the utilization of CBC and CBC with differential (CBC w/diff) tests at University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, and to determine if a reduction in CBC w/diff tests could be achieved without negatively impacting patient care.

Methods

The quantity of testing and distribution of repeated tests before, during, and after an educational intervention were compared.

Results

CBC w/diff tests were ordered 10-fold more frequently than CBC tests. The trauma burn intensive care unit ordered the most CBC w/diff tests, with repeat tests done every 4 or 12 hours. The educational intervention reduced the number of CBC w/diff tests ordered and tests repeated every 12 hours.

Conclusions

The educational intervention changed the ordering practices of CBC w/diff and CBC tests. This was sustained after the intervention and no negative effects on patient care were noted. Similar interventions may lead to optimization of ordering practices of other laboratory tests.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Variation in complete blood count reports across US hospitals [^8e2d03e0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

We found substantial variations in CBC values reported across US hospitals. While most hospitals reported more than 20 values, twice as many values as the hospitals reporting the least number of values, 1 in 5 hospitals reported less than 20 values. This suggests that some of these values are either redundant or unnecessary, eg, the percentages of white blood cell differential count, mean platelet volume, nucleated red blood cell count, and immature granulocyte count. Our study is limited by the possibility that information available via EPIC Care Everywhere may differ from what is available to the local hospital. A 2023 reportproposed 3 distinct abridged CBC reporting options, each for a specific purpose: CBC-WBC (5 values for periodic health examinations), CBC-Diff (9 values for acute illnesses), and CBC-Plus (10 values for hematology patients) as a potential solution. There is a huge opportunity to simplify and standardize CBC reporting. The foreseeable benefits include reducing EMR clutter and time spent in reviewing laboratory test results, minimize physician burnout and distraction, as well as decrease patient concerns and queries.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^f880b4f3]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) in suspected ABA — A complete blood count (CBC) with differential generally should be performed on initial evaluation of children with suspected ABA; the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count is often, but not always, elevated, is higher on average with adjacent osteomyelitis infection than without and may be higher when ABA is caused by S. aureus or streptococcal species than K. kingae, but substantial overlap precludes the use of a specific diagnostic cut-off value; WBC does not differ on average between confirmed and presumed ABA cases; CBC on admission also is not useful in distinguishing ABA from Lyme arthritis; and while WBC is often higher in ABA than transient nonbacterial synovitis, substantial overlap precludes diagnostic value in distinguishing these entities.

### How useful are CBC and reticulocyte reports to clinicians? [^68d94c03]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We surveyed 1,353 attending and 689 house staff physicians of the University Hospitals of Cleveland to ascertain the parameters of the CBC, leukocyte differential, and reticulocyte reports perceived as useful in clinical practice. The response rate was 33% for attending and 22% for house staff physicians. Only 4 of 11 parameters routinely reported in the CBC battery were selected as frequently or always useful by more than 90% of physicians: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and WBC count. Among primary care physicians, the mean cell volume also attained this level of usefulness for the evaluation of anemia. There were no differences between academic physicians and community physicians in the use of RBC indices; however, physicians who had been in practice for fewer than 10 years indicated higher use of the red cell distribution width than physicians practicing for more than 10 years. Most physicians prefer differentials reported as percentages rather than absolute counts. Among physicians who monitor reticulocyte counts, the immature reticulocyte fraction is not widely used. Our results indicate that many physicians do not use much of the data provided in routine CBC/differential and reticulocyte reports. Some modifications of report formats may facilitate physician perception of hematology laboratory results.

### Sustainable laboratory-driven method to decrease repeat, same-day WBC differentials at a tertiary care center [^efac9b69]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A CBC with WBC differential is often ordered when a CBC alone would be sufficient for patient care. Performing unnecessary WBC differentials adds to costs in the laboratory. Our objective was to implement a laboratory middleware algorithm to cancel repeat, same-day WBC differentials to achieve lasting improvements in laboratory resource allocation.

Methods

Repeat same-day WBC differentials were first canceled only on intensive care unit samples; after a successful trial period, the algorithm was applied hospital-wide. We retrospectively reviewed CBC with differential orders from pre- and postimplementation periods to estimate the reduction in WBC differentials and potential cost savings.

Results

The algorithm led to a monthly WBC differential cancellation rate of 5.40% for a total of 10,195 canceled WBC differentials during the cumulative postimplementation period (September 25, 2019, to December 31, 2020). Nearly all (99.94%) differentials remained canceled. Most patients only had one WBC differential canceled (range, 1–38). Savings estimates showed savings of $0.99 CAD per canceled differential and 1,060 minutes (17.7 hours) of technologist time.

Conclusions

A middleware algorithm to cancel repeat, same-day WBC differentials is a simple and sustainable way to achieve lasting improvements in laboratory utilization.

### Interventions to reduce repetitive ordering of low-value inpatient laboratory tests: a systematic review [^8241b882]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Randomised controlled trials

Two randomised controlled trials were included. The trial by Wertheim et al examined a strategy of EMR change combined with education and policy change and reported a 9% reduction in aggregate labs. The authors randomised medical teams comprised of residents and attendings to either intervention or control groups. The reduction was primarily driven by decreased ordering of BMP and CBC without differential; hepatic function panel, coagulation studies and other electrolytes were not affected. Sommers et al investigated education and cost display through a clustered RCT of 33 teams made up of 96 residents that entailed a 45 min educational session focused on reviewing a hospital bill for one of the resident's patients. They aimed at reducing patient cost burden through reduction of unnecessary lab ordering. No significant difference in lab costs between the intervention and control groups was achieved.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^09c582d5]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

Methods

The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

Results

All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Automated blood cell counts: state of the art [^aa47e194]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^190fa9ae]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivorship and post-therapy monitoring — Blood tests (CBC with differential) should be performed every 1 to 3 months, and liver function tests should be performed every 1 to 3 months until normal values are achieved. During the second year, a physical exam and CBC with differential can be performed every 3 to 6 months, and from the third year and beyond they can be performed every 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated. An assessment of bone marrow aspirate can be considered as clinically indicated at a frequency of 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years; if a bone marrow aspirate is performed, flow cytometry with additional studies including MRD assessments should be carried out. While there is insufficient evidence to guide MRD monitoring for patients with Ph-negative disease following completion of maintenance therapy, the approval of blinatumomab may warrant testing; if relapse is suspected, a full workup should be considered. For Ph-positive ALL, periodic quantification of the BCR::ABL1 transcript should be determined, with second- and third-year schedules of every 3 to 6 months and then every 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Interpreting complete blood counts soon after birth in newborns at risk for sepsis [^25490e91]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential is commonly ordered to evaluate newborns at risk for sepsis.

Objectives

To quantify how well components of the CBC predict sepsis in the first 72 hours after birth.

Methods

For this retrospective cross-sectional study we identified 67 623 term and late-preterm (≥ 34 weeks gestation) newborns from 12 northern California Kaiser hospitals and 1 Boston, Massachusetts hospital who had a CBC and blood culture within 1 hour of each other at < 72 hours of age. We compared CBC results among newborns whose blood cultures were and were not positive and quantified discrimination by using receiver operating characteristic curves and likelihood ratios.

Results

Blood cultures of 245 infants (3.6 of 1000 tested newborns) were positive. Mean white blood cell (WBC) counts and mean absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were lower, and mean proportions of immature neutrophils were higher in newborns with infection; platelet counts did not differ. Discrimination improved with age in the first few hours, especially for WBC counts and ANCs (eg, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for WBC counts was 0.52 at < 1 hour and 0.87 at ≥ 4 hours). Both WBC counts and ANCs were most informative when very low (eg, the likelihood ratio for ANC < 1000 was 115 at ≥ 4 hours). No test was very sensitive; the lowest likelihood ratio (for WBC count ≥ 20 000 at ≥ 4 hours) was 0.16.

Conclusion

Optimal interpretation of the CBC requires using interval likelihood ratios for the newborn's age in hours.

### Mitochondria define intestinal stem cell differentiation downstream of a FOXO / notch axis [^b12361e5]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Differential WNT and Notch signaling regulates differentiation of Lgr5 + crypt-based columnar cells (CBCs) into intestinal cell lineages. Recently we showed that mitochondrial activity supports CBCs, while adjacent Paneth cells (PCs) show reduced mitochondrial activity. This implies that CBC differentiation into PCs involves a metabolic transition toward downregulation of mitochondrial dependency. Here we show that Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors and Notch signaling interact in determining CBC fate. In agreement with the organoid data, Foxo1/3/4 deletion in mouse intestine induces secretory cell differentiation. Importantly, we show that FOXO and Notch signaling converge on regulation of mitochondrial fission, which in turn provokes stem cell differentiation into goblet cells and PCs. Finally, scRNA-seq-based reconstruction of CBC differentiation trajectories supports the role of FOXO, Notch, and mitochondria in secretory differentiation. Together, this points at a new signaling-metabolic axis in CBC differentiation and highlights the importance of mitochondria in determining stem cell fate.

### Which observations from the complete blood cell count predict mortality for hospitalized patients? [^91ef8a3c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Information on the prognostic utility of the admission complete blood count (CBC) and differential count is lacking.

Objective

To identify independent predictors of mortality from the varied number and morphology of cells in the complete blood count defined as a hemogram, automated five cell differential count and manual differential count.

Design

Retrospective cohort study and chart review.

Setting

Wishard Memorial Hospital, a large urban primary care hospital.

Patients

A total of 46,522 adult inpatients admitted over 10 years to Wishard Memorial Hospital-from January 1993 through December 2002.

Intervention

None.

Measurements

Thirty-day mortality measured from day of admission as determined by electronic medical records and Indiana State death records.

Results

Controlling for age and sex, the multivariable regression model identified 3 strong independent predictors of 30-day mortality-nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), burr cells, and absolute lymphocytosis-each of which was associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of death within 30 days. The presence of nucleated RBCs was associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 25.5% across a range of diagnoses, excluding patients with sickle-cell disease and obstetric patients, for whom NRBCs were not associated with increased mortality. Having burr cells was associated with a mortality rate of 27.3% and was found most commonly in patients with renal or liver failure. Absolute lymphocytosis predicted poor outcome in patients with trauma and CNS injury.

Conclusions

Among patients admitted to Wishard Memorial Hospital, the presence of nucleated RBCs, burr cells, or absolute lymphocytosis at admission was each independently associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of death within 30 days of admission.

### Monocyte distribution width: a novel indicator of sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 in high-risk emergency department patients [^45fa6c5a]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Changes in the volume of peripheral blood monocytes, specifically an increase in MDW, effectively identifies septic patients and infected patients who are at increased risk for progression to sepsis in the ED. In conjunction with the WBC, as components of the CBC with differential, the performance of MDW further improves and is predicted to enhance healthcare decisions relating to the early detection and treatment of sepsis in the ED.

### Is a 500-cell count necessary for bone marrow differentials? a proposed analytical method for validating a lower cutoff [^4ae2e750]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

By convention, 500 cells are counted for bone marrow aspirate differentials. Evidence supporting such a cutoff is lacking. We hypothesized that 300-cell counts could be sufficient.

Methods

Cell count results from 165 cases, for which values were recorded at 300 and 500 cells, were analyzed. We tested for statistical differences and changes in diagnostic classification between the two cutoffs.

Results

Three hundred cell counts did not produce diagnostically different results, particularly for myeloblasts and plasma cells, where cell percentages are critical for disease classification. Method comparison analysis did not reach statistical significance for any cell type when comparing the two methods. Bias plots showed narrow, even spread about the mean bias. Contingency table analysis yielded no significant diagnostic discrepancies.

Conclusions

Performing differential counts on 300 cells would produce clinically and statistically similar results to 500 cells. Reducing the cell number counted has potential cost/labor reductions without affecting quality of care.

### Monocyte distribution width: a novel indicator of sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 in high-risk emergency department patients [^32ef9dd2]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The concept of monitoring changes in the morphology of circulating immune cells as an early sign of infection has been previously recognized. In response to microbial "danger signals" (e.g. bacterial endotoxins), circulating immune cells, particularly monocytes, and neutrophils are rapidly activated, as reflected by changes in their size and shape and the release of chemokines and cytokines in order to, respectively, recruit and activate other immune cells. Another possible explanation is that sepsis provokes the release of larger, immature monocytes (e.g. monoblasts) into the circulation. Regardless of the mechanism, increased immune cell size during severe infections likely precedes the onset of SIRS, as indicated by the observation that elevated MDW predicted progression from infection at ED admission to Sepsis-3 within 72 hours 71% of the time.

The MDW biomarker is predicted to provide added value to current sepsis detection protocols. A CBC with differential is routinely obtained in most patients presenting to the ED to screen for acute illness and guide the clinician while generating a differential diagnosis, including decisions to pursue a diagnosis of sepsis. The WBC serves as a current laboratory standard for the initial detection of severe infections, wherein an abnormal WBC is ~88% sensitive for sepsis detection, but its specificity for sepsis detection is low. In this study, it was shown that MDW enhanced the performance of WBC for early sepsis detection based on the following three different statistical approaches: 1) differences in the AUC, 2) probability and likelihood ratios, and 3) a statistical "added value analysis". In contrast to currently available biomarkers of sepsis, such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactic acid, which are typically used to confirm the presence of sepsis after the initial patient encounter in the ED, the MDW could be automatically reported with the CBC and differential to serve as means of sepsis detection during the initial ED encounter.

### Umbilical cord blood as a replacement source for admission complete blood count in premature infants [^2d8c9b7a]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesize that a complete blood count (CBC) with manual differential from umbilical cord blood is equivalent to a CBC with manual differential obtained from the neonate on admission.

Study Design

A CBC and manual differential was performed on 174 paired umbilical cord blood and admission blood samples from infants < 35 weeks gestation. Paired t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were the primary statistical tools used for data analysis.

Result

Cord and admission blood white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin and platelet count all significantly (P < 0.0001) correlated with paired neonatal samples (R = 0.82, 0.72, 0.76). Admission blood WBC count fell within the variation of WBC count values from currently accepted neonatal admission blood sources. Cord blood hemoglobin was not clinically different than admission hemoglobin (1.0 g dL⁻¹). Cord blood platelet counts were not different from admission blood platelet counts (5800 cells per μl, P = 0.23). The immature to total granulocyte ratio was not different between samples (P = 0.34).

Conclusion

Umbilical cord blood can be used for admission CBC and differential in premature infants.

### Analytical performance of a point-of-care CBC hematology analyzer, including a 5-part differential: a prospective study to evaluate a microfluidic flow cytometry-based analyzer in waived settings [^ad36b4cb]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A microfluidic flow cytometer-based point-of-care (POC) analyzer was validated against an in-laboratory hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN Automated Hematology System). Concordance on a full complete blood cell count (CBC) with 5-part differential, as performed by operators with no prior clinical laboratory experience, was evaluated.

Methods

We prospectively collected 376 venous blood specimens (376) from individuals with self-reported medical conditions and from apparently healthy individuals. Forty-six additional remnant specimens were acquired to ensure coverage of analytic measuring ranges. Parallel testing was performed, with up to 7 hours between testing on the POC and Sysmex XN analyzers.

Results

Regression analysis resulted in r values of 0.998 to 0.932 for all parameters of a 5-part differential CBC other than basophils (0.709). The mean percentage bias from the reference method, inclusive of the upper and lower reporting limits, was less than 2% for parameters other than lymphocytes (-6.4%), monocytes (25.9%), eosinophils (12.2%), and basophils (-15%). Overall agreement on abnormal flagging was 93.3%.

Conclusions

The Cito CBC microflow cytometer (CytoChip Inc) provides a CBC with a 5-part differential with accuracy, precision, and abnormal flagging equivalent to a moderate-complexity hematology analyzer. It has the key features required of a POC device that can be operated in a waived setting: minimum space requirements, rapid results, single-action measurement (no sample processing or dilution), ease of use, and minimal blood volume.

### Manual differential cell counts help predict bacterial infection. A multivariate analysis [^e095a6cf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We developed logistic regression models that combine information from the automated CBC and manual 100-cell differential counts to predict bacterial infection. The logistic models were fitted from a case group of 116 patients with proven bacterial infection and a control group of 930 presumably uninfected outpatients. A 4-variable, 15-parameter model, which includes automated absolute neutrophil, manual band, and manual immature granulocyte counts, performed best with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area of 89%. A more practical 2-variable model including automated absolute neutrophil and manual band counts performed almost as well with an ROC curve area of 86%. The automated neutrophil count-only model is less informative with an ROC curve area of 78%. The combined information from automated and manual differential cell counts more accurately predicts bacterial infection than automated counting alone. Despite these modest improvements, the high cost of manual differential cell counts dictates careful patient selection. The supplemental information gained from manual differential counts is most useful for patients with low to normal neutrophil counts (8,000/μL [8.0 × 10⁹/L] or less). Further studies are indicated to determine the characteristic patient populations deriving maximal benefit from this information.

### Changes in automated complete blood cell count and differential leukocyte count results induced by storage of blood at room temperature [^aa69728d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To delineate changes that occur in various parameters of automated complete blood cell count (CBC) and differential leukocyte count (differential) on prolonged storage of blood at room temperature.

Design

A CBC and an automated differential were performed on the Coulter Gen.S on 40 K(3) (tripotassium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate) EDTA-anticoagulated blood specimens once daily, specimen volume permitting, for 3 to 7 days. Specimens were kept at room temperature throughout the study. The results were tabulated using a personal computer with Excel software. Percent change or absolute difference from the initial value for each parameter for each subsequent day of the study period was calculated.

Results

Among the CBC parameters, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were stable for the duration of the study (7 days), white blood cell count was stable for at least 3 days (up to 7 days, if the count was within or above the normal range), and platelet count was stable for at least 4 days (up to 7 days, if the count was within or above the normal range). The mean corpuscular volume, mean platelet volume, hematocrit, and red blood cell distribution width each increased, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration decreased from day 2 onward. Among the differential parameters, the relative percentages and absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils tended to increase, whereas those of monocytes trended downward over time. Limited data on basophils did not reveal an appreciable change.

Conclusion

Blood specimens stored at room temperature for more than 1 day (up to 3 days or possibly longer) were found to be acceptable with some limitations for CBC but not for the differential.

### Title: "Labels matter: is it stress or is it trauma? " [^ee0f0f63]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

It is therefore critical to shift away from working with group averages and move toward more individualized analysis approaches. Some years ago, Cohen et al presented the cutoff behavioral criteria (CBC) analysis approach to differentiate between maladaptive and well-adaptive individuals. While the CBC analysis approach was found to be very productive, yielding a series of highly relevant findings, which could not have been identified otherwise, it is different from the way diagnosis is done in humans. While human studies take into consideration responses in nonchallenged individuals, the CBC analysis focuses only on exposed individuals, comparing the performance only among them. More recently, we have developed a variation of the CBC in rodents, termed behavioral profiling, which is an analysis approach based on referring to the performance of a control, nonexposed group as defining normal behavior, and assessing deviation from that "norm". Importantly, control and exposed animals are examined on a battery of tests, aiming to test their functional capacity and to assess their coping abilities. Employing this analysis approach enabled us to demonstrate key neurobiological differences between animals that were exposed to the traumatic experience and developed symptoms (exposed-affected) and those that were exposed to the same experience but did not develop significant symptoms (exposed–nonaffected), further verifying the functional significance of such a distinction. This approach is in good alignment with the human population in which there are people who develop PTSD (susceptible) and others who do not (resilient) after trauma exposure. In addition, differentiating between exposed–affected and exposed–nonaffected individuals enables differentiating between neural mechanisms that are associated with the pathology and those actually associated with stress resilience. Moreover, other studies in the literature have succeeded to predict susceptibility to develop a PTSD-like phenotype on the long term, by characterizing animals' exploratory responses in a novel environment or measuring their changes in startle reactivity shortly after trauma exposure. This line of work aligns well with evidence in humans indicating that a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) given within 60 days of trauma exposure is highly predictive of the degree and persistence of PTSD symptoms at later stages.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Comparing automated vs manual leukocyte differential counts for quantifying the 'left shift' in the blood of neonates [^df4a7657]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The neutrophil 'left shift' can be measured via the immature to total (I/T) neutrophil ratio or the absolute bands per μl using a manual differential count. It can also be measured from an automated differential count by the immature granulocyte percentage (IG%) or the absolute IG per μl. In neonates, it is unknown if the manual or automated differential count is superior.

Study Design

We directly compared complete blood counts (CBCs) with manual and automated differential counts from infants < 90 days old, and documented whether or not each neonate was infected. We developed reference intervals for I/T ratio, bands per μl, IG% and IG per μl using values from non-infected neonates.

Results

The database had 10714 CBCs. The upper reference interval for I/T ratio was 0.29 in the first 48h and 0.31 thereafter; bands per μl was 3710μL⁻¹ in the first 48h and 1785μL⁻¹ thereafter. IG% was 6.2% then 4.2%; IG per μl was 1460μL⁻¹ then 613μL⁻¹. Statistical performances of the four methods were equivalent for identifying infection.

Conclusions

We developed reference intervals for four methods of quantifying a neonate's 'left shift'. The information from automated differentials is not inferior to that from manual differentials in identifying infections, but automated differentials have the advantages of a larger sample size, being less expensive, and faster performance times.

### Network-based analysis reveals novel gene signatures in peripheral blood of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2bcca01e]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Impact of adjustment of complete cell count (CBC) and differential to the gene and module level associations with FEV 1

Because peripheral blood contains a mixture of inflammatory cells, we evaluated the impact of complete cell count (CBC) and differential on gene expression at the gene as well as module level. The correlation of eigengenes with CBC in peripheral blood of the same subjects is shown in Additional file 1: Table S2 for the discovery and replication cohorts.

The yellow and green modules, which were negatively associated with FEV 1 were positively correlated with neutrophils (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated to lymphocytes (P < 0.001) in peripheral blood. The brown module, which showed positive association with FEV 1, was negatively correlated with neutrophils (P < 0.001) and positively correlated to lymphocytes (P < 0.001). These relationships were replicated in the replication cohort.

To evaluate the impact of peripheral blood cell count on gene level association, the analysis was repeated by including CBC and differential of peripheral blood in the statistical model we had used previously. Results are shown in Additional file 1: Table S3. The smallest FDR value after cell count adjustment was 0.64 indicating that cell count adjustment had a significant effect on peripheral blood gene expression signatures for FEV 1. There was a modest correlation (r = 0.56, P < 2.2×10⁻¹⁶) of P values from the cell count and the non-cell count adjusted associations.

We performed a similar analysis by adding CBC and differential as covariates in the module level analysis (Additional file 1: Table S4). This led to the inflation of p values and a loss of statistical significance in the relationships between modules and FEV 1: the yellow and green modules, for instance, ranked third and seventh with P values of 0.158 and 0.282, respectively and an FDR = 0.653 in the CBC adjusted analysis.

### Relationship between white blood cell count and bacteremia using interval likelihood ratios in hospitalized patients [^21563dc0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with bacteremia often have elevated white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, yet these alone are poor predictors of bacteremia. Data on the continuous relationship between WBC response and bacteremia are lacking.

Objective

This study aims to characterize the relationship of WBC count, neutrophil percentage, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to bacteremia using interval likelihood ratios (ILRs) derived from a large sample of hospitalized patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study in a large healthcare system from 2017 to 2018.

Patients

This study included non-surgical inpatients who had at least one complete blood count (CBC) with differential up to 24 hours after admission and a blood culture. Patients with immunosuppression and malignancy or who received antibiotics before negative blood cultures were excluded.

Main Measures

Predictors were WBC count, ANC, and neutrophil percentage. The outcome was bacteremia. We compared test discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC). We calculated ILRs for bacteremia across test value intervals. As a practical example, we assumed a 5% pre-test probability of bacteremia and calculated the post-test probability for each interval. We compared this approach to a threshold approach using a threshold of 70% neutrophils.

Results

Of 25,776 patients with a CBC with differential and blood culture, 1160 had bacteremia. AUROC was highest for neutrophil percentage (0.74), followed by ANC (0.63) and WBC count (0.58). Probability of bacteremia increased exponentially from neutrophil percentage 80 to 100%. Odds of bacteremia varied 35-fold based on neutrophil percentage. A threshold approach with a cut-off of 70% significantly underestimated bacteremia risk at higher levels.

Conclusions

ILRs offered a more discriminating approach to estimating the probability of bacteremia than a single threshold. Physicians assessing risk of bacteremia should pay attention to the magnitude of abnormality because very high and very low values have much stronger predictive power than dichotomized results.

### Variation in complete blood count reports across US hospitals [^9d36214f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

We collected CBC values from 139 hospitals across 43 states and 102 cities (Figure 1). Fifty-four percent were community hospitals while 46% were academic hospitals. The median number of values reported by all hospitals was 21 (range, 12–24). This was not significantly different between academic (median 22 [range, 12–24]) and community hospitals (median 21 [range, 14–24]) (Figure 2). The distribution of hospitals according to the number of CBC values reported were: 12 to 16 (11 [8%]), 17 to 19 (14 [11%]), 20 (35 [25%]), 21 (10 [7%]), 22 (27 [19%]), 23 (25 [18%]), and 24 (17 [12%]). A substantial minority of the hospitals did not report the percentages of white blood cell differential count (13 [9%]) or mean platelet volume (29 [21%]). Absolute nucleated red blood cell and immature granulocyte counts were reported frequently, by 36 (26%) and 80 hospitals (58%), respectively. However, the frequency of reporting these 4 values were similar between academic and community hospitals.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^10dea8a8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — post-therapy surveillance and monitoring: Physical examination (including a testicular examination) and blood tests (CBC with differential) every 1 to 3 months, and liver function tests should be performed every 1 to 3 months until normal values are achieved. During the second year after completion of therapy, a physical examination (including a testicular examination) and blood tests (CBC with differential) should be performed every 3 to 6 months, and these can be further spaced out to every 6 to 12 months or as indicated from the 3rd year and beyond. An assessment of bone marrow aspirate can be considered as clinically indicated at a frequency of 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years; if a bone marrow aspirate is performed, flow cytometry with additional studies that may include comprehensive cytogenetics, FISH, molecular tests, and MRD assessments should be carried out. If relapse is suspected, a full workup should be considered, and for Ph-positive ALL, periodic quantification of the BCR::ABL1 transcript should be determined. While there is insufficient evidence to guide MRD monitoring for patients with Ph-negative disease following completion of maintenance therapy, the approval of blinatumomab, and potentially future therapies for MRD-positive relapse, may warrant testing in this regard.

Maternal thrombocytopenia — initial workup is outlined as follows: The differential diagnosis in pregnancy includes gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, pseudothrombocytopenia, viral infection, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and congenital thrombocytopenias. These disorders usually can be determined with a detailed medical and family history and a physical examination, with attention to current medication use, blood pressure, splenomegaly, viral serology, and adjunctive laboratory studies as appropriate, and a complete blood count (CBC) and examination of the peripheral blood smear generally are indicated in the evaluation of maternal thrombocytopenia; a CBC helps to exclude pancytopenia, evaluation of the peripheral smear serves to rule out platelet clumping that may be a cause of pseudothrombocytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy to distinguish between inadequate platelet production and increased destruction generally is not indicated.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### The unintentional detection of leukemias with complete blood count [^aecc95d2]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The complete blood count (CBC) is the most requested medical test in the world and it is used for various clinical purposes. Due to its characteristic of quantifying red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, it assesses bone marrow function, where most leukemias originate. Therefore, the test has the potential to unintentionally detect different types of leukemia. Screening refers to the application of a diagnostic test to a population without signs or symptoms of the disease. Although the request of a CBC in clinical practice does not necessarily constitute screening, the premise that early detection allows more effective treatment, preventing deaths and allowing patients to live longer, may also apply to leukemias. In this article, leukemias and the CBC are used as a didactic platform to explain some aspects regarding potential benefits, harms, and limitations of incidental detection of diseases in asymptomatic individuals and its implications for the primary care clinician.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^fd966ca3]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### An artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostic platform for rapid near-patient hematology [^e5e0959d]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

A large number of laboratory tests are now available for point‐of‐care testing (POCT)including, among others, urinalysis, blood chemistry and infectious disease testing. However, hematology analyzers capable of performing complete blood counts (CBCs) have lagged in their prevalence at the point‐of‐care, despite CBCs ranking among the most commonly ordered tests. The relative absence of POC CBC analyzers has also hampered the adoption of other POC tests that tend to be ordered alongside the CBC (e.g. complete metabolic panels); in particular, if a CBC is required but must be performed in the central lab due to its absence at the point‐of‐care, its companion tests may as well be ordered from the central lab.

The majority of current near‐patient CBC analyzers rely on the miniaturization of large‐lab analyzers, particularly those based on flow cytometry and/or impedance cytometry techniques. Such miniaturization has in many cases been accompanied by simplification, which has resulted in reduced numbers of parameters (e.g. three‐part instead of five‐part differentials), narrower reportable ranges, reduced abnormal cell flagging capabilities and in some cases a reduction in accuracy (as indicated by the small number of FDA clearances). These CBC analyzers have also inherited many of the product attributes of their larger relatives, including the requirements for liquid reagent replacement, washout and calibration procedures, and frequent quality‐control processeswhich in the POC context can be limiting or prohibitive.

### Comparison of blood counts and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department in Seattle, WA [^5e616705]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We compared complete blood count (CBC) with differential and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to emergency departments in Seattle, WA.

Methods

We reviewed laboratory values for 1 week following each COVID-19 test for adult patients who received a standard severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before April 13, 2020. Results were compared by COVID-19 status and clinical course.

Results

In total 1,027 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 155) had lower leukocytes (P < .0001), lymphocytes (P < .0001), platelets (P < .0001), and higher hemoglobin (P = 0.0140) than those without, but absolute differences were small. Serum albumin was lower in patients with COVID-19 (P < .0001) and serum albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were each associated with disease severity. NLR did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without (P = 0.8012).

Conclusions

Patients with COVID-19 had modestly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and higher hemoglobin values than patients without COVID-19. The NLR, serum albumin, and RDW varied with disease severity, regardless of COVID-19 status.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^8517e656]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Pediatric patients who receive antibiotics for fever and neutropenia in less than 60 min have decreased intensive care needs [^9e25ddb2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The next two PDSA cycles (Add-on Fever and CBC Sepsis) were similarly devised to combat identified barriers to TTA < 60 (Fig. 2). The goal of the Add-on Fever PDSA was to decrease the time required to move a patient from an exam room to the infusion center by designating a special appointment type which would define patients with potential F&N as patients who may ultimately need an infusion room. Team discussions importantly identified that this PDSA was essentially ignored and therefore had little impact on clinic flow or TTA (Fig. 3).

The CBC Sepsis PDSA aimed to decrease time spent waiting for an ANC result and required collaboration with laboratory staff. Typically, ANC results would come from complete blood count (CBC) with Differential orders after manual verification of the ANC by a technician. During the baseline period, such orders were processed in 45 min (Table I). To decrease this time, we worked with the laboratory to develop a new order type (CBC Sepsis) that would designate a request to immediately release machine ANC results as preliminary. Analysis of 200 CBC Sepsis orders revealed that preliminary results of ANC > 500 are converted to final results of ANC < 500 less than 0.5% of the time. Preliminary CBC Sepsis results are available in 10 (+/− 4.6) minutes, a 65–75% improvement over CBC with Differential orders (Table I). The CBC Sepsis PDSA was not reliably followed in the initial weeks after its implementation, however, and therefore did not significantly impact clinic flow or TTA (Fig. 3).

### Assessment of immune cell profiles among post-menopausal women in the women's health initiative using DNA methylation-based methods [^5ec126cb]. Clinical Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral blood immune cell counts are the entry point for interrogation of the immune system either in response to an environmental insult or therapeutic intervention or in relation to disease states. However, it is important to have well-established reference values for cell types in healthy populations to interpret immune cell counts in clinically relevant populations. Reference values of various leukocyte immune parameters (i.e. cell-type subsets and cell ratios) are numerous in the literature for specific populations/cohorts of individuals across different age groups, races, ethnicities, nationalities, and sexes.

Some reference values are reported using a complete blood count (CBC), including differential assessed using hematology analyzers, which returns data on both red blood cells and white blood cells (WBC), enumerating five WBC subtypes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes). For example, Cheng et al. used NHANESIII data to develop reference values based on CBC and reported that the granulocyte fraction appears to increase with age, with the lymphocyte fraction showing an inverse association with age. Cheng et al. also reported race-related differences, such as overall WBC count lower in both non-Hispanic black males and females, compared to non-Hispanic white and Mexican American males and females. This trend is a commonly accepted physiologic norm, driven by the inheritance of the Duffy antigen variant. Mononuclear and lymphocyte percentages were increased, and granulocyte percentage was decreased in non-Hispanic African Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans. These findings were largely replicated by Coates et al. which included CBC data collected on 7,157 healthy volunteers in the UK. While informative, CBC does not differentiate lymphocyte lineage subtypes, requiring flow cytometry approaches for some specific clinical applications. For instance, CD4+ counts are important in HIV monitoring, CD4+ and CD8+ counts have been associated with COVID-19 severity and progression and natural killer cells have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases.

### Clozapine [^b9772091]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

Background

Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil "segs" plus neutrophil "bands"). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, "severe neutropenia" replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.

Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.

Methods

Complete blood count datasets

NHANES CBC data were retrieved from the category "Complete Blood Count with 5-part Differential - Whole Blood" of Laboratory data for NHANES surveys 1999–2014. Corresponding UKB CBC data fields with related database codes are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The fraction of samples with missing (or filled with zero) CBC data was < 0.035% in any studied dataset and those samples were discarded. Differential white blood cell percentages were converted to cell counts by multiplication by 0.01 × White blood ceel count. All CBC parameters were log-transformed and normalized to zero-mean and unit-variance based on data of NHANES participants aged 40 y.o. and older to further carry out PCA and train Cox proportional hazards model.

Step counts datasets

NHANES step counts per minute records during 1 week were retrieved from the category "Physical Activity Monitor" of Examination data for NHANES 2005–2006 survey. Autocorrelation of log-transformed daily step counts was calculated using data from "Fitbit" devices of 4532 users aged 20–80 y.o. (1601 male and 2892 female).

### Empowering medicine residents to order labs mindfully to improve patient-centered care [^33f56215]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Unnecessary laboratory testing of hospitalized patients is prevalent.

Objective

We conducted a study focused on "mindful ordering" to decrease unnecessary laboratory ordering within an Internal Medicine residency program.

Designs, Settings and Participants

We collected survey data on resident/faculty perceptions of laboratory ordering as well as order information from the electronic medical record (EMR).

Intervention

Interventions focused on resident-identified barriers such as knowledge, EMR, habit and faculty expectations. Interventions were cumulative and included resident/faculty education and EMR optimization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We assessed basic and complete metabolic panels (BMP, CMP) and complete blood counts with and without differential (CBC w/diff, w/o diff). Primary outcomes included: total labs ordered per week, lab and frequency, and resident perception of ordering practices. Secondary outcomes included: length-of stay (LOS) and venipuncture utilization.

Results

Survey data demonstrated increased resident perception of both mindful ordering and team discussion. Total labs ordered per week decreased 20% in the first year (1944 to 1500 labs/week). Residents' use of the "one-time draw" option increased; use of "daily" frequency decreased. Trends showed an increase in BMP relative to CMP, and an increase in CBC w/o diff relative to CBC w/diff. These changes were sustained through 127 weeks. There was an approximately 10% decrease in monthly average of patients undergoing venipuncture each day (86.7% to 74.2%). The shifts in laboratory ordering in conjunction with increased discussion about labs suggest a sustained change in resident lab ordering behavior. This study shows the impact of focusing interventions on resident-identified barriers to mindful ordering to create a sustained decrease laboratory orders.

Classification performance for the entire dataset was displayed in Table 3. Clinical features produced good AUC and sensitivity, while CBC biomarkers only obtained modest AUC. Besides, BCMs yielded the lowest performance. Combining all three domains of features got the optimal AUC (10-fold CV: 0.850, Open test: 0.889) and sensitivity (0.816, 0.850). In particular, combined features achieved a boost in the specificity performance (0.831, 0.816), which is vital in clinical practice settings. The levels of both AUCs of the clinical features and the combined features could be considered as good.

### Machine learning models improve the diagnostic yield of peripheral blood flow cytometry [^870253f9]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Peripheral blood flow cytometry (PBFC) is useful for evaluating circulating hematologic malignancies (HM) but has limited diagnostic value for screening. We used machine learning to evaluate whether clinical history and CBC/differential parameters could improve PBFC utilization.

Methods

PBFC cases with concurrent/recent CBC/differential were split into training (n = 626) and test (n = 159) cohorts. We classified PBFC results with abnormal blast/lymphoid populations as positive and used two models to predict results.

Results

Positive PBFC results were seen in 58% and 21% of training cases with and without prior HM (P < .001). % neutrophils, absolute lymphocyte count, and % blasts/other cells differed significantly between positive and negative PBFC groups (areas under the curve [AUC] > 0.7). Among test cases, a decision tree model achieved 98% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC = 0.906). A logistic regression model achieved 100% sensitivity and 54% specificity (AUC = 0.919).

Conclusions

We outline machine learning-based triaging strategies to decrease unnecessary utilization of PBFC by 35% to 40%.

### Optimizing multi-domain hematologic biomarkers and clinical features for the differential diagnosis of unipolar depression and bipolar depression [^a2345201]. Npj Mental Health Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous works have attempted to find associations between CBC biomarkers and mood disorders. For example, white blood cell count (WBC) is a nonspecific marker of inflammatory that is often measured as part of a CBC panel. The association between leukocyte subtypes and affective disorders has been demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyteto-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) have recently been proposed as inflammatory markers. These biomarkers appear to be associated with mood disorders, supporting the inflammatory hypothesis underlying the etiopathogenesis of these conditions. To date, several studies have examined the validity of NLR, PLR, and MLR as potential biomarkers for differentiating BPD from UPD.

In terms of biochemical indicators, the body's antioxidant defense system includes two categories: enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Although the detection of enzymatic antioxidant substances such as superoxide dismutase and catalase are relatively difficult, the detection of non-enzymatic antioxidant substances such as albumin is included in the routine liver and kidney function tests and can be carried out conveniently. Albumin and other nonenzymatic antioxidants can be used to monitor the body's antioxidant levels. Previous studies have shown that the concentrations of plasma albumin and other non-enzymatic antioxidants are lower in patients with depression; concentration of albumin in the major depressive group was lower than that of the manic group, and both were lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, an association between serum uric acid and depressive symptoms was identified, and changes in blood lipid levels have also been reported to be associated with schizophrenia, UPD and bipolar manic.

Despite unipolar and bipolar depression have different associations with clinical features such as the age of onset and hematologic biomarkers, none of previous works have used such information for differential diagnosis. It is urgent to establish objective features that can be easily accessible in practical settings and develop accurate differential diagnosis models for UPD and BPD. Besides, combining differential traits/biomarkers from multiple domains is encouraged to better represent population heterogeneity originating from different aspects. In this study, using clinical features and hematologic biomarkers, we took the initiative to build and validate an automated differential diagnostic model on a large scale cohort of 1160 eligible patients (918 UPD and 242 BPD) in practical settings.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^344c1c51]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) — tests and workups not recommended: Although "some groups recommend that children with potential PANS have a CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, metabolic panel, and urinalysis", "there is no evidence for the utility of these tests in deciding on either diagnosis or treatment; therefore, they should not be routinely performed". Beyond these, "there is no evidence for the following tests; their use is not recommended for diagnosing PANS:" including "PCR assay for Mycoplasma infection (pharynx)" because "good evidence to support this hypothesis does not exist", the "antinuclear antibody test" in isolation due to "its high false-positive rate", and the "Cunningham panel", which has "very low specificity (eg, 6% for PANS and 10% for PANDAS)" and "is not recommended". If ANA is positive with systemic features and inflammatory markers, "the patient should be referred to a rheumatologist for consideration of an alternate diagnosis to PANS". Regarding broader evaluations, "workups for these conditions are rarely, if ever, helpful", and "such a workup should not be performed… unless symptoms of encephalopathy, seizures, myelitis, or other focal neurologic deficits are present or there is overlap of other neuropsychiatric symptoms typical of these syndromes". "Obtaining imaging is not warranted unless CNS or orbital complications are being evaluated".

### Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease – revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 [^f9831c9b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Secondary prevention among infants — neonatal management emphasizes early detection and evaluation: "Any newborn with signs of sepsis should receive a full diagnostic evaluation and receive antibiotic therapy pending the results of the evaluation". "The evaluation should include a blood culture; a CBC including white blood cell differential and platelet count; a chest radiograph if any abnormal respiratory signs are present; and a lumbar puncture if the newborn is stable enough to tolerate the procedure and sepsis is suspected". "Therapy for the infant should include antimicrobial agents active against GBS (including intravenous ampicillin) as well as other organisms that might cause neonatal sepsis, such as E. coli (AII)". For well-appearing newborns with maternal chorioamnionitis, "should undergo a limited evaluation and receive antibiotic therapy pending culture results (AII)", where "The evaluation should include a blood culture and a CBC including white blood cell differential and platelet count; no chest radiograph or lumbar puncture is needed", and "Consultation with obstetric providers to assess whether chorioamnionitis was suspected is important to determine neonatal management (CIII)". Infants with no maternal chorioamnionitis and no indication for prophylaxis "should be managed according to routine clinical care (CIII)".

### Evaluation of the beckman coulter uniCel DxH 800, beckman coulter LH 780, and abbott diagnostics cell-dyn sapphire hematology analyzers on adult specimens in a tertiary care hospital [^a16744b4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

We evaluated the new Beckman Coulter DxH 800 hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) vs the Abbott Diagnostics Cell-Dyn Sapphire (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA) and Beckman Coulter LH 780 hematology analyzers using 430 adult specimens. The DxH 800 provided a CBC and differential that correlated well with those of the Sapphire and LH 780, with most parameters showing correlation coefficients (r) of more than 0.97. In the instrument vs 400-cell manual differential comparison, all 3 instruments showed similar and acceptable accuracy to the reference method except for nucleated RBC (NRBC) enumeration, in which the DxH 800 and Sapphire outperformed the LH 780. We also compared clinical efficiency by determining whether flagged specimens showed abnormalities on a peripheral blood smear as defined by International Council for Standardization in Haematology criteria. The efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the DxH 800 were 77.0%, 87.1%, and 73.0%, respectively, compared with the Sapphire at 75.8%, 93.5%, and 68.8%, respectively, and LH 780 at 66.1%, 93.5%, and 55.3%, respectively.
