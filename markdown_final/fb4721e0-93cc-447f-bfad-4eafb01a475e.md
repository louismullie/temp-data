## Question

medical term for vision defect involving left visual field

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the proper medical term is for a vision defect involving the left visual field. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this phrasing implies a binocular field phenomenon versus a monocular one. Then, I should verify the classic neuro-ophthalmologic pattern that produces loss on the same side of the visual field in both eyes. Next, I will confirm the laterality naming convention used in clinical practice. After that, I need to consider degrees of field loss and variant descriptors. Finally, I will synthesize the most accurate term and note acceptable alternative spellings or related terms, making sure the terminology aligns with the anatomic localization in the visual pathway [^114EHu34].

> Let me first confirm what "left visual field" typically connotes in neurology and ophthalmology. Wait, let me verify the convention: "visual field" here generally refers to the binocular visual space when looking straight ahead, so a left visual field defect most often means loss of the left hemifield in both eyes rather than a purely monocular defect. I need to ensure that this matches the standard teaching that hemifield language implies binocular correspondence rather than unilateral ocular loss, which is consistent with retrochiasmal pathway involvement rather than prechiasmal optic nerve disease [^114EHu34] [^115EP35Y].

> Next, I should review the pattern that produces corresponding hemifield loss in both eyes. Hold on, I should verify that loss on the same side of the visual field in each eye is termed homonymous and implies a lesion posterior to the optic chiasm. Yes, homonymous hemianopia reflects damage anywhere along the retrochiasmal visual pathways, including optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, or occipital cortex, with stroke being a leading cause in adults. This homonymous pattern specifically distinguishes it from heteronymous defects such as bitemporal loss from chiasmal compression, so I need to be precise about the homonymous qualifier here [^114EHu34] [^111QRcRJ] [^111bUAdU].

> Now, I will confirm the laterality convention. Let me think about how we label side: if the left visual field is affected in both eyes, the term is "left homonymous" because the field loss is leftward and congruent between the two eyes. I should double-check usage in the literature to ensure I'm aligning with common clinical phrasing; case descriptions repeatedly use "left homonymous hemianopia" for this pattern, which reassures me that the laterality tag should be "left" before "homonymous hemianopia" [^113SHRQV] [^112SvXkd] [^115KhHPe].

> I need to consider the degree and variants. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about completeness: the umbrella term "hemianopia" can be complete or incomplete, and when only a quadrant is involved, "quadrantanopia" is used. Even if the question doesn't specify completeness, the general and most encompassing label for a left-sided hemifield loss remains "left homonymous hemianopia", with modifiers added where needed for "incomplete", "superior", or "inferior" quadrants. The large clinical-anatomic series and perimetry reviews consistently treat quadrantanopia as a subset within the homonymous spectrum, so the base term is still appropriate here [^111QRcRJ] [^111bUAdU].

> But wait, what if alternative terms are considered. I should confirm spelling variants: "hemianopia" and "hemianopsia" are both acceptable, with regional preferences. I need to ensure I exclude heteronymous patterns that could also involve "left" portions but are not homonymous, such as bitemporal defects from chiasmal compression or binasal defects from lateral geniculate pathology, which would not be accurately labeled as a "left visual field" defect per se. Therefore, terms like "left hemianopia" without the "homonymous" qualifier are less precise and risk ambiguity regarding lesion localization and binocular congruity [^115EP35Y] [^112oNqEG] [^111zq3Zh].

> Let me reconsider the anatomic implication one more time to ensure accuracy. A left homonymous hemianopia localizes contralateral to the field defect, usually to the right retrochiasmal pathway, most commonly in the occipital lobe or optic radiations, which aligns with the epidemiology of stroke-related homonymous defects. This clinico-anatomic consistency supports the correctness and utility of the term in both clinical communication and coding, so I am confident the synthesized terminology is appropriate [^111QRcRJ] [^114EHu34] [^115EP35Y].

> Final answer: The precise medical term is left homonymous hemianopia, with the alternative spelling left homonymous hemianopsia also acceptable [^114EHu34] [^111QRcRJ].

The medical term for a vision defect involving the left visual field is **left homonymous hemianopia** (or hemianopsia) [^114EHu34], defined as loss of the left half of the visual field in both eyes due to a right retrochiasmal lesion [^111QRcRJ]. The most common causes are **right occipital lobe or optic radiation lesions** [^111QRcRJ], typically from stroke [^115skJ49], tumor, or trauma [^111F8APZ]. Diagnosis is confirmed by **perimetry and neuroimaging** [^111wLEAb] [^115EP35Y], and management includes treating the underlying cause plus visual rehabilitation with prisms and compensatory training [^114EHu34] [^116bhyHN].

---

## Clinical definition and characteristics

- **Definition**: Left homonymous hemianopia is loss of the left visual field in both eyes [^111QRcRJ] from a right retrochiasmal lesion [^114EHu34].

- **Visual field pattern**: The defect respects the vertical midline [^114EHu34] and is congruent or incongruent depending on lesion site [^115EP35Y].

- **Associated symptoms**: Patients have difficulty reading, driving [^115e1f9U], and navigating, with increased risk of injury and reduced independence [^114EHu34].

---

## Anatomical and neurological basis

- **Visual pathway anatomy**: The visual pathway includes the optic nerves, chiasm, tracts, LGN [^114EHu34], optic radiations, and occipital cortex [^115EP35Y].

- **Lesion localization**: Right occipital lobe or optic radiation lesions [^115EP35Y] cause left homonymous hemianopia [^111QRcRJ].

- **Common etiologies**: Stroke is most common [^111QRcRJ], followed by tumors [^115skJ49], trauma, and demyelination [^114EHu34].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical examination**: Confrontation visual fields can screen for defects [^114EHu34] but are insensitive for mild loss [^111rLyT2].

- **Formal perimetry**: Automated perimetry (e.g. Humphrey) [^111wLEAb] confirms and quantifies the defect [^111bUAdU].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI [^111QRcRJ] localizes the lesion and defines etiology [^115EP35Y].

---

## Clinical implications and functional impact

Left homonymous hemianopia impairs reading [^114WeAN1], driving [^115zNi7r], and navigation, reducing independence and quality of life [^114EHu34]. It increases safety risks [^114EHu34], including **falls, collisions, and driving-related accidents** [^115e1f9U]. Psychological effects — such as anxiety, depression, and social isolation — are common [^114EHu34].

---

## Management and treatment strategies

Management focuses on treating the underlying cause (e.g. stroke [^1135XMGT], tumor, or trauma) [^114EHu34]. Visual rehabilitation — including **prisms, compensatory training, and vision restoration therapy** [^11539Dtq] — can improve function [^114EHu34] [^116bhyHN] [^116Dgo22]. A multidisciplinary team involving neurology, ophthalmology, occupational therapy, and psychology is recommended [^114EHu34].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Spontaneous recovery occurs in **about 50% within 3 months**; recovery after 6 months is limited [^117SgE8M]. Long-term outcomes often involve **persistent deficits**, requiring ongoing rehabilitation [^116tnT6x] [^114EHu34].

### Homonymous hemianopias: Clinical-anatomic correlations in 904 cases [^111QRcRJ]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia (HH), research was conducted on its impact and causes. Homonymous hemianopia impairs visual function and frequently precludes driving; most knowledge of HH is based on relatively few cases with clinical-anatomic correlations.

Medical records of all patients with HH seen between 1989 and 2004 were reviewed. Recorded factors included demographic characteristics, characteristics and causes of visual field defects, neuroradiologic definition of lesion location, and associated neurologic deficits.

A total of 904 HH cases were found in 852 patients. Among these, 340 HH (37.6%) were complete, while 564 HH (62.4%) were incomplete. Homonymous quadrantanopia (264 HH, 29%) was identified as the most common type of incomplete HH, followed by homonymous scotomatous defects (116 HH, 13.5%), partial HH (114 HH, 13%), and HH with macular sparing (66 HH, 7%). Furthermore, 407 HH (45.0%) were isolated cases. HH causes included stroke (629 HH, 69.6%), trauma (123, 13.6%), tumor (102, 11.3%), brain surgery (22, 2.4%), demyelination (13, 1.4%), other rare causes (13, 1.4%), and unknown etiology (2, 0.2%). Lesions were commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and optic radiations (32.2%). Every type of HH, except for unilateral loss of temporal crescent and homonymous sectoranopia, was found in all lesion locations along the retrochiasmal visual pathways.

Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. Although detailed characteristics of visual defects are clarified, the association between medical imaging and clinical presentation remains crucial in diagnosis and management.

### Homonymous hemianopia: challenges and solutions [^114EHu34]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Homonymous hemianopia (HH) involves vision loss on the same side of the visual field in both eyes. This type of visual field loss is indicative of a lesion involving the visual pathway posterior to the chiasm. HH can affect the ability to drive or read and may result in injuries due to falls or inability to navigate around obstacles. Identifying and managing these visual difficulties can have a significant effect on a patient's quality of life. This review covers the etiology, clinical examination findings, patient challenges, management options, and prognosis associated with HH.

### Transient cortical blindness following occipital lobe retraction in a pineal region meningioma resection [^111WdjkV]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Transient phenomenon secondary to intraoperative bilateral occipital lobe retraction is believed to be the most likely cause, particularly in the absence of ischemia. Decreased cerebral perfusion can occur due to reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, as seen in cases with high tentorial angles which require increased upward retraction. However, our patient did not have an increased tentorial angle, reducing the requirement for retraction. Optimizing CSF drainage, reducing pressure on the occipital lobe, and thus maximizing perfusion is crucial.

	- Injury to the lateral transverse sinus may result in ischemic damage to the occipital cortex, yet this was not demonstrated on our patient's post-operative MRI scans. Cerebral hypoperfusion due to prolonged hypotension was not evidenced peri-operatively. Additionally, sectioning of the tentorium cerebelli, which reduces drainage of blood from the occipital lobe and decreases perfusion due to venous congestion, was not demonstrated on imaging.

### Traumatic homonymous hemianopia [^111F8APZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the characteristics of patients with homonymous hemianopia from traumatic brain injury (TBI) seen in our unit between 1989 and 2004, we conducted a study that included only patients with a history of TBI who had detailed clinical information and results of neuroimaging. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, types of visual field defects, location of lesion, and evolution of visual field defects were recorded.

Of the 880 patients with homonymous hemianopia seen in our unit, 103 patients (112 with homonymous hemianopia) had TBI (74 men and 29 women, mean age 30.7, SD 15.3 years). The median time from injury to initial visual field testing was 5 months (range 0.5–360 months). In total, 64 (57.1%) patients sustained motor vehicle-related injuries; 19 (17%) violence-related injuries; 17 (15.2%) due to falls; and 12 (10.7%) because of other blunt head trauma. Visual field defects included complete homonymous hemianopia in 44 (39.3%) patients and incomplete homonymous hemianopia in 68 (60.7%) patients. The lesion was occipital in 14 (12.5%) patients, associated with optic radiation in 26 (23.2%), the optic tract in 12 (10.7%), and multiple in 60 (53.6%).

Most cases of homonymous hemianopia from TBI were motor vehicle-related. Patients were younger, more often male, and had multiple brain lesions more often than patients with homonymous hemianopia from causes other than TBI. A median delay of 5 months was observed before the documentation of the homonymous hemianopia, which may have a major effect on the success of rehabilitation.

### The need for hemispheric separation in pairwise structural disconnection studies [^116ZB9Mp]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the partial injury problem also apply to the pooled analysis of lesions in the left and right hemispheres. Even if structures relevant to a function of interest are represented in both hemispheres, as is the case for non-lateralized behaviors, lesion-symptom mapping that analyzes unilateral left and unilateral right lesions together causes voxels of either hemisphere to be statistically underpowered.

In a patient with the behavioral deficit in question and a lesion in the left hemisphere, the neural correlates of that deficit in the opposing right hemisphere are represented as fully intact, whereas these voxels are damaged in a patient with a lesion to the right hemisphere, and vice versa. That, in turn, weakens the association between each hemisphere and the deficit. Voxels of one hemisphere thus act as opponents for voxels of the other. Therefore, individual analyses for each hemisphere have been established as the standard in voxel-wise lesion-symptom mapping (Frenkel-Toledo et al.). However, so far it is unclear whether this problem also applies to pairwise disconnection approaches.

Recent literature addressing target behaviors in patients suffering from brain injury primarily analyzed structural disconnections in a joint analysis, that is, a single analysis based on patients with unilateral left and with unilateral right hemispheric lesions (e.g. Errante et al; Kuceyeski et al; Moore et al; Pan et al; Smaczny et al; Urbanski et al.), and only a minority in individual analyses separated by hemisphere (e.g. Rosenzopf et al.).

### Tracking posttraumatic hemianopia [^116eRts6]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Hemianopia after traumatic brain injury is not infrequent and results from retro-chiasmatic lesions. Differentiating optic pathway lesions can be challenging with classic imaging. Advanced imaging techniques as an investigational tool for posttraumatic hemianopia are discussed, and their pitfalls are highlighted through an illustrative case study.

In a patient with posttraumatic hemianopia, MRI at 8 weeks and 2 years after trauma were analyzed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and morphometric analysis of the primary visual cortex (V1) were performed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was conducted 2 years after trauma. DTI at 8 weeks showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the left optic tract, along with a decrease in FA in the right optic tract and optic radiation. At 2 years, an isolated decrease of the left optic tract FA values was observed, together with signs of Wallerian degeneration on classic MR imaging. OCT showed thinning of the retina, congruent with the visual field deficit.

While DTI abnormalities were also present in the early scan, they were more diffuse and included functionally intact structures. Results of advanced imaging techniques need to be interpreted with caution and can vary according to the timing of imaging due to Wallerian degeneration.

### Cerebral versus cortical visual impairment: Eliminating the conflict and renewing the terminology [^115EWc4v]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The terminology of a condition is an important process by which we conceptualize and name things and events to be able to use this information cognitively. Forming concepts is of profound importance for understanding what we are dealing with. Recently, there has been concern about the terminological variability encountered in the literature regarding a visual disease condition. This condition involves visual impairments that are not clinically detectable as being of ocular or ophthalmological origin. When not of ocular origin, there is the possibility that visual impairments are related to cortical changes affecting the primary visual pathway or higher areas, non-cortical areas such as thalamic and cerebellar lesions, as well as lesions in which more than one of these areas is affected. These different situations lead to functional differences that, in my opinion, have not been adequately considered in the literature.

Vision functional damages not of ocular origin can be found in the scientific literature as Cerebral Visual Impairment and Cortical Visual Impairment. If the diversity of nomenclatures used as synonyms were not enough, it is crucial to note that they represent various diseases, yet both can be expressed by the same acronym CVI. Furthermore, there is no agreement on the ocular manifestation involved in the CVI diagnosis. In a stricter sense, CVI is related exclusively to post-chiasmatic lesions, which clinically do not generate identifiable changes, at least in the initial years after the injury.

### Compensatory strategies following visual search training in patients with homonymous hemianopia: an eye movement study [^115F8AvR]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Visual search training in a group of 29 patients with homonymous hemianopia led to several training-specific changes in saccadic behavior, accompanied by a significant reduction in the mean search times required to locate a single target amongst distractors. After visual search training, patients made a higher proportion of fixations into the hemispace containing the target. Patients were quicker to switch into the hemifield containing the target if the initial saccade had been made into the opposite hemifield. Additionally, patients made fewer transitions from one hemifield to another before locating the target. A larger initial saccade was made by patients, although the direction of the initial saccade did not change. There was a very small but significant increase in the number of saccades made in the direction of the target after training. Furthermore, patients required fewer saccades to locate the target after training, reflecting increased search efficiency. The area within which targets could be fixated in the blind field also increased.

These changes were specific to the period of training; there was no spontaneous change or improvement between visits 1 and 2 (the visits prior to the training phase). Moreover, all the changes observed after training at visit 3 were maintained at visit 4, a month after the training had been completed.

Previous visual search rehabilitation programs designed to treat deficits in visual exploration have primarily aimed at improving disorders of visuo-spatial disorientation apparent in some patients with homonymous hemianopia.

### Compensatory strategies following visual search training in patients with homonymous hemianopia: an eye movement study [^115yBYCS]. Journal of neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Subjects and methods

Subjects

A total of 31 patients (16 female) with visual (18 left; 13 right) field defects, ranging from homonymous quadrantanopia to complete hemianopia, due to post chiasmatic lesions, were recruited (mean age = 46.9 years, range 24–75 years). High resolution structural MRI scans revealed that 22 had cerebral infarctions, 6 had arterio-venous malformations (AVM) which had bled, one had a temporal lobectomy, one had a grade 2 glioma in the occipatal lobe and one had a cystic teratoma. Patients were recruited at least 3 months after the onset of their hemianopia and were aware of their field defects. Visual acuities were corrected to 6/6 using trial or contact lenses. None of the patients had co-existing eye movement pathology, abnormalities on fundoscopy or slit lamp examination, visual neglect or reduced mini mental test scores. All patients gave informed written consent. This study was approved by the local Riverside ethics committee.

Experimental procedure

Training procedure

Patients were trained on a dedicated 21 inch TV monitor (25° × 10°), installed in a quiet darkened room in the patient's own home and used under supervision. Patients searched for a single randomly positioned target element (either lines, squares or triangles) that differed from 40 homogenous distractors by a single feature (size or orientation). Prior to each search, patients initially fixated a central cross for 1 s to ensure that their gaze commenced at the centre of the screen. Search stimuli were presented for a maximum of 3 s and subjects indicated target absence/prese

### Visual field defect during therapy with valproic-acid [^111YPM9a]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Visual field defects have been widely reported during the clinical application of vigabatrin, an antiepileptic drug (AED). However, other gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and non-GABA-ergic AEDs could also affect the visual field through different mechanisms of action. Here we report a case of a 22-year-old female patient who experienced bilateral concentric visual field defects during long-term therapy with valproic acid (VPA). A VPA-related metabolic dysfunction was detected through blood and urine examination. Electroretinography indicated reduced B-waves, and bilateral concentric visual field defect was confirmed by both manual and automated perimetry. In conclusion, while the development of concentric visual field defects related to VPA treatment is rare, it remains a possibility.

### Transient obscuration of vision [^113SHRQV]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A previously well 13-year-old girl presented with a 4-month history of progressively worsening headache and visual disturbance. At her fourth presentation, examination showed bilateral papilloedema and a left homonymous hemianopia. CT and MRI scans revealed a tumour obstructing the third ventricle with consequent hydrocephalus. Following uncomplicated endoscopic surgery, both headache and visual function improved. Several features of the history were highly suggestive of raised intracranial pressure and were initially overlooked.

### Efficacy of visual retraining in the hemianopic field after stroke: Results of a randomized clinical trial [^116bhyHN]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of motion discrimination training as a potential therapy for stroke-induced hemianopic visual field defects.

Forty-eight patients with stroke-induced homonymous hemianopia (HH) were randomized into two training arms: intervention and control. The patients, aged between 21 and 75 years, showed no ocular issues at presentation. Patients were trained on a motion discrimination task previously evidenced to reduce visual field deficits, albeit not in a randomized clinical trial. They were randomized with equal allocation to receive training in either their sighted or deficit visual fields. Training was conducted at home over a period of six months, comprising repeated visual discriminations at a single location for 20 to 30 minutes daily. Both study staff and patients were masked to the training type. Pre- and post-training testing was identical, including assessments using Humphrey visual fields (Carl Zeiss Meditech), macular integrity assessment perimetry, OCT, motion discrimination performance, and visual quality-of-life questionnaires.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measures were changes in perimetric mean deviation (PMD) on the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer in both eyes.

The results showed that mean PMDs improved over six months in deficit-trained patients (mean change in the right eye: 0.58 dB; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–1.08 dB; mean change in the left eye, 0.84 dB; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–1.47 dB). However, no improvement was observed in sighted-trained patients (mean change in the right eye: 0.12 dB; 95% confidence interval).

### Saccadic visual search training: A treatment for patients with homonymous hemianopia [^11539Dtq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a novel rehabilitation tool for patients with homonymous hemianopia based on a visual search (VS) paradigm that is portable, inexpensive, and easy to deploy. We hypothesized that by training patients to improve the efficiency of eye movements made in their blind field, their disability would be alleviated.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine patients with homonymous visual field defects (HVFD) without neglect practiced VS paradigms in 20 daily sessions over one month. Search fields comprising randomly positioned target and distracter elements, differing by a single feature, were displayed for three seconds on a dedicated television monitor in the patients' homes. Improvements were assessed by examining response time (RT), error rates in VS, perimetric visual fields (VFs), and visual search fields (VSFs) before and after treatment. Functional improvements were measured using objective visual tasks that represented activities of daily living (ADL) and a subjective questionnaire.

- **Results**: As a group, the patients had significantly shorter mean RT in VS after training (p < 0.001) and demonstrated a variety of mechanisms to account for this. Improvements were confined to the training period and maintained at follow-up. Three patients had significantly longer RT after training but had high initial error rates, which improved with training. Patients performed ADL tasks significantly faster after training and reported significant subjective improvements. There was no concomitant enlargement of the VF, but there was a small but significant enlargement of the VSF.

### Aortic dissection presenting as gait disturbance: A case report [^111PtBud]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Emergency medicine traditionally teaches that aortic dissection presents as tearing chest pain radiating to the back. This case report describes a 55-year-old woman presenting with left homonymous hemianopsia and a resultant gait disturbance. Initial head computed tomography demonstrated a right parietal infarct, and a chest radiograph revealed a markedly widened mediastinum. An acute Stanford type A aortic dissection was subsequently confirmed. This report provides further evidence for atypical, painless presentations of aortic dissection. Given recent literature on the increasing prevalence of painless dissection, the disease entity should be included in the differential diagnosis for stroke, and a simple portable chest x-ray should always be obtained before administering thrombolytics.

### A systematic review on visual scanning behaviour in hemianopia considering task specificity, performance improvement, spontaneous and training-induced adaptations [^116iP1eM]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

People with homonymous hemianopia (HH) benefit from applying compensatory scanning behaviour that limits the consequences of HH in a specific task. The aim of this study is to (i) review the literature on task-specific scanning behaviour that improves performance and (ii) identify differences between this performance-enhancing scanning behaviour and scanning behaviour that is spontaneously adopted or acquired through training.

The databases PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for articles on scanning behaviour in people with HH.

The final sample contained 60 articles, reporting on three main tasks: search (N = 17), reading (N = 16), and mobility (N = 14), as well as other tasks (N = 18). Five articles reported on two different tasks. Specific scanning behaviour was related to task performance in search, reading, and mobility tasks. In search and reading tasks, spontaneous adaptations differed from this performance-enhancing scanning behaviour. Training could induce adaptations in scanning behaviour, enhancing performance in these two tasks. For mobility tasks, limited to no information was found on spontaneous and training-induced adaptations to scanning behaviour.

Performance-enhancing scanning behaviour is mainly task-specific. The spontaneous development of such scanning behaviour is rare. However, compensatory scanning training programs can induce such scanning behaviour, confirming that providing scanning training is important.

### An unusual cause of visual loss: involvement of bilateral lateral geniculate bodies [^111zq3Zh]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

We report the clinical and radiologic features of a 31-year-old woman who suffered incongruous binasal and bitemporal visual field defects and severe sudden visual loss due to hypoperfusion of bilateral lateral geniculate bodies following anaphylactic shock induced by 500 mg amoxicillin per os. Complete neuro-ophthalmologic examinations were performed regularly for visual acuity, color vision, pupillary reflexes, and visual fields. Additional testing was conducted using MR imaging of the brain and CSF analysis. Follow-up was performed for 12 months. Vision loss was acute and severe, with its onset being bilateral and simultaneous. The patient recovered visual acuity of 1.0 within 7 weeks. Color vision was abnormal in both eyes but gradually improved to normal. Visual fields were characterized by incongruous binasal and bitemporal defects, which progressively reduced.

Cerebral MR imaging confirmed the presence of symmetrical lesions confined exclusively within both lateral geniculate bodies. These lesions were best seen on T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images as high-signal-intensity areas suggestive of hemorrhagic ischemia. CSF analysis was normal and aseptic. Blood tests and cultures excluded any microbial infection. We conclude that shock may induce bilateral isolated ischemia of the lateral geniculate bodies, resulting in incongruous binasal and bitemporal visual field defects and severe visual loss. MR imaging is the optimal imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis and for follow-up.

### Compensatory strategies following visual search training in patients with homonymous hemianopia: An eye movement study [^114u78h5]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Analysis of eye movements was conducted using only target present trials. A fixation was defined as a point where the eye position varied by less than 0.5° over a minimum of 60 ms. Two successive fixations required mean positions at least 0.5° apart. Trials were excluded if subjects made false negative responses, failed to respond within 3 seconds, if the initial fixation did not fall within 1° of the central fixation cross, or if no fixations fell within 2° of the target.

Three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA, SPSS version 9), using visit (four visits, two pre-, and two post-training), target position (target located in the blind vs. seeing field), and target type (15°, 30°, 45°) as factors, was employed to analyze the following oculomotor parameters: fixation duration, saccade amplitude, and number of saccades. Directional and hemispace analyses were also considered. Directional analysis focused on the number of saccades made towards the hemianopic and intact hemifields. For hemispace analysis, the midline of the screen was the dividing line between the hemianopic and intact hemispace.

The visual lobe is commonly defined as the area within which a target can be fixated within a single saccade. Lobe size is a function of target and background characteristics and, in patients with homonymous hemianopia (HH), is highly asymmetric with a constricted visual area in the blind hemifield. Here, the visual lobe was defined as the area within which the target was fixated during the next saccade.

### Scanning the visual world: A study of patients with homonymous hemianopia [^116njbTf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

This study examined the scanpaths of patients with homonymous hemianopia while viewing naturalistic pictures in their original and spatially filtered forms. Features of their scanpaths, with respect to various saccade and fixation parameters, were examined to determine whether they develop compensatory eye movement strategies. The effects of various lesion parameters, including location, size, and age, on the evolution of such strategies were considered.

- **Methods**: Eye movements of eight patients with homonymous hemianopia (four left, four right), but lacking neglect, were recorded while they viewed 22 images of real scenes. These movements were compared with those of eight age-matched controls. Subjects viewed each image for 3 seconds, initially in a spatially filtered form in which much of the semantic content had been removed, and then in their original, unfiltered form.

- **Results**: Patients differed significantly from controls in various fixation and saccade parameters. For fixation parameters, patients with hemianopia fixated on different spatial positions compared to controls. They made more fixations, which were more widely distributed and of shorter duration than those of controls, and spent a greater proportion of their total fixation time in the area corresponding to their blind hemifield. They did not make significantly more refixations than controls. For saccade parameters, patients made more saccades into their blind hemifield. These saccades had shorter latencies and shorter amplitudes than those made into their seeing field and resulted in longer scanpaths than those of control subjects.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^117DQGYK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Axonal degeneration is a phenomenon of the central and peripheral nervous systems wherein a nerve fiber loses function after an injury. This process begins at the site of injury and can occur in an anterograde (Wallerian) fashion toward the post-synaptic end or in a retrograde fashion toward the presynaptic cell body. This degeneration applies to the injured nerve body and axon and can occur as early as 5–30 minutes following a traumatic event. When the degeneration crosses a synapse, it is referred to as trans-synaptic, and this can also proceed in an anterograde or retrograde mechanism. Anterograde transneuronal degeneration occurs secondary to the loss of excitatory input to the post-synaptic neuron. Retrograde transneuronal damage is theorized to be caused by a loss of trophic support from the injured cell to the presynaptic dendritic tree.

Examples of neuronal degeneration can be observed in the human visual pathway. In glaucoma, the site of pathology or injury is the optic nerve head. Retrograde degeneration can be identified by thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and, more recently, the ganglion cell complex (GCC) of the retina. Anterograde degeneration in glaucoma can be evidenced by optic nerve atrophy on neuroimaging and evidence of trans-synaptic damage by demonstrating morphological changes in the visual processing cortex and loss of cell density in the lateral geniculate nucleus of macaque monkeys after enucleation. However, there is little evidence of retrograde transneuronal degeneration in the human visual pathway.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^1147YyG8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Compensatory training can improve eye and head scanning movements and aid patients in using their residual vision more efficiently for performing desired tasks. Training should include activities that enhance general visual attention skills, increase the number and amplitude of saccades into the impaired hemifield, and develop a more organized pattern of eye movements. Additionally, strategies to remedy specific scanning deficits, such as improving reading or visual search abilities, should be employed.

One method of compensatory training involves the use of standardized colored lights along a horizontal plane. This system requires participants to use both head and eye movements. The exercises become more complex, ultimately enabling patients to perform systematic and accurate search patterns. Mobility scanning strategies are then utilized, starting in a structured environment and progressing to a complicated, dynamic environment. Some programs teach a rigid systematic search strategy, while others involve searching for randomly placed targets among distractors. Patients are asked to fixate on the target as quickly as possible, moving only the eyes, without any specific scanning strategy being suggested to them.

Teaching systematic scanning tactics results in more organized and efficient search times. The area in which patients can locate targets can be increased by up to 30°. More significantly, visual training can enhance mobility and the ability to navigate while avoiding obstacles. In one study, 91% of participants were able to return to part-time work following training.

### Structural anatomy of pure and hemianopic alexia [^111vsQwR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The two most common types of acquired reading disorders resulting from damage to the territory of the dominant posterior cerebral artery are hemianopic and pure alexia. Patients with pronounced hemianopic alexia have a right homonymous hemianopia that encroaches into central or parafoveal vision; they read individual words well but generate inefficient reading saccades when reading along a line of text. Patients with pure alexia also often have a hemianopia but are more disabled, making frequent errors on individual words; they have sustained damage to a brain region that supports efficient word identification.

- **Objective**: To investigate the differences in lesion sites between hemianopic alexia and pure alexia groups, as rehabilitative techniques differ between the two conditions.

- **Methods**: High-resolution magnetic resonance images were obtained from seven patients with hemianopic alexia and from six patients with pure alexia caused by a left occipital stroke. The boundary of each lesion was defined, and lesion volumes were then transformed into a standard stereotactic space so that regional comparisons could be made.

- **Results**: The two patient groups did not differ in terms of damage to the medial left occipital lobe, but those with pure alexia had additional lateral damage to the posterior fusiform gyrus and adjacent tissue.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians will be able to predict the type of reading disorder that patients with left occipital lesions have from simple tests of reading speed and the distribution of damage to the left occipital lobe on brain imaging.

### Compensatory strategies following visual search training in patients with homonymous hemianopia: an eye movement study [^115Yo4uv]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Homonymous hemianopia (HH), the loss of vision in one half of the visual field, results from unilateral lesions of the geniculostriate pathway. Although a degree of spontaneous recovery may occur in some patients with HH, it is rarely sufficient to remove the disabling consequences of visual field loss — difficulties in reading, driving, and visual exploration, and deficits of visuo-spatial orientation. Although a small minority of patients with hemianopia appear to retain sensitivity to briefly flashed or moving stimuli within their blind field, this residual vision appears inaccessible to conscious perception and action.

Rehabilitation of patients with HH, once thought an untreatable condition, has recently become a matter of intense debate. Several groups have claimed restitution of visual function and consequent visual field enlargement by repeated visual stimulation, usually at the border of the scotoma, and changes in cortical representation in the pre-striate cortex as a result of training have also been reported. Other studies have found no effect of training on visual field enlargement. However, rigorous control of fixation during training eliminates significant visual field enlargement, an observation which has led to controversy over the very existence of visual field enlargement.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of arterial stroke mimics: A pictorial review [^114UmDeG]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old woman with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) presented with left homonymous hemianopsia. Hyperintensity on DWI (a) and FLAIR (c) was observed, along with subtle restriction on ADC (b, arrowheads). Time-of-flight (TOF) images showed regional arterial vasodilatation (d, arrows). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy displayed a significantly elevated lactate peak at 1.3 ppm (dotted arrow) and a decreased NAA peak in the normal-appearing brain. A new lesion appeared 3 months later (f, g); the patient presented with right homonymous hemianopsia.

Finally, stroke-like episodes may recur, but lesions tend to appear in different cerebral locations.

### Clinical reasoning: A 60-year-old man with rapidly progressive left hemibody weakness and vision loss [^113icqJD]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

A 60-year-old man presented with two weeks of progressive left-sided weakness, dysarthria, and an incongruous left homonymous hemianopsia. MRI brain imaging showed a lesion involving the right cerebral peduncle, optic radiation, and dorsal midbrain. Serum and CSF testing was largely unremarkable. His weakness worsened rapidly, and short-interval repeat imaging demonstrated expansion of the brainstem abnormality. A methodical investigation of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and paraneoplastic causes ultimately yielded the diagnosis. This case provides a comprehensive differential for atypical brainstem lesions, which can pose a diagnostic dilemma, particularly when CSF studies are unrevealing and the location is not amenable to biopsy. In such situations, a systematic approach, including whole-body imaging, can aid in diagnosis.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^115e1f9U]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Impairment of the visual field can be debilitating. In addition to the inability to drive, read, or navigate, the loss of independence and inability to enjoy leisure activities can have significant emotional and social implications. Understanding these restrictions can aid in rehabilitation and making the best use of remaining vision.

Inability to drive decreases independence, limits employment opportunities, and increases the risk of depression. In many areas of the US, patients with homonymous hemianopia (HH) do not meet the legal driving requirements. A binocular visual field of at least 110° is required in 27 states. Despite this, some continue to drive illegally, and 12 states have no minimum visual field requirement for driving. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with safety concerns as well as available options for these patients.

Drivers with HH have an impaired ability to detect and react to pedestrians on the side of the vision loss. In a driving simulator, those with HH naturally make more head scans toward the blind side compared with normally sighted individuals; however, the scans tend to be of equal or smaller magnitude. Due, in part, to the smaller scans, simulated pedestrians are detected less than half of the time.

In an on-road driving evaluation, 41% of HH drivers had trouble controlling the vehicle position, 36% had problems adjusting their speed to traffic conditions, 27% did not respond adequately to unexpected events, and 27% had unusually bad driving maneuvers. Despite these problems, 73%–77% are deemed safe to drive in noninterstate conditions.

### Optic tract shrinkage limits visual restoration after occipital stroke [^116tnT6x]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) or its immediate afferents causes a homonymous, contra-lesional visual field defect known as cortically induced blindness (CB). Around 70% of CB occurs after occipital stroke, with trauma, surgical resection, and tumors accounting for the rest. Although partial recovery can occur spontaneously in the first few months after damage and there is potential for training-induced vision restoration, reviewed below, CB remains a permanent condition.

Medical treatment for CB does not routinely include visual restoration training, instead focusing on compensatory (primarily saccade training) or substitution (primarily prism lenses) strategies. Nevertheless, work from our group and others has shown that visual restoration training that requires participants to detect, identify, or discriminate particular features of targets presented in the blind-field can partially restore vision in CB, as measured by both clinical perimetry and psychophysical tests of visual performance. However, these restoration studies show considerable individual variability in the efficacy of training among CB patients, and the training required tends to be intensive, laborious, and lengthy. As we consider introducing restoration therapies clinically, it is important to understand the root causes of this variability so as to identify which patients are most likely to benefit and when.

### Clinical reasoning: An 80-year-old woman with a homonymous hemianopsia [^112SvXkd]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

An 80-year-old woman who was experiencing visual symptoms for 2 years was found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia (HH). On further evaluation the following month, she was noted to have simultanagnosia and alexia. MRI of the brain did not reveal a structural etiology for the symptoms. [¹⁸F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT was performed to aid in the diagnostic investigation. This case of posterior cortical atrophy highlights the differential diagnosis of a HH in the absence of a structural lesion on MRI and the role of FDG PET-CT imaging in such patients.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: A retrospective observational study [^112oNqEG]. Clinical ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Apart from detailing temporal hemifield defects, the present study revealed that visual field defects extend into the nasal hemifield, which also demonstrates left-right asymmetry in many cases. Advanced bitemporal visual field defects in pituitary adenoma patients are likely to be followed by visual field loss in the nasal hemifield. This could be attributed to damaged uncrossed nerve fibers, either because the growing pituitary tumor may directly damage the uncrossed fibers or because the tumor compresses the uncrossed fibers in the lateral part of the optic chiasm against the surrounding structures.

In addition to the left-right asymmetry, pituitary adenoma also causes upper-lower asymmetry. Although one earlier study demonstrated the trend toward greater total deviation of Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results in the superotemporal quadrant compared to the inferotemporal quadrant, the details of upper-lower asymmetry in patients with pituitary adenoma were poorly investigated in the literature. In the present study, by investigating the frequency of severe scotoma instead of total deviation, we successfully demonstrated upper-lower asymmetry with upper-dominant deterioration in the temporal hemifield and lower-dominant deterioration in the nasal hemifield.

The pattern of asymmetry, showing upper-dominant deterioration in the temporal hemifield and lower-dominant deterioration in the nasal hemifield, may conform to Hedges' report, in which visual field damage in the inferonasal quadrant precedes damage in the superonasal quadrant. The mechanism for this asymmetry is not fully elucidated and warrants further investigation.

### Natural history of homonymous hemianopia [^117SgE8M]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

To describe the characteristics of spontaneous recovery of homonymous hemianopia (HH), the authors reviewed medical records of all patients with HH confirmed by formal visual field testing and seen in follow-up in their service between 1989 and 2004. Clinical characteristics, causes, neuroradiologic definition of lesion location, final outcome, and evolution of the visual field defects were recorded. The associations among final visual field defect outcome, time from injury, and clinical features were analyzed.

A total of 254 patients with 263 HH were included in this study. Spontaneous visual field defect recovery was observed in 101 HH (38.4%). The likelihood of spontaneous recovery decreased with increasing time from injury to initial visual field testing (p = 0.0003). The probability of improvement was related to the time since injury (p = 0.0003), with a 50 to 60% chance of improvement for cases tested within 1 month after injury, decreasing to about 20% for cases tested 6 months after surgery. No other factor was found to correlate with the final outcome of the visual field defects. Improvement after 6 months from injury was mild and usually related to the improvement of the underlying disease.

Spontaneous improvement of homonymous hemianopia is seen in at least 50% of patients first seen within 1 month of injury. In most cases, the improvement occurs within the first 3 months from injury. Spontaneous improvement after 6 months postinjury should be interpreted with caution as it is most likely related to the improvement of the underlying disease.

### Cryptococcus gattii genotype VGIIa infection in man, Japan, 2007 [^114nVj2T]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In 2007, a 44-year-old man, a sign painter from Japan, who was not infected with HIV, presented at the University of Tokyo Hospital with a 2-month history of headaches and loss of right-sided vision in both eyes (right homonymous hemianopsia). He had been diagnosed with hyperglycemia three years prior to admission but declined to seek medical treatment. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable. He was an ex-smoker, rarely consumed alcohol, and was not taking any prescription medications, including corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. His travel history included trips to Guam in 1990 and Saipan in 1999, with no other overseas travel. The patient reported exposure to his dog and did not spend time in wilderness areas. He often worked near construction sites in urban locations.

Upon hospitalization, the patient was afebrile, with stable vital signs. A physical examination revealed agraphia (inability to write), anarithmia (inability to count numbers), right homonymous hemianopsia, and a positive Romberg sign. Laboratory evaluations showed elevated glucose (367 mg/dL) and hemoglobin A1c (10.5%) levels. Results of a complete blood cell count and hepatic and renal function tests were within normal limits, as were electrolyte and C-reactive protein levels. A test for antibodies to HIV-1/2 returned negative results.

An enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 4.4 × 4.1 × 3.3 cm lobulated mass in the left occipital lobe with surrounding edema. The lesion displayed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and moderate signal intensity on T2-weighted images.

### Anton's syndrome: A rare and unusual form of blindness [^111NKawJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Anton syndrome is characterized by visual anosognosia. It results from damage to both occipital lobes, while the anterior visual pathways remain intact. We describe four cases of Anton's syndrome:

- **Case 1**: A 73-year-old woman presented with two separate events of intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, 4 years apart. Her first stroke affected the left occipital lobe and the second affected the right occipital lobe. Bilateral occipital lobe damage resulted in cortical blindness.

- **Case 2**: An 88-year-old man suffered from two ischemic strokes, 2 days apart. Each stroke involved one posterior cerebral artery, resulting in bilateral occipital and temporal lobe infarcts.

- **Case 3**: A 64-year-old woman with chronic renal failure suffered bilateral occipital lobe infarction after hemodialysis, due to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

- **Case 4**: An 80-year-old woman experienced a basilar artery stroke, resulting in bilateral thalamic, temporal, and occipital lobe infarction.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^117DMtTA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

A representative case (patient 1) is a 57-year-old man who presented to the neuro-ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of a visual field defect found on routine ophthalmologic testing. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Confrontation visual field testing revealed a dense right homonymous hemianopsia. The remainder of the clinical examination, including pupillary assessment, intraocular pressure, and external slit-lamp and funduscopic evaluation, was within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained that demonstrated an old left occipital infarction with encephalomalacia (Figure 3).

Automated HVF 30–2 testing corroborated the confrontation fields, with a mean deviation (MD) of -29.6 dB for the right hemifield of the right eye and -31.2 dB for the right hemifield in the left eye, with an MD of 1.15 dB and 1.5 dB in the respective left hemifields (Figure 1). The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) showed an average affected nasal thickness of 104 μm in the affected nasal quadrant and 95 μm in the unaffected nasal quadrant. The combined temporal/superior/inferior value was 120 μm for the unaffected sectors compared with 109 μm for the affected sectors (Figure 2A).

- **Generalized thinning**: The ganglion cell complex (GCC) demonstrated generalized thinning, which was more prominent for the hemisphere corresponding to the visual field defect (Figure 2B). The right eye demonstrated an average thickness of 87.5 μm in the temporal unaffected sectors compared with 62.5 μm in the nasal affected sectors. Similarly, for the left eye, the measurements were 82 μm versus 73 μm in the unaffected and affected sectors, respectively.

### Programme choice for perimetry in neurological conditions (PoPiN): A systematic review of perimetry options and patterns of visual field loss [^111bUAdU]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The most commonly reported patterns of visual field defect for IIH included arcuate (predominantly superiorly), constriction, and blind-spot enlargement. The patterns of visual field defect most commonly reported in cases of optic neuropathy are the most diverse of the four conditions; these were altitudinal defects, central, cecocentral and paracentral scotomas, diffuse depression, arcuate defects, and constriction. The most commonly reported patterns of visual field defect for chiasmal compression included hemianopic and quadrantanopic defects, predominantly to the temporal side. In the case of stroke, the most commonly reported patterns of visual field defect were homonymous hemianopic and quadrantanopic defects.

With the exception of optic neuropathy and IIH, the majority of patterns of visual field defects reported are peripheral defects. The 30–2 program and equivalents detect the presence of central defects, however, do not show peripheral defects, so cannot display the full extent of the visual field loss and may not detect visual field loss until it is further advanced such that it also affects the central field.

A limitation of this review was the restriction of targeting four common neurological conditions which cause visual field loss. Furthermore, the types of optic neuropathy were also limited. It is therefore not inclusive of all neurological conditions.

### Intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients with isolated homonymous hemianopia: Analysis of Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR) [^1135XMGT]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Hemianopia can cause considerable disability. Only scarce data are available for ischemic stroke patients presenting with isolated homonymous hemianopia and being treated with intravenous thrombolysis. We analyzed the outcomes of such patients registered in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR).

- **Methods**: The SITS-ISTR (n = 45,079) was searched for patients who presented with isolated homonymous hemianopia. We identified 72 such patients and reported their baseline and demographic characteristics, radiological data, change in their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score within 7 days after thrombolysis, and their 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Univariate analysis of parameters associated with any improvement was performed. Hemianopia was assessed with perimetric examination.

- **Results**: Of 72 patients, 40 (56%) improved within 7 days after thrombolysis; 19 (26%) had full recovery. Those who improved had significantly lower systolic blood pressure before thrombolysis and were less often administered antiplatelet agents before the index stroke. Infarction was visible on the 24-hour computed tomography scan in 65% of patients who improved compared with 81.2% of those without improvement (P = 0.32). No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in patients who improved compared with 1 (3.1%) patient in the non-improved group (P = 0.08). Seventy-one percent of all patients had a 3-month mRS score of 0 to 2, and 51% had an mRS score of 0 to 1. Those who improved within 7 days had a significantly better outcome.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^115skJ49]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The potential causes of homonymous hemianopia (HH) are dependent on the age of the patient. The most common cause of HH in adults is stroke. Approximately 8%–10% of stroke patients have permanent HH, and 52%–70% of hemianopias are caused by stroke. As the population ages and stroke patients live longer, the incidence of stroke and resultant HH is likely to increase.

Other common causes of HH include traumatic brain injury (14% of HH cases) and tumors (11% of HH cases). Less common causes of HH include conditions that may present as temporary HH with spontaneous recovery due to migraine, occipital, parietal, or temporal lobe seizures, or transient ischemic attack. Nonketotic hyperglycemia can also cause HH that resolves with the normalization of blood sugar.

In children aged ≤ 18 years, the most common causes of HH are tumors (27%–39%), brain injury (19%–34%), infarction (11%–23%), and cerebral hemorrhage (7%–11%).

### Homonymous hemianopia in the primary antiphospholipid syndrome [^113GJgts]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A woman aged 26 years was referred by her GP to the eye casualty department with sudden-onset left homonymous hemianopia and a right-sided headache. A full ophthalmic examination was normal, except for a left homonymous hemianopia confirmed with automated perimetry. Urgent CT imaging revealed a non-haemorrhagic cerebral infarct in the right parieto-occipital region. Subsequent blood tests confirmed a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, showing positivity in IgG anticardiolipin antibody, IgG anti-β2-GP1 antibody, and the lupus anticoagulant screen. MRI revealed an extensive congenital abnormality at the Circle of Willis, affecting the right half of circulation. The unique dual pathologies may explain her predisposition to right-sided cerebral infarctions. This case highlights a rare but potentially fatal cause of visual disturbance in a young patient and the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in diagnosis and management.

### Read-right: A "web app" that improves reading speeds in patients with hemianopia [^112hRwV6]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

We developed a novel, adaptive, automated visual field test for assessing hemianopia in patients with text reading difficulties. We tested six points at 1°, 2.5°, 5°, and 10° eccentricity from the fixation cross in both visual fields; four in each along the horizontal meridian, as this is key for text reading (Figure 1). This test has been validated by comparing it with a clinical 'gold standard', the Humphrey automated perimeter (both 10–2 and 24–2 protocols), and has sensitivities in the range of 0.8–1 and specificities of 0.75–1 for the affected hemifield along the horizontal meridian. In most subjects (26/33), we were able to obtain pre- and post-therapy fields to see if these changed over time.

### High 11 C-methionine uptake in a parasellar inflammatory pseudotumor [^115VS8xf]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A 20-year-old man presented with left visual impairment and homonymous hemianopsia. MRI findings suggested the enlargement of an optic glioma, as an optic glioma had been indicated by MRI 14 years earlier without a definitive pathological diagnosis. 11 C-methionine (MET) PET scan showed high uptake in the tumor located in the parasellar region. A transnasal endoscopic biopsy was conducted, and histopathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of an inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT). High MET uptake in a parasellar IPT has apparently not been documented previously. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of high MET uptake in IPT, as this image could present an interpretative challenge.

### Brain networks of spatial awareness: evidence from diffusion tensor imaging tractography [^112fsEQQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Left unilateral neglect, a dramatic condition that impairs awareness of left-sided events, has been classically reported after right hemisphere cortical lesions involving the inferior parietal region. More recently, the involvement of long-range white matter tracts has been highlighted, consistent with the idea that awareness of events occurring in space depends on the coordinated activity of anatomically distributed brain regions. Damage to the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), linking parietal to frontal cortical regions, or to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), connecting occipital and temporal lobes, has been described in neglect patients.

In this study, four right-handed patients with right hemisphere strokes underwent high definition anatomical MRI with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences and a pencil and paper neglect battery of tests. We used DTI tractography to visualize the SLF, ILF, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), a pathway running the depth of the temporal lobe, not previously associated with neglect. Two patients with cortical involvement of the inferior parietal and superior temporal regions, but intact and symmetrical fasciculi, showed no signs of neglect. The other two patients with signs of left neglect had superficial damage to the inferior parietal cortex and white matter damage involving the IFOF. These findings suggest that superficial damage to the inferior parietal cortex may not be sufficient to produce visual neglect. In some cases, a lesion to the direct connections between ventral occipital and frontal regions may be necessary.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^116o4zZf]. Clinical ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

In this study, analysis of both the RNFL and the GCC were included to demonstrate retrograde transneuronal degeneration in patients with homonymous hemianopsia caused by cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Prior to the algorithm for GCC measurement, the best way to indirectly measure the nerve fiber layer was to use the RNFL function on OCT. The RNFL is primarily reported divided into four quadrants: temporal, nasal, superior, and inferior. This distinction is less than ideal for evaluating post-chiasmatic visual field defects, since the temporal quadrant contains retinal fibers from the temporal retina as well as the maculopapillary bundle nasal to the fovea. This allows for both the nasal and temporal visual fields to be represented in the same measurement and could be a confounder when attempting to analyze visual field defects that respect the midline.

To demonstrate retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration, a right occipital lesion would cause thinning of the nasal nerve fiber of the right eye and temporal nerve fiber of the left eye. This becomes further challenging as the peripapillary nerve fiber layer is not symmetric at baseline in normal subjects. In general, the inferior quadrant is thickest, followed by the superior, nasal, and temporal.

The fovea represents the physiologic division between crossed and uncrossed fibers to the visual cortex, and at baseline is symmetric between the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants. For these reasons, the GCC analysis is a more straightforward way to demonstrate thinning as it is projected to the visual cortex.

### Motion area V5/MT+ response to global motion in the absence of V1 resembles early visual cortex [^111Tj8Gx]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

The study involved participants with chronic unilateral damage to V1, leading to homonymous visual field loss as recorded by Humphrey perimetry. Seven individuals, aged 38–76, were recruited, with damage caused by either posterior circulation stroke (n = 5) or benign tumor resection (n = 2) at least 6 months prior (range: 6–252 months post-lesion). Fig. 1 demonstrates their radiology and visual field schemata. Exclusion criteria included additional non-correctable visual impairment and prior neurological disease.

Six age-matched individuals (ages 25–68) were recruited as controls, all having normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological conditions. Participants came from ophthalmological or stroke services across three UK centers, with testing conducted at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. Written informed consent was obtained, and the study received ethical approval from the Oxford Research Ethics Committee: Ref B 08/H0605/156.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^111rLyT2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Homonymous hemianopia (HH) is the main consequence of an occipital lobe lesion. Damage to the occipital lobe usually does not produce other neurological manifestations, although some patients may experience photopsias or other hallucinations in the blind hemifield.

Reliable neurological visual fields are easy to simulate with automated perimetry, even in individuals who have never previously performed visual field testing. A spiral pattern with Goldmann perimetry, a tubular field with tangent screen testing, or a cloverleaf pattern with automated visual fields is indicative of functional visual loss. If nonorganic visual field loss is suspected, the visual field can be tested by asking the patient to saccade into the supposedly hemianopic field. The patient assumes you are testing eye movements, so they will not realize that they should not be accurately saccading to the target.

### Clinical reasoning: A 67-year-old woman with progressive headache, visual hallucinations, and seizures [^11469QYR]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for three months due to new-onset headaches and meningismus that progressed to focal neurologic deficits. These first manifested as episodes of flashing lights and black blotches obscuring her vision for minutes. She also began to have visual hallucinations with formed letters and words projected onto nearby walls. She developed gait unsteadiness and had difficulty using her phone and reading a clock. She was seen by neuro-ophthalmology and found to have a left homonymous hemianopsia, at which point she was admitted for further evaluation.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs, left homonymous hemianopsia, simultagnosia and agraphesthesia, and asymmetric reflexes with an upgoing toe on the left. A brain MRI revealed asymmetric, bilateral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal abnormalities and extensive leptomeningeal enhancement. In the hospital, the patient suffered a seizure and was started on an anticonvulsant. Initial testing for infectious, inflammatory, and malignant conditions was unrevealing. A brain biopsy was ultimately performed, and a diagnosis was made.

We discuss the differential diagnosis of progressive new headache and meningismus, the localization of the symptoms and examination, and the initial workup pursued in advance of biopsy. After a discussion of the pathologic diagnosis, we discuss treatment and management, as well as outline atypical features in our case as compared with prior literature. This case provides a pathologic diagnosis and offers correlation with the patient's clinical-radiological presentation.

### Recovery of visual-field defects after occipital lobe infarction: A perimetric study [^112oVPVz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the temporal course of homonymous visual-field defects resulting from occipital lobe infarction using automated perimetry.

- **Methods**: 32 patients with ischemic infarction of the occipital lobe were studied prospectively using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer II. The visual field of each eye was divided into central, paracentral, and peripheral zones. The mean visual sensitivity of each zone was calculated and used for statistical analysis. The results of the initial examination, conducted within 2 weeks of stroke, were compared with results from a sixth-month follow-up. Lesions were assigned to specific localizations — optic radiation, striate cortex, occipital pole, and occipital convexity — based on MRI.

- **Results**: A statistically significant improvement was noted, particularly for the lower quadrants. Lesions at the occipital pole and convexity were not significantly associated with visual-field recovery. In contrast, involvement of the striate cortex and extensive lesions across all studied areas were significantly associated with a poor prognosis.

- **Conclusions**: Homonymous visual-field defects in our patients improved within 6 months, with notable restoration in the lower quadrants and peripheral zones. Incomplete damage to the striate cortex, which has a varied vascular supply, might explain this observation. The magnification factor theory — relating to the increase in receptive-field size of striate cortex cells with visual-field eccentricity — may account for the more pronounced improvement in peripheral zones.

### Prevention of postoperative visual field defect after the occipital transtentorial approach: Anatomical study [^114kjfMi]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

A postoperative visual field defect resulting from damage to the occipital lobe during surgery is a unique complication of the occipital transtentorial approach. Although the association between patient position and this complication is well investigated, preventing the complication remains a challenge. The objective of this study is to define the area of the occipital lobe in which retraction is least harmful by examining the surface anatomy of the brain, the course of the optic radiations, and the microsurgical anatomy of the occipital transtentorial approach.

- **Methods**: Twelve formalin-fixed cadaveric adult heads were examined with the aid of a surgical microscope and 0° and 45° endoscopes. The optic radiations were studied using fiber dissection and MR tractography techniques.

- **Results**: The arterial and venous relationships of the lateral, medial, and inferior surfaces of the occipital lobe were defined anatomically. The full course of the optic radiations was displayed via both fiber dissection and MR tractography. Although the stems of the optic radiations as exposed by both techniques are similar, the terminations of the fibers are slightly different. The occipital transtentorial approach provides access for removing lesions involving the splenium, pineal gland, collicular plate, cerebellomesencephalic fissure, and anterosuperior part of the cerebellum. An angled endoscope can aid in exposing the superior medullary velum and superior cerebellar peduncles.

- **Conclusions**: Anatomical findings suggest that retracting the inferior surface of the occipital lobe may avoid direct damage and perfusion deficits.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^1129k1wf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The GCC analysis differed from the RNFL in that the GCC was compared using the affected and unaffected hemiretina, so each eye had a pair of datum points. For example, for patients with right homonymous hemianopsia, the temporal hemiretina of the left eye was labeled affected and the nasal hemiretina was labeled unaffected. The GCC algorithm on SD-OCT (Cirrus HD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA) divides the macula into six equal sectors across a horizontal meridian. At baseline, all segments should be of equal thickness. To establish a thickness measurement for the nasal macula, the superonasal sector and the inferonasal sector were averaged; similarly, the temporal thickness was calculated as the average of the superotemporal and inferotemporal sectors. The affected hemiretinal measurements were compared against a group of all unaffected sectors (Figure 2B). The inferior and superior segments were left out of the analysis as there is no vertical midline to keep the crossed and uncrossed fibers separated.

The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Since visual field data follows a normal distribution, a matched Student's t-test was used to compare the mean deviation of affected and unaffected quadrants (n = 34). The RNFL and GCC analyses were obtained using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests because of the lack of normal distribution and small sample size. The HVF MD and GCC analysis compared affected versus unaffected hemifields/hemiretinas while the RNFL analysis compared nasal fibers between affected and unaffected regions.

### Spared perilesional V1 activity underlies training-induced recovery of luminance detection sensitivity in cortically-blind patients [^116Dgo22]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) causes homonymous visual-field loss long considered intractable. Multiple studies now show that perceptual training can restore visual functions in chronic cortically-induced blindness (CB). A popular hypothesis is that training can harness residual visual functions by recruiting intact extrageniculostriate pathways. Training may also induce plastic changes within spared regions of the damaged V1.

Here, we link changes in luminance detection sensitivity with retinotopic fMRI activity before and after visual discrimination training in eleven patients with chronic, stroke-induced CB. We show that spared V1 activity representing perimetrically-blind locations prior to training predicts the amount of training-induced recovery of luminance detection sensitivity. Additionally, training results in an enlargement of population receptive fields in perilesional V1, which increases blind-field coverage and may support further recovery with subsequent training.

These findings uncover fundamental changes in perilesional V1 cortex underlying training-induced restoration of conscious luminance detection sensitivity in CB.

### Retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in homonymous hemianopsia [^112mAgGq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between the topographic reduction in macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, as detected with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and visual field defects caused by ischemic occipital cortical injury.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective review of all patients who presented to our eye institution between January 2012 and July 2014 with visual field defects secondary to ischemic cortical injury. The visual field defect pattern and mean deviation were analyzed. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular GCC were both assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Patients with any ocular pathology that could affect these measurements were excluded. The topographic relationship of visual field defect to reduction in GCC was specifically analyzed.

- **Results**: Nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Their average age was 65 years (range: 57–73 years); eight were men, and six had right hemianopsias. The laterality of the visual field defect was used to assign an affected and unaffected side of analysis for RNFL and GCC layer thickness. A right hemianopsia meant that the nasal fibers of the right eye and temporal fibers of the left eye were assigned as the "affected side", and the temporal fibers of the right eye and nasal fibers of the left eye were assigned as "unaffected". There was no statistically significant difference between affected and unaffected RNFL; however, there was a significant difference in GCC layer reduction between the affected and unaffected sides (P = 0.029).

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that there is a significant topographic reduction in GCC thickness associated with visual field defects in patients with ischemic occipital cortical injury.

### Homonymous hemianopia: Challenges and solutions [^114WeAN1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Left-to-right readers with left homonymous hemianopia (HH) face challenges in reading, particularly finding subsequent lines of text. The initial part of a word is crucial for quick identification, and those with left-sided visual field defects often make frequent reading errors.

Hemianopia poses difficulties in evaluating the environment, leading to disorientation, trouble crossing the street, bumping into objects, inability to detect hazards, and increased risk of falling. Patients with HH make more saccades toward the blind field, though these movements are less accurate and systematic. This results in significantly longer search times, explaining the challenges faced in locating objects. Moreover, the slowed search patterns impede the comprehension of the environment, making it difficult to avoid obstacles.

### Adaptation to post-stroke homonymous hemianopia - a prospective longitudinal cohort study to identify predictive factors of the adaptation process [^113SYj8v]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

To determine any factors that predict how an individual will adapt to post-stroke hemianopic visual field loss, with close monitoring of the adaptation process from an early stage, the Hemianopia Adaptation Study (HAST) was conducted as a prospective observational longitudinal cohort clinical study. Adult stroke survivors (n = 144) with new-onset homonymous hemianopia were monitored using the standardized mobility assessment course (MAC) as the primary outcome measure of adaptation.

Several baseline variables were found to be good predictors of adaptation. Three variables were associated with adaptation status at 12 weeks post-stroke: inferior percentage visual field, percentage total MAC omissions, and MAC completion time (seconds). Baseline measurements of these variables can predict adaptation at 12 weeks with moderate to high accuracy (area under ROC curve, 0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.90). A cut-off score of ≤ 25% target omissions is suggested to predict which individuals are likely to adapt by 12 weeks post-stroke following gold standard care.

Adaptation to hemianopia is a personal journey, with several factors being important for predicting its presence, including MAC outcomes and the extent of inferior visual field loss. A clinical recommendation is made for the inclusion of the MAC as part of a functional assessment for hemianopia. The mobility assessment course (MAC) should be considered as an assessment of mobility/scanning in the rehabilitation of patients with homonymous hemianopia, with a cut-off score of ≤ 25% omissions on the MAC.

### Peroneal neuropathy due to a popliteal aneurysm in a patient with infectious endocarditis [^116yxhKN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

We present an 18-year-old young man with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis who also suffered from concomitant knee pain. The clinical examination revealed right homonymous hemianopsia and left peroneal neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the knee demonstrated a lobulated saccular aneurysm in the left popliteal fossa. We diagnosed this patient as having peripheral mononeuropathy due to an aneurysm compressing the peroneal nerve in the left poplitea.

### UK exceptional case driving application outcomes in post-stroke homonymous hemianopia: Results from a clinical study [^115zNi7r]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). High credibility.

We report results in relation to returning to driving in the UK under the exceptional cases rule for visual field loss.

- **Methods**: The Hemianopia Adaptation Study is a prospective clinical study recruiting adult stroke survivors with new-onset homonymous hemianopia. The mobility assessment course (MAC) was used to measure navigational scanning. Car drivers were offered a 1-year post-stroke assessment to consider referral for driving assessment.

- **Results**: Of 144 participants, 51 were eligible for driving assessment, with 13 (25.4%) accepting an appointment for UK Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) referral. A statistically significant difference in gender and baseline Barthel (stroke severity) scores was found between those requesting referral and those declining (p = 0.046; p < 0.001). MAC outcomes were significantly different, with those referred having a lower percentage of target omissions (9.0%) and a faster mean course completion time (46.0s) than those not referred (28.3%/72.5s) (p = 0.006; p < 0.001). Twelve of the 13 referred were offered a driving assessment by the DVLA. All 12 passed and returned to driving.

- **Conclusions**: It is possible for individuals with post-stroke homonymous hemianopia to return to driving, where exceptional cases criteria are met. There is evidence to support the use of the MAC as a clinical measurement of adaptation.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: Individuals with post-stroke homonymous hemianopia should be fully informed regarding driving regulations that can differ between countries and sometimes different states within a country.

There was no statistically significant difference between affected and unaffected RNFL. However, there was a significant difference in GCC layer reduction between the affected and unaffected sides (P = 0.029).

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest a significant association between retinal GCC layer reduction and visual field defects due to ischemic occipital cortical injury. This reinforces the importance of ocular imaging in understanding and assessing visual field impairments.

### Homonymous hemianopia: challenges and solutions [^116k52Qt]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Optic tract lesions can produce both complete and partial homonymous hemianopia (HH). The presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and band-shaped atrophy of the optic disc can help distinguish an optic tract lesion from damage located posterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). When a complete HH is present, the relative afferent pupillary defect will be found in the eye with the temporal visual field loss (contralateral to the optic tract lesion).

This may occur due to the increased number of decussating ganglion cell fibers compared with nondecussating fibers, or it may occur because the melanopsin-containing fibers found in the nasal retina have increased sensitivity compared with those found in the temporal retina. Band-shaped atrophy, manifesting as pallor of the nasal and temporal optic nerve head, will also be seen in the eye contralateral to the optic tract lesion. Thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) that corresponds with the area of pallor can be observed with optical coherence tomography analysis of the NFL or ganglion cell complex. Here, retinal tissue associated with the temporal visual field loss, the NFL nasal to the disc, and the NFL temporal to the disc but nasal to the macula is reduced.

Additionally, the superior and inferior NFL may be thinned in the eye ipsilateral to the optic tract lesion. Associated signs and symptoms may be present if the lesion affecting the optic tract extends to nearby structures. If the temporal lobe is involved, memory may be affected and seizures can occur. Damage to the adjacent cerebral peduncle can result in contralateral hemiparesis.

### Efficiency of rarebit perimetry in the evaluation of homonymous hemianopia in stroke patients [^111wLEAb]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

To compare the efficiency of Rarebit perimetry and the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) in detecting homonymous hemianopia in stroke patients with occipital lobe infarcts, a study was conducted.

Forty patients suffering from visual complaints due to acute occipital lobe infarcts underwent visual field analysis on the same day. The tests were conducted in random order using either Humphrey perimetry 30–2, SITA standard program (Zeiss Humphrey Systems), or Rarebit perimetry. A visual field was classified into four quadrants for each eye: superior temporal, superior nasal, inferior temporal, and inferior nasal. The mean hit rate numbers (MHR), mean deviation, and pattern standard deviation (PSD) values were compared for each quadrant of each eye.

The results showed that Rarebit MHR and HFA mean deviation values for each quadrant of the right and left eyes were highly correlated in all patients with homonymous hemianopia. Pearson's r correlation coefficients for the superior temporal, superior nasal, inferior temporal, and inferior nasal quadrants of right and left eyes were 0.827, 0.833, 0.843, 0.851 and 0.746, 0.821, 0.882, 0.824, respectively (p < 0.001 for all quadrants). There was also a strong correlation between Rarebit MHR and HFA PSD for each quadrant of both eyes.

Rarebit perimetry is rapid, reliable, and easily performed in patients with homonymous hemianopia. It can be conducted using straightforward software and hardware, readily detecting severe visual loss in patients with occipital lobe lesions.
