## Question

A 62-year-old man is diagnosed with a localized, resectable gastric adenocarcinoma after endoscopic biopsy and staging CT scan. He is otherwise healthy and is being considered for perioperative chemotherapy followed by curative surgical resection. The multidisciplinary tumor board discusses the next steps in his management.

According to current guidelines, what additional procedure(s) should be performed before proceeding with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery in this patient, and how should the results influence surgical planning?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what additional procedure(s) should be performed before starting perioperative chemotherapy and surgery for a 62-year-old with localized, resectable gastric adenocarcinoma, and how the results should influence surgical planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the current staging is sufficient to commit to perioperative therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (NCCN, ESMO) mandate for staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology. Next, I will examine the evidence base supporting this practice and quantify its yield. After that, I need to consider how positive cytology or occult metastases should alter management. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm and confirm any nuances that could change the plan, such as MSI-H/dMMR considerations or alternative strategies if laparoscopy is not feasible.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the gap in staging. The patient has a biopsy-proven gastric adenocarcinoma deemed localized and resectable on contrast-enhanced CT, but cross-sectional imaging has limited sensitivity for peritoneal disease and small-volume metastases, so radiographic staging can understage a meaningful fraction of patients who are otherwise candidates for curative-intent therapy [^37ab49dc] [^e27578dd].

> I need to check guideline requirements next. NCCN recommends diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings for cytology in medically fit patients with potentially resectable stage cT1b or higher locoregional disease when considering perioperative therapy and/or surgery, and it explicitly notes that positive peritoneal cytology without visible implants should be considered M1 disease and that surgery as initial treatment is not recommended in that scenario [^37ab49dc] [^b2de9152]. ESMO similarly recommends diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal lavage for cytology in patients with resectable gastric cancer who are candidates for perioperative chemotherapy, underscoring that positive lavage cytology places patients in an uncertain category for curative-intent resection [^f13ba8d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the evidentiary basis and quantify benefit. Large series show that laparoscopic staging detects radiographically occult metastases in roughly 20–30% of patients, with Memorial Sloan Kettering data showing M1 disease in 31% and other series reporting similar yields, thereby preventing nontherapeutic laparotomies and informing systemic therapy decisions [^37ab49dc] [^b2de9152]. Systematic reviews and contemporary practice summaries also support staging laparoscopy as a standard element in the workup of locally advanced gastric cancer to improve staging accuracy and guide multimodality therapy [^3c1ecfa9].

> Next, I should review how results should influence surgical planning. If peritoneal cytology is positive, even without visible implants, this is M1 disease and curative-intent surgery should not proceed; instead, the patient should be managed with systemic therapy and palliative strategies as appropriate, and enrollment in clinical trials or consideration of peritoneal-directed approaches may be discussed in selected cases, acknowledging limited high-quality evidence for cytoreduction/HIPEC in this setting [^37ab49dc] [^21db9278]. If laparoscopy reveals gross peritoneal disease or unresectable local extension, the plan should pivot to nonoperative management rather than proceeding to gastrectomy [^9e42c5e3].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and integration with perioperative chemotherapy. Ideally, staging laparoscopy with cytology is performed before any systemic therapy to avoid treating and then discovering occult peritoneal disease, which would change curative intent to palliative and expose patients to morbidity without oncologic benefit; this sequencing is consistently endorsed in NCCN and ESMO guidance and aligns with quality metrics in gastric cancer care [^37ab49dc] [^f13ba8d4]. I should also confirm that if laparoscopy is not feasible due to adhesions or patient factors, the team should document rationale and consider alternative strategies, but this is a deviation from standard and should be exceptional rather than routine [^notfound].

> I will now examine special scenarios that could modify the plan. For MSI-H/dMMR tumors, perioperative immunotherapy is an emerging consideration; however, even in that subgroup, baseline staging laparoscopy remains appropriate to exclude peritoneal disease before initiating systemic therapy, and response assessment after immunotherapy should include restaging imaging and, when indicated, endoscopic biopsy to confirm pathologic response before surgical decisions are finalized [^f0b68a5e] [^3ac72f14]. But wait, what if the tumor is very early stage, such as cT1a or cT1b without nodal disease? In that narrower context, the threshold for laparoscopy is lower, yet NCCN still allows consideration of laparoscopy in cT1b disease when planning perioperative therapy, so I should individualize based on risk features and institutional practice [^37ab49dc].

> Let me synthesize the practical, guideline-concordant recommendation. Before starting perioperative chemotherapy, the patient should undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings for cytology to detect radiographically occult peritoneal disease; positive cytology or visible peritoneal metastases should preclude immediate resection and redirect care to systemic therapy, whereas negative cytology with no unresectable findings supports proceeding with perioperative chemotherapy followed by curative-intent gastrectomy with appropriate nodal dissection, ideally in a high-volume center with D2 expertise [^37ab49dc] [^f13ba8d4] [^e45eaa96]. I should double-check that this approach is consistent with contemporary quality standards and that the MDT documents the staging rationale and plan, which it is [^e247a81a].

> Final answer: Perform diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings for cytology before initiating perioperative chemotherapy. Positive peritoneal cytology or occult peritoneal metastases upstage to M1 and should defer surgery in favor of systemic therapy, whereas negative findings support proceeding with perioperative chemotherapy and curative-intent resection, ensuring accurate baseline staging and avoiding nontherapeutic laparotomy [^37ab49dc] [^f13ba8d4] [^3c1ecfa9].

Before starting perioperative chemotherapy, the patient should undergo **diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings** [^f13ba8d4] to detect radiographically occult peritoneal disease or positive cytology, which would upstage to M1 and preclude curative surgery [^37ab49dc]. This step is recommended by NCCN and ESMO for medically fit patients with cT1b or higher disease being considered for perioperative therapy [^37ab49dc] [^f13ba8d4]. If laparoscopy is positive, management should shift to systemic therapy rather than surgery; if negative, proceed with perioperative chemotherapy and curative-intent resection [^9e42c5e3].

---

## Rationale for additional staging procedures

Although CT is standard for initial staging, it has **limited sensitivity for peritoneal disease and small-volume metastases** [^notfound]. Laparoscopy with peritoneal washings detects occult peritoneal spread in 20–30% of patients, preventing nontherapeutic laparotomy and guiding appropriate systemic therapy [^37ab49dc].

---

## Recommended additional procedure: diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings

- **Indication**: Medically fit patients with cT1b or higher locoregional disease being considered for perioperative therapy and/or surgery [^37ab49dc].
- **Procedure**: Laparoscopic inspection of the peritoneal cavity with biopsies as needed, plus peritoneal washings for cytology [^37ab49dc].
- **Clinical significance**: Positive cytology (even without visible implants) is M1 disease and surgery as initial treatment is not recommended [^37ab49dc].

---

## Impact on surgical planning

Laparoscopy with cytology **directly affects surgical decision-making**:

| **Laparoscopy/cytology result** | **Impact on surgical planning** |
|-|-|
| Positive for peritoneal disease or malignant cytology | - Upstaged to M1 <br/> - Curative surgery deferred <br/> - Systemic therapy indicated [^37ab49dc] |
| Negative for peritoneal disease and cytology | - Proceed with perioperative chemotherapy <br/> - Followed by curative-intent resection [^9e42c5e3] |

---

## Additional considerations

- **Multidisciplinary review**: Essential to integrate laparoscopy results into the overall plan and ensure guideline-concordant care [^79b51a4f].
- **Alternative strategies**: If laparoscopy is contraindicated, consider PET/CT or MRI, but these are less sensitive for peritoneal disease than laparoscopy [^notfound].
- **Patient counseling**: Explain that laparoscopy may reveal inoperable disease, altering the treatment course toward systemic therapy [^c6687faf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Perform diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings** before perioperative chemotherapy in this patient [^f13ba8d4].
- **If positive**, defer surgery and initiate systemic therapy; if negative, proceed with perioperative chemotherapy and curative-intent resection [^9e42c5e3].
- **Use multidisciplinary review** to align care with current standards and patient preferences [^79b51a4f].

---

Diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings is the **key additional step** before perioperative therapy in localized gastric cancer, as it detects occult peritoneal disease that would change management away from curative surgery [^f13ba8d4].

Response assessment and additional management — additional management options are based on the assessment of response to primary treatment. Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan with contrast (oral and IV) should be performed in patients who are medically fit after the completion of perioperative chemotherapy and before surgical intervention, and FDG-PET/CT scan can be performed as clinically indicated. Patients found to have resectable disease on imaging should proceed with surgery (preferred) or palliative management, while those found to have unresectable or metastatic disease after primary treatment should receive palliative management. For those patients with MSI-H/dMMR tumors who received preoperative or perioperative ICI, response assessment should include an FDG-PET/CT (5–8 weeks after therapy) as clinically indicated and EGD and biopsy, and a chest/abdomen CT with oral and IV contrast (including pelvis CT, if clinically indicated) is recommended but not required if FDG-PET/CT is performed. Patients with no evidence of disease should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team and may undergo observation or surgery, patients with persistent local disease have the option of surgery (preferred) or palliative management, and palliative management is recommended for patients with new metastatic disease.

### Multimodality therapy of localized gastric adenocarcinoma [^e86d6b84]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical resection is the primary method of obtaining a potential cure for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. However, chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy offer significant improvement in survival over surgery alone. Much of the difficulty in deciding the optimal treatment strategy is choosing between perioperative chemotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Adding to the complexity is the potential for incorporating treatment strategies based on clinical trials performed in Asia. There is likely a difference in tumor biology between Eastern and Western patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, in addition to the clear differences in screening, pathologic assessment, and surgical technique. Even among tumors in Western populations, heterogeneity of histology, anatomy, and staging among studies make cross-trial comparisons difficult. There is also active controversy surrounding the staging and management of gastroesophageal junction tumors. Lastly, the benefit of extended lymph node dissection is not clear based on the existing studies and has not been firmly established as a surgical standard of care for all patients. Future goals include better classification of gastric cancer, continued pursuit of randomized trials in Western populations, standardization of surgical technique, and incorporation of targeted therapies.

### Novel perspectives for the treatment of gastric cancer: from a global approach to a personalized strategy [^a5f526ee]. Current Oncology Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Although recent advances have been made, surgery still remains the mainstay of any curative treatment for gastric cancer patients, with radical gastrectomy representing the procedure of choice. However, patients with locally advanced disease show high rates of locoregional or distant recurrence even after potentially curative resections. According to global results presented in the setting of locally advanced resectable gastric carcinoma, perioperative chemotherapy may be considered a valuable option. On the other hand, clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer seem to suggest that a limit in efficacy has been reached for standard chemotherapy. Interesting data are expected from the development of targeted agents that, similarly to other cancer sites, showed appealing results in gastric cancer as well. Along with new effective therapeutic opportunities, better clinical and molecularly driven patient selection will represent the cornerstone of the global care for these patients.

Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide. Even though neoadjuvant, perioperative, and adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may improve outcomes compared with surgery alone, the optimal combination of treatment modalities remains controversial. While European and North American trials established perioperative chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiation regimens for gastric cancer, Asian countries have focused on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. This review summarizes results from contemporary randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to elucidate the relative merits of each treatment approach.

### Preoperative treatment and surgery in gastric cancer: friends or foes? [^6ec624b3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Until 2006, most reports of preoperative (neoadjuvant) treatments for gastric carcinoma were inconclusive and produced confusing results due to inhomogeneous treatment regimens, selection of patients, and response assessment. Since publication of the results from the MAGIC trial, substantial scientific evidence has suggested the benefits of perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) chemotherapy to locally advanced gastric cancer. To date, this phase III trial, coupled with preliminary data from other published reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, supports the theoretical advantages of preoperative treatment for gastric carcinoma, thus introducing the concept of delayed surgery. Neoadjuvant treatment of resectable, locally advanced tumours might improve patients' outcomes and postpone the need for curative resection, but it also exposes patients to the risk of tumour progression.

### Management of locally advanced gastroesophageal cancer: still a multidisciplinary global challenge? [^b1b29a1a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The outcome of patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric cancer, or adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction is poor. In clinical trials, multimodality therapy, such as perioperative chemotherapy, preoperative or postoperative chemoradiation, or adjuvant chemotherapy led to significant increments in survival. Therefore, experts agree that patients with stage II or III disease should be offered a multidisciplinary treatment approach. However, patients are treated somewhat differently in the different regions of the world and survival rates remain far from being satisfactory. Efforts to further improve outcome are highly warranted.

Optimal management of esophageal and gastric cancer during the perioperative period requires a coordinated multidisciplinary treatment effort. Accurate staging guides treatment strategy. Advances in minimally invasive surgery and endoscopy have reduced risks associated with resection while maintaining oncological standards. Although the standard perioperative chemo-and radiotherapy regimens have not yet been established, randomized control trials exploring this subject show promising results.

Objective

The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the data regarding the use of neoadjuvant, perioperative, surgical, and adjuvant treatment options in localized gastric cancer patients and to develop Appropriate Use Criteria recommended by a panel of experts convened by the American Radium Society.

Methods

Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methodology was used to develop an extensive analysis of peer-reviewed phase 2/2R/3 trials, as well as meta-analyses found within the Ovid Medline database between 2010 and 2020. The expert panel then rated the appropriateness of various treatments in 5 representative clinical scenarios through a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi).

Results

For patients with medically operable locally advanced gastric cancer, the strongest recommendation was for perioperative chemotherapy based on high-quality data. Acceptable alternatives included surgery followed by either chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). For patients with upfront resection of stages I to III gastric cancer (no neoadjuvant therapy), the group strongly recommended adjuvant therapy with either chemotherapy alone or CRT, based on high-quality data. For patients with locally advanced disease who received preoperative chemotherapy without tumor regression, the group strongly recommended postoperative chemotherapy or postoperative CRT. Finally, for medically inoperable gastric cancer patients, there was moderate consensus recommending definitive concurrent CRT.

Conclusions

The addition of chemotherapy and/or radiation, either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or perioperative setting, results in improved survival rates for patients compared with surgery alone. For inoperable patients, definitive CRT is a reasonable treatment option, though largely palliative.

### Radiation therapy for gastric cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^3a30b820]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Radiation therapy (RT) for gastric cancer — RT is used in several clinical scenarios across the disease spectrum, and although phase 3 studies have not shown a benefit to preoperative or postoperative chemoradiation with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, RT may be a therapeutic option depending on the stage, patient performance status, and adequacy and timing of surgery. For patients with locally unresectable and nonmetastatic gastric cancer, RT may have the potential to contribute to meaningful disease control, and RT has been long recognized as an effective tool in palliation of bleeding, pain and obstruction. Like surgery, RT may also play an important role in the treatment of oligometastases, and with innovations in RT (eg, stereotactic body RT, respiratory management, image guidance, adaptive planning, increases in safely deliverable dose) the indications for its use have extended, with robust study alongside novel systemic therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as surgery potentially identifying new therapeutic strategies. Related systemic therapy evidence includes that the MATTERHORN trial has shown that for patients with resectable disease, regardless of PD-L1 or microsatellite stability status, immunotherapy added to perioperative chemotherapy has improved pCR and event-free survival rates, and a trend towards improved OS in MATTERHORN suggests the possibility of statistical significance with longer follow-up.

Perioperative chemotherapy and chemoradiation — resectable gastric adenocarcinoma — are informed by randomized trials indicating benefit with perioperative fluorouracil and cisplatin and no added benefit to postoperative chemoradiation after preoperative chemotherapy. In FNCLCC ACCORD 07, at a median follow-up of 5.7 years, the 5-year OS rate was 38% for perioperative chemotherapy versus 24% for surgery alone (P = 0.02), with corresponding 5-year DFS rates of 34% and 19%, and the Panel feels perioperative fluorouracil and cisplatin is a viable treatment option for locally advanced resectable gastric cancer (category 1). In the phase III CRITICS trial, at a median follow-up of 61.4 months, median OS was 43 months (95% CI, 31–57) with postoperative chemotherapy versus 37 months (95% CI, 30–48) with postoperative chemoradiation (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84–1.22; P = 0.90), and after 6.7 years the 5-year OS was 58% versus 46% (HR, 1.62; P = 0.0004), supporting the conclusion that adding RT to postoperative chemotherapy confers no survival benefit following adequate preoperative chemotherapy and surgery. An ongoing phase II trial (CRITICS II) is comparing three preoperative strategies — chemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiation, and sequential chemotherapy and chemoradiation — for resectable gastric cancer (NCT02931890).

Perioperative chemotherapy — fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FNCLCC ACCORD 07): In this trial (n = 224 patients; 25% had gastric adenocarcinoma), perioperative chemotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, DFS, and OS in resectable cancer. At a median follow-up of 5.7 years, the 5-year OS rate was 38% for perioperative chemotherapy versus 24% with surgery alone (P = 0.02), and the corresponding 5-year DFS rates were 34% and 19%, respectively. Although accrual was low, the Panel feels that perioperative fluorouracil and cisplatin is a viable treatment option for patients with locally advanced resectable gastric cancer (category 1).

### Multidisciplinary treatment of gastric cancer… [^51febdbb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Gastrectomy, perioperative chemotherapy, adjuvant chemoradiation, surveillance endoscopy, and best supportive care. Main Outcomes and Measures Panelists scored 416 scenarios regarding treatment scenarios for appropriateness from 1 to 9. Median appropriateness scores from 1 to 3 were considered inappropriate; 4 to 6, uncertain; and 7 to 9, appropriate. Agreement was reached when 12 of 16 panelists scored the scenario similarly. Appropriate scenarios agreed on were subsequently scored for necessity. Results For patients with T1N0 disease, surgery alone was considered appropriate, while there was no agreement over surgery alone for patients T2N0 disease. Perioperative chemotherapy was appropriate for patients who had T1-2N2-3 or T3-4 GC without major symptoms. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was classified as appropriate for T1-2N1-3 or T3-4 proximal GC and necessary for T1-2N2-3 or T3-4 distal GC.

There was no agreement regarding surveillance imaging and endoscopy following gastrectomy. Surveillance endoscopy was deemed to be appropriate after endoscopic resection. For patients with metastatic GC, surgical resection was considered inappropriate for those with no major symptoms, unless the disease was limited to positive cytology alone, in which case there was disagreement. Conclusions and Relevance Patients with GC being treated with curative intent should be considered for multimodal treatment. For patients with incurable disease, surgical interventions should be considered only for the management of major bleeding or obstruction. Unfortunately, many patients with GC in Western countries have metastatic disease. Prognosis is exceptionally poor for these patients. 6 While it is generally agreed that treatment for noncurative GC should be focused primarily on palliation, retrospective series of highly selected patients suggest a potential modest survival benefit with resection.

8 The utility of surgical treatment for metastatic GC is thus controversial, and the appropriate treatment strategy remains unclear. Surgical resection without preoperative therapy was considered appropriate for all M0 GC in proximal and distal tumors, with the exception of patients with T3-4N2-3 distal GC and minor symptoms. For these patients, the panel gave a mean appropriateness score of 7. 5, with indeterminate agreement. Necessity scores for these scenarios were high, especially for early-stage disease. The panelists believed surgical resection was necessary as initial therapy for most patients with major symptoms. The panelists could not agree on the appropriateness of endoscopic mucosal resection for T1N0 lesions, regardless of symptoms or location. They agreed it was inappropriate to perform endoscopic mucosal resection for all other scenarios. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was considered inappropriate following resection of T1N0 disease.

For proximal lesions, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was deemed appropriate for T1-2N1-3 or T3-4N0-3 disease. For distal cancers, adjuvant chemoradiation was classified as necessary for T1-2N2-3 and T3-4N0-3 disease. For the use of nonsurgical management, including stenting, in patients with metastatic GC without major symptoms, appropriateness scores were high but reached agreement only in patients with GC with more than 1 liver metastasis or more than 1 site of metastatic disease. For patients with major symptoms, the appropriateness of nonsurgical management was indeterminate. Surgical resection was considered inappropriate for patients with no major symptoms unless the disease was limited to positive cytology alone, in which case there was disagreement regarding surgical management. The use of multimodality treatment to improve survival in patients with GC undergoing curative-intent resection is well established.

Post-chemoradiation management — following primary treatment, patients should be restaged to determine whether surgery is an option, and surgery is preferred if appropriate for patients with resectable and medically operable disease after chemoradiation, while those found to still have unresectable or medically inoperable and/or metastatic disease should receive palliative management.

### Leveraging the multidisciplinary tumor board for dissemination of evidence-based recommendations on the staging and treatment of gastric cancer: a pilot study [^ab2ad133]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In terms of node dissection, modified D2 lymphadenectomy, preserving the spleen and pancreatic tail, is the established standard of care in curative-intent gastrectomy and improves disease specific survival. It is easier and lower risk, however, to perform a gastrectomy without clearing these nodes. Surgeons trained to perform gastrectomy for benign disease or non-adenocarcinoma indications may not be comfortable with this more extended nodal dissection or even aware of the steps it entails.

Notably, both SL and modified D2 dissection are surgical standards. Recommendations on perioperative chemotherapy were not reported to be controversial by any of the participating sites. This could have been because perioperative therapy regimens are supported by relatively recent randomized prospective trials. Surgical standards often are not supported by such high-level evidence, but more often come from abundant retrospective data and consensus agreement. Concerns about validity of evidence or disagreement with it and strongly held beliefs by colleagues and partners were among the barriers to implementation reported by several sites.

Although the impact of SL on survival has not been demonstrated in the form of a prospective trial, SL it is supported by abundant literature and is necessary for guiding appropriate treatment.– When SL is not performed at baseline and patients undergo systemic therapy, peritoneal disease present initially may respond and no longer be detectable, but the patient still will be at a much higher risk of recurrence because they were still stage 4 at baseline. These patients should go on to be considered for alternative therapies or clinical trials (e.g. targeted regimens or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy [HIPEC]) or at a very minimum should have an informed discussion about their higher risk of recurrence and their prognosis before undergoing gastrectomy. Confirming a patient's disease stage before initiation of invasive treatment with stated curative intent is a basic tenet of cancer care. In a randomized trial, D2 lymphadenectomy was examined, but it was decades ago, and the current recommendation for pancreas and spleen-sparing modified dissection are based on interpretation of those results, which may be why some still find this recommendation controversial.

Additional barriers reported by multiple sites in this study were "the availability of surgeons skilled in D2 dissection" and "having too few gastric cancer cases per year for a dedicated team." These topics came up in the semi-structured interviews and led to discussions about possibly referring gastric cancer patients to higher-volume centers. These quotations and the themes pulled from the interviews highlight issues in real-world practice that may be affecting care and outcomes for patients, particularly those with relatively rare cancers.

### Impact of postoperative chemotherapy on survival for oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery [^e7a921bb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The majority of patients suitable for curative treatment of oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (OGAC) undergo either perioperative chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) followed by surgery. There is clear evidence of benefit for both approaches compared with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced disease. Despite this, less than half of these patients will survive for more than 5 years after surgery. The benefit of perioperative/neoadjuvant treatment outside patients who exhibit substantial cancer regression (primary tumour and/or lymph nodes), who probably represent less than 20 per cent of those receiving perioperative chemotherapyand less than 30 per cent having NACRT, appears to be small in retrospective analyses. Furthermore, the importance of different components of perioperative chemotherapy, particularly treatment given in the postoperative phase, is unclear. This is of particular relevance in OGAC because, even in trial settings, the planned postoperative component of perioperative chemotherapy is started in as few as 50–60 per cent of patients and completed in less than 50 per cent. This leads many treating clinicians to believe that the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy is all derived from the preoperative doses. In the majority of patients who do not receive postoperative chemotherapy, the reason for this is poor fitness after surgery. In this context, quantifying the additional benefit of postoperative treatment and establishing in whom this occurs would allow more informed decision-making about relative risks and benefits.

### Radiation therapy for gastric cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^f2284101]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASTRO clinical practice guideline — recommendations for radiation therapy (RT) in gastric cancer are based on "a systematic literature review" and "a predefined consensus-based methodology with a system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength." Multidisciplinary evaluation and decision making are recommended for all patients. For patients with cT2-4 and/or N+ resectable gastric cancer, perioperative chemotherapy is recommended, preferably FLOT (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel), and perioperative durvalumab and FLOT has shown a significant improvement in event-free survival versus FLOT only for resectable disease and is now being adopted as a standard of care. Preoperative chemoradiation is recommended for patients who are not candidates for perioperative chemotherapy and conditionally recommended if there is concern for a margin positive (R1) or incomplete (R2) resection. Postoperative chemoradiation is conditionally recommended for patients who are not candidates for perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy or if a suboptimal resection was done for those who proceeded directly to surgery. Definitive chemoradiation may provide durable control for nonmetastatic patients who are inoperable either at initial diagnosis or at the time of locoregional recurrence. For patients with oligometastatic gastric cancer, metastasis-directed therapy along with systemic therapy is conditionally recommended. Palliative RT is efficacious for patients with bleeding, pain, and obstruction, and target coverage goals and dose guidance for normal tissues are provided.

### Lymphatic, blood vessel and perineural invasion identifies early-stage high-risk radically resected gastric cancer patients [^bdc52e10]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although most clinical trials investigating adjuvant chemotherapy generated inconclusive results, the trial by(the MAGIC trial) has re-opened the debate about chemotherapy for operable gastric cancer patients. In this study, 503 patients affected by adenocarcinoma of the stomach, oesophagogastric junction or lower oesophagus were randomised to perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone. The authors of this study demonstrated that perioperative chemotherapy was able to significantly improve progression-free survival and OS. However, in the chemotherapy arm only 43% of patients completed the postoperative planned programme, probably as a consequence of the fact that gastric cancer patients have been often shown to be hardly compliant to postoperative chemotherapy. On the other hand, it has also been previously reported that a chemoradiotherapy adjuvant approach may improve the outcome of radically resected gastric cancer by lowering the incidence of local relapse.

The availability of various and different treatment options has consequently reintroduced the crucial question of an accurate treatment selection and a correct definition of high-risk categories, which may help identifying subgroups of patients benefiting more from additional medical treatments after (or before) radical surgery.

Our findings suggest that the presence or absence of LBVI/PNI is an important aspect influencing the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients, who underwent radical surgery and, more interestingly, it appeared an independent prognostic factor affecting DFS (P = 0.0002) and OS (P = 0.0001), which were also influenced by variables already known to represent important prognostic factors such as the extension within the gastric wall, nodal involvement and the type of lymphadenectomy.

In the present analysis, we found a statistically significant difference in stage at diagnosis, DFS and OS between patients with LBVI/PNI and those without LBVI/PNI. In fact, the median DFS for patients in group A was 32.1 months, whereas it was not reached by patients in group B (P = 0.0001); the median OS was 45.5 months for patients in group A, whereas it was not reached for patients in group B (P = 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, the presence of LBVI/PNI appeared an independent prognostic factor for DFS and OS. Our results were confirmed in subgroups analysis, separately considering stage I and early gastric cancer patients with and without LBVI/PNI.

### Quality assurance of surgery in the randomized ST03 trial of perioperative chemotherapy in carcinoma of the stomach and gastro-oesophageal junction [^41f983ce]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 895 patients who underwent resectional surgery in the ST03 trial (84·2 per cent of 1063 randomized), surgical details were available for 880 (98·3 per cent) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). There was no difference in surgical approaches across the arms of the trial. Open surgery was performed in 547 patients (62·2 per cent), and a minimally invasive approach in 222 (25·2 per cent), which was either a totally minimally invasive procedure (49, 5·6 per cent), a hybrid approach (laparoscopic abdomen and open thoracotomy: 110, 12·5 per cent) or a laparoscopically assisted procedure (63, 7·2 per cent). Data on surgical approach were missing for 77 patients (8·8 per cent). Extended lymphadenectomy including perigastric, left gastric, hepatic and splenic artery lymph nodes was performed according to the surgeon's discretion in 46·6 per cent of patients, which was similar in both trial arms (Table S2, supporting information).

Surgical procedures and techniques

Sites undertaking total minimally invasive laparoscopic operations routinely within the trial were required to provide information on their previous experience with these techniques. Evidence was submitted for 67 of 112 operations at 14 sites. Of the remaining 45 operations, five were performed just once by centres and noted as a protocol deviation. The surgical requirements were followed by sites in 95·5 per cent of resection procedures.

Some 159 patients completed preoperative chemotherapy but did not undergo resection. Fifty‐four of these patients had surgery, which comprised a laparotomy only (51 patients) or a laparotomy and bypass procedure (3 patients). The remaining patients did not undergo surgery because of disease progression, patient preference or for a number of other reasons.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy of applying reduced surgery for the treatment of asymptomatic unresectable advanced gastric cancer [^b01e74ba]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our analysis suggests that surgery may have a role in selected advanced gastric cancer patients generally considered for palliative systemic therapy alone. However, as no definitive confirmation from randomized trials exists, such an approach cannot be recommended at present in all metastatic patients. The treatment of advanced gastric cancer is slowly but steadily improving thanks to the availability of new therapeutic agents and better supportive measures. It is therefore likely that improving the percentage of patients who achieve disease control in first- and second-line could increase the possibility of reconsidering surgery on primary tumor in a higher number of cases. This will open the way for further prospective research in the field and for the conduction of adequately sized randomized trials. Meanwhile, gastrectomy cannot be considered as a standard approach in asymptomatic GC patients and a case-by-case decision should be based on the multidisciplinary assessment of any single patient.

As anticipated, if we would like to answer the open questions about the role of surgery in this setting, we should probably include benefit from upfront systemic therapy as a key selection factor, in order to avoid an aggressive surgical procedure in patients with lower chances of long-term survival and a potential detrimental impact on QoL.

However, with the development of surgery and the in-depth knowledge of oncologists about gastric cancer as a disease, Marano et al. concluded that there is a significant association between hospital surgical volume and patient prognosis, highlighting the fact that better postoperative outcomes tend to be achieved in centres with higher surgical volumes, and that concentrating gastric cancer surgery in hospitals with greater specialisation and high surgical volumes may improve patient prognosis. At the same time, it was emphasised that multidisciplinary assessment and clinical decision-making for patients with advanced gastric cancer, such as pre-rehabilitation, standardised clinical pathways and perioperative non-invasive management, improved hospital care for patients with gastric cancer, and increased the long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer through a variety of initiatives.

There are still some shortcomings in this study: (1) the number of original studies included is small, only one RCT and its sample size is small; the rest of the cases were extracted from retrospective studies; (2) the years of the original studies span a large period, and the differences between chemotherapy regimens may have an impact on the results of the study. Therefore, the conclusions of this study still need to be further validated by more high-quality studies.

### Perioperative chemo (radio) therapy versus primary surgery for resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction, and lower esophagus [^e2ac5249]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The outcome of patients with locally advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal (GE) junction, and stomach) is poor. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of perioperative chemotherapy on survival and other outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effect of perioperative chemotherapy for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma on survival and other clinically relevant outcomes in the overall population of participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in prespecified subgroups.

Search Methods

We performed computerized searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Review of Effectiveness (DARE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011), and LILACS (Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud), combining the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy with specific search terms. Moreover, we handsearched several online databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved papers.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs which randomized patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, in the absence of distant metastases, to receive either chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy followed by surgery, or surgery alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors identified eligible trials. We solicited individual patient data (IPD) from all selected trials. We performed meta-analyses based on intention-to-treat populations using the two-stage method to combine IPD with aggregate data from RCTs for which IPD were unavailable. We combined data from all trials providing IPD in a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the effect of several covariables on overall survival.

Main Results

We identified 14 RCTs with 2422 eligible patients. For eight RCTs with 1049 patients (43.3%), we were able to obtain IPD. Perioperative chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.89). This corresponds to a relative survival increase of 19% or an absolute survival increase of 9% at five years. This survival advantage was consistent across most subgroups. There was a trend towards a more pronounced treatment effect for tumors of the GE junction compared to other sites, and for combined chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in tumors of the esophagus and GE junction. Resection with negative margins was a strong predictor of survival. Multivariable analysis showed that tumor site, performance status, and age have an independent significant effect on survival. Moreover, there was a significant interaction of the effect of perioperative chemotherapy with age (larger treatment effect in younger patients). Perioperative chemotherapy also showed a significant effect on several secondary outcomes. It was associated with longer disease-free survival, higher rates of R0 resection, and more favorable tumor stage upon resection, while there was no association with perioperative morbidity and mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

Perioperative chemotherapy for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma increases survival compared to surgery alone. It should thus be offered to all eligible patients. There is a trend to a larger survival advantage for tumors of the GE junction as compared to other sites and for chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in esophageal and GE junction tumors. Likewise, there is an interaction between age and treatment effect, with younger patients having a larger survival advantage, and no survival advantage for elderly patients.

### Leveraging the multidisciplinary tumor board for dissemination of evidence-based recommendations on the staging and treatment of gastric cancer: a pilot study [^e247a81a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Although its incidence is relatively low in the United States, the incidence of poorly differentiated, diffuse-type disease is increasing. Multiple clinical trials conducted in recent years have aimed to optimize multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) and outcomes for gastric cancer patients. Despite these studies and subsequent updates to evidence-based treatment guidelines, long-term oncologic outcomes for patients with all but the earliest stage of disease have not improved significantly in decades, particularly in the United States.

The reasons for stagnant outcomes are likely multifactorial, but potentially include delay or outright failure to incorporate trial results and evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. Studies have shown that compliance with evidence-based staging and treatment recommendations for gastric cancer, including both surgical and perioperative components of care, is low in the United States. Worhunsky et al.reported that in the early 2000's, only 45% of patients with gastric cancer in California received stage-specific therapy in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines. A more recent study by Zhao et al.using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) showed that only about 40% of patients with potentially curable disease treated from 2004 to 2014 met surgical standards, even while receiving treatment at Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited centers.

Surgical standards for gastric cancer include performance of a staging laparoscopy (SL) with peritoneal lavage to evaluate for radiographically occult peritoneal disease and confirm its clinical stage. This is recommended to be performed at baseline, before a treatment plan is formed, for clinical stage 2 or 3 patients for whom curative-intent therapy is planned. Additional surgical standards include modified D2 lymphadenectomy (with removal of at least 16 lymph nodes), total gastrectomy for proximal cancers, and distal/subtotal gastrectomy for distal cancers. Findings have shown that compliance with these surgical standards is associated with improved survival. In addition to surgical standards, perioperative systemic therapy is recommended for patients with clinical T3/4 or node-positive disease and has been confirmed to improve survival outcomes in randomized controlled trials. If only approximately 40% of gastric cancer patients are receiving guideline-concordant care in the United States, there is a need to understand and address the barriers to incorporation of treatment recommendations at the local level.

### ASO author reflections: the impact of minimally invasive surgery on the completion rate of the perioperative chemotherapy protocol in gastric cancer [^170cea61]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Future

Studies suggest that the adjuvant component of the perioperative chemotherapy contributes substantially to the overall positive effect on survival. Our study did not show any benefit of the laparoscopic approach in terms of rate of initiation, need for modification, and time to start of the adjuvant treatment. In contrast, we found that severe postoperative complications were strongly associated with omission of adjuvant chemotherapy and an increased likelihood of chemotherapy reduction, which occurred in 44% of the enrolled patients. Thus, it became clear that postoperative morbidity is a crucial determinant of the ability to resume the oncological treatment. Considering that morbidity rates as high as 40% are reported in Western series, further exploration of multidisciplinary interventions in perioperative care with focus on minimizing postoperative complications is warranted.

### Effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection on survival in patients with limited metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer: the AIO-FLOT3 trial [^f8055396]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Surgical resection has a potential benefit for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction.

Objective

To evaluate outcome in patients with limited metastatic disease who receive chemotherapy first and proceed to surgical resection.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The AIO-FLOT3 (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) trial is a prospective, phase 2 trial of 252 patients with resectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Patients were enrolled from 52 cancer care centers in Germany between February 1, 2009, and January 31, 2010, and stratified to 1 of 3 groups: resectable (arm A), limited metastatic (arm B), or extensive metastatic (arm C). Data cutoff was January 2012, and the analysis was performed in March 2013.

Interventions

Patients in arm A received 4 preoperative cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) followed by surgery and 4 postoperative cycles. Patients in arm B received at least 4 cycles of neoadjuvant FLOT and proceeded to surgical resection if restaging (using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) showed a chance of margin-free (R0) resection of the primary tumor and at least a macroscopic complete resection of the metastatic lesions. Patients in arm C were offered FLOT chemotherapy and surgery only if required for palliation. Patients received a median (range) of 8 (1–15) cycles of FLOT.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was overall survival.

Results

In total, 238 of 252 patients (94.4%) were eligible to participate. The median (range) age of participants was 66 (36–79) years in arm A (n = 51), 63 (28–79) years in arm B (n = 60), and 65 (23–83) years in arm C (n = 127). Patients in arm B (n = 60) had only retroperitoneal lymph node involvement (27 patients [45%]), liver involvement (11 [18.3%]), lung involvement (10 [16.7%]), localized peritoneal involvement (4 [6.7%]), or other (8 [13.3%]) incurable sites. Median overall survival was 22.9 months (95% CI, 16.5 to upper level not achieved) for arm B, compared with 10.7 months (95% CI, 9.1–12.8) for arm C (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25–0.55) (P < .001). The response rate for arm B was 60% (complete, 10%; partial, 50%), which is higher than the 43.3% for arm C. In arm B, 36 of 60 patients (60%) proceeded to surgery. The median overall survival was 31.3 months (95% CI, 18.9-upper level not achieved) for patients who proceeded to surgery and 15.9 months (95% CI, 7.1–22.9) for the other patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with limited metastatic disease who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and proceeded to surgery showed a favorable survival. The AIO-FLOT3 trial provides a rationale for further randomized clinical trials.

### Impact of perioperative chemotherapy on oncological outcomes after gastric cancer surgery [^498e525a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative chemotherapy has become standard care for resectable gastric cancer. However, available evidence is based on a limited number of trials, and the outcomes in routine clinical practice and in unselected patients are scarcely reported.

Methods

The study included a consecutive series of patients with resectable gastric cancer treated between 2001 and 2011 in Central Norway. Before 2007, patients with resectable gastric cancer did not receive perioperative chemotherapy. Since 2007, medically fit patients with resectable gastric cancer and aged 75 years or less have been offered this. Response rates were evaluated by CT, and tolerability was assessed by the frequency of hospital admission, need for dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. The two time intervals were compared on an intention-to-treat basis for patients aged no more than 75 years for any impact on resection rates, surgical morbidity, postoperative mortality and long-term survival.

Results

About two-thirds (259) of the 419 patients registered were aged 75 years or less at diagnosis. Ninety-five of 136 patients in the later interval were eligible for chemotherapy, of whom 90 actually received the specified regimen, and 78 (87 per cent) were able to complete the preoperative course. Only 40 (44 per cent) completed all scheduled preoperative and postoperative cycles. Thirty-eight (43 per cent) of 89 evaluable patients showed a definite response on CT. Chemotherapy had no impact on postoperative morbidity or mortality. The 5-year survival rate on an intention-to-treat basis was 40·7 (95 per cent c.i. 30·7 to 50·7) per cent in the first interval, compared with 41·7 (31·5 to 51·9) per cent after the introduction of perioperative chemotherapy (P = 0·765). After adjustment for other risk factors, based on comparisons of the two time intervals, there were no differences in oncological outcomes with the use of perioperative chemotherapy.

Conclusion

Perioperative chemotherapy was completed in less than half of the patients with resectable gastric cancer. An observed tumour response to chemotherapy did not translate into any long-term survival benefit compared with surgery alone.

### Perioperative chemotherapy versus surgery alone for resectable gastroesophageal cancer [^a4389b13]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival.

Results

ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P = 0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN93793971 [controlled-trials.com].).

### Controversies in the treatment of local and locally advanced gastric and esophageal cancers [^15e5b627]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite overall progress in the therapy of local and locally advanced esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinomas, death as a result of these tumors remains a common outcome. Most randomized phase III trials on which level-one evidence has been built have included the heterogeneous histologies and locations associated with these tumors. However, the different etiologies, molecular biology, and recurrence patterns associated with gastroesophageal malignancies suggest the need to split rather than lump. Biologic and response differences exist between squamous and adenocarcinomas, as well as diffuse and intestinal histologies. This may be a cause behind conflicting outcomes in similar trials. The accepted standard of chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers is based on a few positive trials, with the best chemotherapy and total dose of radiation remaining controversial. In the West, the staging evaluations of locally advanced gastric cancer are not uniform. Yet, these evaluations will inform the results of preoperative and perioperative treatments. Although postoperative chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer has been an accepted treatment option for the last decade, more recent studies have called into question the need for radiotherapy. In perioperative strategies, it has yet to be determined whether histologic or molecular changes in the operative specimen should inform postoperative treatment. An appropriate place for targeted therapy needs to be found in preoperative and postoperative treatment regimens. Finally, because so much is lost when trials are forced to close for lack of accrual, it is imperative to build multidisciplinary consensus before they are launched.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival in cT2N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma patients: a multicenter propensity score analysis [^6d919c59]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Inclusion Criteria

All consecutive adult patients (> 18 years of age) who underwent surgery with curative intent for gastric or esophagogastric junction (Siewert III) adenocarcinoma between January 2007 and December 2017 in the 32 participating centers (Online Resource 1) were assessed for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were histological type other than adenocarcinoma (e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumor, neuroendocrine tumor, lymphoma) or documented patient refusal to participate in clinical research. Patients with clinical T2N0M0 stage at initial diagnosis were identified and included in the current study.

Study Endpoints

The primary endpoint was to assess the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in OS and DFS in the cT2N0M0 patients. Postoperative (in-hospital) morbidity and mortality, as well as recurrence patterns, were assessed as secondary endpoints. For all analyses, cT2N0M0 patients were divided into two groups: chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS group) or upfront surgery (S group). Of note, DFS was calculated after excluding patients who experienced postoperative mortality and patients with metastatic disease upon diagnosis.

Data Collection, Treatment and Follow-Up

Baseline demographic, histological, and treatment data were collected from all eligible patients. Surgical resection and perioperative treatment were performed in all centers, based on the ESMO guidelines. Lymph node dissection was commonly defined as D1.5 or spleen-preserving D2. Chemotherapy regimens varied across centers and local practice, with most common combinations being the ECF/ECXand, more recently, FLOT regimens. Postoperative complications were assessed during the entire hospital stay of the index operation and graded according to the validated 5-scale Dindo–Clavien classification, with grades > IIIa defined as 'major'. Tumor regression grade (TRG) was evaluated by pathologists according to Mandard score. Long-term follow-up was performed by thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and/or upper endoscopy on demand, according to local protocols. When tumor recurrence was detected, it was classified as locoregional (peri-anastomotic, locoregional lymph nodes), distant (solid organ metastasis, peritoneal carcinomatosis), or mixed. The median follow-up in the current series was 32.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 20.1–62.3) for the S group and 30.2 months (IQR 17.9–52.6) for the CS group.

### Minimally invasive staging surgery for cancer [^3c1ecfa9]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Staging laparoscopy (SL) is used to assess for radiographically occult metastatic disease and local resectability in selected patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. SL may avoid nontherapeutic laparotomy in patients with unresectable cancer and is associated with shorter length of hospital stay and time to receipt of systemic therapy compared with nontherapeutic laparotomy. With improvements in preoperative imaging, careful patient selection for SL is imperative. SL and peritoneal washings should be considered for patients with distal gastroesophageal and locally advanced gastric cancer before planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy or resection. SL should be considered in selected high-risk patients with hepatopancreatobiliary malignancies.

### Quality assurance of surgery in the randomized ST03 trial of perioperative chemotherapy in carcinoma of the stomach and gastro-oesophageal junction [^c6687faf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The ST03 trial was a national multicentre trial that recruited patients at almost 100 hospitals in the UK between 2007 and 2013. Its primary outcome was overall survival between the two treatment arms. The trial had a pragmatic design, with R0 resection as the only secondary outcome measure with a surgical theme. As a result, specific details of surgical procedures were not recorded as in a trial comparing surgical procedures. This trial therefore delivers a snapshot of UK contemporary surgical practice. The ST03 surgical protocol was designed to prespecify the surgical approaches and extent of resection to minimize performance bias related to individual surgeon preference, which may be influenced by tumour response to perioperative chemotherapy. The study included prospective data collection on case report forms to record the type of surgical procedure actually undertaken. Development of the ST03 trial protocol was informed by best current evidence. However, it was also pragmatic, thus allowing flexibility in several components of the intervention (such as minimal access or open surgery, extent of lymph node dissection). High‐quality pathological data were available to relate surgical procedures to outcome measures, such as lymph node yield and resection margin status, owing to use of a prespecified histopathology protocol, which included detailed guidance for local pathologists as well as a comprehensive prospective data collection. This analysis showed that surgical procedures and outcomes were similar in both arms of the trial. Therefore, heterogeneity of surgical approach was unlikely to be responsible for the lack of benefit observed in the experimental arm of the trial.

The inclusion of minimally invasive surgery required a protocol modification as such techniques were not commonplace at the inception of the trial. The TMG required surgeons undertaking these procedures in patients entered into the trial to provide evidence of their qualitative outcomes. Despite this requirement, formal review by the TMG was completed for only 28·1 per cent of the minimally invasive procedures undertaken. Retrospective review of the remaining patients showed no excess complication rates and equivalent lymph node yields, suggesting consistency of the quality of the surgery. However, this does highlight one of the challenges in a randomized trial where protocol modifications may be required that could affect outcome.

Despite comprehensive staging assessments at the time of diagnosis and randomization into the trial, 15·8 per cent of the trial population did not undergo resection, with 5·1 per cent found to be inoperable at laparotomy. The outcome for this group was not complicated by excess postoperative morbidity. These levels of inoperability and unresectability are important findings, which should be explained to patients when entering into a trial 21.

### Gastrectomy for gastric cancer: defining critical elements of patient selection and outcome assessment [^cb08e65e]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

In advanced gastric cancer, palliation of symptoms, rather than cure, is often the most appropriate goal of patient management. There are important differences among patients undergoing non-curative operations for gastric cancer. The literature to date is limited, in part, by imprecise use of the term palliative. In clinical decision-making, the potential benefits of proposed procedure must be balanced against the duration of hospitalization, treatment of complications, and requirements for additional palliation. Studies designed to measure palliative interventions would benefit from precise designations of palliative intent inpatients receiving non-curative operations.

### Oxaliplatin plus capecitabine in the perioperative treatment of locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in combination with D2 gastrectomy: NEO-CLASSIC study [^3855adce]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Lessons Learned

The NEO-CLASSIC study provided valuable insight for the clinical efficacy and tolerability profiles of perioperative chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, plus gastrectomy, in patients with localized resectable gastric cancer. The study was designed to explore the potential survival benefits of an eight-cycle, perioperative oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) schedule in the above-mentioned setting and to explore the feasibility of prolonging the cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. The projected endpoint was not met.

Background

This multicenter, open-label study (NEO-CLASSIC) evaluated the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX), plus D2 gastrectomy, in localized resectable gastric cancer.

Methods

Patients aged 18–75 years with histologically-confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (stage T2-4a/N+M0) were given eight cycles of XELOX (four preoperatively, four postoperatively). Each 3-week cycle comprised capecitabine 1,000 mg/m 2 twice daily on days 1–14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 on day 1. Curative D2 gastrectomy was scheduled 2–4 weeks after the last preoperative cycle. The primary objective of the study was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of XELOX in the preoperative setting. Sample size was calculated by assuming that a minimum of 47 cases would be required to increase the ORR by 15% (from 40% to 55%). With an estimated 10% dropout rate, 55 patients would have to be recruited.

Results

Fifty-five patients were enrolled, and one was excluded because of screening failure. R0 resections were achieved in 45 of 54 intent-to-treat patients (83.3%), and four patients received R1 resections (Fig. 1). There were no complete responses, 27 (50.0%) partial responses, 22 cases (40.7%) of stable disease, and 4 (7.4%) of progressive disease. The objective response rate was 50.0%. Median follow-up was 52.97 months; 30 patients (55.6%) had disease progression (Table 1), and median progression-free survival was 20.10 (95% confidence interval: 4.31–35.89) months; median overall survival was 30.77 months (95% confidence interval was not yet available) (Fig. 2). Fifty-four patients completed 209 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy; 42 patients received 133 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy (Table 3). The rate of grade 3–4 adverse events was 8.5% (29/342 cycles); the most frequent events were neutropenia (9/342 cycles) and leukopenia (4/342 cycles).

Conclusion

These findings suggest that combination therapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin as perioperative chemotherapy, followed by D2 gastrectomy, is effective and safe in late-stage, locally advanced gastric cancer. Although enrollment exceeded the 47 patients required to identify an increase in the ORR by 15% (from 40% to 55%), results did not meet the primary endpoint.

Gastric cancer — staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology — Pretreatment diagnostic laparoscopy can detect occult metastases, with a Memorial Sloan Kettering series of 657 patients staged over a period of 10 years showing metastatic disease (M1) in 31% of patients. Cytology testing of peritoneal fluid can help identify occult carcinomatosis, and positive peritoneal cytology even in the absence of visible implants should be considered as M1 disease, and surgery as initial treatment is not recommended. For patients considered for surgical resection without preoperative therapy, laparoscopy may be useful to detect radiographically occult metastatic disease in T3 and/or N+ tumors. The Panel recommends performing diagnostic laparoscopy to assess the peritoneal cavity (with biopsies as needed) and cytology of peritoneal washings in medically fit patients with potentially resectable stage cT1b or higher locoregional disease when considering perioperative therapy and/or surgery, and laparoscopy with cytology can be considered for medically fit patients with surgically unresectable disease.

### Impact of laparoscopic gastrectomy on the completion rate of the perioperative chemotherapy regimen in gastric cancer: a Swedish nationwide study [^832823ce]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this nationwide study, we investigated the impact of a minimally invasive surgical approach on different aspects of the completion of perioperative chemotherapy in GC. After adjusting for clinically relevant covariates, no association between the surgical approach and the rate of initiation, the need for regimen modification, or the time interval to start of the adjuvant chemotherapy became evident. Of the covariates included in the regression models, the occurrence of major postoperative complications was found to be an independent and strong predictor of omission of the adjuvant treatment. In addition, severe morbidity was also associated with a higher rate of chemotherapy reduction following surgery.

Whether the neoadjuvant and adjuvant parts of perioperative chemotherapy regimens are equally important for long-term prognosis is not yet clarified. Asian RCTs have clearly demonstrated the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II/III gastric cancer that have undergone up-front curative resection. – In Europe, however, the preferred modality is perioperative chemotherapy, meaning that patients are already exposed to chemotherapy before surgery. Although evidence is limited, there are studies indicating that the adjuvant portion of chemotherapy may still be of value also in this setting. Glatz et al. studied 134 patients with esophagogastric cancer and found that postoperative chemotherapy contributed substantially to the beneficial effect of the perioperative regimen on survival. Similarly, Saunders et al. analyzed 333 patients and showed that the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy conferred a significant survival benefit, although this was limited to patients with proven histopathological response to the neoadjuvant treatment. Although both studies have certain limitations (retrospective, single center studies with predominantly cardia tumors), they imply that the adjuvant part of perioperative chemotherapy regimens plays a role in recurrence prevention. Nevertheless, the fact that approximately half of the patients will eventually not proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy as intended strengthens the argument that the preoperative component is the most crucial, either as the neoadjuvant part of a perioperative scheme, or as a totally neoadjuvant approach (usually in the form of chemoradiotherapy and mainly for tumors located at the gastroesophageal junction). This not only ensures delivery of systemic treatment when it is most likely that the patient will be able to tolerate it, but also provides an observation period during which subclinical dissemination may manifest, and thus spare some patients with biologically aggressive tumors a futile procedure.

Principles of multidisciplinary team approach for esophagogastric cancers — Category 1 evidence supports the notion that the combined modality therapy is effective for patients with localized esophagogastric cancer, and the combined modality therapy for patients with localized esophagogastric cancer may be optimally delivered when the following elements are in place: frequent meetings (either once a week or once every 2 weeks) are encouraged; optimally at each meeting, all relevant disciplines should be encouraged to participate and these may include: surgical oncology, medical oncology, gastroenterology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology, and the presence of nutritional services, social workers, nursing, palliative care specialists, and other supporting disciplines are also desirable; all long-term therapeutic strategies are best developed after adequate staging procedures are completed, but ideally prior to any therapy that is rendered; joint review of the actual medical data is more effective than reading reports for making sound therapy decisions; a brief documentation of the consensus recommendation(s) by the multidisciplinary team for an individual patient may prove useful; the recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team may be considered advisory to the primary group of treating physicians of the particular patient; re-presentation of select patient outcomes after therapy is rendered may be an effective educational method for the entire multidisciplinary team; and a periodic formal review of relevant literature during the course of the multidisciplinary meeting is highly encouraged.

Results

Patient characteristics and type of surgery performed

A total of 164 patients, 59 women and 105 men, were considered for GC resection at our institution between 2006 and 2010. The median age was 65 years (range 56–73). Surgical resection was performed as front-line treatment in 132 patients; 56 (42%) underwent total gastrectomy and 76 (58%) subtotal gastrectomy. Although at initial imaging all patients were considered eligible, further evaluation at the MDT meeting indicated metastatic disease in 32 patients (19.5%) with peritoneal (55%), lymph nodal (25%) or liver disease (20%), diverted from surgery. D0 gastrectomy was performed in 31 (23.5%), D1 in 62 (47%), D2 in 36 (27.3%), while 3 (2.3%) patients had a palliative operation.

Pathology data

T and N stages for all patients are shown in Table 1. Of the 132 patients operated, 92 (70%) had intestinal and 40 (30%) diffuse adenocarcinoma; 33 (25%) had proximal and 99 (75%) distal location; and 52 (39%) had vascular infiltration and 39 (29%) perineural invasion. An R0 resection was identified in 100 patients (75.8%), whereas R1 and R2 resection were recognized in 25 (18.9%) and 7 (5.3%) patients, respectively.

Adjuvant chemotherapy and RT data

Ninety-two of the 132 patients (70%) received adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) based on the stage and according to the European Society of Medical Oncology's guidelines available at the time. Chemotherapy was offered to all but 1 patient, who did not undergo surgery because of advanced disease and significant comorbidities. There was a range of chemotherapy treatments applied in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, mainly 5FU, platinum and taxane-based as previously reported. Postoperative RT was offered to 2 (6.3%) patients who did not receive surgical treatment for symptom palliation and to 24 (18.2%) patients who underwent resection and fulfilled the predefined criteria.

### Surgical management of gastric cancer… [^bded4769]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance Surgery plays a critical role in the management of all stages of gastric cancer. Observations For patients with early gastric cancer and low risk of lymph node metastasis, endoscopic therapy or surgery alone is potentially curative. Novel techniques, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, may allow for greater use of stomach-sparing procedures that could improve quality of life without compromising oncologic outcomes; however, experience with these techniques is rare outside of East Asia, and studies of long-term outcomes are still ongoing. Patients with later-stage localized gastric cancer benefit from more extensive lymphadenectomy and multimodality therapy, as they are at risk for nodal and distant metastases. There have been recent advances in chemotherapy that have led to improved survival, but the optimal sequencing of multimodality therapy is still being investigated. Better systemic therapy may also increase the role of surgery for patients with oligometastatic disease.

There are ongoing studies examining the efficacy of peritoneal-directed therapies in both patients with low-volume peritoneal disease and patients at high risk of peritoneal recurrence. Conclusions and Relevance The management of gastric cancer continues to evolve. Surgeons should be aware of novel surgical approaches currently under investigation as well as how surgery fits into the contemporary multidisciplinary approach to this disease.

### Controversies in the surgical management of gastric cancer [^2c45319b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma in the United States has declined steadily since the early 1900s, it remains a significant health problem. Progress has been made during the past few decades in several areas: Lymph node staging has been refined, perioperative mortality has fallen, and plausible adjuvant therapy has emerged. Currently, complete surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy because it is the only potentially curative option; however, considerable controversy remains regarding the specifics of a surgical approach. This article examines 4 major controversies in the management of gastric cancer: extent of gastric resection, role of extended lymph node dissection, value of elective splenectomy for proximal gastric lesions, and current state of adjuvant therapy. Pertinent retrospective and prospective studies are reviewed to help formulate meaningful conclusions.

### Gastric cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^2f396ee5]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Option Overview for Gastric Cancer The standard form of curative therapy for gastric cancer is radical surgery. However, the incidences of local failure in the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes, and distant failures via hematogenous or peritoneal routes, remain high. As such, comprehensive staging and evaluation with a multidisciplinary team to determine roles of neoadjuvant, perioperative, and adjuvant combination chemotherapy, surgery, and external-beam radiation therapies should be considered. Investigators in Europe evaluated the role of perioperative chemotherapy without radiation therapy. Initially, in a randomized phase III trial, patients with stage II or higher adenocarcinoma of the stomach or of the lower third of the esophagus were assigned to receive three cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and continuous infusion fluorouracil before and after surgery or to receive surgery alone.

Compared with the surgery group, the perioperative chemotherapy group had a significantly higher overall survival adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction were randomly assigned to receive either surgery alone or surgery plus postoperative chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy.

If the lesion is not in the cardioesophageal junction and does not diffusely involve the stomach, subtotal gastrectomy is the procedure of choice, because it has demonstrated equivalent survival when compared with total gastrectomy and is associated with decreased morbidity. When the lesion involves the cardia, proximal subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy may be performed with curative intent. If the lesion diffusely involves the stomach, total gastrectomy is required. At a minimum, surgical resection includes greater and lesser curvature perigastric regional lymph nodes.

### Association of preoperative chemosensitivity with postoperative survival in patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma [^d5524e11]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Gastric adenocarcinoma is generally associated with poor prognosis, even at the resectable stage. Perioperative chemotherapy is a stand of care for locally advanced gastric carcinoma. However, completion of the entire course of postoperative chemotherapy (PC) is challenging. Even in well-selected trial participants, the completion rate is less than 50%. In addition, the response to preoperative chemotherapy varies. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients are very sensitive to preoperative chemotherapy, leading to complete pathological response. In contrast, at least 20% of patients could achieve only radiologically stable disease. The current standard postoperative practice remains to complete the same preoperative regimen as tolerated, regardless of the patient's response to preoperative chemotherapy.

However, the benefit associated with PC is unclear for all patients, considering the low completion rate. There is currently no biomarker that can reliably select patients who may benefit from PC. In this study using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we hypothesized that preoperative chemosensitivity is associated with survival among patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma who also receive PC.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve survival in cT2N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma patients: a multicenter propensity score analysis [^967fdb7a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This European multicenter cohort study evaluated postoperative and long-term outcomes in patients with cT2N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent either upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not increase postoperative morbidity, and neither did it offer a benefit in OS or decreased recurrence rate in cT2N0 stage patients.

The subgroup of cT2N0 stage patients remains underrepresented in the scientific literature. In a recent retrospective study, Gabriel et al. suggested the absence of survival benefit in cT2N0 patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with upfront surgery for patients with a 'true' T2N0 status (both cT2N0 and pT2N0). In line with these findings, in our series, OS and DFS were also similar for cT2N0 patients, irrespective of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration. On a multivariable level, signet-cell histology and locally advanced cT stage were associated with poor OS. Advanced cT stage, signet ring cell histology, and limited lymphadenectomy (a < 15 lymph node yield) were associated with earlier recurrence.

The present findings are in contrast with the current European (ESMO)and North American (NCCN) gastric cancer treatment guidelines, which suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cT2N0 disease. Interestingly, the current series conducted in 32 European reference centers reveal that 66.3% of cT2N0 patients underwent upfront surgery. How might this divergence from treatment guidelines be explained? Our results illustrate that chemotherapy is more frequently offered to younger patients, with a better overall health status and more proximal tumors. Although the individual motivation behind treatment choices cannot be retrieved for all patients, a tendency to 'spare' chemotherapy to more frail patients with distal tumors has been observed. As previously published by Handforth et al. 'unfit' but operable oncological patients could still benefit from surgical resection, as fragile individuals are more likely to experience chemotherapy intolerance, surgical complications, and death. This is in accordance with previous reports on esophageal cancer patients, where acceptable oncological outcomes were reported when 'chemotherapy-unfit patients' underwent upfront surgery for early disease stage. Interestingly, in the present study, a higher rate of complications was observed in the S group, despite the lower rate of total gastrectomy. Although specific data to explain this difference are not available in our study, we can hypothesize that patient frailty, more pronounced in this group as discussed above, might have a role in increasing surgical morbidity.

### Modern surgical considerations for gastric cancer [^89be25b6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment for localized gastric adenocarcinoma. The type and extent of resection depends on tumor location. Although the incidence of gastric cancer has been declining, a shift has occurred to more tumors involving the proximal compared with the distal stomach. Appropriate treatment depends on a thorough staging process to exclude the presence of distant metastatic disease. Current staging modalities include high-quality CT scan, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. The value of peritoneal lavage to detect occult peritoneal disease is under investigation. The principles of surgical resection have always included negative resection margins and adequate lymph node examination. Controversial topics requiring further study include laparoscopic resections and hepatic metastasectomy. This review highlights the salient points of current surgical management of gastric adenocarcinoma.

### Gastr ı C cancer surgery in elderly patients: promising results from a mid-western population [^e1de66f6]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastric cancers are the fifth most common malignancy worldwide and the third in cancer-related deaths, according to the latest data. In addition, gastric cancers have had rising incidence trends in recent years. In recent studies, the elderly population rate has been increasing worldwide, especially in the last two decades. As a result of this, cancer incidence in the geriatric population is growing.

Surgery is still the only curative treatment for gastric cancer patients. Locally advanced lesions and pre-operative lymph node metastasis should be considered for neoadjuvant therapy. After detecting the tumor's resectability, extensive surgery, including regional lymph nodes, should be performed on the patients. Elderly patients also have comorbid diseases more common; moreover, the physiological reserves of almost all organ systems are reduced. Therefore, extensive oncological resections remain controversial in this population. For most of the trials in this area, elderly patients are usually excluded from the studies. Furthermore, studies on these procedures' outcomes are limited.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the perioperative results of both younger and elderly populations and discuss the safety of gastric resections on geriatric patients. The second objective is to review clinicopathological outcomes from the surgical oncology perspective.

### Peri-operative chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in operable oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (UK medical research council ST03): primary analysis results of a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 2–3 trial [^bb196b79]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, have shown that the addition of peri-operative chemotherapy to surgery improves survival for patients with resectable oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma compared with surgery alone. Despite this increase in survival, mortality in patients with this disease remains high, with 5-year overall survival for localised disease at diagnosis of only about 40%.

Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, improves responses to chemotherapy and progression-free survival, but not overall survival, in patients with advanced gastric cancer. In oesophagogastric cancer, a complete surgical resection (R0 resection) is an important predictor of long-term survival. We postulated that a higher proportion of patients responding to pre-operative chemotherapy would increase the likelihood of an R0 resection and lead to improved survival outcomes. Therefore, we designed ST03 as a phase 2–3 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of adding bevacizumab to peri-operative chemotherapy for patients with resectable oesophagogastric cancer.

The initial phase 2 stage of the trial focused on safety and feasibility in the first 200 patients; these results have been reported previously. The addition of bevacizumab was feasible and did not seem to significantly increase toxic effects or the likelihood or severity of surgical complications. Therefore, the study proceeded to the phase 3 stage.

### Processes of care in the multidisciplinary treatment of gastric cancer: results of a RAND / UCLA expert panel [^180a9b57]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is growing interest in reducing the variations and deficiencies in the multidisciplinary management of gastric cancer.

Objective

To define optimal treatment strategies for gastric adenocarcinoma (GC).

Design, Setting, and Participants

RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method involving a multidisciplinary expert panel of 16 physicians from 6 countries.

Interventions

Gastrectomy, perioperative chemotherapy, adjuvant chemoradiation, surveillance endoscopy, and best supportive care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Panelists scored 416 scenarios regarding treatment scenarios for appropriateness from 1 (highly inappropriate) to 9 (highly appropriate). Median appropriateness scores from 1 to 3 were considered inappropriate; 4 to 6, uncertain; and 7 to 9, appropriate. Agreement was reached when 12 of 16 panelists scored the scenario similarly. Appropriate scenarios agreed on were subsequently scored for necessity.

Results

For patients with T1N0 disease, surgery alone was considered appropriate, while there was no agreement over surgery alone for patients T2N0 disease. Perioperative chemotherapy was appropriate for patients who had T1-2N2-3 or T3-4 GC without major symptoms. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was classified as appropriate for T1-2N1-3 or T3-4 proximal GC and necessary for T1-2N2-3 or T3-4 distal GC. There was no agreement regarding surveillance imaging and endoscopy following gastrectomy. Surveillance endoscopy was deemed to be appropriate after endoscopic resection. For patients with metastatic GC, surgical resection was considered inappropriate for those with no major symptoms, unless the disease was limited to positive cytology alone, in which case there was disagreement.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with GC being treated with curative intent should be considered for multimodal treatment. For patients with incurable disease, surgical interventions should be considered only for the management of major bleeding or obstruction.

### Management of gastric adenocarcinoma for general surgeons [^f08dac68]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, despite declining incidence of the disease in the United States. Because of the rare occurrence of the disease in the United States, there is significant treatment variance in use of diagnostic modalities, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies, and surgical techniques. The survival of patients with gastric cancer in the United States is significantly lower than those of Asian countries where the diagnosis is made at an earlier stage and uniform high-quality treatment is delivered. This article reviews pearls and pitfalls of multidisciplinary management of the gastric adenocarcinoma for best outcomes.

Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology — pretreatment diagnostic laparoscopy can be used to detect occult metastases; in a study at a single center, 657 patients underwent laparoscopic staging over a period of 10 years and metastatic disease (M1) was detected in 31% of patients. Cytology testing of peritoneal fluid can help improve laparoscopic staging through identification of occult carcinomatosis, and positive peritoneal cytology even in the absence of visible peritoneal implants should be considered as M1 disease, and surgery as initial treatment is not recommended. In patients being considered for surgical resection without preoperative therapy, laparoscopy may be useful for detecting radiographically occult metastatic disease in patients with T3 and/or N+ tumors identified on preoperative imaging. The Panel recommends performing diagnostic laparoscopy to assess the peritoneal cavity (with biopsies as needed) and cytology of peritoneal washings in medically fit patients with potentially resectable stage cT1b or higher locoregional disease when considering perioperative therapy and/or surgery, and laparoscopy with cytology can be considered for patients who are medically fit with surgically unresectable disease.

### Oncologic outcomes of patients with resectable primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review [^3187238d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment paradigm for this rare disease is the same as for other gastric malignancies. Nonetheless, it is uncertain whether oncologic outcomes in cases of localized disease are the same as in localized, resectable adenocarcinomas. Given the paucity of relevant literature on PGSCCs, we constructed a patient cohort from isolated cases to extrapolate survival data following surgical resection of these lesions. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated 3- and 5-year overall survival to be approximately 62.2% and 51.9%, respectively, with even lower 3-year disease-free survival at 38% following curative intent surgery with or without adjuvant therapy. Akce et al, in their study, quote inferior 5-year overall survival rates of 14.7%, in a patient population that was largely managed non-operatively, mainly because of the presence of metastatic disease at presentation. These observations suggest that PSGCC amenable to surgical resection is likely to be associated with enhanced survival and metastatic disease is possibly an important factor influencing long-term oncologic outcomes.

Furthermore, T4 and node-positive stages were found to be significant negative predictors of survival in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. It is possible that this may be due to a type II statistical error related to the small accrued patient sample, although it is also possible that advanced T-stage correlates strongly with lymphatic spread and therefore cannot be assessed independently. Notwithstanding this limitation, survival following resection of non-metastatic PGSCC appears to be roughly equal to that following resection of gastric adenocarcinoma, and therefore surgery should be aggressively pursued whenever disease clearance is technically feasible, irrespective of T and N stage, in the effort to optimize oncologic outcomes.

As far as adjuvant therapy is concerned, no standardized treatment regimens have been established as yet, with most authors reporting the use of 5-FU or cisplatin-based drug combinations. In our analysis, the use of adjuvant therapy was not associated with prolonged survival, nevertheless, given the lack of data, many factors were left unaccounted for, most importantly the performance status and comorbidities of included patients. In addition, radiotherapy was scarcely used: only in 2 patients of the entire cohort, for whom no follow-up data are available, and therefore no assumptions on its usefulness in the setting of PGSCC can be made. Taking into consideration the radiosensitivity of other squamous neoplasms of the digestive tract, we speculate that radiation therapy, in addition to chemotherapy, may be more effective in improving disease-free and overall survivals.

Survivorship in gastric cancer — screening and management of long-term sequelae are important, but due to a lack of large randomized trials the Panel's recommendations are based on smaller studies, clinical experience, and other consensus recommendations and guidelines; survivorship care planning should include appropriate timing of transfer of care to a primary care physician and maintenance of a therapeutic relationship, with clearly delineated roles between oncology and primary care, and routine gastric cancer-specific surveillance is not recommended for more than 5 years.

### Esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^39deada5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Perioperative chemotherapy for gastric and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) adenocarcinoma — MAGIC, FLOT4, and regimen selection — are summarized as follows: The landmark phase III MAGIC trial comparing perioperative epirubicin/cisplatin/fluorouracil (ECF) to surgery alone established that perioperative chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in non-metastatic stage II and higher disease. In FLOT4 phase II, 265 patients were randomized to ECF (n = 137) or FLOT (n = 128); FLOT had higher pCR rates (16%; 95% CI, 10–23 vs. 6%; 95% CI, 3–11; P = 0.02) and fewer grade 3–4 adverse events (40% of patients in the ECF group vs. 25% of patients in the FLOT group). In FLOT4 phase III, 716 patients were randomized to FLOT (n = 356) or ECF (n = 360), and median OS was improved with FLOT (50 vs. 35 months; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.94) with similar serious chemotherapy-related adverse events (27% in the ECF group vs. 27% in the FLOT group). Accordingly, ECF should no longer be recommended; due to considerable toxicity with FLOT, the panel recommends its use in select patients with good performance status, and the preferred perioperative regimen for most patients with good to moderate performance status is FOLFOX. Additional support comes from the FNCLCC ACCORD 07 trial (n = 224; 75% lower esophagus or EGJ adenocarcinoma), which reported fluorouracil/cisplatin perioperative therapy significantly increased curative resection rate, DFS, and OS, with 5-year OS 38% at a median follow-up of 5.7 years for the perioperative group.

### White blood cell and cell-free DNA analyses for detection of residual disease in gastric cancer [^41e73d9a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In the present study, we apply a matched cfDNA and WBC sequencing approach to accurately detect ctDNA alterations after preoperative chemotherapy and after surgery in patients with resectable gastric cancer. We hypothesize that ctDNA detection after completion of preoperative treatment as well as MRD detection after surgery can predict recurrence and survival in patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with multimodal therapeutic regimens. Overall, these analyses evaluate a strategy to distinguish ctDNA alterations from cfDNA variants related to clonal hematopoiesis and investigate whether ctDNA elimination before or after surgery can serve as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative treatment.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^484ce5f8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — biopsy strategy and perioperative decision-making state that if a biopsy does not confirm malignancy, at least one repeat biopsy should be performed, and EUS-guided FNA and a core needle biopsy at a high-volume center is preferred. When cancer is not confirmed after two or three biopsies in patients with borderline resectable disease, the Panel recommends referral to a high-volume center for further evaluation. Core needle biopsy is recommended, if possible, for all patients with locally advanced or metastatic or recurrent disease to obtain adequate tissue for potential ancillary studies, including tumor/somatic molecular profiling, and alternative diagnoses including autoimmune pancreatitis should be considered. A positive biopsy is required before administration of chemotherapy, but biopsy proof of malignancy is not required before surgical resection for clearly resectable or borderline resectable disease and a nondiagnostic biopsy should not delay surgical resection when the clinical suspicion for pancreatic cancer is high. The NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Panel strongly recommends that all diagnostic and surgical management decisions involve multidisciplinary consultation, and the Panel believes that core biopsies should not replace EUS-guided FNA but rather can be performed in addition to EUS-guided FNA.

### Current status and future directions in gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination [^21db9278]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from gastric cancer is mostly associated with poor prognosis. Despite the improvement of survival with modern polychemotherapy, the results are still unsatisfactory. Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy might provide an additional therapeutic option for highly selected patients with gastric cancer and peritoneal metastasis leading to improved prognosis. Considering the increased rate of perioperative morbidity and the crucial prognostic role of complete macroscopic cytoreduction, adequate preoperative diagnostics and patient selection are strongly recommended. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to determine the roles of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy as part of an interdisciplinary treatment concept.

### Impact of laparoscopic gastrectomy on the completion rate of the perioperative chemotherapy regimen in gastric cancer: a Swedish nationwide study [^76d0725a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations. Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Research Ethics Committee of Stockholm (2013/596–31/3, 2016/1486–32, and 2020–06495). The complementary review of medical records was approved by the institutional review board at each participating hospital, or the regional authority legally responsible for the handling of personal data, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.

Data Source

Eligible patients were identified in the Swedish National Register for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer (NREV). This national quality register prospectively collects data on patients diagnosed with these malignancies in Sweden and has been described in detail elsewhere. Data are acquired through a number of surveys at different time points, reported on a web module by the hospital responsible for the treatment and follow-up of the patient. The NREV database has previously been validated and shown to have a high grade of data completeness and accuracy. The register was the source of information on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, details of the surgical treatment, and postoperative outcomes, including histopathological findings. Since the survey concerning the details of the oncological treatment was introduced in 2017, and thus not available for the entire study period, information regarding the neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy was retrieved by reviewing the patients' medical records. This included type of chemotherapy regimen, time interval between surgery and initiation of chemotherapy, number of cycles initially planned and ultimately administered, regimen modifications, and reason for not initiating the adjuvant treatment. During this review process, missing register data (mainly owing to unreported follow-up surveys) were also added.

Study Population

Patients treated with curative intent for adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction Siewert type IIIbetween 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020 were identified in NREV. The study inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical stage T2-4aN0-3M0 according to the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors,(2) combined modality treatment, consisting of surgery and perioperative chemotherapy, (3) Standard open or laparoscopic gastrectomy performed (distal or total gastrectomy, with or without splenectomy), and (4) No other concomitant malignancy.

Exposure

Included patients were stratified into two groups according to surgical approach, i.e. LG and OG (reference group). Analyses were performed based on the intention-to-treat principle, with laparoscopic procedures converted to open included in the LG group.
