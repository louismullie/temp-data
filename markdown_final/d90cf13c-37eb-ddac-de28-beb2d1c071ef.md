## Question

This question relates to the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) landmark trial.

How should you counsel an unvaccinated, at-risk outpatient about expected symptom course if they start molnupiravir versus no antiviral, based on MOVe-OUT's patient-reported outcomes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel an unvaccinated, at-risk outpatient about the expected symptom course if they start molnupiravir versus no antiviral, based on MOVe-OUT's patient-reported outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial population and design to ensure applicability. Then, I should verify the patient-reported outcome definitions and analytic methods. Next, I will extract the key symptom endpoints and quantify the differences. After that, I need to check the clinical significance and translate it into practical counseling. Finally, I should consider limitations, external validity, and safety counseling, and close with a concise, patient-centered summary anchored to the data.

> Let me first confirm the trial context and whether it matches the patient in question. MOVe-OUT enrolled nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for progression, treating within 5 days of symptom onset; the PRO analyses were prespecified secondary endpoints using a 15-item daily symptom diary through day 29, which aligns with the scenario of an unvaccinated, at-risk outpatient considering molnupiravir [^e5d02dcf] [^3893e876].

> I need to verify the PRO endpoints and analytic approach so I don't misstate the results. The key measures were time to sustained resolution or improvement (three consecutive days of reduced severity without relapse), time to first symptom resolution, time to first alleviation, and time to progression (two consecutive days of worsening severity); analyses used Kaplan-Meier estimates and stratified Cox models, with diary completion rates exceeding 92% through day 29, which supports reliability of the PRO data [^b3b210eb] [^be0f3a3b].

> Now, let me extract the quantitative differences for the five distinctive symptoms emphasized in the analyses: cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Median time to first resolution was 18 days with molnupiravir versus 20 days with placebo, and median time to first alleviation was 13 days versus 15 days, respectively; hazard ratios favored molnupiravir for both endpoints, indicating faster improvement, though confidence intervals crossed 1 for some comparisons, reflecting modest effect sizes [^7e16f6f1] [^1aa6b736].

> Hold on, I should verify the broader symptom set, not just the five distinctive symptoms. For all 15 targeted symptoms, median time to alleviation of all symptoms was 8 days with molnupiravir versus 10 days with placebo, and median time to sustained alleviation was 15 days versus 16 days; again, hazard ratios favored molnupiravir, suggesting a modest but consistent acceleration of symptom improvement across the constellation of COVID-19 symptoms [^7e16f6f1] [^1aa6b736].

> Let me consider clinical significance and how to translate this into counseling. A 2-day reduction in time to first resolution or alleviation, and a 2-day reduction in time to alleviation of all symptoms, is modest but meaningful at the patient level, particularly for those with higher symptom burden or occupational needs; importantly, molnupiravir also reduced the likelihood of symptom progression at early time points, which reinforces a clinically perceptible benefit in symptom trajectory even if absolute differences are small [^be0f3a3b] [^a580e572].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about absolute risk changes or "how much better will I feel"? I should confirm that MOVe-OUT's PRO analyses report medians and hazard ratios rather than absolute risk differences for symptom endpoints, so I cannot provide a precise absolute risk reduction for symptom resolution; I should explain that the benefit is best framed as a modest acceleration of improvement and a lower chance of symptom worsening, rather than a guarantee of faster recovery for everyone [^7e16f6f1] [^be0f3a3b].

> Next, I should review limitations and external validity so counseling is balanced. The PRO analyses were prespecified but not the primary endpoint, and some post hoc explorations were conducted; the population was unvaccinated and largely pre-Omicron, so effects in vaccinated or Omicron-era patients may differ; nonetheless, convergent data from PANORAMIC in largely vaccinated participants show faster recovery with molnupiravir despite no reduction in hospitalizations, supporting symptom benefits across eras, albeit with smaller absolute effects in lower-risk populations [^8f805cc7] [^3f6550a3].

> I need to ensure safety counseling is accurate. Molnupiravir was generally well tolerated in MOVe-OUT, with adverse event rates similar to placebo and low discontinuation; however, I should confirm reproductive counseling: it is not recommended in pregnancy, and contraception is advised during treatment and for 4 days after in females and for 3 months after in males, given theoretical mutagenesis concerns; I should also note that viral RNA rebound can occur after treatment but was not associated with increased hospitalization or death in MOVe-OUT [^a1cb84e1] [^797373b7] [^1f40cd01].

> Let me synthesize a patient-centered message. If you start molnupiravir within 5 days of symptom onset, you can expect your symptoms to begin improving a few days sooner on average, with about a 2-day reduction in time to first alleviation and to sustained improvement across common COVID-19 symptoms; you are also less likely to experience symptom progression in the first week, and the medicine is generally well tolerated, though we will avoid use in pregnancy and ensure contraception is in place as needed [^7e16f6f1] [^be0f3a3b] [^a1cb84e1].

> Finally, I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty. The symptom benefits are modest and estimates come with confidence intervals that include no effect for some comparisons, so I should emphasize that individual experiences will vary; still, across multiple PRO endpoints in MOVe-OUT, molnupiravir consistently shortened symptom burden by about 1–2 days and reduced progression risk, which aligns with a clinically meaningful, though not dramatic, patient-perceived benefit in the intended population [^7e16f6f1] [^be0f3a3b].

---

Molnupiravir shortens the time to symptom resolution by about 2 days in unvaccinated, high-risk outpatients with COVID-19, with a median time to first symptom resolution of **18 vs 20 days** versus placebo and a median time to first alleviation of **13 vs 15 days** [^7e16f6f1]. It also reduces the likelihood of symptom progression and accelerates sustained alleviation of all symptoms, with a median of **15 vs 16 days** versus placebo [^7e16f6f1]. These benefits are modest and should be weighed against limited efficacy versus alternatives and reproductive safety concerns; molnupiravir is reserved for patients who cannot use nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir [^c02e783f] [^bd46158e].

## Patient-reported symptom outcomes in MOVe-OUT

The MOVe-OUT trial included **1,408 nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults** with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for progression [^e5d02dcf]. Participants completed a 15-item symptom diary daily through day 29, rating severity as none, mild, moderate, or severe; loss of smell and taste were recorded as yes/no [^3893e876]. Key PRO endpoints included:

- **Time to sustained resolution/improvement**: Three consecutive days of reduced severity without relapse [^b3b210eb].
- **Time to symptom progression**: Two consecutive days of worsening severity [^b3b210eb].
- **Time to first resolution**: First day of three consecutive days with symptoms rated as none or mild [^b3b210eb].
- **Time to first alleviation**: First day of three consecutive days with symptoms rated as none or mild after being moderate or severe at baseline [^b3b210eb].

---

## Key findings on symptom resolution and alleviation

Molnupiravir demonstrated **modest improvements** in symptom resolution and alleviation compared with placebo:

| **Endpoint** | **Molnupiravir** | **Placebo** | **Hazard ratio (hr)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Median time to first resolution of symptoms | 18 days | 20 days | HR 1.18 (95% CI 1.03–1.34) [^7e16f6f1] |
| Median time to first alleviation of symptoms | 13 days | 15 days | HR 1.16 (95% CI 1.03–1.32) [^7e16f6f1] |
| Median time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms | 15 days | 16 days | HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02–1.33) [^7e16f6f1] |

---

These results indicate that molnupiravir accelerates symptom resolution and alleviation by approximately 2 days compared with placebo, with sustained alleviation occurring about 1 day earlier [^7e16f6f1].

---

## Symptom progression and severity

Molnupiravir also reduced the likelihood of symptom progression. Participants receiving molnupiravir were less likely to experience progression of symptoms, including cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell or taste, compared with placebo [^1aa6b736]. The proportion of participants reporting moderate-to-severe symptoms declined more rapidly in the molnupiravir group, particularly for the five distinctive COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell, and loss of taste) [^f4c33b39].

---

## Clinical significance and patient counseling

The observed reductions in symptom duration and progression are modest but clinically meaningful for patients seeking faster relief. Patients can expect symptoms to resolve approximately 2 days earlier with molnupiravir compared with no antiviral treatment, and they are less likely to experience symptom worsening during the acute phase of illness [^7e16f6f1]. However, it is essential to counsel patients that molnupiravir is less effective than nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in preventing hospitalization and death, and its use is generally reserved for those who cannot access or tolerate alternative therapies [^c02e783f] [^bd46158e].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: The MOVe-OUT trial enrolled unvaccinated participants, so the applicability of PRO findings to vaccinated populations is uncertain [^8f805cc7].
- **Modest effect size**: The observed symptom benefits are modest, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^7e16f6f1].
- **Safety considerations**: Molnupiravir is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm, and contraception is advised during treatment and for a period after completion [^797373b7].

---

Molnupiravir provides modest improvements in symptom resolution and alleviation in unvaccinated, high-risk outpatients with COVID-19, with a median reduction of about 2 days in symptom duration compared with placebo. These benefits should be balanced against limited efficacy versus alternatives and reproductive safety concerns, and molnupiravir is generally reserved for patients who cannot use nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir [^c02e783f] [^bd46158e].

Background

Molnupiravir is an orally administered antiviral authorized for COVID-19 treatment in adults at high risk of progression to severe disease. Here, we report secondary and post hoc analyses of participants' self-reported symptoms in the MOVe-OUT trial, which evaluated molnupiravir initiated within 5 days of symptom onset in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Methods

Eligible participants completed a 15-item symptom diary daily from day 1 (randomization) through day 29, rating symptom severity as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe"; loss of smell and loss of taste were rated as "yes" or "no". Time to sustained symptom resolution/improvement was defined as the number of days from randomization to the first of 3 consecutive days of reduced severity, without subsequent relapse. Time to symptom progression was defined as the number of days from randomization to the first of 2 consecutive days of worsening severity. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate event rates at various time points. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio between molnupiravir and placebo.

Results

For most targeted COVID-19 symptoms, sustained resolution/improvement was more likely, and progression was less likely, in the molnupiravir versus placebo group through day 29. When evaluating 5 distinctive symptoms of COVID-19, molnupiravir participants had a shorter median time to first resolution (18 vs 20 d) and first alleviation (13 vs 15 d) of symptoms compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Molnupiravir treatment in at-risk, unvaccinated patients resulted in improved clinical outcomes for most participant-reported COVID-19 symptoms compared with placebo. Clinical Trials Registration. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04575597.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be asymptomatic or may develop into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a variable clinical course ranging from mild to critical illness. There is a need for more effective drugs against COVID-19 that not only improve patient outcomes but that can be self-administered in the outpatient setting to reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molnupiravir is an orally administered prodrug of the small-molecule, nucleoside-analogue β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), which has demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. In the global phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter MOVe-OUT trial assessing the safety and efficacy of molnupiravir in at-risk, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, molnupiravir demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which refer to any report of the status of a patient's health condition that comes directly from the patient, are useful because they enhance the understanding of patients' experiences with the study intervention compared with investigator-assessed or biomedical measures alone. Another advantage of evaluating PROs in clinical trials is improved communication between patients and healthcare providers/investigators, which may further support adherence and provide better understanding of treatment benefits. The increased use of PROs in clinical trials in recent years may be attributed to the recognition of PROs as appropriate measures of treatment efficacy and/or supporting data for efficacy outcomes and encouragement for use by regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of PRO endpoints that can address various aspects of patient health, including symptoms, quality of life, and functionality. Furthermore, symptom-based assessments are becoming more insightful for the evaluation of COVID-19 treatments because of the decrease in hospitalizations or deaths due to emerging viral variants that are less virulent and higher rates of preexisting vaccine- and infection-induced host immunity. For clinical trials evaluating drugs for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in outpatient adults and adolescents, the FDA has recommended systematically assessing key COVID-19‒related symptoms reported by patients to provide an accurate evaluation of treatment benefit.

Abstract

Background

Molnupiravir is an orally administered antiviral authorized for COVID-19 treatment in adults at high risk of progression to severe disease. Here, we report secondary and post hoc analyses of participants' self-reported symptoms in the MOVe-OUT trial, which evaluated molnupiravir initiated within 5 days of symptom onset in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Methods

Eligible participants completed a 15-item symptom diary daily from day 1 (randomization) through day 29, rating symptom severity as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe"; loss of smell and loss of taste were rated as "yes" or "no". Time to sustained symptom resolution/improvement was defined as the number of days from randomization to the first of 3 consecutive days of reduced severity, without subsequent relapse. Time to symptom progression was defined as the number of days from randomization to the first of 2 consecutive days of worsening severity. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate event rates at various time points. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio between molnupiravir and placebo.

Results

For most targeted COVID-19 symptoms, sustained resolution/improvement was more likely, and progression was less likely, in the molnupiravir versus placebo group through day 29. When evaluating 5 distinctive symptoms of COVID-19, molnupiravir participants had a shorter median time to first resolution (18 vs 20 d) and first alleviation (13 vs 15 d) of symptoms compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Molnupiravir treatment in at-risk, unvaccinated patients resulted in improved clinical outcomes for most participant-reported COVID-19 symptoms compared with placebo.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^7e16f6f1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The study MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) was published by Yanfen Guan and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the trial question was: what is the role of molnupiravir in at-risk, unvaccinated patients with COVID-19? In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the population was: 1408 patients (723 female, 685 male). The inclusion criteria were nonhospitalized, unvaccinated, at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 5 days before randomization. The key exclusion criteria were current hospitalization or an expected need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 within 48 hours of randomization; receipt of certain therapies indicated specifically for the treatment of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the interventions were: n = 709 molnupiravir (oral dose of 800 mg BID for 5 days) n = 699 placebo (matching placebo BID for 5 days). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median time to first resolution of symptoms (18 days vs. 20 days; HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.34). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median time to first alleviation of symptoms (13 days vs. 15 days; HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32) Significant increase in median time to alleviation of all symptoms through day 29 (8 days vs. 10 days; HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.4) Borderline significant increase in median time to sustained alleviation of all symptoms through day 29 (15 days vs. 16 days; HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33). In the MOVe-OUT (patient-reported symptom outcomes) study, the conclusion was: in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated, at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 5 days before randomization, molnupiravir was superior to placebo with respect to median time to first resolution of symptoms.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^e5d02dcf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The trial protocol (no. MK-4482-002) and all amendments were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.

Trial Design

Details of MOVe-OUT (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04575597) have been previously reported. This paper reports on the participant-reported symptom outcomes in the phase 3 component of the trial conducted between May and November 2021. Participants aged 18 years and older with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 5 or fewer days prior to enrollment were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral molnupiravir 800 mg or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The first dose of the trial drug was administered within 24 hours of randomization. The modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population, which is the primary population for evaluation of efficacy, included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the trial drug and were not hospitalized before the first dose. Trial visits occurred at screening and on days 1 (baseline), 3, 5 (end of therapy [EOT]), 10, 15, and 29.

Key inclusion criteria included having at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19 (> 60 y old, active cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m², serious heart conditions [including heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies], or diabetes mellitus) and at least 1 symptom attributable to COVID-19 with onset 5 or fewer days prior to randomization. Key exclusion criteria included current hospitalization or an expected need for hospitalization due to COVID-19 within 48 hours of randomization, receipt of certain therapies indicated specifically for the treatment of COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^b5ecf99b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In MOVe-OUT, treatment with molnupiravir resulted in improved outcomes for most participant-reported COVID-19 symptoms compared with placebo. When evaluating 5 symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 at the time of trial conduct (prior to the Omicron wave), molnupiravir-treated participants were more likely to achieve sustained resolution/improvement and less likely to experience progression of symptoms than those receiving placebo at nearly all time points. In addition, the median time to first resolution and first alleviation of these distinctive COVID-19 symptoms was shorter in participants treated with molnupiravir through day 29 when compared with the placebo group. These results are consistent with other exploratory and post hoc endpoints from MOVe-OUT (eg, evaluation of biomarkers, respiratory interventions, and use of medical services), which demonstrated additional clinical benefits beyond a reduction in hospitalization/deaths in participants treated with molnupiravir.

Recently published real-world evidence supports the impact of molnupiravir on patient-reported symptom data, including in vaccinated patients during the Omicron wave. In PANORAMIC, a vaccinated, lower-risk patient population than in MOVe-OUT was enrolled, with consequent low rates of hospitalization and/or death (< 1%) during the study, and no effect was seen for the primary endpoint regarding reducing the number of hospitalizations or deaths. However, PANORAMIC demonstrated treatment benefit of molnupiravir in secondary symptom-based endpoints based on a broad range of PROs, including a faster time to sustained recovery, with a clinically meaningful difference of 4.2 days compared with standard-of-care treatment alone. Consistent with findings from the PANORAMIC study, post hoc analyses from MOVe-OUT demonstrated reduced median time to alleviation, and sustained alleviation, of all 15 targeted symptoms through day 29 in participants treated with molnupiravir compared with placebo.

### Molnupiravir versus placebo in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK (AGILE CST-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial [^f22fd7e5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

The antiviral drug molnupiravir was licensed for treating at-risk patients with COVID-19 on the basis of data from unvaccinated adults. We aimed to evaluate the safety and virological efficacy of molnupiravir in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19.

Methods

This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial (AGILE CST-2) was done at five National Institute for Health and Care Research sites in the UK. Eligible participants were adult (aged ≥ 18 years) outpatients with PCR-confirmed, mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who were within 5 days of symptom onset. Using permuted blocks (block size 2 or 4) and stratifying by site, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either molnupiravir (orally; 800 mg twice daily for 5 days) plus standard of care or matching placebo plus standard of care. The primary outcome was the time from randomisation to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity on nasopharyngeal swabs and was analysed by use of a Bayesian Cox proportional hazards model for estimating the probability of a superior virological response (hazard ratio [HR] > 1) for molnupiravir versus placebo. Our primary model used a two-point prior based on equal prior probabilities (50%) that the HR was 1·0 or 1·5. We defined a priori that if the probability of a HR of more than 1 was more than 80% molnupiravir would be recommended for further testing. The primary outcome was analysed in the intention-to-treat population and safety was analysed in the safety population, comprising participants who had received at least one dose of allocated treatment. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04746183, and the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN27106947, and is ongoing.

Findings

Between Nov 18, 2020, and March 16, 2022, 1723 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 180 were randomly assigned to receive either molnupiravir (n = 90) or placebo (n = 90) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 103 (57%) of 180 participants were female and 77 (43%) were male and 90 (50%) participants had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 infections with the delta (B.1.617.2; 72 [40%] of 180), alpha (B.1.1.7; 37 [21%]), omicron (B.1.1.529; 38 [21%]), and EU1 (B.1.177; 28 [16%]) variants were represented. All 180 participants received at least one dose of treatment and four participants discontinued the study (one in the molnupiravir group and three in the placebo group). Participants in the molnupiravir group had a faster median time from randomisation to negative PCR (8 days [95% CI 8–9]) than participants in the placebo group (11 days [10–11]; HR 1·30, 95% credible interval 0·92–1·71; log-rank p = 0·074). The probability of molnupiravir being superior to placebo (HR > 1) was 75·4%, which was less than our threshold of 80%. 73 (81%) of 90 participants in the molnupiravir group and 68 (76%) of 90 participants in the placebo group had at least one adverse event by day 29. One participant in the molnupiravir group and three participants in the placebo group had an adverse event of a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or higher severity. No participants died (due to any cause) during the trial.

Interpretation

We found molnupiravir to be well tolerated and, although our predefined threshold was not reached, we observed some evidence that molnupiravir has antiviral activity in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, although this evidence is not conclusive.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^7101e4c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The PRO data from the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial suggest that treatment with molnupiravir resulted in improved outcomes — both for sustained resolution/improvement and progression — for most COVID-19 symptoms compared with placebo. These results are consistent with the overall results from MOVe-OUT, where molnupiravir demonstrated a benefit in reducing hospitalization and/or death and was well tolerated in nonhospitalized adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. These data contribute to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the benefits of molnupiravir on clinical outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

### Outpatient treatment for COVID-19… [^c02e783f]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has US Food and Drug Administration approval for people aged 18 years or older and is available under Emergency Use Authorization for individuals aged 12 to 17 years who weigh at least 40 kg. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is taken orally, twice daily for 5 days, and should be started within 5 days of onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The most common side effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are altered taste, nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness. Some patients experience a return of COVID-19 symptoms after completing a 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. This symptom "rebound" is not associated with an increased risk of developing severe disease and does not need to be treated with another course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Remdesivir has FDA approval for treatment of COVID-19 in people aged 28 days or older who weigh at least 3 kg. For outpatients, remdesivir is given intravenously daily for 3 days and should be started within 7 days of COVID-19 symptoms.

Because intravenous infusion is required, remdesivir is reserved for patients who are ineligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Remdesivir commonly causes nausea and diarrhea and, rarely, causes allergic reactions and elevations in liver function tests. Molnupiravir is the least effective outpatient medication for COVID-19, so it should be given only to patients who are not eligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or remdesivir. Molnupiravir is not authorized for patients younger than 18 years or for individuals who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir substantially decrease risk of hospitalization and work best when taken early in the course of COVID-19. Most patients improve several days to 2 weeks after starting these medications, but those who develop shortness of breath or other concerning symptoms should seek immediate medical care.

Patients with weakened immune systems who have prolonged COVID-19 symptoms and persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 test results may benefit from longer courses of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or remdesivir.

IDSA COVID-19 outpatient therapy — molnupiravir recommendation states that the guideline panel suggests the use of molnupiravir for ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who are within five days of symptom onset and have no other treatment options. More data are needed on the potential adverse effects of this medication. The evidence supporting this recommendation will be reassessed with the release of updated published information from newer trials. Outcomes had a high risk of bias so were not considered for making the recommendation.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^dff41bcb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The Platform Adaptive Trial of Novel Antivirals for Early Treatment of COVID-19 in the Community (PANORAMIC) study is an ongoing, UK-based, open-label, prospective, randomized, platform, adaptive, controlled clinical study that evaluated over 25 000 at-risk patients with COVID-19 and included PROs as key secondary outcome measures to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir plus usual care compared with usual care alone in the treatment of COVID-19. Since this study consisted of a large dataset and demonstrated use of symptom-based endpoints as outcome measures, we conducted similar post hoc analyses, including time to alleviation and time to sustained alleviation, of all 15 symptoms. Time to alleviation of all 15 symptoms was defined as the time from randomization to the first day that all 15 symptoms were alleviated (symptoms scored as "moderate" or "severe" at baseline and subsequently scored as "none" or "mild"; for loss of smell and loss of taste, symptoms scored as "yes" at baseline and subsequently scored as "no"). Time to sustained alleviation of all 15 symptoms was defined as the time from randomization to the first day that all 15 symptoms were alleviated (as defined above), without subsequently being reported as "moderate" or "severe" or subsequently reported as "yes" for loss of smell and loss of taste. For individual symptoms, participants who did not have symptom alleviation were censored at the last date they recorded that specific symptom. Participants who died were censored at day 29.

Statistical Analysis

Time to sustained resolution/improvement and time to progression, and the additional post hoc analyses of time to event (ie, first symptom resolution/improvement, first symptom alleviation, alleviation of all reported symptoms, and sustained alleviation of all reported symptoms), were evaluated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Hazard ratios (HRs) between molnupiravir and placebo were estimated based on a stratified Cox regression model, which was adjusted for the randomization stratum (ie, participants' time from symptom onset prior to the day of randomization [≤ 3 d, > 3 d]). Analyses were descriptive and not adjusted for multiplicity. Missing symptom diary data were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward method.

### Molnupiravir: is It time to move in or move out? [^1b39cd4a]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Molnupiravir: Is It Time to Move In or Move Out?With more than 250 million diagnosed cases and 5 million deaths, Covid-19 is our epoch-defining pandemic - and it is still ongoing. Despite the development of several effective Covid-19 vaccines, there are a limited number of antiviral treatments to reduce disease progression, risk of hospitalization, and death once the infection occurs. In this editorial, we examine the results of the phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of molnupiravir,…

### Randomized controlled trial of molnupiravir SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody response in at-risk adult outpatients [^d3994dd1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with the nucleoside analogue molnupiravir (MK4482, EIDD2801) was reported to reduce viral load, hospitalisation and mortality in unvaccinated participants with early COVID-19 in the MOVeOUT trial. Based on these data, molnupiravir received emergency use authorisation in the UK in November 2021 for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals deemed to be at higher risk of complications due to age or underlying comorbidities.

Molnupiravir is metabolised intracellularly to NHC-triphosphate, which competes with natural cytidine and uridine for incorporation by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) into the nascent viral RNA. This leads to abnormal, non-Watson-Crick pairing with guanosine and uridine in further rounds of replication, increasing the substitution of adenosine for guanosine and cytosine for uridine, so-called transition mutations, within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Lethal mutagenesis resulting from treatment with RdRp inhibitors eventually leads to viral extinction. A distinctive pattern of transition mutagenesis is evident in viral genomes recovered from animals and humans who have received molnupiravir –. The risk that, following molnupiravir treatment, some highly mutated viruses might remain viable and capable of onward transmission has been postulated.

To measure the impact of molnupiravir in a largely vaccinated population, the Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of covid-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC) was established. The first drug tested in PANORAMIC was molnupiravir, and amongst 25,783 mostly vaccinated individuals, found that molnupiravir did not reduce hospitalisation or death(primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes showed those receiving molnupiravir experienced significantly reduced viral load during treatment and reported faster symptom recovery and fewer general practitioner consultations than those receiving Usual Care.

Here we report detailed results of the PANORAMICvirology sub-study, where a subset of participants in both arms underwent serial virology and immunology sampling. Demographic, clinical, and viral load data together with biomarkers of immune response (anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody) and disease severity (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP)) were collected to study viral and immune dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and viral culture provide further insights into the risk-benefit profile of molnupiravir to patient and public health.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^ab48a8cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

To assess the impact of molnupiravir treatment on COVID-19 symptoms reported directly from patients, we present participant-reported symptoms data from the phase 3 component of MOVe-OUT. Key secondary objectives of MOVe-OUT were to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir compared with placebo as assessed by time to sustained resolution/improvement, and time to progression, of targeted self-reported COVID-19 symptoms daily from baseline through day 29.

### Real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir as treatments for COVID-19 in patients at high risk [^3d03d0e8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of clinical trials, most notably MOVe-OUT, revealed that early use of molnupiravir (ie, within 5 days of symptom onset) reduced the RR of hospitalization or death by 30% among unvaccinated patients at mild to moderate risk for severe disease. Similarly, the EPIC-HR trial reported an 88% relative reduction of risk of hospitalization or death in patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in 90.3% of the vaccinated population (3 doses). While both antivirals significantly reduced viral loads more effectively than placebo, the results presented in both trials revealed that the number needed to treat was higher for molnupiravir than nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, suggesting that the latter drug may have a more robust antiviral effect.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^8f805cc7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The PRO endpoints provide information on treatment efficacy that is not attained through objective markers or clinical assessments. The current SARS-CoV-2 variants and the increase in preexisting immunity from vaccination and/or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection have resulted in lower overall rates of hospitalization and mortality, emphasizing the importance of symptom data in informing the treatment benefits of new SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Although there have been efforts to develop disease-specific PROs to assess COVID-19 symptoms and treatment impact, there is still a lack of consensus on how to evaluate symptom-based endpoints in the dynamic landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics.

Strengths of this trial include its global conduct at 107 sites and the high rates of symptom diary completion. A large and diverse cohort can provide a better understanding of the efficacy of molnupiravir therapy as reported directly from patients across multiple racial and ethnic groups. In this trial, the 15-item symptom diary was consistent with FDA guidance and the definition of sustained resolution/improvement excluded those patients who had symptom relapse through day 29. Another strength of this trial is the double-blinding, which prevents any researcher or participant bias, particularly with PRO measures that rely on participants' own reporting of their symptoms.

An important limitation is that some of the analyses were not predefined in the protocol and were performed post hoc. In many analyses, the HR point estimates favored molnupiravir versus placebo, although the 95% CI often included 1. However, the study was not powered to demonstrate a difference for these symptom-based endpoint analyses. Furthermore, symptom data were collected only through day 29; therefore, due to the short-term nature of the evaluation, any potential assessment of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 was not in the scope of this trial. Another limitation is that participants in MOVe-OUT were not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2; therefore, any potential effects of vaccination on the results obtained in this trial could not be assessed. Finally, symptom diary development was based on existing evidence at the time of trial initiation and the content was not directly confirmed with patient feedback. This was challenging at the time of trial initiation because COVID-19 was a novel disease being studied during an unprecedented global pandemic; however, confirmation of content validity of the symptom diary through patient feedback is ongoing.

### Molnupiravir for treating COVID-19 [^21366fab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Five years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, morbidity and mortality have subsided. Vaccines have contributed to reducing the risk of infection and severe disease. However, new COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, and the role of oral antivirals such as molnupiravir in preventing progression of disease or hospitalisation must be assessed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms.

Search Methods

We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We considered full-text articles, preprints, abstracts, trial registry records, and reports of ongoing trials. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but cross-over trials were ineligible. Participants had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without risk factors for severe disease. The intervention was molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days, and control was no treatment, placebo, or standard of care, as defined by the study authors. We excluded studies comparing molnupiravir with treatment strategies that included molnupiravir.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality and hospitalisation. Our important outcomes were change in clinical status, viral clearance, quality of life, adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis where two or more studies with reasonably similar clinical and methodological characteristics reported the same outcome. We used data from intention-to-treat analysis where available. We analysed all outcomes at the participant level using the generic inverse variance method, applying a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

This review included 11 studies (31,272 participants). Eight studies recruited outpatients and three recruited inpatients. We did not meta-analyse inpatient studies, as characteristics varied widely. All outpatient studies included participants with mild to moderate COVID-19, with a mean age ranging from 35 years to 57 years and variable prevalences of comorbidities and COVID-19 vaccination. We excluded suboptimal molnupiravir dosing arms in four outpatient studies and one inpatient study.

Synthesis Of Results

Outpatients Molnupiravir compared to placebo or usual care probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.65; 7 RCTs, 29,238 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute reduction in mortality is nine fewer deaths per 10,000 people treated (95% CI 10 fewer to four fewer per 10,000), which we consider clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.12; 6 RCTs, 29,228 participants; low-certainty evidence), symptom resolution by day 14 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.71; 3 RCTs, 22,400 participants; low-certainty evidence), and symptom resolution by day 28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, 24,728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four studies reported viral clearance by day 5, which was higher in people receiving molnupiravir compared with those receiving placebo or usual care (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.15 to 5.36; 3067 participants). The effect size decreased by day 10 (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.34; 2 RCTs, 2438 participants) and indicated little to no difference between molnupiravir and control by day 14 to 15 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; 4 RCTs, 3062 participants). The results at day 28 to 30 again showed higher virus clearance in the molnupiravir arm (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; 3 RCTs, 397 participants), although there were few participants in this analysis. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 7 RCTs, 4304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Molnupiravir results in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21; 8 RCTs, 30,009 participants; high-certainty evidence). Inpatients The effect of molnupiravir in inpatients is unclear; substantial heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence We assigned high risk of bias judgements to one of seven RCTs for all-cause mortality, one of six RCTs for hospitalisation, two of three RCTs for symptom resolution at 14 days and 28 days, three of seven RCTs for adverse events, and three of eight RCTs for serious adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious indirectness as well as risk of bias, as the populations across trials differed by vaccination status. There was no serious imprecision identified for any outcome. Publication bias is likely high in this review, as we identified 16 unpublished trials. Six were listed as complete, but only one had available data.

Authors' Conclusions

In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.

### Molnupiravir plus usual care versus usual care alone as early treatment for adults with COVID-19 at increased risk of adverse outcomes (PANORAMIC): an open-label, platform-adaptive randomised controlled trial [^3f6550a3]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PANORAMIC was published by Christopher C Butler and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the PANORAMIC study, the trial question was: what is the role of molnupiravir in high-risk vaccinated adults in the community with COVID-19? In the PANORAMIC study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PANORAMIC study, the population was: 25708 patients (15053 female, 10655 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with relevant comorbidities with confirmed COVID-19 for ≤ 5 days in the community. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; lactation; receipt of molnupiravir; allergy to molnupiravir. In the PANORAMIC study, the interventions were: n = 12774 molnupiravir (molnupiravir at a dose of 800 mg BID for 5 days plus usual care) n = 12934 standard care only (management of symptoms with antipyretics; monoclonal antibodies and antivirals for very high-risk patients). In the PANORAMIC study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in hospitalizations or death from all causes at day 28 (1% vs. 1%; OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.41). In the PANORAMIC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in days to first reported recovery (9 days vs. 15 days; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.76) Significant increase in early sustained recovery (32% vs. 23%; OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.72) Significant increase in days to alleviation of all symptoms (4 days vs. 4 days; HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.22). In the PANORAMIC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the PANORAMIC study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with relevant comorbidities with confirmed COVID-19 for ≤ 5 days in the community, molnupiravir was not superior to standard care only with respect to hospitalizations or death from all causes at day 28.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Clinical data supporting this EUA are based on data from 1,433 randomized subjects in the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial (NCT04575597). MOVe-OUT is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial studying LAGEVRIO for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age and older and had one or more pre-defined risk factors for disease progression: over 60 years of age, diabetes, obesity (BMI ≥ 30), chronic kidney disease, serious heart conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or active cancer. The study included symptomatic subjects not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and who had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom onset within 5 days of randomization. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 800 mg of LAGEVRIO or placebo orally twice daily for 5 days.

At baseline, in all randomized subjects, the median age was 43 years (range:18 to 90); 17% of subjects were over 60 years of age and 3% were 75 years of age or older; 49% of subjects were male; 57% were White, 5% Black or African American, 3% Asian, 50% Hispanic or Latino. The majority of subjects were enrolled from sites in Latin America (46%) and Europe (33%); 12% were enrolled in Africa, 6% were enrolled in North America and 3% were enrolled in Asia. Forty-eight percent of subjects received LAGEVRIO or placebo within 3 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common risk factors were obesity (74%), over 60 years of age (17%), and diabetes (16%). Among 792 subjects (55% of total randomized population) with available baseline SARS-CoV-2 variant/clade identification results, 58% were infected with Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages), 20% were infected with Mu (B.1.621), 11% were infected with Gamma (P.1), and the remainder were infected with other variants/clades. Overall, baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms.

### Molnupiravir for oral treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients [^471d6de5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

New treatments are needed to reduce the risk of progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Molnupiravir is an oral, small-molecule antiviral prodrug that is active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with molnupiravir started within 5 days after the onset of signs or symptoms in nonhospitalized, unvaccinated adults with mild-to-moderate, laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness. Participants in the trial were randomly assigned to receive 800 mg of molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence hospitalization or death at day 29; the incidence of adverse events was the primary safety end point. A planned interim analysis was performed when 50% of 1550 participants (target enrollment) had been followed through day 29.

Results

A total of 1433 participants underwent randomization; 716 were assigned to receive molnupiravir and 717 to receive placebo. With the exception of an imbalance in sex, baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The superiority of molnupiravir was demonstrated at the interim analysis; the risk of hospitalization for any cause or death through day 29 was lower with molnupiravir (28 of 385 participants [7.3%]) than with placebo (53 of 377 [14.1%]) (difference, -6.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.3 to -2.4; P = 0.001). In the analysis of all participants who had undergone randomization, the percentage of participants who were hospitalized or died through day 29 was lower in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (6.8% [48 of 709] vs. 9.7% [68 of 699]; difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.9 to -0.1). Results of subgroup analyses were largely consistent with these overall results; in some subgroups, such as patients with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with low baseline viral load, and those with diabetes, the point estimate for the difference favored placebo. One death was reported in the molnupiravir group and 9 were reported in the placebo group through day 29. Adverse events were reported in 216 of 710 participants (30.4%) in the molnupiravir group and 231 of 701 (33.0%) in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Early treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death in at-risk, unvaccinated adults with Covid-19. (Funded by Merck Sharp and Dohme; MOVe-OUT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04575597.).

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1aa6b736]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Post hoc analyses of the 5 distinctive COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated that the following were less common in the molnupiravir group compared with placebo through day 29: progression to moderate and severe symptoms for shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, cough, and new occurrences of loss of smell and loss of taste (Figure 4). Furthermore, the median time to first resolution of symptoms, and first alleviation of symptoms, for the 5 distinctive COVID-19 symptoms was shorter in the molnupiravir group compared with placebo (18 d [95% CI: 17–19] vs 20 d [95% CI: 19–23] and 13 d [95% CI: 12–14] vs 15 d [95% CI: 14–16], respectively) (Figure 5). Finally, in the post hoc analyses similar to those of the PANORAMIC study, we observed reduced median time to alleviation, and sustained alleviation, of all 15 symptoms in the molnupiravir group compared with placebo (8 d [95% CI: 7–9] vs 10 d [95% CI: 9–11] and 15 d [95% CI: 13–16] vs 16 d [95% CI: 15–18], respectively) through day 29 (Figure 6).

### Phase 2 / 3 trial of molnupiravir for treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized adults [^37b8ea38]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Safe and effective oral treatments are needed to improve clinical outcomes for nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19. Molnupiravir is an orally administered, small-molecule ribonucleoside prodrug shown to inhibit replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro and in animal models. METHODS: MOVe-OUT is an ongoing, phase 2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of molnupiravir in nonhospitalized adults. In the phase 2 component, participants had mild or moderate, laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 with sign/symptom onset up to (and including) 7 days before randomization. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to receive 200, 400, or 800mg of molnupiravir or placebo twice daily for 5 days, stratified by time since sign/symptom onset and by being at increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of participants who were hospitalized and/or died through day 29. RESULTS: The phase 2 component randomly assigned 302 participants to treatment; baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Molnupiravir had no apparent dose-related effect on adverse events, and no clinically meaningful abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in relation to dose or treatment. Eleven participants were hospitalized or died through day 29. Of 225 participants in the combined molnupiravir group, 7 (3.1%) were hospitalized or died, compared with 4 of 74 participants (5.4%) in the placebo group. Subgroup analyses suggested lower incidences of hospitalization and/or death in the molnupiravir versus placebo groups in participants older than 60 years of age, those with increased risk for severe illness, those with symptom onset up to (and including) 5 days before randomization, and those with both symptom onset up to (and including) 5 days before randomization and increased risk for severe illness. CONCLUSIONS: These interim study results support further evaluation of molnupiravir as a potential treatment to reduce hospitalizations and/or death in nonhospitalized patients with Covid-19.

### Molnupiravir and risk of hospital admission or death in adults with COVID-19: emulation of a randomized target trial using electronic health records [^ae3865dc]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The number of people reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 globally is increasing. Reinfection is associated with increased risk of mortality and with serious adverse health outcomes in the acute and post-acute phase. Based on current evidence, it is unclear whether molnupiravir continues to show effectiveness in reducing the risk of hospital admission or death during the acute phase of reinfection. Our analyses supplement the evidence base and suggest that molnupiravir might retain similar effectiveness in people with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the MOVe-OUT trial, which included unvaccinated adults at high risk of progression to severe covid-19, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospital admission or death at 29 days (relative risk 0.70, v 0.72 in our study, and absolute risk reduction 3.0%, v 1.1% in our study). In our study the absolute risk reduction was more modest, possibly because of the lower baseline risk in our cohort (event rates were 3.8% in the control arm in our study v 9.7% in MOVe-OUT). A recent pragmatic trial (PANORAMIC) during the BA.1 and BA.2 predominant era that included vaccinated participants at high risk of progression to severe covid-19 found that molnupiravir did not reduce the risk of hospital admission or death (adjusted odds ratio 1.06 (95% bayesian credible interval 0.81 to 1.41)). The difference between our results and those of PANORAMIC could be explained by variations in study setting, recruitment strategy, and definition of the intervention (see supplementary table S5). Because patients at the highest risk of adverse outcomes with covid-19 in the UK were advised to seek medical advice from special regional covid-19 specialist clinics with access to antivirals or monoclonal antibodies, they were not the target population of PANORAMIC. Consequently, PANORAMIC's findings might be less applicable to patients in this highest risk category. In PANORAMIC's control groups, the 28 day event rates were 1% for hospital admission or death and 0.04% for death compared with 30 day event rates in our control group of 3.8% for hospital admission or death and 0.8% for death. The difference in baseline risk between PANORAMIC and our study also supported by the comparison of baseline characteristics where the PANORAMIC trial included a relatively younger (average age 56.7, v 67.3 years in our study) and healthier population (eg, in PANORAMIC 8% had cardiovascular disease and 12% had diabetes v 40.6% and 40.8%, respectively, in our study). In addition, PANORAMIC allowed outpatient treatment of covid-19 in the control group (molnupiravir, monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir or nirmatrelvir) and outpatient treatment of covid-19 other than molnupiravir in the treatment group during usual care, whereas in our emulated trial we estimated the effectiveness of using only molnupiravir as outpatient treatment compared with no treatment. Taken together, the results from MOVe-OUT, PANORAMIC, and our analysis suggest the possibility of graded erosion in effectiveness of molnupiravir as the baseline risk (risk in the control group) of the target population decreases — suggesting that those at the highest risk of progression to severe covid-19 are likely to derive most benefit.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^37632ec1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The MITT population in MOVe-OUT included 1408 participants: 709 received molnupiravir and 699 received placebo. The median age was 43.0 (range: 18–90) years, and more than half of participants (51.3%) were female. The median time from symptom onset to randomization was 4 (range: 1–5) days. The most common risk factors for severe COVID-19 were obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²; 74.0%), aged older than 60 years (17.4%), and diabetes mellitus (15.9%). Of the 5 distinctive symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 at the time of trial conduct, the frequency reported at baseline were cough (81.7%), fatigue (76.1%), loss of smell (45.9%), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (37.0%), and loss of taste (36.1%) (Table 1). Compliance with the symptom diary was high, with completion rates of more than 97% from baseline through day 5 (EOT) and more than 92% from baseline through day 29 (Table 2).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^df5e8025]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — molnupiravir (Recommendation 28) states that in ambulatory adults (≥ 18 years) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests molnupiravir initiated within five days of symptom onset rather than no molnupiravir (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty of evidence). Other options for ambulatory treatment include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir, and patient-specific factors and product availability should drive decision-making; data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting. Patients who will most likely benefit from antivirals are those with risk factors for progression to severe disease, whereas those without risk factors are less likely to benefit. Patients who put a higher value on the putative mutagenesis, adverse events, or reproductive concerns and a lower value on the uncertain benefits would reasonably decline molnupiravir. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression admitted to the hospital for reasons other than COVID-19 may also receive molnupiravir.

### Randomized trial of molnupiravir or placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [^4e5cc693]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Molnupiravir is an oral prodrug of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in animal models. We report data from the phase 2 component of MOVe-IN, a clinical trial evaluating molnupiravir in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2/3 trial in patients 18 years old and older requiring in-hospital treatment for laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 with symptom onset 10 or fewer days before randomization. Participants were randomly assigned to placebo or molnupiravir 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg (1:1:1:1 ratio), twice daily for 5 days. Primary end points were safety and sustained recovery (participant alive and either not hospitalized or medically ready for discharge) through day 29. RESULTS: Of 304 randomly assigned participants, 218 received at least one dose of molnupiravir and 75 of placebo. At baseline, 74.0% had at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19. Adverse events were reported in 121 of 218 (55.5%) molnupiravir-treated and 46 of 75 (61.3%) placebo-treated participants, with no apparent dose effect on adverse event rates and no evidence of hematologic toxicity based on prespecified adverse events. Of 16 confirmed deaths, most were in participants with severe Covid-19 (75.0%), with underlying comorbidities (87.5%), older than 60 years of age (81.3%), and/or symptom duration longer than 5 days (75.0%) at randomization. Median time to sustained recovery was 9 days in all groups, with similar day 29 recovery rates ranging from 81.5% to 85.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial of patients hospitalized with Covid-19, a 5-day course of molnupiravir up to 800 mg twice daily was not associated with dose-limiting side effects or adverse events, but did not demonstrate clinical benefit.

### Real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir as treatments for COVID-19 in patients at high risk [^cdcefb9b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which in most individuals is mild to moderate; however, older people and those with chronic diseases are at higher risk to develop severe disease. Although primary and boosted vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has significantly reduced the risk of severe disease and death, COVID-19 remains a significant problem for highly vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those who are immunocompromised or have chronic diseases. Thus, the availability of oral antiviral agents that are effective against SARS-CoV-2 might further reduce the risk of hospitalization, disease progression, and death, particularly among patients at high risk. Remdesivir, which was the first antiviral agent approved for emergency treatment of COVID-19, has been shown to prevent disease progression in an outpatient setting, as well as in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir are newer drugs that also exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo. However, while remdesivir is an intravenous drug, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir can be administered orally, which is advantageous in an outpatient setting.

In a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial (MOVe-OUT), outpatient use of molnupiravir was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization by 30% as compared with placebo. Similarly, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization and death (relative risk [RR] reduction, 88.9%) for at least 28 days after administration in patients with COVID-19 who were symptomatic, unvaccinated, and nonhospitalized and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir ultimately received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in January 2022 for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients who were at high risk for severe disease but did not require supplemental oxygen. While outpatient administration of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and at high risk for disease progression has resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization and death in real-world studies, critical questions remain.

### Impact of molnupiravir treatment on patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms in the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^b3b210eb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Time to sustained resolution/improvement of symptoms was defined per protocol as the number of days from baseline to the first of 3 consecutive days of reduced severity, without subsequent relapse (ie, ≥ 2 consecutive days without returning to baseline severity, or worse than baseline severity) by day 29. Time to progression was defined per protocol as the number of days from baseline to the first of 2 consecutive days of worsening severity. Additionally, 5 distinctive symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 at the time of trial conduct (ie, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, cough, fatigue, loss of smell, and loss of taste) were evaluated post hoc to investigate the timing of symptom resolution/improvement, or symptom progression, early in the disease course and the proportion of participants reporting "moderate" and "severe" symptom severity over time.

Additional post hoc endpoints, including time to first symptom resolution (ie, the number of days from baseline to the first of 3 consecutive days when symptoms were reported as "none" or "no") and time to first symptom alleviation (ie, the number of days from baseline to the first of 3 consecutive days when symptoms were scored as "moderate" or "severe" at baseline and subsequently as "none" or "mild", or scored as "mild" at baseline and subsequently as "none"), were also assessed for these 5 distinctive symptoms. For loss of smell and loss of taste, alleviation was defined as the first day of 3 consecutive days when symptoms scored as "yes" at baseline were scored as "no". Participants who reported "none" or "no" symptoms at baseline and throughout day 29 were censored at time 0. For participants who reported "none" or "no" symptoms at baseline but who developed symptoms post-baseline, time to first symptom resolution was defined as the number of days from baseline to the first of 3 consecutive days when symptoms were reported as "none" or "no" and time to first symptom alleviation was defined as the number of days from baseline to the first of 3 consecutive days when symptoms were alleviated.

### Comparative effectiveness of sotrovimab and molnupiravir for prevention of severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients in the community: observational cohort study with the openSAFELY platform [^4342a3d2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications and interpretation

The current clinical guideline from NHS Englandhas de-prioritised molnupiravir for routine clinical use in adult patients with symptoms of covid-19 in the community at high risk of severe outcomes from covid-19, based on the results of recent trials. Sotrovimab is recommended as one of the first line treatment options (along with Paxlovid), whereas molnupiravir is considered a third line option (after a second line antiviral, remdesivir), and is only recommended when the other drugs cannot be used because of contraindications or feasibility issues. However, no comparative effectiveness trial has been conducted to support these clinical pathways. Our real world findings during a period when both drugs were frequently prescribed provide supportive evidence for this updated guideline. Assuming that molnupiravir had limited or no effect on covid-19 outcomes, our results imply that sotrovimab substantially reduced the risk of admission to hospital or death from covid-19 compared with eligible patients who did not receive sotrovimab or other drugs in real world settings.

The COMET-ICE and MOVe-OUT trials recruited only patients who were not vaccinated, and uncertainty has been raised about the effects in populations who have received covid-19 vaccinations. This issue is a concern for both sotrovimab (whether active immunity induced by the vaccine influences passive immunisation with neutralising monoclonal antibodies) and molnupiravir (given the preliminary finding of limited efficacy in seropositive patients from the MOVe-OUT trial). Our analysis restricted to patients who had received three or more covid-19 vaccinations supports the conclusion that sotrovimab is beneficial in patients who are fully vaccinated, who now represent most of the covid-19 patient population in many settings.

### Randomized controlled trial of molnupiravir SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody response in at-risk adult outpatients [^1ad6fba3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This first report of a PANORAMIC virology-sub-study has shown that important virology and immunology insights are feasible through minimally invasive participant self-sampling. In the main trial molnupiravir treatment did not demonstrate benefit in reducing hospitalisations or deaths compared to Usual Care. We now show that while 800 mg molnupiravir twice daily for 5 days causes initial significant viral load reductions, treatment is independently associated with increased risk of detectable virus at Day 14 likely resulting from too short a treatment duration. The residual virus in participants receiving molnupiravir is mutated and can be cultured up to 9 days post-cessation of treatment.

Our viral dynamic results conflict with those of the Phase II study, in which mean viral loads were lower and the proportion with < LLOQ viral loads higher in the molnupiravir-treated individuals one month later. However, in the Phase III trial viral load reductions were less marked during treatment, with less than 1 log10 copies/mL difference in treated or untreated by Day 5 and did not persist with post-treatment follow-up. Our baseline viral loads were around 1 log10 higher than previous studiesand since our estimate of viral decline rate, δ, was similar to previous studies, our higher viral loads are a consequence of higher baseline. The causes of this include PANORAMIC participants being older with shorter time since symptom onset than previous studies. The incubation period of the omicron variant is around a day shorter than previous variantswhich may have contributed to higher viral loads. In the treatment of infectious disease, it is rare for an effective therapeutic agent to be stopped before pathogen clearance. A 5-day course is too short to clear the virus and may explain the lack of clinical benefit in the main trial.

Table 1.
Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics in the MITT Population

Table 2.
Summary of Symptom Diary Completion Rate for Any Symptom Through Day 29 (MITT Population, N = 1408)

For most COVID-19 symptoms, sustained resolution/improvement was more likely in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group through day 29 (point estimate of HR > 1; the 95% confidence interval [CI] included 1 for most symptoms) (Figure 1). Among the 5 distinctive symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 at the time of trial conduct, the observed median time to resolution/improvement was shorter for participants in the molnupiravir versus the placebo group for fatigue (tiredness), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, loss of taste, and loss of smell; the 95% CI included 1 for shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and loss of taste (Table 3). Similarly, for most COVID-19 symptoms, progression was less likely in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group through day 29 (point estimate of HR < 1; the 95% CI included 1 for all symptoms) (Figure 2). Among the 5 distinctive COVID-19 symptoms, participants in the molnupiravir group were more likely to achieve sustained resolution/improvement by day 3, day 5 (EOT), and day 10 (Figure 3 A) for all symptoms, except for cough on day 10. Progression of symptoms was also less likely in the molnupiravir group by day 3, day 5 (EOT), and day 10 for all symptoms, except for fatigue on day 3 and day 5 (EOT) (Figure 3 B).

### Randomized controlled trial of molnupiravir SARS-CoV-2 viral and antibody response in at-risk adult outpatients [^7d22f9eb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Modelling studies in SARS-CoV-2, and other acute viral infectionsshowed antivirals are most effective early in disease, and we were able to recruit participants within 2.5 days of symptom onset on average. Finding that male sex and increasing age associate with higher viral load correlates with these groups being most at risk of severe infectionand is in line with a previous study. Lower spike antibody correlating with higher viral loads underlines the evidence for spike antibody being a correlate of protection and control. The slower viral elimination rate post-treatment seen with molnupiravir maybe a result of greater numbers of target cells remaining to support ongoing infection, but lower spike antibody response due to initial viral suppression and/or viral genetic changes may contribute.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titres were significantly lower with molnupiravir by Day 14 (Fig. 3d), even after controlling for other covariates (Fig. 3e). Early rapid reduction in viral load with molnupiravir treatment may have caused a smaller rise in antibody levels due to lower antigenic stimulation (Fig. 3f). Whilst we were unable to culture sufficient virus to undertake antibody neutralisation assays, the magnitude of difference in antibody titre between the arms by Day 14 (2200 U/mL lower in the molnupiravir arm) when antibody response usually peaks, is likely to be clinically significant. With populations becoming increasingly reliant on natural infection to boost immunity, antiviral blunting of antibody response is a concern.

### Health outcomes 3 months and 6 months after molnupiravir treatment for COVID-19 for people at higher risk in the community (PANORAMIC): a randomised controlled trial [^b158cd6e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

No randomised controlled trials have yet reported on the effectiveness of molnupiravir on longer term outcomes for COVID-19. The PANORAMIC trial found molnupiravir reduced time to recovery in acute COVID-19 over 28 days. We aimed to report the effect of molnupiravir treatment for COVID-19 on wellbeing, severe and persistent symptoms, new infections, health care and social service use, medication use, and time off work at 3 months and 6 months post-randomisation.

Methods

This study is a follow-up to the main analysis, which was based on the first 28 days of follow-up and has been previously reported. For this multicentre, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in the UK, participants were eligible if aged at least 50 years, or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and unwell 5 days or less with confirmed COVID-19 in the community. Participants were randomly assigned to the usual care group or molnupiravir group plus usual care (800 mg twice a day for 5 days), which was stratified by age (< 50 years or ≥ 50 years) and vaccination status (at least one dose: yes or no). The primary outcome was hospitalisation or death (or both) at 28 days; all longer term outcomes were considered to be secondary outcomes and included self-reported ratings of wellness (on a scale of 0–10), experiencing any symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle ache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of smell or taste, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, and generally feeling unwell) rated as severe (moderately bad or major problem) or persistent, any health and social care use, health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-5L), time off work or school, new infections, and hospitalisation.

Findings

Between Dec 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022, 25783 participants were randomly assigned to the molnupiravir plus usual care group (n = 12821) or usual care group (n = 12962). Long-term follow-up data were available for 23008 (89·2%) of 25784 participants with 11778 (91·9%) of 12821 participants in the molnupiravir plus usual care group and 11230 (86·6%) of 12963 in the usual care group. 22806 (99·1%) of 23008 had at least one previous dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Any severe (3 months: adjusted risk difference -1·6% [-2·6% to -0·6%]; probability superiority [p(sup)] > 0·99; number needed to treat [NNT] 62·5; 6 months: -1·9% [-2·9% to -0·9%]; p(sup) > 0·99, NNT 52·6) or persistent symptoms (3 months: adjusted risk difference -2·1% [-2·9% to -1·5%]; p(sup) > 0·99; NNT 47·6; 6 months: -2·5% [-3·3% to -1·6%]; p(sup) > 0·99; NNT 40) were reduced in severity, and health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-5L) improved in the molnupiravir plus usual care group at 3 months and 6 months (3 months: adjusted mean difference 1·08 [0·65 to 1·53]; p(sup) > 0·99; 6 months: 1·09 [0·63 to 1·55]; p(sup) > 0·99). Ratings of wellness (3 months: adjusted mean difference 0·15 (0·11 to 0·19); p(sup) > 0·99; 6 months: 0·12 (0·07 to 0·16); p(sup) > 0·99), experiencing any more severe symptom (3 months; adjusted risk difference -1·6% [-2·6% to -0·6%]; p(sup) = 0·99; 6 months: -1·9% [-2·9% to -0·9%]; p(sup) > 0·99), and health-care use (3 months: adjusted risk difference -1·4% [-2·3% to -0·4%]; p(sup) > 0·99; NNT 71·4; 6 months: -0·5% [-1·5% to 0·4%]; p(sup) > 0·99; NNT 200) had high probabilities of superiority with molnupiravir treatment. There were significant differences in persistence of any symptom (910 [8·9%] of 10190 vs 1027 [11%] of 9332, NNT 67) at 6 months, and reported time off work at 3 months (2017 [17·9%] of 11274 vs 2385 [22·4%] of 10628) and 6 months (460 [4·4%] of 10562 vs 527 [5·4%] of 9846; NNT 100). There were no differences in hospitalisations at long-term follow-up.

Interpretation

In a vaccinated population, people treated with molnupiravir for acute COVID-19 felt better, experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 associated symptoms, accessed health care less often, and took less time off work at 6 months. However, the absolute differences in this open-label design are small with high numbers needed to treat.

### Molnupiravir for treatment of adults with mild or moderate COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d6376d83]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of molnupiravir in treating patients with non-severe COVID-19 remain uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in adult patients with mild or moderate COVID-19.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and WHO COVID-19 database up to 27 December 2022.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials with no language restrictions.

Participants

Adults with mild or moderate COVID-19.

Interventions

Molnupiravir against standard care or placebo.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used a revision of RoB-2 criteria.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Outcomes were mortality, hospital admission, viral clearance, time to viral clearance, time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement, any adverse events, and serious adverse events. We performed DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analyses to summarize the evidence and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

Nine randomized controlled trials enrolling 30 472 patients proved eligible. Majority of patients were outpatients, with a mean age ranging from 35 to 56.6 years. In adult patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir probably reduces mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20–0.94; risk difference [RD], 0.1% fewer; moderate certainty) and the risk of hospital admission (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45–0.99; RD, 1.4% fewer; moderate certainty) and may reduce time to viral clearance (mean difference, -1.81 days; 95% CI, -3.31 to -0.31; low certainty) and time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement (mean difference, -2.39 days; 95% CI, -3.71 to -1.07; low certainty). Molnupiravir probably increases the rate of viral clearance (RR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.43–4.96; RD 16.1% more; moderate certainty) at 7 days (± 3 days) and likely does not increase serious adverse events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.61–1.15; RD 0.1% fewer; moderate certainty).

Conclusions

In adult patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir likely reduces mortality and risk of hospital admission probably without increasing serious adverse events.

Clinical outcomes

This study did not preferentially enroll high-risk individuals and was not powered to detect a difference in hospitalization. However, daily symptom diaries were collected to evaluate severity of symptoms, time to resolution of symptoms, and overall health associated with COVID-19. At baseline, a greater proportion of participants administered molnupiravir reported their health as poor or fair (68.3%) compared with those who received placebo (50.0%). The median time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms was not statistically different between participants who received molnupiravir and those who received placebo: 9.0 days [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.0 to 13.0], 5.5 days (95% CI, 4.0 to 8.0), 8 days (95% CI, 6.0 to 12.0), and 8.5 days (95% CI, 7.0 to 11.0) in the 200-, 400-, and 800-mg molnupiravir groups and placebo recipients, respectively. The median time to participant-reported general health of at least "very good" was similar between the pooled molnupiravir groups (14 days; 95% CI, 13 to 21) and the placebo group (15 days; 95% CI, 12.0 to 18.0) (table S8). Overall, 12 (8.6%) participants receiving molnupiravir and 5 (8.1%) participants receiving placebo required a COVID-19–associated medical visit (table S9), which was not a statistically significant difference.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection

Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein–specific immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG at baseline and on days 7 and 28 of the study. The proportions of participants with any antibody to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at baseline varied between the groups, with 15.0, 30.0, 35.3, and 18.2% in the 200-, 400-, and 800-mg molnupiravir and placebo groups, respectively. By day 28, 99.2% of molnupiravir-treated participants had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, compared with 96.5% of those administered placebo.

Molnupiravir — evidence certainty, safety considerations, and timing — the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence for treatment of ambulatory patients was low. The use of molnupiravir presents additional considerations and potential concerns regarding viral mutagenesis in immunocompromised persons and safety in persons of reproductive age, and the FDA required the manufacturers to conduct additional animal studies on the impact of the drug on spermatogenesis and to establish a pregnancy registry if the drug was inadvertently administered during pregnancy. The evidence confirms that using molnupiravir early in the disease process when viral loads are high confers maximum benefit, and it is critical to make a rapid diagnosis and treat ambulatory patients with COVID-19 early in the disease course. More recent studies in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 have shown lower rates of progression to hospitalizations or death; given this observation, the panel discussed about the role of patient centered outcomes other than mortality and hospitalizations and agreed that such outcomes should be evaluated in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, measured using validated instruments, and coupled with measures of disability or quality of life.

Second, the processes by which exchange of information occurred between the study investigators and the DSMB were arguably not suitable for a relatively large-scale international COVID-19 trial during a rapidly evolving pandemic. The study protocol clearly states that the primary efficacy end point is the proportion of participants with either hospitalization (≥ 24 hours of acute care in a hospital or similar acute care facility, including emergency rooms or facilities created to address hospitalization needs during the COVID-19 pandemic) or death by day 29. The recommendation by the DSMB to stop the trial for efficacy (based on the first ∼50% of the data available) came at a time when ∼90% of the full sample had been recruited. The DSMB recommendation to stop early for efficacy and the investigators' adherence to this recommendation places unnecessary pressure on stakeholders to consider the interim data in their interpretation of the efficacy of molnupiravir. The conventional randomized controlled trial setup, during which DSMBs take weeks to convene and review the interim data, is not conducive to COVID-19 because of the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic. The MOVe-OUT trial is only one of many examples of undue reliance on positive interim analysis as investigators have rushed to the media without critical assessment of the potential consequences.

Third, at a key FDA EUA Antiviral Advisory Committee meeting, Merck did not present any exploratory analyses or other rationale for why the interim analysis showed a 50% reduction in hospitalization for molnupiravir, but then the second half of the study showed a trend favoring placebo and no difference in mortality (one event per group). Bias associated with interim analyses has been widely studied. A reversal of the treatment effects after an interim analyses seems unprecedented. In their interim analysis, Merck reported a ∼50% decrease in primary outcome events (28 of 385 versus 53 of 377) but this effect reversed after the interim analysis (20 of 324 in molnupiravir versus 15 of 322 in placebo). If we consider each separately, the likelihood that this occurred by chance alone is statistically unlikely (test of interaction, P < 0.01; Figure 1).

### Antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir versus ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 (PLATCOV): an open-label, phase 2, randomised, controlled, adaptive trial [^153f0873]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Although widely purchased by governments and promoted in the private health sector, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir have not been compared directly or compared with other COVID-19 therapeutics. As a result, current use largely depends on availability, cost, estimates of effect from preregistration studies conducted earlier in the pandemic, and perceptions regarding potential drawbacks (ie, tolerability and viral rebound vs mutant creation).

Clinical outcomes depend on the clinical and immune status of the study population and the virulence of the virus. COVID-19 has become substantially milder, although severe infections still occur, particularly in groups at high risk. The increasing rarity of deterioration requiring hospitalisation and death mean that prohibitively large comparative studies are needed to detect clinically important differences. We therefore aimed to assess the in-vivo antiviral activities of molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir in adults with early symptomatic COVID-19.

Outcomes

Participants completed a 15-item paper symptom diary daily starting from baseline through day 29. The daily symptom diary content was based on a common COVID-19 symptom list from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and refined based on feedback from clinicians and regulatory agencies. The format and wording (instructions, symptom description, and response options) were based on internal PRO development experience using patient-friendly language. The final diary was aligned with the FDA guidance released in September 2020. The symptoms evaluated included cough, sore throat, nasal congestion (stuffy nose), runny nose, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or body aches, fatigue (tiredness), feeling hot or feverish, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptom severity was rated as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe"; loss of smell and loss of taste were rated as "yes" or "no".

On day 1, participants were required to complete the symptom diary prior to the first dose of the trial drug. Completion of the symptom diary was observed at the trial site or in-home visit and documented, including time of participant completion, by trial staff/home healthcare professional(s). Following day 1, participants were requested to complete the symptom diary daily at approximately the same time through day 29, recording and rating each symptom during the prior 24 hours at its worst (ie, none, mild, moderate, or severe) for 13 symptoms and indicating symptom presence (ie, no, yes) for loss of smell and loss of taste. If a participant was unable to record their responses on the symptom diary by themselves, the trial staff would support completion using an interview script. To support compliance with diary completion, the symptom diary was reviewed by trial staff with each participant at each visit, and participants were provided with regular reminders (eg, telephone call, e-mail, text messages) following the EOT visit, every other day through day 29.

### Making statistical sense of the molnupiravir MOVe-OUT clinical trial [^5ff4ad15]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Oral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 may prevent disease progression and health system overcrowding. A new oral therapeutic named molnupiravir has been promoted as providing an approximately 50% reduction in death or the need for hospitalization. The clinical trial evaluating this drug was stopped early at the recommendation of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board after approximately 50% of the sample had been recruited. At the point of discontinuing the trial, approximately 90% of the planned sample had been recruited and had available follow-up data accessible. We discuss issues about the study conduct, analysis, and interpretation, including 1) the authors and sponsors presented the interim analysis as the primary analysis; 2) communication between sponsors and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board was insufficient; 3) the treatment effects reverse when examining only the post-interim analysis population, and are substantially attenuated when examining the full data; 4) the choice of primary analysis is incorrect; 5) analysis of lost-to-follow-up patients favors the study drug; and 6) other known molnupiravir trials were not presented in the primary study findings. As a result of methodological and statistical concerns, it seems that external trials, separate from those supported by the sponsoring company, are required to determine the utility of this drug.

Molnupiravir use limitations and eligibility — Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease admitted to the hospital for reasons other than COVID-19 may also receive molnupiravir. Patients who put a higher value on the putative mutagenesis, adverse events, or reproductive concerns and a lower value on the uncertain benefits would reasonably decline molnupiravir. Molnupiravir is not authorized under the FDA EUA for use in patients < 18 years because it may affect bone and cartilage growth and is not recommended under the FDA EUA for use during pregnancy. Molnupiravir is not authorized under the FDA EUA for pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 because benefit of treatment has not been observed in individuals when treatment is started after hospitalization due to COVID-19. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### A phase 2a clinical trial of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and elimination of infectious virus [^80322bd8]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This phase 2a clinical trial was designed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy and safety of molnupiravir and was not powered to evaluate clinical endpoints, such as symptom duration or hospitalization, nor was enrollment limited to participants with risk factors for severe COVID-19. However, a phase 2/3 study is ongoing to evaluate the effect of molnupiravir on symptom duration and severity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations (identifier: NCT04575597).

An important limitation of our phase 2a trial was the imbalance in the randomization, with a greater proportion of seropositive individuals and a lower viral load at baseline among those randomized to receive 800 mg of molnupiravir compared to placebo. To determine whether these baseline differences affected the differences in viral RNA elimination, infectious virus clearance, and change in viral load from baseline, sensitivity analyses were conducted using participants who were seronegative at baseline or who had infectious virus isolated at baseline. Differences in infectious virus isolation at day 5, time to clearance of viral RNA, and reductions in viral load from baseline to day 5 remained significant when analysis was limited to participants who were antibody negative at baseline. Among participants who were negative for antibodies at baseline, there was no difference in baseline viral load between the 800-mg molnupiravir group and the placebo group.

### Factors influencing COVID-19 risk: insights from molnupiravir exposure-response modeling of clinical outcomes [^c124d039]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Molnupiravir (MOV) is an oral antiviral for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in outpatient settings. This analysis investigated the relationship between β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the phase III part of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MOVe-OUT trial. Logistic regression models of the dependency of outcomes on exposures and covariates were constructed using a multistep process. Influential covariates were identified first using placebo arm data, followed by assessment of exposure-dependency in drug effect using data from both the placebo and MOV arms. The exposure-response (E-R) analysis included 1,313 participants; 630 received MOV and 683 received placebo. Baseline viral load, baseline disease severity, age, weight, viral clade, active cancer, and diabetes were identified as significant determinants of response using placebo data. Absolute measures of viral load on days 5 and 10 were strong on-treatment predictors of hospitalization. An additive area under the curve (AUC)-based maximum effect (E max) model with a fixed Hill coefficient of 1 best represented the exposure-dependency in drug effect and the AUC50 was estimated to be 19,900nMhour. Patients at 800mg achieved near maximal response, which was larger than for 200 or 400mg. The final E-R model was externally validated and predicted that the relative reduction in hospitalization with MOV treatment would vary with patient characteristics and factors in the population. In conclusion, the E-R results support the MOV dose of 800mg twice daily to treat COVID-19. Many patient characteristics and factors impacted outcomes beyond drug exposures.

### A phase 2a clinical trial of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and elimination of infectious virus [^9e3addf2]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, molnupiravir was well tolerated and was associated with antiviral efficacy. This was shown by reduced infectious virus isolation from nasopharyngeal swabs, reduced time to elimination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, an increased proportion of participants who cleared SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and a greater reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from baseline compared with those given placebo, in a cohort of outpatients with COVID-19. Four days after treatment initiation, there was no infectious virus isolated from any participants who received 400 or 800 mg of molnupiravir. The findings from this study support a recent interim analysis of data from a phase 3 clinical trial of molnupiravir in adult outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The interim analysis reported a significant decrease in rates of hospitalization and death from 14.1% among placebo recipients to 7.3% among participants treated with 800 mg of molnupiravir. The combined analysis, including all randomized participants, revealed a continued decrease in hospitalization and death among those treated with molnupiravir (6.8%) compared with those who received placebo (9.7%). There was also an 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99) reduction in the risk of death among participants who received molnupiravir compared with placebo, suggesting that early control of viral replication prevented progression to severe illness and death.

### Molnupiravir and risk of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: cohort study [^8857984a]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Among people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least one risk factor for progression to severe covid-19, molnupiravir use during the first five days of infection was associated with reduced risk of PASC, regardless of an individual's vaccination status and history of infection. These findings suggest that treatment with molnupiravir in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a viable strategy to reduce the risk of post-acute adverse health outcomes.

Figure 2.
Relative risk random effects meta-analysis of country-specific aggregate data.

Fifth, the study protocol had prespecified that a lost-to-follow-up patient should be considered a primary event. This is an inappropriate assumption. The correct approach to assessing loss to follow-up is to use this assumption as a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the effects change in a meaningful way, the robustness of the data. Loss to follow-up occurred in one patient in the control group. In this case, the assumption of an event changed the interpretation importantly. If, instead, we assume no event, the current relative risk using the basic data would become nonsignificant (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49–1.00).

Sixth, and last, there have been at least three other molnupiravir trials that have been completed in similar populations but not published in peer-reviewed journals. The MOVe-IN trial, evaluating molnupiravir in hospitalized patients, showed no clinical benefits and was stopped by the trial ethics committee after slightly higher death rates were seen in the molnupiravir arm. Two other randomized trials of molnupiravir conducted by Indian pharmaceutical companies, Aurobindo and MSN Laboratories, enrolled more than 2,000 patients with moderate COVID-19 but showed no significant clinical benefits, according to the Indian regulatory authorities, and were discontinued. In these two trials, the definition of moderate COVID-19 included the criterion of blood oxygen levels between 90% and 93%, whereas the definition in the MOVe-OUT trial was "no lower than 93%". A press release in July 2021 presented results from a positive interim analysis of another Indian trial of molnupiravir conducted by the Indian pharmaceutical company Hetero, with which Merck had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement. This analysis included 741 patients with mild COVID-19 from the total sample size of 1,218. This trial started recruitment on 25th May 2021, according to the Indian clinical trials registry, with results announced on July 9th, 2021. It is unclear how this trial could have recruited 741 patients, completed follow up, collected and analysed all the data within less than 7 weeks. This would be unprecedented for any randomised trial for COVID-19. In the media release, there was a statement that all adverse events were mild in severity, and none led to drug discontinuation. From a sample size of 741 patients, this seems very unlikely. By contrast, in the MOVe-OUT trial, 116 of 1,411 patients had at least one serious adverse event, and 30 of 1,411 patients discontinued randomized treatment because of adverse events. It is not clear why there should be no patients with these safety outcomes in one trial of molnupiravir and then an important number with the same outcomes in another trial. In the media release, there were 7/370 hospitalistions on molnupiravir (1.7%) versus 23/371 (6.2%) on control (P = 0.0027). In February 2022, results from all 1,218 patients were presented at a medical conference. As with the MOVe-OUT trial, there was no evidence of clinical benefit in the 477 additional patients recruited: 2/238 were hospitalized on molnupiravir, versus 3/239 in the control arm. Also, as with the MOVe-OUT trial, the hospitalization rate in the control arm fell significantly, from 23/371 (6.2%) in the first analysis to 3/239 (1.3%) for the patients randomized later. There is no explanation for this fall in hospitalization rate. There is no mention of these large, randomized trials in the publication of the MOVe-OUT trial. There was also no discussion of these clinical trials at the FDA EUA meeting. If all of these clinical trials were included in a meta-analysis, the summary effect would likely be nonsignificant, with wide CIs. The likelihood of this observation is suggested further by the fact that the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR)–COVID-19 National Task Force recently (January 12, 2022) issued a second warning against molnupiravir based on review of data from the three outpatient trials mentioned earlier, stating that "harms far outweigh claimed benefits", specifically among those at high risk of disease or older than 60 years. Other countries and organizations are currently (January 18, 2022) holding back, with France recently canceling their order molnupiravir, the United Kingdom only offering molnupiravir via the current Platform Adaptive Trial of Novel Antivirals for Early Treatment of COVID-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC) study, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency having not formally approved molnupiravir but only issued advice for countries considering its use, and the WHO having approved another drug (GSK's sotrovimab) for mild infection based on clinical trial evidence generated around the same time as MOVe-OUT.

### Favipiravir for treatment of outpatients with asymptomatic or uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^a60c6e2c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In contrast to our findings, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of molnupiravir reported an approximate 30% reduction in mortality and COVID-19–related hospitalizations. The overall hospitalization rates were higher than in our favipiravir study, possibly due to differences in standards of care and the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 (Delta variant) during the molnupiravir study. Of note, in vitro data suggest that molnupiravir may also be mutagenic to mammalian cells. Animal studies suggest that favipiravir administered in combination with molnupiravir may be an effective strategy to allow for lower molnupiravir doses and potentially avoid unintended consequences.

Our study has several limitations. Most therapeutic studies for COVID-19, like ours, assess antiviral efficacy by using RT-PCR to detect viral RNA from nasal, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal swabs. However, detectable RNA may not reflect actively replicating virus and individuals can continue to have detectable RNA intermittently and long after illness recovery. Widespread use of cell culture to detect replication-competent virus and to establish viral clearance is limited by feasibility, cost, and safety considerations. Although we use Ct rather than viral load, our analysis was strengthened by serial testing from individuals. Our primary endpoint was based upon participant-collected nasal swabs, which may be less accurate than nasopharyngeal swabs. However, we found similar results from a secondary analysis of study staff–collected oropharyngeal swabs. Our study was powered to detect differences in shedding cessation, not symptom resolution. Although not designed to detect a difference in "long COVID", we found that nearly half of both groups continued to report symptoms 28 days after enrollment. In addition, we did not limit enrollment to those with very recent symptom onset; this may have impaired our ability to detect a difference in outcomes. Finally, we did not include severely immunocompromised patients in this trial, and we enrolled patients prior to the emergence and dominance of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants in the United States.

In conclusion, our data do not support favipiravir use at currently recommended doses in outpatients with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Dose optimization studies are necessary to elucidate if favipiravir administered at higher doses or delivered in combination with other agents is effective and safe for patients with COVID-19.

### Safety and efficacy of molnupiravir in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients: a real-life experience [^f05f3588]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Early treatment with molnupiravir was demonstrated to reduce significantly the risk of disease progression (odds ratio: 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.02–0.47; p = 0.004) in contrast with the MOVE‐OUT trial, where only people who started treatment after 4–5 days since the onset of the symptoms had better outcomes when compared with placebo. In our population, the effect of early treatment was evident also in complicated patients such as people who get the infection during hospitalization. Among them, four people did not receive early treatment, and two of them had a disease progression; on the contrary, among the 39 people who received early treatment, only 7 had a disease progression (50% vs. 17.9%).

Our data support an early treatment start, especially in patients with a higher comorbidity burden and older age, underrepresented in the MOVE‐OUT trial.

The majority of people who had a disease progression have been infected in the months of January (p = 0.011); the possible explanation is that in Italy in January there was still a significant percentage of the SARS‐CoV‐2 variant B.1.617.2 (delta), which has a higher fatality compared to the variant B.1.1.529 (Omicron).

In our study, people without SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination or a complete vaccination cycle (more than 120 days since the last dose) showed the same risk of disease progression. Our data support the efficacy of molnupiravir also in older people without SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination.

Regarding safety, in our study, the percentage of adverse events was lower in respect of the MOVE‐OUT trial (6.8% vs. 8.0%), while the percentage of discontinuation was similar (0.76% vs. 0.6%), thus confirming the high tolerability and safety of monlupiravir in clinical practice.

Our study has some limitations that should be addressed. First, this is an observational, retrospective study. Second, our experience is monocentric, and this could not entirely reflect the international situation. Finally, CT scans and blood tests were performed only in a part of the patients treated with molnupiravir.

### A phase 2a clinical trial of molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19 shows accelerated SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and elimination of infectious virus [^1325fcd7]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There is an urgent need for an effective, oral, direct-acting therapeutic to block transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of the nucleoside analog molnupiravir in 202 unvaccinated participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptom duration < 7 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive molnupiravir (200 mg) or placebo and then 3:1 to receive molnupiravir (400 or 800 mg) or placebo, orally twice daily for 5 days. Antiviral activity was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs. Infectious virus was assessed by inoculation of cultured Vero cells with samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and was detected by RT-PCR. Time to viral RNA clearance (primary endpoint) was decreased in the 800-mg molnupiravir group (median 14 days) compared to the placebo group (median 15 days) (log rank P value = 0.013). Of participants receiving 800 mg of molnupiravir, 92.5% achieved viral RNA clearance compared with 80.3% of placebo recipients by study end (4 weeks). Infectious virus (secondary endpoint) was detected in swabs from 1.9% of the 800-mg molnupiravir group compared with 16.7% of the placebo group at day 3 of treatment (P = 0.016). At day 5 of treatment, infectious virus was not isolated from any participants receiving 400 or 800 mg of molnupiravir compared with 11.1% of placebo recipients (P = 0.034 and 0.027, respectively). Molnupiravir was well tolerated across all doses.

The way forward

While some people with COVID-19 are still hospitalized, many now recover at home, especially those who have been vaccinated. However, COVID-19 symptoms still affect patients' lives. Treatments that lessen symptom severity and duration of illness are likely to reduce more severe outcomes. as those with less severe and shorter illness are almost certainly less likely to suffer severe outcomes, even if this may not be measurable given the small magnitude of effect. Since symptom severity and duration are themselves important for patients, clinical trials for early COVID-19 should use symptom severity and duration of illness as endpoints. Given that viral burden varies over the course of infection and that progression to severe illness may be more common in the later stages of infection, chosen endpoints should also account for timing of assessment. The measurement of this endpoint should be agreed upon and used uniformly across trials. Such standardized measures should aim to have high relevance for patients, clinicians, policymakers, regulators, and society.

As the pandemic evolves, it will become increasingly important for treatments to be evaluated in heterogenous populations (e.g. across vaccination status, age, co-morbidities, locations). Recovery outcomes may be more important for these populations, and the importance of a specific outcome may depend on the group to which patients belong. For example, high-risk, unvaccinated people may want treatments that prevent hospitalization, while low-risk, vaccinated people may want less severe disease. Some treatments may be safe and low cost, and thus cost effective in treating symptoms. High-cost treatments with more side effects and interactions are likely to have a different primary purpose, to prevent disease progression and keep people out of hospital. For example, paxlovid is boosted with ritonavir, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor resulting in increased distribution of paxlovid, but also any other drugs metabolized by this cytochrome. These interactions should be carefully considered when developing a treatment strategy. However, if a safe and low-cost method of reducing symptoms is denied approval because of a lack of evidence it prevents hospitalization, we risk denying many patients the benefit they want. By understanding the diverse needs of different groups of stakeholders, outpatient trials can achieve both relevance and scientific reliability across the multiple patient risk groups they will enroll.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

Why is molnupiravir considered for treatment — mechanism, early safety, and EUA context are summarized as follows: "Molnupiravir is an oral antiviral that targets the genetic machinery that is responsible for SARS COV-2 replication". It is "an oral pro-drug that is converted to β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, which acts as a substrate for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", and "after it is incorporated into the viral RNA, serial mutations develop, resulting in a virus that is less fit for ongoing viral replication". Early evaluation notes that "One phase I RCT evaluated the safety and tolerability of molnupiravir in healthy adults without COVID-19 [235]" and "The study reported molnupiravir to be well tolerated, with no increased reports of serious adverse events among persons in the molnupiravir arm compared to those receiving placebo". The regulatory summary states that "The FDA granted EUA to molnupiravir on December 23, 2021, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults (≥ 18 years) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death".

### Availability of oral antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the requirement for an ethical prescribing approach [^9b1aab49]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The first two oral antivirals, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, are now becoming available in many countries. These medicines will be indicated to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. These antivirals should be prescribed within 5 days of symptom onset, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been confirmed. However, the availability of these antivirals will be scarce for some time due to manufacturing constraints. Each country should establish a policy on the conditions under which these antivirals can be prescribed. Such a policy should be based on the fulfilment of five ethical elements: transparency, relevance, appeals, enforcement, and fairness. Following the principles of distributive justice, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should be prescribed according to a hierarchy of predicted efficacy, ideally on the basis of an evidence-based scoring system. The placebo-controlled randomised trials that supported the temporary authorisation of these two antivirals were conducted in unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, so an evidence-based prescription practice would only use these drugs for unvaccinated patients until further data become available. However, in the countries that authorised these antivirals in 2021 (the UK and the USA), both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients meeting particular requirements have access to these antivirals. Due to the complexity of prioritisation, national health authorities should start issuing their draft policies as soon as possible and these policies should be regularly updated. The effectiveness of these antivirals against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 must be urgently assessed. Once implemented, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir must show their effectiveness and safety in the real world, and health systems must be adequately adapted for the correct use of these antivirals.

Fourth, at the FDA EUA advisory meeting, Merck presented their interim data across 10 countries, with no explanation for wide differences in outcomes among these countries. Point estimates of absolute risk differences (the primary analysis) varied from –19.6% for patients enrolled in Brazil to +9.1% for patients enrolled in Guatemala, with mutually exclusive CIs. When analyzing binary data, it is always recommended that both relative and absolute differences be presented, as both have serious limitations but complement each other well. Observed placebo risk also varied substantially across countries in the MOVe-OUT trial. When analyzing the full data, a relative effect measure such as a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio would be stable, whereas absolute risk differences do not generalize across countries. Relative effects are stable across varying control group risks. As evidence of the latter, a pooled 7% absolute risk reduction is meaningless for settings with less than 7% of events in the placebo group. A meta-analysis of the interim trial data using a random effects RR model that incorporates the heterogeneity of country effects, for example, finds a nonsignificant RR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46–1.00; see Figure 2). Merck's own analysis using a hazard ratio also finds a nonsignificant effect (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48–1.01).

Discussion

There was a greater reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality when comparing nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to molnupiravir in both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients. When neither drug is contraindicated, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be considered as a more effective option.

Our study findings differ from a previous study conducted on the US Veterans population, which found no observable difference between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir treatments. The discrepancy in hospitalisation risk between the two studies may be attributed to various factors, including differences in health seeking behaviours and hospitalisation criteria between Hong Kong and the US. However, the point estimator of risk of mortality may be similar between their (risk ratio: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.09–2.73) and our study (hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.33–0.56). Compared to their study, our study had a higher sample size and number of events, providing sufficient statistical power to detect differences. Indeed, our conclusion is also supported by indirect evidence from the EPIC-HR and MOVe-OUT trials. Further, a UK-based Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of Covid-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC) trial in the United Kingdom even found no reduction of hospitalisations or mortality among molnupiravir group compared to control group among high-risk vaccinated non-hospitalised patients. Two US-based observational studies reported a reduction in hospitalisation and mortality among nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users compared to non-users in populations with high COVID-19 vaccine uptake (HR of hospitalisation or mortality: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.02–0.50; Odd ratio (OR) of hospitalisation: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.33–0.62; OR of mortality: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03–0.50). Another US-based observational study demonstrated that molnupiravir was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions or mortality (relative risk 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64–0.79). In the inpatient setting, two Hong Kong-based studies showed reductions in hospitalisation and mortality among nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir users compared to non-users (HR in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66–0.90; HR in molnupiravir: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81–0.93; HR in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.23–0.50; HR in molnupiravir: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.40–0.59). Notably, the molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of COVID-19 in an outpatient setting (MOVe-In) showed no reduction in mortality among the majority of patients with severe illness who required oxygen therapy or remdesivir. These results from indirect comparison indicated that the risk of hospitalisation and mortality among nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir users was lower compared to non-users, and the magnitude of risk reduction was reported to be lower among nirmatrelvir-ritonavir users than molnupiravir users relative to non-users. On the top of current evidence, our findings provided a direct comparison between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in both non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients and highlighted a greater clinical benefit in nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative pharmacodynamic assessment of COVID-19 antiviral treatments in patients. The study shows that both molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir accelerate viral clearance in early COVID-19. This supports the results of previous clinical trials and studies with sparse viral sampling. The antiviral effect of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir was substantially greater than that of molnupiravir. This corresponds approximately with the differences in clinical benefits reported in earlier randomised and observational studies. –, It suggests that inhibiting the main viral protease provides the most potent inhibition of viral replication in patients with COVID-19. Other main protease inhibitors, which do not require pharmacokinetic boosting by ritonavir, are in pharmaceutical development. The meta-analysis of this platform trial indicated that the molnupiravir effect was very similar to parenteral remdesivir, although this comparison is less robust as the two drugs were not compared contemporaneously.

The main indication for oral antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19 is prevention of disease progression. As with other potentially serious infections, the earlier in the course of disease that effective antiviral drugs are given, the greater the clinical benefit. Several different antiviral medicines have proved effective in patients with COVID-19, but there have been no direct comparisons between them. It has become increasingly difficult to conduct the large clinical trials with clinical endpoints in patients with COVID-19 that have been used to inform treatment policies. The low rates of hospitalisation and death, and the imprecision of clinical and laboratory measures of recovery, have resulted in the failure of large outpatientbased studies to reach their prespecified endpoints. Acceleration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance correlates with prevention of hospitalisation and death, and provides an efficient pharmacodynamic measure of comparative antiviral efficacy. Compared with trials with clinical endpoints, the pharmacometrics approach used here requires two orders of magnitude fewer enrolled patients to provide comparative assessments, and it delivers results rapidly in real time.

mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. However, given the modest benefit and the inconsistencies between the first and second half of trial MK-4482-002, MOV is only authorized for use for adults for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options. those with impaired immune systems or who are extremely clinically vulnerable) were eligible to receive monoclonal antibodies, intravenous antivirals, and oral antivirals as "usual care.

As an example, Table 1 shows an analysis conducted by Merck of nucleotide changes detected in SARS-CoV-2 sequences from subjects in the Phase 3 outpatient trial, MK-4482-002 Part 2. Consistent.

SARS-CoV-2 from MOV-treated patients have not been conducted to assess and quantify the risk of transmission of MOV-mutagenized viruses to others. However, studies conducted in a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed early MOV treatment was associated with reduced virus shedding and impairment of virus. attributable to the enrollment of a less high-risk population, as evidenced by a hospitalization/death rate of < 2% in both the molnupiravir arm and the usual care arm.  MOV was associated with a modest decrease in hospitalization and death in the Phase 3 trial, MK-4482-002. This "modest efficacy" is accounted for in the. criteria for issuing an EUA include a requirement that it be reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in treating a serious or life-threatening disease. We continue to believe that molnupiravir meets this requirement.

Further, it is the review team's current position that the risk-benefit assessment of MOV as a second-line therapy remains acceptable. We will continue evaluating data, including new real world data and any clinical trial data as they become available, noting the many limitations of real world data. Reference ID: 5128714.

### A viroimmunologic model to characterize the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2: implication for treatment duration [^a20a6bad]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The antiviral efficacy of molnupiravir against SARS-CoV-2 is controversial. Here, we develop a model integrating viral and immune dynamics to characterize the mechanism of action of molnupiravir in vivo and its impact on viral dynamics, during and after treatment.

Methods

We analysed data from the PANORAMIC trial, where 577 outpatients were randomised shortly after symptom onset to receive usual care or molnupiravir for 5 days, and where viral and immunological data were collected for two weeks. We developed a mathematical model that characterized virus/host interaction and accounted for the impact of molnupiravir on viral replication and mutagenesis. The model was used to explore the impact of longer treatment duration.

Results

Molnupiravir reduced RNA replication with an efficacy that reached 93% at the end of a five-day treatment. This effect was mediated through two different pathways, one that increased transition mutation frequency, and other that directly inhibited viral production. Accordingly five-day treatment shortened the median time to clearance of both RNA and infectious virus by approximately 2 days. Treatment duration of 10 days could reduce the time to RNA clearance by 5 days and reduce the occurrence of viral rebounds. Longer treatment durations might be needed in case of post-exposure prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Our model suggests that molnupiravir acts primarily on viral replication, and does not act specifically on viral infectivity. Longer administration of molnupiravir may reduce rebound rate and shorten time to viral clearance.

Antivirals are the cornerstone of therapy since their activity is not influenced by VOCs, and randomized trials demonstrated that, when administered within 5 or 7 days from symptom onset, they were effective in reducing the rate of hospitalization or death in unvaccinated outpatients with mild/moderate COVID-19 who had risk factors for severe COVID-19. Although few HM patients were included, this population is expected to gain maximum benefit from anti-viral treatment, as demonstrated in observational studies.

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or intravenous remdesivir are the first choices based on efficacy data. Drug-drug interactions limit the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, but the careful reduction of immunosuppression or targeted therapy agents can allow its use in most HM patients. Molnupiravir use is limited by the lower efficacy in the randomized trial (relative risk reduction of 30%, compared to 87% of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir), the lack of European Medicine Agency (but not FDA) authorization and, therefore, the unavailability in some countries. The advantages of molnupiravir include absence of drug-drug interactions and the possibility to use in case of renal failure (ClCr < 30 ml/min).

The data available for high titer of convalescent plasma (CVP) does not support its role in the routine treatment of mild/moderate COVID-19. Considering the polyclonal protection given by CVP, less influenced by protein-S mutations which led to the loss of activity of MoAbs, CVP might be useful in immunocompromised patients, in addition to antivirals.

In severe or critical COVID-19 in HM, remdesivir treatment is recommended together with steroid treatment and a second immunosuppressant (mainly an anti-IL-6 agent), if required. In the HM patients, when choosing the second immunomodulator, the recent hematological treatment should be also considered, especially if patients are already on ruxolitinib, which should not be discontinued in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No data suggest the need for different treatment in HM children compared to HM adults, although children have a much lower risk of severe COVID-19 and the data are more limited. The reason for providing early treatment to children could be hastening the cure from SARS-CoV-2 infection to allow continuing HM treatment program.

### The importance of appropriate selection of clinical endpoints in outpatient COVID-19 clinical trials [^511f7dcf]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outpatient trials to evaluate COVID-19 therapies

Previous trials evaluating inhaled budesonide, oral fluvoxamine, and the oral antiviral agents molnupiravir (Lagevrio™), as well as nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir (Paxlovid™) illustrate the challenges associated with identifying appropriate endpoints, as each trial measured different outcomes that had little consistency in terms of measurement –. These outpatient clinical trials used outcomes such as change in naso- or oropharyngeal viral load densities, change in symptom severity, time to clinical improvement, emergency setting visits, hospitalization, and mortality, sometimes combining these outcomes into composite outcomes. These outcomes vary substantially in their complexity and degree of subjectivity. For example, if correctly performed, a body temperature or SpO2 reading should be highly reproducible, while the measurement of how a patient feels and functions is more challenging. Similarly, an SpO2 measured in the home by a participant may not be as reproducible as one obtained in a healthcare setting. These differences prevent timely comparative evaluation of agents for patients with COVID-19 in the outpatient population.

6.1 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies

The following adverse reactions have been observed in the clinical study of LAGEVRIO that supported the EUA. The adverse reaction rates observed in these clinical trials cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Additional adverse events associated with LAGEVRIO may become apparent with more widespread use.

Overall, more than 900 subjects have been exposed to LAGEVRIO 800 mg twice daily in clinical trials. The safety assessment of LAGEVRIO is primarily based on an analysis from subjects followed through Day 29 in the Phase 3 study in non-hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 (MOVe-OUT) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

The safety of LAGEVRIO was evaluated based on an analysis of a Phase 3 double-blind trial (MOVe-OUT) in which 1,411 non-hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 were randomized and treated with LAGEVRIO (N = 710) or placebo (N = 701) for up to 5 days. Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study intervention or within 14 days of study intervention completion/discontinuation.

Discontinuation of study intervention due to an adverse event occurred in 1% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 3% of subjects receiving placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (< 1%) subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.

The most common adverse reactions in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in MOVe-OUT are presented in Table 1, all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).

Laboratory Abnormalities

Selected Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities in chemistry (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, and lipase) and hematology (hemoglobin, platelets, and leukocytes) parameters all occurred at a rate of less than or equal to 2% and occurred at a similar rate across arms in MOVe-OUT.

### Safety and efficacy of inhaled interferon-β 1a (SNG001) in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19: a randomized, controlled, phase II trial [^eb119948]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We observed a significant increase in the median fold change of inflammatory markers, CRP, LDH and fibrinogen, all of which are acute phase reactants, during treatment with SNG001 compared with those receiving placebo. The increase in these markers of inflammation and coagulation are consistent with the pro-inflammatory mechanism of action of interferon and could potentially explain the lack of benefit in time to symptom improvement between groups. The increases in CRP, LDH, and fibrinogen were transient however, and returned to similar levels as placebo by day 28.

While the strengths of this study include a randomized, placebo-controlled design with standardized virology and symptom assessment, there are limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. Foremost, the phase 2 studies within the ACTIV-2 platform are powered on the primary virologic outcome and not designed to detect a difference in hospitalizations. Additionally, most participants enrolled did not meet the protocol definition of higher risk for severe COVID-19 further limiting the ability to detect a difference in this outcome. In addition, 80% of participants enrolled were unvaccinated limiting the evaluation of efficacy in a vaccinated population. While, this trial enrolled participants a mean 4.7 days from symptom onset — earlier than participants in other IFN trials including Solidarity and ACTT 3, this is later than trials evaluating other investigational outpatient therapeutics that demonstrated an antiviral effect, including nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, remdesivir, and peginterferon Lambda.

Access to diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics has been a significant challenge throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. SNG001 is a self-administered, nebulized, inhaled, therapeutic that can be delivered at home. However, the requirements for electricity to power the nebulizing device and training are potential barriers to treatment. Although a 14-day course was used in this and prior studies of SNG001, the optimal duration of therapy is not known. Importantly, all hospitalizations occurred by 8 days from enrollment potentially suggesting that a shorter duration of treatment could be possible.

In conclusion, orally inhaled nebulized SNG001 was safe and well tolerated but did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the nasopharynx, nor decrease time to improvement of COVID-19 symptoms in outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. A signal of fewer hospitalizations with SNG001 compared to placebo warrants further investigation as a therapeutic to prevent progression to severe COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for acute COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular disease and postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^fe2bdf42]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Advances in vaccination, therapies, and the impact of widespread immunity acquired from prior infection have markedly lowered the case-fatality rate of COVID-19. Additionally, the availability of effective outpatient therapeutics, including nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (NMV-r), molnupiravir, remdesivir, and various monoclonal antibodies, are significant advances. While the efficacy of these treatments in lowering the risk of acute COVID-19 has been well-established, the published data in peer-reviewed literature regarding their effectiveness in reducing the frequency of PASC are limited, barring a recent Department of Veterans Affairs study meta-analysis showing an association of early treatment of COVID-19 and decreased risk of PASC.

NMV-r is a favored treatment for outpatient management of COVID-19 based on the results of a pivotal placebo-controlled trial in high-risk unvaccinated patients with mild-moderate disease. In this study, NMV-r resulted in an 89% reduction in risk of hospitalization or all-cause mortality compared to the placebo, leading to the emergency use authorization of the drug. Subsequently, in several observational studies, NMV-r treatment was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in broader patient groups, including relatively young (18–50 years of age) high-risk vaccinated patients with COVID-19 such as those with CVD.

Given the frequency and consequences of PASC in patients with high-risk factors, it is crucial to determine whether antiviral therapy is effective in preventing PASC. Accumulating evidence suggests that viral particles persist throughout the human body after the resolution of the acute infection. This has been thought to be one of the potential mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of PASC. Intuitively, treatment with NMV-r could potentially reduce the incidence of PASC by facilitating viral clearance. While ideally, these data would come from prospective randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials; such studies have not yet reported these outcomes with sufficient follow-up to answer this question. To address this data gap, we utilized the electronic health records (EHR)-based, curated real-world data of the TriNetX research network to describe the frequency of PASC-associated symptoms among those treated vs not treated with NMV-r.

### Clinical antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019: an open-label, randomized controlled adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^5b2d34f2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Remdesivir has been used extensively as a parenteral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in some regions, although therapeutic recommendations have varied widely. The initial clinical trials of remdesivir suggested clinical benefit in reduced duration of hospitalization but did not demonstrate an in vivo antiviral effect. Until early 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended against use of remdesivir in treatment, largely based on lack of mortality reduction in the interim results from the WHO's multinational Solidarity trial, and many countries did not license remdesivir for use. The WHO recommendation against the use of remdesivir has now been reversed, with updated results from the WHO's Solidarity trial indicating a small benefit. It is now appreciated that antiviral medications are more effective early in COVID-19 infections when viral burdens are highest, and they provide less benefit later in the course of illness in hospitalized patients where anti-inflammatory interventions show life-saving benefit. In the majority of cases, hospitalization occurs after approximately 1 week from symptom onset (this was the population studied in the Solidarity trial) — administration of remdesivir early in the course of infection has been shown to prevent progression to severe disease in high-risk outpatients.

Large randomized controlled trials have since demonstrated the clinical efficacy of multiple small molecule drugs in the treatment of early COVID-19, notably molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. These oral medications are simpler to administer compared with intravenous remdesivir. However, drug–drug interactions, other contraindications, and availability of these oral medications mean that remdesivir retains clinical utility in select populations. Until now there has been no standardized method for assessing in vivo antiviral effects. Time to viral clearance is an insensitive measure that is highly dependent on baseline viral loads. The PLATCOV study (Finding treatments for COVID-19: a phase 2 multi-centre adaptive platform trial to assess antiviral pharmacodynamics in early symptomatic COVID-19) is a platform randomized trial aiming to provide a standardized assessment in vivo of candidate antiviral drugs by measuring rates of viral clearance. We report the antiviral activity of remdesivir in adults with early symptomatic COVID-19. The previously published clinical trials on remdesivir were conducted largely in unvaccinated patients infected with the early SARS-CoV-2 viral variants, which were more likely to result in hospitalization and severe outcomes than those prevalent today. This study was conducted in largely vaccinated individuals in a period that spanned the Delta and early Omicron variants.

### Outpatient treatment of confirmed COVID-19: a living, rapid review for the American College of Physicians [^4e06b008]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians and patients want to know the benefits and harms of outpatient treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Purpose

To assess the benefits and harms of 12 different COVID-19 treatments in the outpatient setting.

Data Sources

Epistemonikos COVID-19 L·OVE Platform, searched on 4 April 2022.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts against a priori-defined criteria. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared COVID-19 treatments in adult outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence (COE). A second reviewer verified data abstraction and assessments.

Data Synthesis

The 26 included studies collected data before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduced hospitalizations (1% vs. 6% [1 RCT] and 1% vs. 4% [1 RCT], respectively; moderate COE). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir probably reduced all-cause mortality (0% vs. 1% [1 RCT]; moderate COE), and regdanvimab probably improved recovery (87% vs. 72% [1 RCT]; moderate COE). Casirivimab-imdevimab reduced time to recovery by a median difference of 4 days (10 vs. 14 median days [1 RCT]; high COE). Molnupiravir may reduce all-cause mortality, sotrovimab may reduce hospitalization, and remdesivir may improve recovery (low COE). Lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin may have increased harms, and hydroxychloroquine may result in lower recovery rates (low COE). Other treatments had insufficient evidence or no statistical difference in efficacy and safety versus placebo.

Limitation

Many outcomes had few events and small samples.

Conclusion

Some antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies may improve outcomes for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. However, the generalizability of the findings to the currently dominant Omicron variant is limited.

### Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) [^1f40cd01]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity

NHC, the nucleoside analogue metabolite of molnupiravir, had variable cytotoxicity against different mammalian cell types with CC50values ranging from 7.5 µM (human lymphoid CEM cell line) to > 100 µM, in 3-day exposure assays. Molnupiravir inhibited the proliferation of human bone marrow progenitor cells with CC50values of 24.9 µM and 7.7 µM for erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation, respectively, in 14-day colony formation assays.

Viral RNA Rebound

Post-treatment increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding levels (i.e., viral RNA rebound) in nasopharyngeal samples were observed on Day 10, Day 15, and/or Day 29 in a subset of LAGEVRIO and placebo recipients in the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial. Approximately 1% of both LAGEVRIO and placebo recipients had evidence of recurrent COVID-19 symptoms coinciding with a rebound in viral RNA levels in nasopharyngeal samples.

Post-treatment viral RNA rebound was not associated with the primary clinical outcome of hospitalization or death through Day 29 following the single 5-day course of LAGEVRIO treatment. Post-treatment viral RNA rebound also was not associated with the detection of cell culture infectious virus in nasopharyngeal swab samples.

### Equipoise, standard of care and consent: responding to the authorisation of new COVID-19 treatments in randomised controlled trials [^964095a7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale research and pharmaceutical regulatory processes have proceeded at a dramatically increased pace with new and effective, evidence-based COVID-19 interventions rapidly making their way into the clinic. However, the swift generation of high-quality evidence and the efficient processing of regulatory authorisation have given rise to more specific and complex versions of well-known research ethics issues. In this paper, we identify three such issues by focusing on the authorisation of molnupiravir, a novel antiviral medicine aimed at reducing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to multiply in the body, for clinical use by the National Health Service in England and the concomitant testing of molnupiravir through the large-scale Platform Adaptive trial of Novel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of COVID-19 In the Community randomised control trial. By analysing the ways in which the authorisation and clinical use of molnupiravir complicate standard approaches to clinical equipoise, standard of care and participant consent in the PANORAMIC randomised control trial, we will explain some of ethical implications for clinical trials that aim to study the efficacy and safety of new COVID-19 and other therapeutics when conditional authorisation has already been granted and when such treatments have already been made available to patients by national health providers.

### Analysis of all-cause hospitalization and death among nonhospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir during the omicron wave in Hong Kong [^217f37f6]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study examined the effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir exclusively among patients with COVID-19 and comorbid type 2 diabetes in a contemporary cohort during the Omicron wave in Hong Kong. Both oral antiviral agents were associated with a statistically significant 29% reduction in all-cause mortality and hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes compared with control participants who did not receive either antiviral medication. Furthermore, we observed that both oral antiviral medications reduced the risk of in-patient disease progression. These findings are notable because diabetes is a common indication for antiviral prescribing for COVID-19 management.

The landmark MOVe-OUT trial reported that molnupiravir use was associated with a reduction in hospitalization or mortality among nonhospitalized unvaccinated patients with COVID-19. In the MOVe-OUT trial, 228 participants (15.9%) had diabetes (107 in molnupiravir group and 121 in placebo group). In the diabetes subgroup, the absolute risk difference in the incidence of hospitalization or death was 1.4% (95% CI, −8.2 to 11.1), favoring placebo over molnupiravir among patients with diabetes. It is possible that a small subgroup of patients with diabetes contributed to this result in the subgroup analysis. Apart from the landmark trial, 2 additional studies, of molnupiravir use included a proportion of patients with diabetes. In a retrospective population-based study showing that molnupiravir use was not associated with a reduction in hospitalization in general, 13.1% of the cohort had diabetes. The PANORAMIC study was a randomized clinical trial showing that molnupiravir use among high-risk vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection did not reduce the already-low hospitalizations and deaths, but resulted in faster time to recovery and reduced viral detection and load. In the PANORAMIC trial, 12% of the cohort had diabetes. Subgroup analysis stratified by diabetes status was only performed in the PANORAMIC trial, suggesting no significant interaction by diabetes status (P = 0.12). However, the PANORAMIC cohort was younger (mean age, 56.6 years) and most participants had received 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the population most at risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, our study is the first to specifically evaluate a group of molnupiravir-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, and we observed that molnupiravir use was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization and further benefit in in-hospital disease progression. Furthermore, a beneficial effect was observed across a broad spectrum of patients with type 2 diabetes, stratified by age, sex, vaccination status, and baseline insulin use — factors commonly identified as prognostic factors of COVID-19 outcomes. In considering prescribing of oral antiviral medications, patients with type 2 diabetes often have cardiovascular comorbidities with potential drug-drug interactions between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and essential cardiovascular medications. Our findings suggest that in scenarios in which patients with type 2 diabetes are not eligible to receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, molnupiravir may be a reasonable option.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — viral rebound with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir report that recurrence of symptoms associated with viral rebound has been estimated to occur in treated patients in 0.8% to 6.6% in various trials, with rebound also described with molnupiravir (5.8%) and with no antiviral treatment; observational evidence suggests hospitalization after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment to be infrequent, ranging from 0.11% to 0.44%, and no direct evidence was found on the effect of repeat treatment.

### Ensitrelvir for the treatment of nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19: results from the SCORPIO-HR, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^26c91784]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Ensitrelvir did not significantly shorten the time to sustained resolution of 15 COVID-19–related symptoms compared with placebo among participants who received treatment ≤ 3 days from symptom onset. Ensitrelvir demonstrated potent antiviral efficacy, with greater reduction in mean viral RNA levels and a higher proportion of participants with negative viral cultures on day 4, compared with placebo. Treatment with ensitrelvir was well tolerated, with a similar adverse event profile as placebo and no dysgeusia. Notably, ensitrelvir had a low incidence of viral rebound and no symptomatic viral rebound in either arm.

Several oral antivirals have demonstrated improvements in time to symptom resolution. In an earlier phase of the epidemic and using different symptom resolution definitions, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir shortened the median time to symptom resolution by 2–3 days in HR persons as secondary or post hoc analyses. In a more recent study conducted in 2022, the oral main protease inhibitor simnotrelvir shortened the time to symptom resolution by 36 hours compared with placebo; this benefit appeared to be greater in participants with risk factors for severe COVID-19. Ensitrelvir was associated with a 24-hour reduction in median time to resolution of 5 symptoms, the primary endpoint in a previous trial of mostly SR participants, using Peto-Prentice's generalized Wilcoxon test. Our study also demonstrated an overall trend toward improvement in analyses of time to symptom resolution (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5); however, regardless of the statistical methods used, all differences were less than 24 hours in magnitude.

### Persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity despite anti-viral treatment in immunodeficient patients [^ac95304f]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

From December 2021, the NHS authorised additional COVID-19 treatments for the highest risk non-hospitalised patients. This policy enabled use of another nMab, Sotrovimab, or oral antiviral treatments (Molnupiravir or Paxlovid) to be prescribed to non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in clearly defined high risk groups. Treatment is delivered by hubs known as Covid Medicine Delivery Units (CMDUs) across the country within 5–7 days of symptom onset and with a positive COVID PCR or lateral flow test.

The nMab Sotrovimab targets an epitope of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Data from the COMET-ICE trial demonstrated reduction in hospitalisation and death in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 treated with Sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is active against BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants and therefore was the first line treatment offered when these variants were dominant. After BA.2 became the dominant circulating subvariant, the antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been used as first line treatment via CMDUs unless there are contraindications. Anti-viral treatments Molnupiravir (a ribosomal dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor which drives viral mutagenesis) and nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid; a ritonavir-boosted 3C-protease inhibitor) have been demonstrated to reduce hospitalisation and death in patients with mild to moderate infection in the MOVe-Out and EPIC HR trials respectively.

Despite promising immediate clinical outcomes with the use of Ronapreve, sotrovimab, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, it is currently unclear whether sustained viral clearance is achieved in immunodeficient patients. Although, persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity following infection is recognised in immunocompetent hosts and may be of limited significance, the same cannot be assumed for immunodeficient patients at risk of chronic or relapsing infection. We therefore aimed to establish the long-term virological outcomes in the immunodeficient patients treated at our centre.

### Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^b85f5245]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The study RECOVERY (molnupiravir) was published by RECOVERY Collaborative Group. and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the trial question was: what is the role of molnupiravir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the population was: 923 patients (376 female, 547 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; receipt of molnupiravir during current illness. In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the interventions were: n = 445 molnupiravir (at a dose of 800 mg PO BID for 5 days plus standard of care) n = 478 usual care (standard of care only). In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 28 (17% vs. 17%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28). In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of discharged alive within 28 days (72% vs. 74%; RR 0.96, 96% CI 0.82 to 1.12) No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation or death (17% vs. 17%; RR 0.96, 96% CI 0.73 to 1.25) No significant difference in receipt of ventilation (11% vs. 8%; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9). In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in new cardiac arrhythmia, thrombotic events, clinically significant bleeding, non-coronavirus infections, seizures, acute liver injury, and AKI. significant difference in hyperglycemia requiring insulin (7.4% vs. 3.1%). In the RECOVERY (molnupiravir) study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, molnupiravir was not superior to usual care with respect to death at day 28.

### Drug treatments for COVID-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis [^52ab61a8]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Time to symptom resolution

Seventy nine trials including 26 119 participants met the threshold of analysing treatments with a minimum of 100 patients and were included in the network meta-analysis. Thirty four interventions were studied: the most common interventions were standard care (73 trials, 11 674 participants), Janus kinase inhibitors (4 trials, 1585 participants), molnupiravir (3 trials, 1536 participants), remdesivir (4 trials, 1497 participants), and inhaled corticosteroids (2 trials, 1031 participants). Molnupiravir probably reduces time to symptom resolution (ratio of means 0.66, 0.52 to 0.83; mean difference −3.3 days, −4.8 to −1.6; moderate certainty). No other intervention had at least moderate certainty evidence of benefit or harm (fig 2).

Subgroups and sensitivity analyses

Previous iterations of this living systematic review explored subgroup effects for remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, ivermectin, and interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. An additional network meta-analysis limited to interventions of interest for patients with non-severe disease up to 2 February 2022 showed that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir may reduce mortality (supplementary material). Findings for other outcomes were not meaningfully different from the full network. Among patients with non-severe disease, we did not identify any subgroup effects for molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, fluvoxamine, or remdesivir.

### Favipiravir for treatment of outpatients with asymptomatic or uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^0a935151]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Suboptimal dosing may also explain why we found no evidence of mutagenesis after at least 5 days of favipiravir exposure. Our findings differ from in vitro work demonstrating a 3-fold increase in the number of mutations and a 12-fold increase in C to T or G to A transitions in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposed to favipiravir compared to controls. This is also in contrast to an in vivo study of molnupiravir, a closely related nucleotide analogue, that found a 2-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene mutations in the treatment group compared to the control group. A study that evaluated favipiravir dosing for Ebola infections in macaques found that viral mutational load was strongly associated with favipiravir dose and that viral mutation accumulation was associated with lower levels of plasma infectious viral particles. Based upon these findings, the authors suggested that an earlier clinical trial in humans may have used suboptimal favipiravir dosing. However, recent in vitro data suggest that even higher favipiravir doses may not be effective against SARS-CoV-2.

### The importance of appropriate selection of clinical endpoints in outpatient COVID-19 clinical trials [^922344f9]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative to changing the focus to more frequently occurring outcomes could be to restrict enrollment to higher risk populations with low vaccine coverage or other vulnerabilities (e.g. elderly, immunocompromised patients, or those with comorbidities) who are expected to have a higher event rate. This, however, is insufficient, and raises potential questions regarding generalizability, especially for an agent that may be expected to be used in a population that was not included in the clinical trial. For example, older people with multiple co-morbidities may not be eligible for a clinical trial because they have received various doses of COVID-19 vaccines but would still be provided therapy in clinical practice. Furthermore, trials in largely unvaccinated populations would be nearly impossible to conduct given the widespread uptake of vaccination worldwide, and the resulting lack of generalizability of such a trial. Trials that enroll heterogenous populations increase the clinical applicability of effective therapies, so exclusions based on vaccination status, comorbidities, variant infection, location, and availability of therapies outside the trial should be avoided where possible. This highlights the challenge of maintaining traditional endpoints and increases the desirability of uniform and accurate measurement of outcomes that, while harder to assess accurately, remain relevant to patients and guideline developers and regulators.

### Efficacy and safety of GST-HG171 in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 / 3 trial [^8dd02d5d]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Several drugs have undergone evaluation and shown significant clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19. Most previous trials used hospitalization or death as the primary endpoint, such as the MOVE-OUT trial for Molnupiravir, the EPIC-HR trial for Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir, and the TOGETHER trial for fluvoxamine. As the mortality rate has significantly decreased with the emergence of recent Omicron variants, however, there has been a shift in focus towards outcomes related to clinical symptoms. Among drugs evaluated for symptoms related outcomes, Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir (in the EPIC-SR trial) did not show benefits. The PANORAMIC trial and the PRINCIPLE trial exhibited benefits in symptom recovery for Molnupiravir and budesonide, respectively, yet both were evaluated in open-label trials. The SCORPIO-SR trial demonstrated efficacy for a 3C-like (3CL) protease inhibitor Ensitrelvir with the time to resolution of 5 characteristic symptoms shortened.VV116, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor approved in China, was evaluated among adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, establishing non-inferior efficacy to Nirmatrelvir plus Ritonavir and demonstrating superiority to placebo with respect to the time to sustained clinical recovery. Simnotrelvir and Leritrelvir are 3CL protease inhibitors recently approved in China, both of which shortened the time to sustained resolution of COVID-19 symptoms compared to placebo in their phase III trials. However, the trials mentioned above were all conducted before the 2023 Omicron XBB wave in China. To date, evidence of efficacy on symptom recovery for orally administrated antiviral drugs in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 remains limited, and no evidence of efficacy has been reported in patients infected with emerging XBB variants.

### Efficacy and safety of 5-day oral ensitrelvir for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: the SCORPIO-SR randomized clinical trial [^8622f8e6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Previous clinical trials, of oral antivirals for COVID-19 were conducted during the Delta phase of the pandemic in unvaccinated, high-risk adults and demonstrated a reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death as the primary end point. However, given the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and the nature of the infection caused by the Omicron variant, these end points could no longer be a viable option. Indeed, published studies, report a significant reduction in the risk of death, hospitalization, or severe disease associated with the Omicron vs Delta infection. Moreover, community-based studies, suggest limited effectiveness of these antivirals for high-risk, vaccinated adults or patients infected with the Omicron variant in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19.

The guidance issued by the FDA in 2020 discusses approaches to measure common symptoms of COVID-19 in drug clinical trials, which include the use of patient-reported outcomes. The phase 2/3 EPIC-SR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients) study used self-reported, sustained alleviation of all targeted COVID-19 symptoms for 4 days as a novel primary end point to assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Although a shortened time to sustained alleviation and resolution of COVID-19 signs and symptoms was demonstrated in nonhospitalized, high-risk adults with COVID-19 (EPIC-HR study), the EPIC-SR study did not show a meaningful difference in the time to sustained symptom alleviation through day 28. The current SCORPIO-SR study met the primary end point and demonstrated clinical efficacy of ensitrelvir in the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms (sustained for at least 24 hours) irrespective of the presence of risk factors for severe disease.

Ensitrelvir demonstrated clinical benefit for mild to moderate COVID-19 in terms of symptom resolution and virus reduction. To ensure its efficacy in various patient populations, additional clinical trials are being conducted, including SCORPIO-HRfor patients regardless of presence of high-risk factors and STRIVE (Strategies and Treatments for Respiratory Infections & Viral Emergencies: Shionogi Protease Inhibitor)for inpatients, both of which are in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, and 1 pediatric study.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir — renal dosing and ambulatory options are specified as follows: For eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min and ≥ 30 mL/min, use 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for five days; for eGFR < 30 mL/min, it is not recommended. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease admitted to the hospital may also receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir for a 3-day course, molnupiravir, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and patient-specific factors and product availability should drive decision-making; data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting.

Methods

Study design and study procedures

The present report uses the data of a prospective multicentre observational study (including five infectious disease centers in the Lazio region of Italy) on the effectiveness of early treatment with mAbs or antiviral agents for high‐risk outpatients with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19. Herein, we included all the patients consecutively enrolled, from March 2021 to May 2023, in the overmentioned five hospitals and treated with antivirals (molnupiravir, remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) or mAbs (bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, sotrovimab and tixagevimab/cilgavimab) according to AIFA eligibility criteria, the physician's assessment and judgment, the availability of drugs (which has changed over time) and the presence of contraindications to specific drugs.

On the day of the first evaluation, demographic and clinical data were collected, including information on time from symptoms onset, vaccination status and comorbidities, and treatment was administered. All the data were anonymously collected into an electronic database. The SARS‐CoV‐2 variant was established either directly, using base sequencing where available, or indirectly, inferred from the calendar period of baseline date based on Italian regional surveillance data. Data on vaccination were extracted from the regional register (Anagrafe Vaccinale Regione Lazio) and, if not available, we collected self‐reported vaccination status from clinical charts. Participants were defined with (1) none or incomplete vaccination, if they did not receive any vaccine dose, or they received less than three doses; (2) full but not recent vaccination, if they received more than three doses with the last dose administered more than 120 days before; (3) full recent vaccination, if they received more than three doses with the last dose administered less than 120 days before. Participants were followed up to 30 days by in‐presence or telephonic visits, and information on hospitalization or death was collected.

### Temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 clearance kinetics and the optimal design of antiviral pharmacodynamic studies: an individual patient data meta-analysis of a randomised, controlled, adaptive platform study (PLATCOV) [^15a62512]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The PLATCOV study characterised the effects of several antiviral drugs on viral clearance. with findings that were generally consistent with earlier clinical trials assessing their efficacy in the prevention of disease progression. Comparative estimates of in-vivo antiviral activity allow for rational selection of drugs now that comparisons based on clinical endpoints are no longer feasible because of the prohibitively large sample sizes required in clinical trials. In this analysis, using the observed differences in the viral clearance profiles between effective and ineffective drugs or the no treatment arm allowed determination of the sampling duration that best characterised these differences. The greatest differences between effective and ineffective (or no) drugs were observed for assessments made over 4–5 days. Although there was substantial inter-individual variation in clearance rates, and intra-individual variation between the serial viral density estimates, with current viral clearance rates daily sampling still has adequate discriminatory power.

However, if natural viral clearance continues to accelerate, then it might be necessary to sample twice daily over a shorter period. Shortening the viral clearance serial sampling to 5 days simplifies the comparative assessment of antiviral drugs in COVID-19 (although later sampling is still necessary if rebound is being assessed).

These data emphasise the importance of fixed ratio (as opposed to response adaptive randomisation ratios) randomisation and contemporary comparators in COVID-19 platform trials. Temporal confounding across non-concurrently randomised interventions or for time-varying randomisation ratios (this occurs in response-adaptive trials) requires model-dependent adjustment. Even an ineffective drug will appear effective if compared with a historical control. The exact ranking of all unblinded interventions in the PLATCOV platform trial in the meta-analysis is dependent in part on correct adjustment for the temporal trends. This issue is particularly salient for the comparison between remdesivir and molnupiravir, because they had very similar effects, and it can be difficult to differentiate small effects from small biases.

### Molnupiravir and risk of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: cohort study [^c9796b97]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings in relation to other studies

Our study findings provide evidence that use of molnupiravir within the first five days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result is associated with reduced risk of PASC. Molnupiravir use was associated with 14% less risk of PASC, 38% lower risk of post-acute death, and 14% lower risk of post-acute hospital admission; the magnitude of risk reduction on the absolute scale was also substantial — a 2.97%, 0.87%, and 1.32% lower absolute risk of PASC, post-acute death, and post-acute hospital admission for every 100 treated people between 30 and 180 days of infection. These findings align with previous observations that use of combined antivirals nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is associated with reduced risk of PASC, post-acute death, and post-acute hospital admission. Together, these findings suggest that use of antivirals in the acute phase of infection may not only help reduce the risk of progression to severe covid-19 but may be a viable strategy to reduce the risk of post-acute adverse health outcomes, including PASC. The clinical decision to use antivirals during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection should consider the effectiveness of antivirals in reducing the burden of death and disease in both the acute and the post-acute phases of covid-19.
