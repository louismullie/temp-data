## Question

What kind of iv fluids to administer to dehydrated patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of intravenous fluids to administer to a dehydrated patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of dehydration. Then, I should verify the first-line choice between crystalloids and colloids. Next, I will compare isotonic saline versus balanced crystalloids and consider special populations. After that, I need to check dosing, rates, and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate alternatives like oral rehydration and subcutaneous fluids, and close with a concise, actionable recommendation anchored to guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the type and urgency of IV fluids depend on severity, etiology, and patient factors such as age, comorbidities, and electrolyte status. Severe dehydration with shock, altered mental status, or ileus warrants immediate IV isotonic resuscitation, whereas mild to moderate dehydration without red flags can often be managed orally, and chronic or end-of-life contexts may favor subcutaneous hydration to avoid IV risks [^114NBuaN] [^112csfMw] [^116nbbJJ].

> I need to ensure the first-line principle is correct: crystalloids are preferred for initial resuscitation in dehydration because they are effective, safe, and less costly than colloids, and large reviews show no mortality benefit of colloids over crystalloids while starches increase renal replacement therapy needs, so I should avoid colloids for routine dehydration resuscitation [^111QhqtH] [^1178uzWT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which crystalloid to pick. I should compare isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) with balanced solutions such as lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte. Balanced crystalloids have lower chloride and often include bicarbonate precursors, which reduces hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may modestly improve biochemical endpoints; however, high-quality evidence shows no clear mortality difference versus saline in critically ill adults, though some analyses suggest fewer renal events with balanced solutions, so the choice should be individualized and guided by ongoing electrolyte and acid–base status [^112ybZbc] [^1178uzWT] [^115Vn6XH].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric data because practice often differs. In children with severe dehydration from diarrheal illness, balanced crystalloids like Ringer's lactate likely shorten hospital stay by about 0.35 days and reduce hypokalemia compared with saline, with no clear mortality difference, supporting a preference for balanced solutions when available, while acknowledging the evidence quality is moderate for some outcomes and low for mortality [^112ZPidS] [^112w9meR].

> I should double-check dosing and rates for severe dehydration. For adults, typical resuscitation uses 1–2 liters of isotonic crystalloid as a bolus, reassessing hemodynamics and urine output, then titrating to correct the estimated deficit over 24–48 hours. For children, WHO-style rapid rehydration uses 100 mL/kg total, with 30 mL/kg given rapidly followed by 70 mL/kg more slowly, and shock treated with 20 mL/kg boluses repeated as needed, with DKA-specific guidance recommending 10–20 mL/kg isotonic saline boluses followed by calculated deficit replacement and careful monitoring for cerebral edema risk [^115oX9BJ] [^113a8hNS] [^11214RM1].

> But wait, what if the patient has hypernatremia or hyponatremia. I need to ensure sodium correction is cautious: in hypernatremia, use isotonic fluids initially to restore volume before slow correction of sodium, and in hyponatremia with severe symptoms, hypertonic saline is indicated, whereas otherwise correct sodium gradually to avoid osmotic demyelination, typically no more than 8–12 mEq/L in 24 hours, with frequent monitoring of sodium and neurologic status [^111nVwLA] [^1175CAmS].

> Let me consider special scenarios. In acute pancreatitis, lactated Ringer's is favored over saline for resuscitation, with moderate rather than aggressive fluid strategy and early reassessment to avoid fluid overload. In rhabdomyolysis, isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's are acceptable with goal-directed urine output targets. In heat stroke, prioritize rapid cooling and use isotonic IV fluids for rehydration. In end-of-life care, subcutaneous hydration can reverse dehydration with fewer adverse effects than IV, though it delivers smaller volumes more slowly [^115JvzZw] [^115ZxpDm] [^116575r8] [^112csfMw].

> I should confirm maintenance fluid choices after initial resuscitation. In children, isotonic maintenance fluids with appropriate potassium and dextrose reduce hyponatremia compared with hypotonic solutions, so routine hypotonic maintenance should be avoided. In adults, maintenance is often isotonic crystalloid with dextrose as indicated, with ongoing reassessment of electrolytes and fluid balance to avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload [^113QWAcR] [^117Vp6EP] [^112YegjG].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. Fluid therapy should be treated like drug therapy with indication, dose, and stop criteria, using frequent clinical assessment of perfusion, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory status, urine output, and daily weights when feasible, plus serial electrolytes and acid–base checks. Fluid challenges of 500 mL can help assess responsiveness while limiting excess administration, and positive fluid balance is consistently associated with worse outcomes in critical illness, so I need to de-escalate promptly once euvolemia is achieved [^1141B1Rp] [^113Nxweq] [^114P8Wsu].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives when IV access is difficult or risks outweigh benefits. Oral rehydration solutions are first-line for mild to moderate dehydration and can be surprisingly effective even in some vomiting patients with antiemetics, while nasogastric tubes are a reasonable bridge when oral intake fails. Subcutaneous hydration is a safer alternative to IV in older adults or palliative settings, with fewer adverse events though lower volume delivery, and should be considered when appropriate [^114NBuaN] [^112EfV35] [^112csfMw].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. For most dehydrated patients requiring IV therapy, start with isotonic crystalloid, prefer balanced solutions such as lactated Ringer's when available, especially in children with diarrheal dehydration, pancreatitis, or when large volumes are anticipated. Reserve saline when balanced solutions are unavailable or when specific indications exist, avoid colloids for routine dehydration, tailor dosing to severity and patient factors, and monitor closely to correct deficits while preventing fluid overload, escalating to special protocols for DKA, hypernatremia, or shock as indicated [^112ZPidS] [^115JvzZw] [^111QhqtH] [^11214RM1] [^111nVwLA].

---

For dehydrated patients, use **isotonic crystalloids** (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) for initial resuscitation [^114NBuaN] because they restore intravascular volume and electrolytes with minimal risk of osmotic shifts. In children, **isotonic fluids are preferred** to prevent hyponatremia [^113QWAcR] [^114FbFon]. For mild to moderate dehydration without shock, oral rehydration is first-line [^114NBuaN]; reserve IV therapy for severe dehydration, shock, or when oral intake is not feasible [^116jwv3M]. Avoid hypotonic solutions initially, as they can cause hyponatremia and cerebral edema [^114FbFon] [^113QWAcR]. Monitor electrolytes, acid–base status, and clinical response to guide ongoing fluid selection and rate adjustments [^112yo5ca].

## Classification of dehydration

Dehydration is classified by **serum sodium concentration** and severity:

| **Type** | **Definition** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Isotonic dehydration | Sodium 130–150 mmol/L | - Equal loss of water and sodium <br/> - Most common in acute gastroenteritis [^notfound] |
| Hypotonic dehydration | Sodium < 130 mmol/L | - Greater sodium loss than water <br/> - Risk of seizures and cerebral edema |
| Hypertonic dehydration | Sodium > 150 mmol/L | - Greater water loss than sodium <br/> - Risk of cerebral hemorrhage and thrombosis |

---

Severity is categorized as **mild, moderate, or severe** based on clinical signs and percentage of body weight lost [^notfound].

---

## General principles of fluid resuscitation

- **Restore intravascular volume**: Use isotonic fluids to rapidly expand plasma volume and restore perfusion [^117ELPoD].
- **Correct electrolyte imbalances**: Tailor fluid composition to address specific deficits (e.g. potassium, sodium) [^1134hMUp].
- **Individualize therapy**: Consider age, comorbidities, and ongoing losses (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting, burns) [^116nbbJJ].
- **Monitor closely**: Track vital signs, urine output, electrolytes, and acid–base status to guide adjustments [^112yo5ca].

---

## Choice of intravenous fluids

### Isotonic crystalloids

Isotonic crystalloids are **first-line for most dehydrated patients** because they match plasma tonicity and expand intravascular volume effectively [^1178uzWT].

- **Normal saline (0.9% NaCl)**: Widely available; suitable for initial resuscitation, especially in shock or when electrolyte status is unknown [^114NBuaN].
- **Lactated Ringer's (LR)**: Contains sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and lactate; preferred in metabolic acidosis, liver disease, or when potassium is needed [^notfound].
- **Balanced crystalloids (e.g. Plasma-Lyte)**: Lower chloride content; may reduce hyperchloremic acidosis and renal injury risk in critical illness [^112ybZbc].

---

### Hypotonic solutions

Hypotonic solutions (e.g. 0.45% saline, 5% dextrose in water) are **not recommended for initial resuscitation** because they can cause hyponatremia, cerebral edema, and seizures, especially in children [^113QWAcR] [^114FbFon]. They may be considered only after initial isotonic resuscitation and correction of electrolyte imbalances, with close monitoring [^notfound].

---

### Colloids

Colloids (e.g. albumin, hydroxyethyl starch) are **not routinely recommended** for dehydration because they offer no mortality benefit and may increase adverse effects (e.g. renal injury, coagulopathy) [^111QhqtH]. Albumin may be considered in specific scenarios (e.g. cirrhosis with ascites, large-volume paracentesis) but is not first-line for dehydration [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

- **Isotonic fluids**: Preferred for both resuscitation and maintenance to prevent hyponatremia [^113QWAcR] [^114FbFon].
- **Oral rehydration**: First-line for mild to moderate dehydration; IV reserved for severe cases or when oral intake is not feasible [^114NBuaN].
- **WHO guidelines**: Use 0.9% saline or LR for severe dehydration; administer 100 mL/kg total, with 30 mL/kg rapidly followed by 70 mL/kg over 2–5 hours [^113a8hNS].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **individualize fluids** by using smaller boluses and slower rates to avoid fluid overload, and consider subcutaneous hydration when IV access is difficult or risky [^112csfMw].

---

### Patients with chronic illnesses

In patients with chronic illnesses, **heart failure or renal disease** warrants cautious fluid administration with close monitoring to avoid overload [^116s9uMF]. In **diabetes mellitus**, use isotonic fluids and monitor glucose closely to avoid hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia [^112YtsdG].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Continuous monitoring is essential to guide therapy and prevent complications:

- **Vital signs**: Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature [^115eXLhn].
- **Urine output**: Target 0.5–1 mL/kg/h in adults; 1–2 mL/kg/h in children [^notfound].
- **Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine [^112yo5ca].
- **Acid–base status**: pH, lactate, base excess [^11769uM8].
- **Clinical response**: Mental status, capillary refill, skin turgor, thirst [^116jwv3M].

---

## Potential complications of inappropriate fluid administration

- **Fluid overload**: Pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, cardiac failure [^111TyiA9].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia [^114FbFon].
- **Acid–base imbalances**: Metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis [^112ybZbc].
- **Infection**: Line-related sepsis, thrombophlebitis [^112Qd2yy].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended iv fluid** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| General dehydration (adults) | Isotonic crystalloids (NS or LR) | Restore intravascular volume; minimal osmotic shifts [^117ELPoD] |
| Pediatric dehydration | Isotonic crystalloids (NS or LR) | Prevent hyponatremia; restore volume [^113QWAcR] [^114FbFon] |
| Metabolic acidosis | Lactated Ringer's or balanced crystalloids | Buffer acidosis; provide electrolytes [^112ZPidS] |
| Severe dehydration/shock | Rapid isotonic boluses (NS or LR) | Rapid volume expansion; restore perfusion [^114NBuaN] |
| Mild to moderate dehydration | Oral rehydration first-line | Safe, effective, less invasive [^114NBuaN] |

---

Isotonic crystalloids (**normal saline or lactated Ringer's**) are the **preferred IV fluids** for dehydrated patients, with selection tailored to age, comorbidities, and electrolyte status. Oral rehydration is first-line for mild to moderate cases, and close monitoring is essential to adjust therapy and prevent complications [^114NBuaN] [^112YegjG].

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^116DR42o]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

### Perioperative fluid management and clinical outcomes in adults [^116LFAnG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

The administration of IV fluid to avoid dehydration, maintain an effective circulating volume, and prevent inadequate tissue perfusion should be considered, along with the maintenance of sleep, pain relief, and muscular relaxation, a core element of the perioperative practice of anesthesia. Knowledge of the effects of different fluids has increased in recent years, and the choice of fluid type in a variety of clinical situations can now be rationally guided by an understanding of the physicochemical and biological properties of the various crystalloid and colloid solutions available. However, there are few useful clinical outcome data to guide this decision. Deciding how much fluid to give has historically been more controversial than choosing which fluid to use. A number of clinical studies support the notion that an approach based on administering fluids to achieve maximal left ventricular stroke volume (while avoiding excess fluid administration and consequent impairment of left ventricular performance) may improve outcomes. In this article, we review the available fluid types and strategies of fluid administration and discuss their relationship to clinical outcomes in adults.

### Are we close to the ideal intravenous fluid? [^113fy4d3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The approach to i.v. fluid therapy for hypovolaemia may significantly influence outcomes for patients who experience a systemic inflammatory response after sepsis, trauma, or major surgery. Currently, there is no single i.v. fluid agent that meets all the criteria for the ideal treatment for hypovolaemia. The physician must choose the best available agent(s) for each patient, and then decide when and how much to administer. Findings from large randomized trials suggest that some colloid-based fluids, particularly starch-based colloids, may be harmful in some situations, but it is unclear whether they should be withdrawn from use completely. Meanwhile, crystalloid fluids, such as saline 0.9% and Ringer's lactate, are more frequently used, but debate continues over which preparation is preferable. Perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear how to select the optimal dose of fluid in different patients and different clinical scenarios. There is good reason to believe that both inadequate and excessive i.v. fluid administration may lead to poor outcomes, including increased risk of infection and organ dysfunction, for hypovolaemic patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on this topic and identify some key pitfalls and some areas of agreed best practice.

### Fluid challenge revisited [^112mYD2U]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112r2PYE]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

For children with moderate to severe AGE, rehydration with oral or intravenous isotonic fluids to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and on-going losses is the mainstay of treatment. Where oral rehydration is not feasible, rehydration by nasogastric tube is the preferred option and recommended before intravenous rehydration in some guidelines. However, some aspects of current management recommendations are controversial. First, the decision to treat with either oral or intravenous fluids is largely based upon an assessment of level of dehydration, which has been shown to be notoriously unreliable. Second, though the evidence supporting the recommendations are scanty, current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the treatment of severe dehydration ('Plan C') are based on rapid, intravenous administration of isotonic fluids. Plan C recommends a minimum of 100mls/kg, the equivalent volume replacement for losses in those with 10% dehydration. Plan C is given in two stages over 3–6 h, dependent on age. Recommending an initial 30 ml/kg to be administrated rapidly (30–60 min) and the remaining 70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h respecitvely in infants aged under 12 months and older. For those with hypovolaemic shock initial management recommends fluid boluses (of up to 60 ml/kg) rehydration for children which is followed by step 2 of plan C (70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h). Whilst the aggressive regime may be appropriate for cholera, the only infective cause of secretory-diarrhoea (leading to excess fluid and electrolyte loss), it may not be generalisable to non-cholera AGE, the dominant cause of AGE worldwide. Despite lack of formal testing, the WHO expert review group indicated this as a strong recommendation.

There are, however, increasing concerns over the safety of rapid intravenous correction of fluid deficits. The only controlled trial (FEAST) assessing fluid bolus therapy in children with presumed sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in those children receiving fluid-bolus therapy, including a large group with severe dehydration. Although the FEAST trial raises important questions about the safety of rapid intravenous fluid therapy in severe febrile illnesses, children with severe dehydration secondary to AGE were not included in the trial, therefore it is uncertain whether rapid fluid replacement to correct dehydration, the cornerstone of standard management in this condition, is safe. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the evidence underpinning current guidelines for intravenous rehydration.

### Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given? An international consensus [^115Vn6XH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tQetK]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid intravenous rehydration, using fluid volumes of 70-100mls/kg over 3–6 h, with some of the initial volume given rapidly as initial fluid boluses to treat hypovolaemic shock for children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and severe dehydration. The evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of rapid versus slower rehydration remains uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 11th of May 2017 comparing different rates of intravenous fluid therapy in children with AGE and moderate or severe dehydration, using standard search terms. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Non-RCTs and non-English articles were excluded. The primary endpoint was mortality and secondary endpoints included adverse events (safety) and treatment efficacy.

Main Results

Of the 1390 studies initially identified, 18 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 3 studies (n = 464) fulfilled a priori criteria for inclusion; most studied children with moderate dehydration and none were conducted in resource-poor settings. Volumes and rates of fluid replacement varied from 20 to 60 ml/kg given over 1–2 h (fast) versus 2–4 h (slow). There was substantial heterogeneity in methodology between the studies with only one adjudicated to be of high quality. There were no deaths in any study. Safety endpoints only identified oedema (n = 6) and dysnatraemia (n = 2). Pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the rapid and slow intravenous rehydration groups for the proportion of treatment failures (N = 468): pooled RR 1.30 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.93) and the readmission rates (N = 439): pooled RR 1.39 (95% CI: 0.68, 2.85).

Conclusions

Despite wide implementation of WHO Plan C guideline for severe AGE, we found no clinical evaluation in resource-limited settings, and only limited evaluation of the rate and volume of rehydration in other parts of the world. Recent concerns over aggressive fluid expansion warrants further research to inform guidelines on rates of intravenous rehydration therapy for severe AGE.

### Intravenous fluids: effects on renal outcomes [^112Ryokt]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is the most commonly prescribed inpatient medication in hospitals around the world. Intravenous fluids are drugs and have an indication, a dose, and expected and unintended effects. The type and amount of fluid given to patients are both important, and can either hasten or slow recovery depending on how they are administered. This narrative review provides a brief summary of the effect of intravenous fluid administration on kidney function and on renal outcome measures of relevance to both patients and clinicians. Several large clinical trials of fluid therapy are currently underway, the results of which are likely to change clinical practice.

### Isotonic versus hypotonic solutions for maintenance intravenous fluid administration in children [^114FbFon]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Maintenance intravenous fluids are frequently used in hospitalised children who cannot maintain adequate hydration through enteral intake. Traditionally used hypotonic fluids have been associated with hyponatraemia and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Use of isotonic fluid has been proposed to reduce complications.

Objectives

To establish and compare the risk of hyponatraemia by systematically reviewing studies where isotonic is compared with hypotonic intravenous fluid for maintenance purposes in children. Secondly, to compare the risk of hypernatraemia, the effect on mean serum sodium concentration and the rate of attributable adverse effects of both fluid types in children.

Search Methods

We ran the search on 17 June 2013. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), and ISI Web of Science. We also searched clinical trials registers and screened reference lists. We updated this search in October 2014 but these results have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared isotonic versus hypotonic intravenous fluids for maintenance hydration in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors assessed and extracted data for each trial. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes as mean differences with 95% CIs.

Main Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1106 patients. The majority of the studies were performed in surgical or intensive care populations (or both). There was considerable variation in the composition of intravenous fluid, particularly hypotonic fluid, used in the studies. There was a low risk of bias for most of the included studies. Ten studies provided data for our primary outcome, a total of 449 patients in the analysis received isotonic fluid, while 521 received hypotonic fluid. Those who received isotonic fluid had a substantially lower risk of hyponatraemia (17% versus 34%; RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.60, high quality evidence). It is unclear whether there is an increased risk of hypernatraemia when isotonic fluids are used (4% versus 3%; RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.38, nine studies, 937 participants, low quality evidence), although the absolute number of patients developing hypernatraemia was low. Most studies had safety restrictions included in their methodology, preventing detailed investigation of serious adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Isotonic intravenous maintenance fluids with sodium concentrations similar to that of plasma reduce the risk of hyponatraemia when compared with hypotonic intravenous fluids. These results apply for the first 24 hours of administration in a wide group of primarily surgical paediatric patients with varying severities of illness.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116jwv3M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Contemporary approaches to perioperative IV fluid therapy [^112yGe5J]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous fluid therapy is required for most surgical patients, but inappropriate regimens are commonly prescribed. The aim of this narrative review was to provide evidence-based guidance on appropriate perioperative fluid management.

Method

We did a systematic literature search of the literature to identify relevant studies and meta-analyses to develop recommendations.

Results

Of 275 retrieved articles, we identified 25 articles to inform this review. "Normal" saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is not physiological and can result in sodium overload and hyperchloremic acidosis. Starch colloid solutions are not recommended in surgical patients at-risk of sepsis or renal failure. Most surgical patients can have clear fluids and/or administration of carbohydrate-rich drinks up to 2 h before surgery. An intraoperative goal-directed fluid strategy may reduce postoperative complications and reduce hospital length of stay. Regular postoperative assessment of the patient's fluid status and requirements should include looking for physical signs of dehydration or hypovolemia, or fluid overload. Both hypovolemia and salt and water overload lead to adverse events, complications and prolonged hospital stay. Urine output can be an unreliable indicator of hydration status in the postoperative surgical patient. Excess fluid administration has been linked to acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiac and pulmonary complications.

Conclusion

There is good evidence supporting the avoidance of unnecessary fasting and the value of an individualized perioperative IV fluid regimen, with transition to oral fluids as soon as possible, to help patients recover from major surgery.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^112yVjfQ]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As dehydration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in older people, its recognition and treatment is important. While individual clinical signs and bedside tests are limited in diagnostic value, a holistic clinical evaluation should still be recommended. Serum osmolality has a role in the diagnosis in hypertonic dehydration with further studies required to evaluate point of care testing. Daily fluid requirements may be lower than previously recommended, but this evidence is weaker for older people. While oral hydration is usually the preferred method, the subcutaneous rate offers reasonable rates of fluid absorption and has the advantage over intravenous routes of having much fewer adverse effects. As complex interventions, behavioural and environmental strategies may result in small increases in fluid intake but are limited by motivation and longevity.

### Intravenous solutions in the care of patients with volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities [^1134hMUp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^112mTDH6]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

How do we prescribe fluids?

The choice of intravenous fluid should be based on consideration of certain baseline factors, but also on elements that arise during therapy. For example, at baseline, administration of saline may be indicated in the presence of hypochloremia whereas a hypotonic fluid may be warranted in the presence of hypernatremia. Importantly, the situation may evolve with time as the fluid administered may induce metabolic changes leading to a different "best" fluid choice. Giving several liters of 0.9% saline will result in hyperchloremia, so continuing this fluid strategy is not rational.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^117BNuBb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fluids are by far the most commonly administered intravenous treatment in patient care. During critical illness, fluids are widely administered to maintain or increase cardiac output, thereby relieving overt tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia.

Main Text

Until recently, because of their excellent safety profile, fluids were not considered "medications". However, it is now understood that intravenous fluid should be viewed as drugs. They affect the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and immune systems. Fluid administration should therefore always be accompanied by careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio, not only of the additional volume being administered but also of the effect of its composition on the physiology of the patient. Apart from the need to constantly assess fluid responsiveness, it is also important to periodically reconsider the type of fluid being administered and the evidence regarding the relationship between specific disease states and different fluid solutions.

Conclusions

The current review presents the state of the art regarding fluid solutions and presents the existing evidence on routine fluid management of critically ill patients in specific clinical settings (sepsis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, major abdominal surgery, acute kidney injury and trauma).

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^115mLiuS]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the benefits and harms of subcutaneous fluid replacement in older people included 29 studies in the review and six in the pooled analyses. None of the included studies were graded as low risk of bias. The pooled analysis compared the rate of adverse events in those randomised to subcutaneous versus intravenous fluid. There was a 38% lower risk of adverse events in the subcutaneous group (risk ratio 0.62 [95%CI 0.53, 0.71], moderate quality of evidence). Intravenous hydration reduced serum osmolality by 5.75 mmol/kg (95%CI 0.13 to 11.4; two trials, very low quality of evidence) more than subcutaneous infusion, although it is not clear at what time point this was measured. Over 24 hours, the intravenous route infused 155 mL (95%CI 60 to 253; three trials; very low quality of evidence) more than the subcutaneous route when administering 1 l of fluid. The clinical significance of this small volume is open to debate. There was low quality evidence that in people with cognitive impairment there was a 58% reduced risk of agitation when using the subcutaneous route compared to the intravenous route (risk ratio 0.42 [95%CI 0.22 to 0.79]; three studies).

There are no studies directly comparing the oral route with parenteral routes when hydrating older people.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nxweq]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Volume of fluid challenge

The volumes of fluid administered for the fluid challenge varied from < 500 mL (n = 8 [12.7%]) to 500 mL (n = 50 [79.4%]) and > 500 mL (n = 5 [7.9%]). Twenty-four studies were excluded from this analysis because the volume was described as milligrams per kilogram and the participants' body weight was not reported. The estimated mean PR values were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9–62.7) among patients receiving < 500 ml, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9–61.0) among patients receiving 500 mL and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9–79.2) among patients receiving > 500 ml. There was no difference in the PR values between groups of patients receiving different volumes of fluid challenges [F (2,57) = 0.35, p = 0.71] (Additional file 1: Figure S3). The PR observed in studies where the fluid was prescribed as a fixed volume (n = 63 [72.4%]) and where fluid volume was adjusted for body weight (n = 24 [27.6%]) was similar [F (1,83) = 0.02, p = 0.88].

Type of fluid

Twenty-six (35%) studies used crystalloids, and 50 (65%) used colloids. Nine studies were excluded from the analysis because they used both types of fluids. Among patients receiving crystalloids, 53.5% (95% CI 45.4–58.5) were responders, as compared with 59.0% (95% CI 55.5–62.9) in the group receiving colloids (Additional file 1: Figure S4). The type of fluid used did not affect the proportion of patients responding to a fluid challenge [F (1,76) = 2.19, p = 0.14].

### Effect of intravenous fluids on dehydrated patients and on normal subjects… [^114t5nok]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dehydration is frequently encountered in both medical and surgical patients. Whether dehydration is the result of vomiting, diarrhea, inability to swallow or electrolyte derangement such as occurs in diabetic acidosis, 1 the intravenous administration of fluids is the mode of therapy usually relied on to restore the normal state of hydration and electrolyte balance. Indeed, so routinely and with such gratifying results are intravenous fluids used for these patients that the physician seldom pauses to consider the exact effect of his therapy on the cardiovascular system. Previous reports in the literature have dealt with the effect of intravenous infusions on pulse rate, blood pressure, blood volume, venous pressure, velocity of blood flow and the electrocardiogram. 2 Altschule and Gilligan3 have also reported the changes in cardiac output in normal men. However, no workers, so far as we are aware, have studied the effect of intravenous fluids on cardiac output. HARDY JD, GODFREY L.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^1178uzWT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Intravenous fluids are drugs and should be prescribed as such. Among the available fluids, crystalloids have the highest benefit/risk ratio and, should generally be prescribed first. For critically ill patients or when large amount of fluids is expected to be infused, balanced solutions should be preferred because of their favourable effects on patient outcomes, including kidney function. The preferred solution for non critically ill patients or low volume resuscitation is less clear. However, given the availability of balanced solutions and their low cost, they could be considered for all patients. The role of albumin remains a matter of debate, but there is indirect evidence that albumin may favourably affect the outcomes of patients with septic shock. The indications and effects of gelatins remain unclear for critically ill patients. The role of dextrans in this patient population should probably remain marginal until more data is forthcoming.

### Harms and benefits of subcutaneous hydration in older patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112csfMw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review all available original publications on the harms and benefits of subcutaneous (SC) hydration in older patients.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Participants

All studies on SC hydration in older patients without restrictions on design or language.

Measurements

The Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases and trial registries were searched from inception to November 5, 2019, and two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of individual outcomes.

Results

Thirty-one publications from 29 studies met the eligibility criteria. The data from six randomized controlled trials were used for the meta-analyses. The subgroup analysis including only the studies with the lowest risk of bias showed that SC hydration was associated with fewer adverse effects than intravenous (IV) hydration (risk ratio (RR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53–0.88; P = 0.003; n = 4; I² = 0.0%; 545 infusions in each group). In absolute numbers, patients treated with SC hydration had an incidence rate of 90 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions versus 130 adverse effects per 1,000 infusions (95% CI = 102–169) with IV hydration. Secondary outcomes comparing IV with SC hydration showed that SC was 3.2 minutes faster to set up and markedly reduced the risk of agitation (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.22–0.79; P = 0.007; I² = 65%; n = 3); however, SC hydration delivered a lower volume of fluid and was less efficient at reducing serum osmolality (s-osmolality).

Conclusions

SC hydration is safer than IV hydration and potentially reduces the risk of agitation, but it is less effective. SC hydration should be available as an alternative to IV hydration when treating older patients for mild-to-moderate dehydration. More high-quality studies are needed in the field to increase the confidence in the estimates.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^1179xrXu]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hydration is a fundamental aspect of clinical practice and yet it is an under-researched topic, particularly in older people, leading to many areas of uncertainty. There are two types of dehydration; hypertonic, which is a water deficit, and isotonic, which is a deficit of both water and salt. Individual clinical signs and bedside tests are poor diagnostic tools, making dehydration difficult to identify. However, the diagnostic value of a holistic clinical approach is not known. The gold-standard clinical test for dehydration is serum osmolality, but this cannot diagnose isotonic dehydration and may delay diagnosis in acute situations. Salivary osmolality point-of-care testing is a promising and rapid new diagnostic test capable of detecting both hypertonic and isotonic dehydration in older people, but further evidence to support its clinical utility is needed. Daily fluid requirements may be less than previously thought in adults, but the evidence specific to older people remains limited. Hydration via the subcutaneous route is safer and easier to initiate than the intravenous route but is limited by infusion speed and volume. Prompting older adults more frequently to drink, offering a wider selection of drinks and using drinking vessels with particular features can result in small increases in oral intake in the short-term. The ongoing clinically-assisted hydration at end of life (CHELsea II) trial will hopefully provide more evidence for the emotive issue of hydration at the end of life.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^11769uM8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fluids are probably the most commonly administered intravenous treatment in inpatient care. Because of their excellent safety profile, until recently fluid solutions were not considered "medications". Little to no thought was therefore invested in the choice of fluids to be administered in specific clinical scenarios. However, recent evidence on long-term effects has altered our view on the different types of fluids available for fluid resuscitation. Intravenous fluids should be seen as drugs affecting the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and immune systems and should therefore not be administered "blindly".

Emphasis on the importance of volume above all the other characteristics of the fluids administered was nurtured by early guidelines that focused on administering specific fluid volumes to hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. the surviving sepsis campaign). It is true that fluid administration is an important component of treatment of overt tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Fluids may expand the intra-vascular compartment, thereby improving cardiac output (CO) and end-organ perfusion. However, the most common error with regards to fluid administration is the belief that resuscitation hinges on transfusion of a specific volume of fluids.

Disease processes are dynamic and their response to fluid may change over time. Specific disease states may also require different fluid therapy. Evidence from perioperative settings has associated both hypo- and hypervolemia with several unfavorable outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), respiratory complications, increased lengths of stays, admission costs and 30-day-mortality rates. Later iterations of the guidelines have therefore clarified that the aim of fluid resuscitation is restoration of end-organ perfusion and correction of physiological imbalance. Follow-up during fluid administration should therefore include surrogate markers of organ perfusion (e.g. mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, lactate, CO), markers of circulation, blood electrolyte and acid-base composition and indicators of renal function. No fluid is ideal for all disease conditions at all times. This review presents the current state of knowledge regarding the types of fluids to be administered with an emphasis on several disease states.

### Buffered solutions versus 0.9% saline for resuscitation in critically ill adults and children [^112ybZbc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid therapy is one of the main interventions provided for critically ill patients, although there is no general consensus regarding the type of solution. Among crystalloid solutions, 0.9% saline is the most commonly administered. Buffered solutions may offer some theoretical advantages (less metabolic acidosis, less electrolyte disturbance), but the clinical relevance of these remains unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of buffered solutions versus 0.9% saline for resuscitation in critically ill adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to July 2018: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and four trials registers. We checked references, conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel or cross-over design examining buffered solutions versus intravenous 0.9% saline in a critical care setting (resuscitation or maintenance). We included studies on participants with critical illness (including trauma and burns) or undergoing emergency surgery during critical illness who required intravenous fluid therapy. We included studies of adults and children. We included studies with more than two arms if they fulfilled all of our inclusion criteria. We excluded studies performed in persons undergoing elective surgery and studies with multiple interventions in the same arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane's standard methodological procedures. We assessed our intervention effects using random-effects models, but when one or two trials contributed to 75% of randomized participants, we used fixed-effect models. We reported outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs (20,213 participants) and identified three ongoing studies. Three RCTs contributed 19,054 participants (94.2%). Four RCTs (402 participants) were conducted among children with severe dehydration and dengue shock syndrome. Fourteen trials reported results on mortality, and nine reported on acute renal injury. Sixteen included trials were conducted in adults, four in the paediatric population, and one trial limited neither minimum or maximum age as an inclusion criterion. Eight studies involving 19,218 participants were rated as high methodological quality (trials with overall low risk of bias according to the domains: allocation concealment, blinding of participants/assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting), and in the remaining trials, some form of bias was introduced or could not be ruled out. We found no evidence of an effect of buffered solutions on in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01; 19,664 participants; 14 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate of 119 per 1000, buffered solutions could reduce mortality by 21 per 1000 or could increase mortality by 1 per 1000. Similarly, we found no evidence of an effect of buffered solutions on acute renal injury (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00; 18,701 participants; 9 studies; low-certainty evidence). Based on a rate of 121 per 1000, buffered solutions could reduce the rate of acute renal injury by 19 per 1000, or result in no difference in the rate of acute renal injury. Buffered solutions did not show an effect on organ system dysfunction (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.61; 266 participants; 5 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on the effects of buffered solutions on electrolyte disturbances varied: potassium (mean difference (MD) 0.09, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.27; 158 participants; 4 studies; very low-certainty evidence); chloride (MD -3.02, 95% CI -5.24 to -0.80; 351 participants; 7 studies; very low-certainty evidence); pH (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; 200 participants; 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence); and bicarbonate (MD 2.26, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.27; 344 participants; 6 studies; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no effect of buffered solutions on preventing in-hospital mortality compared to 0.9% saline solutions in critically ill patients. The certainty of evidence for this finding was high, indicating that further research would detect little or no difference in mortality. The effects of buffered solutions and 0.9% saline solutions on preventing acute kidney injury were similar in this setting. The certainty of evidence for this finding was low, and further research could change this conclusion. Patients treated with buffered solutions showed lower chloride levels, higher levels of bicarbonate, and higher pH. The certainty of evidence for these findings was very low. Future research should further examine patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life. The three ongoing studies once published and assessed may alter the conclusions of the review.

### Which intravenous isotonic fluid offers better outcomes for patients with a brain injury? [^111udY4J]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Administering intravenous fluids is a common therapy for critically ill patients. Isotonic crystalloid solutions, such as saline or balanced solutions, are frequently used for intravenous fluid therapy. The choice between saline or a balanced crystalloid has been a significant question in critical care medicine. Recent large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated whether balanced crystalloids yield better outcomes in general or specific critical care populations, and many of them have confirmed this hypothesis. Although the broad eligibility criteria of these RCTs suggest applicability to neurocritical care patients, it is important to discuss whether using balanced crystalloids, as opposed to saline, would benefit patients who primarily have neurological disorders or diseases. This review considers the relevance of this question, weighs the pros and cons of the two fluid types, examines available data, and anticipates results from ongoing RCTs to guide clinicians in selecting the optimal fluid for patients with brain injury.

### Fluids in the ICU: which is the right one? [^114p3Zrq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The administration of fluids is one of the most common interventions in the intensive care unit. The effects and side effects of intravenous fluids depend on the amount administered and their specific composition. Intravenous fluid solutions are either considered crystalloids (for example 0.9% saline, lactated Ringer's solution) or colloids (artificial colloids such as gelatins, and albumin). This narrative review summarizes the physiological principles of fluid therapy and reviews the most important studies on crystalloids, artificial colloids and albumin in the context of critically ill patients.

### Four phases of intravenous fluid therapy: a conceptual model [^1141B1Rp]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

I.V. fluid therapy plays a fundamental role in the management of hospitalized patients. While the correct use of i.v. fluids can be lifesaving, recent literature demonstrates that fluid therapy is not without risks. Indeed, the use of certain types and volumes of fluid can increase the risk of harm, and even death, in some patient groups. Data from a recent audit show us that the inappropriate use of fluids may occur in up to 20% of patients receiving fluid therapy. The delegates of the 12th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Conference sought to obtain consensus on the use of i.v. fluids with the aim of producing guidance for their use. In this article, we review a recently proposed model for fluid therapy in severe sepsis and propose a framework by which it could be adopted for use in most situations where fluid management is required. Considering the dose-effect relationship and side-effects of fluids, fluid therapy should be regarded similar to other drug therapy with specific indications and tailored recommendations for the type and dose of fluid. By emphasizing the necessity to individualize fluid therapy, we hope to reduce the risk to our patients and improve their outcome.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Clinical practice guideline: maintenance intravenous fluids in children [^117Vp6EP]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children — fluid tonicity ranges, products used, and overall comparative efficacy — are summarized as follows: Isotonic fluid has a sodium concentration similar to plasma (135–144 mEq/L), and the sodium concentration of isotonic fluids ranged from 131 to 154 mEq/L, whereas hypotonic fluids ranged from 30 to 100 mEq/L; investigators most commonly used 0.9% NaCl (sodium concentration 154 mEq/L; osmolarity 308 mOsm/L), with Hartmann solution 131 mEq/L/279 mOsm/L used in 46 patients and Plasmalyte 140 mEq/L/294 mOsm/L used in 346 patients, and dextrose (2.5%–5%) was often added. Across 17 randomized clinical trials including 2455 patients (2313 with primary outcome data), sixteen studies revealed that isotonic fluids were superior to hypotonic fluids in preventing hyponatremia, with 7 systematic reviews, and the number needed to treat with isotonic fluids to prevent hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mEq/L) was 7.5 across all included studies and 27.8 for moderate hyponatremia (sodium < 130 mEq/L); study appraisal found the studies methodologically sound, with most bias types low risk in all but 2 studies, 1 study with 2 potentially high-risk bias types, and 11 studies with 1 or more unclear bias areas.

### Delirium and dehydration: some fluid for thought? [^111QfrAV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Delirium is a frequent complication of advanced cancer. It is characterized by cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbance, and therefore can potentially result in severe symptom distress and impeded communication between patient and family and between patient and medical staff. The reversibility of delirium depends on its underlying causes. Delirium is multifactorial in origin, and precipitating or contributory factors include dehydration and hypovolemia. Much of the debate concerning the role of hydration in advanced cancer has centered on symptoms such as thirst, and ethical issues such as parenteral hydration and its association with prolongation of life, with the association between hydration status and delirium largely excluded. This review examines the latter association in the light of recent studies. It also provides an outline of relevant pathophysiology and clinical assessment, a decision-making framework and a practical approach to the techniques of assisting hydration. This will hopefully help physicians and families in weighing up the merits of assisted hydration in an individual context and help them to achieve a consensus on the role of hydration that is consistent with the goals of care.

We did not publish a protocol prior to conducting this review. We registered our search strategies on PROSPERO on 21st May 2017 (review number 67532). We used pre-defined rules relating to eligibility criteria, information sources to be searched, study selection, data collection process, and assessment of risk of bias in identified studies.

Selection criteria and process

Population

Children aged 0 to 18 years with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and moderate or severe dehydration. Due to the possible variation in the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, where this was not clearly defined in the manuscript, we planned to use either the ESPGHAN or WHO definition for acute gastroenteritis. Where the level of dehydration in trial participants was not clearly defined we used the WHO guideline definition for moderate and severe dehydration. We excluded studies with severe malnutrition and chronic or persistent diarrhoea according to WHO definitions (i.e. lasting ≥ 14 days).

Intervention

Interventions included any form of intravenous rehydration with isotonic solutions e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer's lactate for rehydration. Studies that involved the use of hypotonic solutions were excluded since these are not recommended for intravenous rehydration.

Comparison

A comparator was considered as any of the above intravenous isotonic solution given at different rates for rehydration. Enteral therapies were not considered.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary endpoints included treatment efficacy (as defined in the study protocols - see below) and safety outcomes (within 28 days of rehydration). These included:
Proportion of participants with a pre-defined serious adverse event (other than death). Where this was not clear we used the definition from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline: any adverse event is life-threatening, or requires hospitalisation or prolongation of hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Pre-specified SAEs were new onset seizures, pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema and cardiac failure.
Proportion of participants with dysnatraemia at 4–6 h after the initiation of intravenous rehydration. Dysnatraemia was defined as a serum sodium level outside the normal range (135–145 mmol/L). Where dysnatraemia was present at enrolment, we planned to compare the magnitude (percentage) of decrease or increase in serum sodium levels from baseline at enrolment.

### Evaluation and management of dehydration in children [^117E2Vwv]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The article discusses the evaluation of dehydration in children and reviews the literature on physical findings of dehydration. Pediatric dehydration is a common problem in emergency departments and wide practice variation in treatment exists. Dehydration can be treated with oral, nasogastric, subcutaneous, or intravenous fluids. Although oral rehydration is underutilized in the United States, most children with dehydration can be successfully rehydrated via the oral route. Selection of oral rehydration solution and techniques for successful oral rehydration are presented. Appropriate selection and rate of administration of intravenous fluids are also discussed for isonatremic, hyponatremic, and hypernatremic dehydration.

### Thirst-guided participant-controlled intravenous fluid rehydration: a single blind, randomised crossover study [^117DMxwn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dehydration is common in hospitals and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Clinical assessment and diagnostic measures of dehydration are unreliable. We sought to investigate the novel concept that individuals might control their own intravenous rehydration, guided by thirst.

Methods

We performed a single-blind, counterbalanced, randomised cross-over trial. Ten healthy male volunteers of mean age 26 (standard deviation [sd] 10.5) yr were dehydrated by 3–5% of their baseline body mass via exercising in the heat (35°C, 60% humidity). This was followed by a 4 h participant-controlled intravenous rehydration: individuals triggered up to six fluid boluses (4% dextrose in 0.18% sodium chloride) per hour in response to thirst. Participants undertook two blinded rehydration protocols which differed only by bolus volume: 50 mL (low volume [LV]) or 200 mL (high volume [HV]). Each hour during the rehydration phase, plasma osmolality (pOsm) was measured and thirst score recorded. Nude body mass was measured at baseline, after dehydration, and after the rehydration phase.

Results

In both conditions, the mean dehydration-related body mass loss was 3.9%. Thirst score was strongly associated with pOsm (within-subject r = 0.74) and demand for fluid decreased as pOsm corrected. In the HV condition, participants rapidly rehydrated themselves (mean fluid delivered 3060 vs 981 mL in the LV condition) to body mass and pOsm no different to their euhydrated state.

Conclusion

Healthy individuals appear able to rely on thirst to manage intravenous fluid intake. Future work must now focus on whether patient-controlled intravenous fluids could represent a paradigm shift in the management of hydration in the clinical setting.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^117ELPoD]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Contrary to our expectations, we observed increases in serum sodium in both the 0.45% and 0.9% groups, although this change was only statistically significant in the 0.9% group. Furthermore, similar proportions of individuals in both treatment arms developed hyponatremia.

After decades of using hypotonic fluids, the best choice of solution for maintenance IV fluid therapy has recently become a topic of intense debate. Six randomized trials favored isotonic over hypotonic fluids for the prevention of hyponatremia. There were two main differences between the present trial and past studies. First, the present study included a more diverse population than past trials, including both non-critically ill general medical patients and surgical patients after completion of surgery. Second, prior trials dictated both the rate and composition of fluids administered. A strength of the present study is that only fluid composition was dictated by study protocol; physicians were advised that study fluid was to be used for maintenance needs, and allowed the freedom to choose the rate of administration and any additional fluids according to their usual practice. This allowed us to isolate the impact of fluid composition on changes in serum [Na] in a 'real world' clinical setting in which physicians determined the rate of fluid administration.

Maintenance fluids are one of the three key components of an IV fluid prescription, along with deficit replacement, and replacement of ongoing losses. The goal of maintenance fluids is to maintain fluid homeostasis by replacing both insensible water losses and obligate urinary water losses. Combining theoretical considerations regarding obligate urinary water losses, empiric estimates of average daily insensible water losses, and estimates of daily electrolyte requirements, Holliday and Segar recommended hypotonic solutions (0.2% saline) for the maintenance component of the IV fluid prescription. However, their assumptions regarding obligate urinary water losses - or at least regulation of urinary water losses -may not be valid among hospitalized children.

Recommendations for replacement of a volume deficit vary. For rapid volume expansion, only isotonic fluids are considered safe and effective. Although some sources suggest that 0.45% saline can be used for slow correction of volume deficits, use of 0.45% saline in a volume depleted patient (who therefore has elevated ADH) will predictably lead to a drop in serum [Na]. Volume deficits are isotonic deficits, so should be replaced with isotonic fluid. This view is reflected in current recommendations. The composition of fluid used for ongoing losses depends on the type of fluid being lost.

OVERUSE OF IV FLUIDS AND MEDICATIONS AND AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS

There is growing evidence that IV fluids are often administered unnecessarily or continued longer than clinically indicated. The proportion of hospitalized patients who can safely receive oral hydration instead of IV fluids is likely substantial, particularly in cases where oral intake is feasible and safe.

For patients with infectious diarrhea, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends oral rehydration solutions as the first line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration. In patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing contrast‐enhanced CT or cardiac catheterization, oral hydration was as effective as IV hydration in preventing contrast‐associated acute kidney injury. Oral rehydration for clinically stable patients with hypernatremia has demonstrated safety in pediatric populations, and could be implemented for adult inpatients.

Avoiding low‐value practices restricting oral intake can reduce the use of IV fluids. Examples include shortening pre‐procedure fasting timesand early resumption of enteral nutrition for acute pancreatitis. Even for patients with dysphagia, a study by Leder et al. demonstrated that 90.7% of hospitalized patients who passed a 3‐ounce water swallow challenge could be advanced to oral diets without subsequent signs of aspiration.

Many medications such as antibiotics can be administered through IV push (like cefazolin and meropenem)or orally (as in azithromycin or fluroquinolones) with equal efficacy. IV proton pump inhibitors in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleed can be administered as infusions or intermittently as twice a day IV pushes or oral therapy after the initial 80 mg bolus, according to American College of Gastroenterology guidelines. Wherever fluids can be minimized, doing so provides multiple benefits including improved resource utilization and ease of nursing medication administration.

Overuse in these cases is not only wasteful but also increases the risk of complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and prolonged hospital stays in patients with heart failure and other conditions. Moreover, the unnecessary use of IV lines increases the risk of infections and thrombophlebitis, adding to patient morbidity.

Dehydration and drugs — syncope management recommendations state that fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration, and reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension can be beneficial in selected patients with syncope. In selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake, and rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery. Additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages, and higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages; this treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or HF, uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^11214RM1]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Although these guidelines now have greater cohesion, a number of minor differences remain:

Regarding fluid replacement, NICE have included two levels of severity of DKA, while BSPED have subdivided the stratification to include three discrete categories for severity and subsequent dehydration status, as outlined in table 1. A difference remains between the maximum weight considered by the guidelines when calculating fluid deficit. Given that the maximum weight considered for each is 75 kg for NICE and 80 kg for BSPED, the maximum difference in deficit fluids could be 1850 mL (5%×75 kg = 3750 mL for NICE compared with 7%×80 kg = 5600 mL for BSPED).
For patients who are clinically dehydrated, but not in shock, an intravenous 10 mL/kg bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride is recommended on admission. This should be administered over 30 min (NICE) or 60 min (BSPED). This volume is included in the fluid replacement when calculating the total fluid deficit. NICE recommend discussing with a paediatrician experienced in DKA management before giving more than one intravenous bolus. A second bolus should only be considered if needed to improve tissue perfusion and this must be done after reassessing their clinical status. A delicate balance between increasing the risk of osmolar shift secondary to rapid fluid administration, with the risk of dehydration and subsequent CO due to slower fluid administration, is the foundation for the initial discrepancy between the two guidelines. Guidance from the 2018 ISPAD consensus states that this should be administered between 30 min and 60 min, which falls between the two UK guidelines. Therefore, aiming to administer the fluid rapidly but observing for signs of potential deterioration and adjusting the rate accordingly will provide the best outcome for patients.
In the presence of hypovolaemic shock, both NICE and BSPED recommend an intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride bolus of 20 mL/kg. BSPED recommend repeating these infusions over 15 min to a maximum of 40 mL/kg, before considering the introduction of inotropes, while NICE recommends administering it as soon as possible. In both guidelines, the bolus for shock is not subtracted from total fluid deficit. While the nomenclature varies between these two guidelines, in practice, it is likely that these will represent similar time frames. Administering a 20 mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride bolus to treat shock as quickly as possible should provide the best therapy for the patient.
When calculating fluid replacement, the NICE guidelines recommend a maximum weight of 75 kg, whereas BSPED recommend a maximum weight of 80 kg or 97th centile weight for age (whichever is lower). This discrepancy is unlikely to be encountered on a frequent basis in general paediatric practice. However, if the weight greatly exceeds 75 kg, it may be more appropriate for young people to be managed according to adult guidelines due to their increased body habitus. Additionally, identifying a CYP on the 97th centile can be difficult, especially in an emergency setting, and, therefore, this may be missed.

### ESPNIC clinical practice guidelines: intravenous maintenance fluid therapy in acute and critically ill children-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ciCYe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous maintenance fluid therapy (IV-MFT) has been defined as the water and electrolyte prescription designed to replace anticipated physiologic water and electrolyte losses over the ensuing 24-h period. Maintenance fluid therapy is provided by enteral hydration and/or IV-MFT which comprises both specific IV-MFT prescription, but also additional fluids administered as vectors of various treatments, blood products, or line flush infusions. IV-MFT should be differentiated from fluid boluses and resuscitation fluids that are administered to correct a relative or true fluid deficit, or from replacement fluids that are administered to correct abnormal fluid losses, even if this might be challenging as they are often administered simultaneously. IV-MFT is a standard of care for many hospitalized children in both acute and critical care settings (i.e. emergency department, pediatric wards, surgical wards or intermediate (high dependency) care units and pediatric intensive care units (PICU)). Despite this, maintenance fluid prescribing practices vary considerably and guidelines are scarce. Historically, IV-MFT prescriptions (fluid volume calculation formulas and solution composition) were based on Holliday and Segar's work. Since then, the use of these guidelines has been associated with potentially severe complications such as hyponatremia, fluid overload and hyperchloremic acidosis, due to inappropriate fluid composition and/or infusion rates/volumes. Several established practices are currently questioned. First, the ideal fluid tonicity, i.e. the osmotic pressure gradient of the fluid which is determined by the concentration of osmoactive or non-penetrating solutes, mainly sodium. Second, the chloride content and balanced nature of the fluid (i.e. balanced or buffered solutions are produced after the replacement of part of the chloride anions by organic anions to align to the plasma chloride levels, which may impact on acid–base equilibrium). Finally, the volume of fluid administered, especially in situations where patients are at risk of increased anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and free water excretion impairment. Over the past decade, several pediatric societies have developed guidelines and recommendations surrounding IV-MFT, but their impact has been limited by a lack of dissemination, a lack of recent systematic reviews and because some important questions remained unanswered. In 2020, the Metabolism, Endocrine and Nutrition (MEN) section of the European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive care (ESPNIC) formed a working group to develop European guidelines on IV-MFT. These guidelines aim to provide evidence-based recommendations around the indications for IV-MFT, the tonicity of IV-MFT, the electrolyte or glucose content and the volume of IV-MFT administered to children from term to 18 years of age.

### Fluid resuscitation: history, physiology, and modern fluid resuscitation strategies [^116Fp5Ly]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) fluids are among the most common interventions performed in the emergency department. They are at times lifesaving, but if used recklessly can be harmful. Given their ubiquity, it is important to understand the history, physiology, and current strategies that govern the use of IV fluids during the resuscitation of the critically ill.

### Avoid instituting intravenous (IV) fluids before doing a trial of oral… [^112EfV35]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Many children who come to the emergency department with dehydration require fluid replacement. To avoid the pain and potential complications of an IV catheter, it is preferable to give these fluids by mouth. Giving a medication for nausea may allow patients with nausea and vomiting to accept fluid replenishment orally. This strategy can eliminate the need for an IV. It is best to give these medications early during the emergency department visit, rather than later, in order to allow time for them to work optimally.

### Rational fluid management in today's ICU practice [^113i8zvj]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

Results of multiple smaller clinical trials and recent larger randomized controlled clinical trials advise against the use of both high and low molecular weight starch-based solutions in the care of critically ill patients, because they appear to increase morbidity and rates of renal dysfunction. No convincing data support their impact on improving outcomes. Based on the SAFE trial, albumin and crystalloids appear to have equal effects on mortality in critically ill patients, with the exception of patients with traumatic brain injury.

Goal-directed fluid therapy designed to optimize either stroke volume or preload has been validated in multiple patient groups and has the potential to improve meaningful clinical outcomes. Physicians should resist the blood-pressure-centric approach to hemodynamic management that has, for practical reasons, been the dominant paradigm for over a century, and should make every effort to utilize the currently available technology that can help them give fluids when they are needed, and to restrict them when they are not. Future studies should address both the ideal combination of monitoring devices as well as the choice of fluids in order to develop the best possible treatment strategy for specific clinical scenarios. In particular, stroke volume variation, arterial respiratory variation, and low-frequency oscillations in the photo-plethysmographic waveforms are attractive candidate endpoints that need to be further assessed.

A successful fluid management strategy needs to be incorporated into a multimodal interdisciplinary plan of care. We are reminded of this by Dr Latta's humbling closing of his first account of an initially successful resuscitation of a dehydrated cholera patient that fell short on these grounds:

This being my first case, I fancied my patient secure, and from my great need for a little repose, left her in charge of the hospital surgeon; but I had not been long gone, ere the vomiting and purging recurring, soon reduced her to her former state of debility. I was not apprised of the event, and she sunk in five and a half hours after I left her. As she had previously been of sound constitution, I have no doubt the case would have resulted in complete reaction, had the remedy, which already had produced such effect, been repeated.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

Early reports of the use of hypodermoclysis within palliative care settings included the use of hyaluronidase to facilitate distribution of the fluid within the connective tissues (and so absorption of fluid into the systemic circulation). A review of the literature concluded that hyaluronidase is not indicated in most cases. Furthermore, hyaluronidase is relatively expensive (and often difficult to acquire) and has been linked to additional adverse effects (e.g. allergic reactions, fluid overload).

The PR route is an option for administering CAH when other routes are not available/suitable. Proctoclysis has been reported to be effective and generally well tolerated (although there is much less data on this route of administration).
9 Patients who are dehydrated should be given sufficient fluids to reverse the dehydration.

If a patient is dehydrated, and the decision is made to commence clinically assisted hydration, then the goal of treatment should be to reverse dehydration in a timely manner: the volume of fluid, type of fluid (including electrolytes), and rate of infusion should be individualised. Important factors to consider are the degree of dehydration, ongoing fluid losses (i.e. homeostatic, pathological), and relevant co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes mellitus, cardiac problems, renal disease). Routine biochemical testing should be used to guide fluid and electrolyte replacement (except in patients in the terminal phase). Once the patient is rehydrated, an assessment must be made regarding the necessity for ongoing/ "maintenance" treatment (see statement 10).
10 Patients who are not dehydrated should be given sufficient fluids to maintain hydration/prevent dehydration.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

### Fluid therapy for children: facts, fashions and questions [^111gGi2e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Fluid therapy restores circulation by expanding extracellular fluid. However, a dispute has arisen regarding the nature of intravenous therapy for acutely ill children following the development of acute hyponatraemia from overuse of hypotonic saline. The foundation on which correct maintenance fluid therapy is built is examined and the difference between maintenance fluid therapy and restoration or replenishment fluid therapy for reduction in extracellular fluid volume is delineated. Changing practices and the basic physiology of extracellular fluid are discussed. Some propose changing the definition of "maintenance therapy" and recommend isotonic saline be used as maintenance and restoration therapy in undefined amounts leading to excess intravenous sodium chloride intake. Intravenous fluid therapy for children with volume depletion should first restore extracellular volume with measured infusions of isotonic saline followed by defined, appropriate maintenance therapy to replace physiological losses according to principles established 50 years ago.

### Accelerated intravenous rehydration [^115e5ggX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether accelerated intravenous (i.v.) rehydration using a new Isotonic Dehydration Worksheet results in: (1) complications in serum sodium or volume status, and (2) decreased duration of i.v. fluid therapy or length of hospital stay, we conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing chart review. An intervention group of 98 children, ages 1 month to 12 years, treated with the Isotonic Dehydration Worksheet from December 2000 through March 2001 was compared to a control group of 61 children treated from December 1999 through March 2000 before introduction of the Worksheet. Complication rates were low and did not differ between the 2 groups. Mean unadjusted lengths of i.v. therapy (35.3 vs. 33.7 hours) and of hospital stay (47.0 vs. 49.3 hours) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Introduction of an accelerated rehydration protocol was well-tolerated by patients but did not result in a significant decrease in the outcome variables examined. Other factors may have a greater impact on the outcome variables, and a prospective study to address these questions is planned.

Dehydration and drugs — For syncope due to acute dehydration, I C-LD: Fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration. Fluid resuscitation is recommended for syncope secondary to both dehydration and exercise-associated hypotension, and oral fluid bolus may require less volume than intravenous fluid infusion to have a similar treatment effect because oral fluid loading has a pressor effect. Rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery, and beverages with increased sodium concentration (closer to normal body osmolality) rehydrate faster than beverages with lower sodium concentration or increased osmolality.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^11348Pgm]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Supportive care during withdrawal — clinical guidance emphasizes non-isolation, hydration vigilance, and universal supportive measures. Supportive care for withdrawal helps alleviate common physical complications and reassures the patient about what to expect from the process, and isolating patients who are experiencing withdrawal, however, is not advised, due to the increased risk of self-harm. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances can have serious health consequences, including death, so maintaining fluids is essential; it is important that custody staff are alert to indicators of dehydration and well-trained to report concerns about dehydration to health care staff, and qualified health care professionals will monitor for signs and symptoms of dehydration during clinical assessments. All patients experiencing withdrawal, regardless of severity, should receive supportive care, which may include nutritional supplementation, intravenous (IV) fluids, glucose, management of electrolyte abnormalities, and periodic clinical reevaluations, as clinically indicated.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^117WmH9m]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Dehydration may, in its simplest form be considered a deficiency of water, but even this simplistic definition is controversial. The lack of formal definition has hindered academic progress, with several professional societies differing in even the basic principles of whether the definition should include factors such as osmolality, intake or output, clinical findings and volume distribution. In 2019, a group of UK academics convened to reach consensus. The group which identifies as multidisciplinary was drawn from anaesthesia/critical care (50%), sports science, cardiology and dietetics and was largely based in southeast England. The group of 12 experts used expert opinion, literature reviews and a modified Delphi process to produce a series of recommendations.

Two types of dehydration were defined by the consensus group:

Hypertonic dehydration, an uncompensated, predominantly pure water deficit (e.g. inadequate water intake or excessive loss) resulting in a raised extracellular osmolality.
Isotonic dehydration, which is a deficiency of water with an associated reduction in salt (e.g. caused by diarrhoea) which does not increase the extracellular osmolality.

While these definitions may have a role in standardising diagnosis, the narrow geographical membership and lack of diverse expertise will likely lead to a lack of uptake by the wider community. However, the definitions are clear and compared with other existing definitions are easily translated into clinical practice.

Other factors may have a greater impact on the outcome variables, and a prospective study to address these questions is planned.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^113a8hNS]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality (after acute respiratory illnesses). The vast majority of deaths occur in low resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A large case-control study, Global Enteric Multicentre study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred < 7 days following enrolment — indicating that current treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children (without severe malnutrition), oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration, defined as two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty and/ or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly ≥ 2 seconds (s), lethargy and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called 'plan C'), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline. This is the approximate volume estimated to have been lost in children with 10% dehydration and is recommended to be given over 3 h (or 6 h in children < 1 year). Plan C consists of two steps in which the volume and rate of infusion are different and also differ by age group (< 1 year and ≥ 1 year). In Step 1 30 ml/kg over 30 min (or 1 h if < 1 year) and then in Step 2 70 ml/kg over 2.5 h (or 5 h if < 1 year). For children presenting with shock (defined as the presence of all three of weak and fast pulse, temperature gradient and capillary refilling time > 3 s), WHO also recommends initial fluid boluses given for shock (i.e. up to 3 boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal (0.9%) saline given as rapidly as possible) followed directly by Step 2, i.e. 90–130 ml/kg. These management guidelines are recommended in resource-poor settings, despite no formal testing in a clinical trial. A review of the evidence underpinning WHO management guidelines in 2012, with regard to shock and rehydration management, focused principally on the type of fluid for resuscitation but did not consider the rate or volume.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^115qCpFd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication status and language.

Types of participants

We included children aged one month to 18 years old, with:

clinically defined acute infectious diarrhoea or acute gastroenteritis of less than 14 days' duration (defined as passing loose or watery stools at least three times in a 24‐hour period (WHO 2005)); and
severe dehydration (defined by the dehydration scale recommended by the WHO (WHO 2005); or classified using the CDS or Gorelick Scales, as 'moderate to severe dehydration'), managed with a rapid intravenous rehydration therapy.

Types of interventions

Interventions

The interventions of interest were intravenous balanced crystalloid solutions, defined as any solution that contained lower sodium and chloride concentrations than 0.9% saline, maintained a difference between sodium and chloride levels of at least 20 mmol/L, and that contained bicarbonate or its precursors, such as acetate, lactate, or gluconate. Examples of balanced solutions included, but were not limited to: Ringer's lactate (also called 'Hartmann's solution') and multiple electrolytes' solution (Plasma‐Lyte 148 or Plasma‐Lyte A).

Control

The control was 0.9% saline solution (also called 0.9% sodium chloride or 0.9% NaCl). We considered trials that gave oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution only when ORS was given to complement intravenous infusion in both trial groups.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Time in hospital (or hospital length of stay)
Mortality (overall during hospitalization)

Secondary outcomes

Need for additional fluids
Total amount of fluids received
Time to resolution of metabolic acidosis (plasma pH greater than 7.35 or plasma bicarbonate greater than 19.9 mmol/L)
Change in and final pH level after correction
Change in and final bicarbonate level after correction
Change in sodium level after correction
Change in chloride level after correction
Change in potassium level after correction
Change in creatinine level after correction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) at any time (according to authors' definition)

Adverse effects

Number of children with one or more adverse effects. Expected adverse effects were any electrolytes disturbances as measured by study authors.

### Reduction in resources and cost for gastroenteritis through implementation of dehydration pathway [^115LPc52]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Management decisions for patients with gastroenteritis affect resource use within pediatric emergency departments (EDs), and algorithmic care using evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) has become widespread. We aimed to determine if the implementation of a dehydration EBG in a pediatric ED resulted in a reduction in intravenous (IV) fluid administration and the cost of care.

Methods

In a single-center quality improvement initiative between 2010 and 2016, investigators aimed to decrease the percentage of patients with gastroenteritis who were rehydrated with IV fluids. The EBG assigned the patient a dehydration score with subsequent rehydration strategy on the basis of presenting signs and symptoms. The primary outcome was proportion of patients receiving IV fluid, which was analyzed using statistical process control methods. The secondary outcome was cost of the episode of care. Balancing measures included ED length of stay, admission rate, and return visit rate within 72 hours.

Results

A total of 7145 patients met inclusion criteria with a median age of 17 months. Use of IV fluid decreased from a mean of 15% to 9% postimplementation. Average episode of care-related health care costs decreased from $599 to $410. For our balancing measures, there were improvements in ED length of stay, rate of admission, and rate of return visits.

Conclusions

Implementation of an EBG for patients with gastroenteritis led to a decrease in frequency of IV administration, shorter lengths of stay, and lower health care costs.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^115eXLhn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis intravenous hydration monitoring and dosing — monitor clinical parameters and target early reassessment with moderate strategies. Monitoring depends on heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, and hydration leading to a decrease in the HCT (hemoconcentration) and/or decreased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality; the latest evaluation should be 6–8 hours after admission. A randomized study showed that moderate intravenous hydration for the first 24–48 hours may be equally effective as aggressive hydration and was less likely to cause volume overload. In patients with no evidence of hypovolemia, an initial resuscitation rate of no more than 1.5 mL/kg of body weight per hour should be administered, whereas in patients with hypovolemia, clinicians should administer a bolus of 10 mL/kg.

### The impact of climate change induced natural disasters on healthcare: rethinking intravenous fluids [^113t4srn]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the evidence, excess use of IV fluids and medications remains a default practice in many hospitals. The reasons are multifaceted. Orders may be part of standard protocols, sometimes with little thought given to whether they are truly necessary. Many clinicians view IV fluid administration as a simple, low‐risk intervention to "do something" for patients, especially where the clinical picture is uncertain. The complex nature of insurance reimbursements also contributes to this confusion, as the use of IV fluids and medications can be perceived as the difference between inpatient and observation status. This mindset contributes to a cycle of overuse that is difficult to break.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^115V4G4J]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Similar findings were noted in studies that examined the effects of different infusions in treating dehydration, and acute pancreatitis. A double-blind study randomized 90 consecutive moderate-to-severely dehydrated adults to receive 0.9% saline, RL, or Plasma-Lyte at 20 ml/kg/h for 2 h. At the end of the study infusions, serum bicarbonate concentrations decreased leading to a tendency to lower pH values in the saline group. No significant changes were noted in potassium, sodium, or chloride concentrations. An observational study of 40 dehydrated patients with choleriform diarrhea examined the effects of treatment with 50 ml/kg/h of either RL or 0.9% saline.RL led to quicker resolution of acidosis, whereas the hyperosmolar and hypernatremic states were corrected with both solutions. Although the saline group had lower serum potassium concentrations at baseline, there were no significant differences in potassium concentrations at 2 and 14 h following infusion of the study fluids. Finally, a randomized study examined goal-directed (n = 19) versus standard (n = 21) fluid resuscitation in 40 patients with acute pancreatitis. Patients, randomized to either 0.9% saline or RL, received an initial bolus of 20 ml/kg over 30 min for resuscitation followed by a 3 ml/kg/h infusion for maintenance. There were no differences in total fluid volumes used (∼4.5 liters in 24 h). Infusion of RL was associated with significant reductions in systemic inflammatory response after 24 h (84 vs. 0% reduction in saline group, P = 0.035) and reduced CRP concentrations (51.5 vs. 104 mg/dl, P = 0.02). Although the aforementioned studydid not report peri-infusion serum potassium concentrations, there were no reported adverse events of hyperkalemia.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^112ZPidS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although acute diarrhoea is a self-limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma-Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2.

Mortality

Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8.

Adverse Events

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Characteristics of the included studies We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta-analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and one study in two high-income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma-Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each. Risk of bias All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments. Primary outcomes Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) -0.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.10; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low-certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.

### Do not drown the patient: appropriate fluid management in critical illness [^115DVApg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Administering intravenous fluids to support the circulation in critically ill patients has been a mainstay of emergency medicine and critical care for decades, especially (but not exclusively) in patients with distributive or hypovolemic shock. However, in recent years, this automatic use of large fluid volumes is beginning to be questioned. Analysis from several large trials in severe sepsis and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome have shown independent links between volumes of fluid administered and outcome; conservative fluid strategies have also been associated with lower mortality in trauma patients. In addition, it is becoming ever more clear that central venous pressure, which is often used to guide fluid administration, is a completely unreliable parameter of volume status or fluid responsiveness. Furthermore, 2 recently published large multicenter trials (ARISE and ProCESS) have discredited the "early goal-directed therapy" approach, which used prespecified targets of central venous pressure and venous saturation to guide fluid and vasopressor administration. This article discusses the risks of "iatrogenic submersion" and strategies to avoid this risk while still giving our patients the fluids they need. The key lies in combining good clinical judgement, awareness of the potential harm from excessive fluid use, restraint in reflexive administration of fluids, and use of data from sophisticated monitoring tools such as echocardiography and transpulmonary thermodilution. Use of smaller volumes to perform fluid challenges, monitoring of extravascular lung water, earlier use of norepinephrine, and other strategies can help further reduce morbidity and mortality from severe sepsis.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

The consensus that i.v. resuscitation fluids should be considered as drugs with specific dose recommendations, contraindications, and side-effects has led to an increased attention for the choice of fluid during perioperative care. In particular, the debate concerning possible adverse effects of unbalanced fluids and hydroxyethyl starches resulted in a re-evaluation of the roles of different fluid types in the perioperative setting. This review provides a concise overview of the current knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety of distinct fluid types for perioperative use. First, basic physiological aspects and possible side-effects are explained. Second, we focus on considerations regarding fluid choice for specific perioperative indications based on an analysis of available randomized controlled trials.

### Intravenous fluids: should we go with the flow? [^117XW65R]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Societal perspective

After the statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is less prescribed Europe-wide because of medico-legal considerations. The EMA supported us to think twice before infusing any fluid intravenously and to acknowledge that fluids are drugs. Interestingly, other colloids are also increasingly being avoided although the evidence for safety problems for albumin or gelatin is scarce. In the statement from the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures — Human (CMDh), healthcare professionals are informed to consider that 'HES solutions should only be used for the treatment of hypovolaemia due to blood loss when crystalloids alone are not considered sufficient'.

With this article the authorities reinforce applying individualized medicine and using, for example, preload monitoring to assess hypovolaemia. This is a step forward from conventional pressure-based management strategies. Interestingly, blood loss is defined as a prerequisite for colloidal HES infusion; replacement of extracellular water losses is clearly not listed as an indication for a colloidal infusion. The wording in this article leaves room for individual decision-making because the lack of efficacy of crystalloids does not need to be proven in the individual patient before choosing a more potent colloid, but only anticipated by the attending clinician.

'HES solutions should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time. Treatment should be guided by continuous haemodynamic monitoring so that the infusion is stopped as soon as appropriate haemodynamic goals have been achieved'.
The CMDh group requires clinicians to monitor the haemodynamic status continuously, however, without defining the appropriate methodology. From a practical viewpoint, and extrapolated from the ESA and S3 guidelines, appropriate haemodynamic monitoring will most probably not be restricted to conventional pressure-oriented monitoring but will comprise volumetric preload testing. The CMDh statement reminds us about a general principle in pharmacotherapy: repeatedly reconsider the indication and avoid overdosing. The therapeutic target is to achieve normovolaemia, not infusing beyond. The CMDh statement also suggests the use of protocols with predefined triggers for infusion and as stop signals for further infusion. Thereby, the authorities encourage a personalized low-HES volume resuscitation technique. Contraindications against the use of HES, such as in sepsis and burn, are clearly listed in the EMA resolution.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^115JvzZw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — initial intravenous hydration: We suggest moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation for patients with AP, with additional boluses if there is evidence of hypovolemia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), and we suggest using lactated Ringer solution over normal saline for intravenous resuscitation in AP (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). While we suggest all patients receive moderately aggressive isotonic crystalloid, caution is needed if cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidity exists and patients should be monitored for volume overload. Fluid resuscitation is likely more important early in the disease (within the first 24 hours), and fluid volumes need to be reassessed within 6 hours of presentation and for the next 24–48 hours with a goal to decrease the blood urea nitrogen (BUN). There is a general consensus that treating a patient with mild disease early in the course with early aggressive or moderately aggressive hydration is beneficial.

Maintenance intravenous fluids in children — specific groups at higher risk for developing hyponatremia include many populations excluded from RCTs, "such as those with congenital or acquired heart disease, liver disease, renal failure or dysfunction, or adrenal insufficiency; neurosurgical patients; and patients taking medication known to impair free-water excretion, such as desmopressin", for whom "Data on the efficacy of isotonic fluids to prevent hyponatremia and the potential complications related to isotonic fluids in these patients are lacking". In edematous states "such as CHF, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome", patients "are at risk for both volume overload and hyponatremia", and "Administering isotonic saline at typical maintenance rates will likely be excessive and risk volume overload, and IVFs should be restricted with close monitoring". Additional high-risk contexts include renal failure with "a relative inability to excrete free water", CNS disorders "including SIAD and cerebral salt wasting", and exposure to medications "such as desmopressin administered perioperatively for Von Willebrand disease, antiepileptic medications (such as carbamazepine), and chemotherapeutic agents (such as IV cyclophosphamide and vincristine)". For these disease states, "Isotonic IVFs may be the preferred fluid composition for these disease states, but care is needed in dosing the quantity of fluids, and close monitoring".

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^111GRniC]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings, but never formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

Methods

A multi-centre open-label phase II randomised controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan/Kenyan children aged 60days to 12years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. We compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer's lactate (100 ml/kg over 3h (6h if < 1 year), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (plan C) versus slower rehydration: 100 ml/kg Ringer's lactate over 8h (all ages) without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48h including cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

Results

One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median (IQR) age 8 (6–12) months) were randomised to plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up at day 7). Following randomisation mean (SD) time to start intravenous rehydration started was 15 min (18) in both arms. Mean (SD) fluid received by 1 hour was greater in plan C (mean 20.2 ml/kg (12.2) and 33.1 ml/kg (17) for children < 1year and > - 1 year respectively) versus 10.4 ml/kg (6.6) in slow arm. By 8 hours volume received were similar mean (SD) plan C: 96.3 ml/kg (15.6) and 97.8 ml/kg (10.0) for children < 1 and ≥ 1 year respectively vs 93.2 ml/kg (12.2) in slow arm. By 48-h, three (5%) plan C vs two (3%) slow had an SAE (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.12–3.85, p = 0.65). There was no difference in time to the correction of dehydration (p = 0.9) or time to discharge (p = 0.8) between groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels rose substantially by 8 hours in both arms, which persisted to day 7. Day 7 weights suggested only 33 (29%) could be retrospectively classified as severely dehydration (≥ 10% weight loss).

Conclusion

Slower rehydration over 8 hours appears to be safe, easier to implement than plan C. Future large trials with mortality as the primary endpoint are warranted.

### Optimisation of intravenous fluid prescribing: framework for changing practice through education and audits [^112yo5ca]. BMJ Open Quality (2017). Medium credibility.

Analysis of 2017 audit results as per NICE standards on intravenous fluids

Standard 1: The patient's fluid and electrolyte needs are assessed as part of every ward review

We assessed this standard to have been completed if a clear link was documented in the notes between the patient's clinical assessment and the need for intravenous fluids, and treatment with intravenous fluids was included in the plan. This was achieved in 72% of cases.

Standard 2: The following information is included in the intravenous fluid prescription: the type, rate and volume of fluid to be administered

Results indicated that the type and volume of intravenous fluid was documented in 100% of cases and the rate in 92% of cases.

Standard 3: Patients have an intravenous fluid management plan which should include details of the fluid and electrolyte prescription over the next 24 hours, details of assessment (urea and electrolytes, weight, fluid balance) and details of the monitoring plan

The details of prospective 24 hours fluid and electrolyte prescriptions were only completed in 23% of cases, with many intravenous fluid plans extending no further than the phrase 'IV fluids'. In terms of patient assessment, urea and electrolytes were checked in 87% of cases, weight had been documented in 68% of cases and fluid balance fully and partially completed in 64% and 27% of cases, respectively.

Standard 4: Correct prescription of intravenous maintenance fluids

Intravenous maintenance fluids were prescribed appropriately in 71% of patients (n = 103) (table 1).

Standard 5: Correct prescription of intravenous resuscitation fluids

Intravenous resuscitation fluids were prescribed appropriately in 96% of patients (n = 29) (table 1).

Not within NICE standards: correct prescription of intravenous replacement fluids

Intravenous replacement fluids were prescribed appropriately in 75% of cases (n = 63) (table 1).

### Colloids versus crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill people [^111QhqtH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Critically ill people may lose fluid because of serious conditions, infections (e.g. sepsis), trauma, or burns, and need additional fluids urgently to prevent dehydration or kidney failure. Colloid or crystalloid solutions may be used for this purpose. Crystalloids have small molecules, are cheap, easy to use, and provide immediate fluid resuscitation, but may increase oedema. Colloids have larger molecules, cost more, and may provide swifter volume expansion in the intravascular space, but may induce allergic reactions, blood clotting disorders, and kidney failure. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effect of using colloids versus crystalloids in critically ill people requiring fluid volume replacement on mortality, need for blood transfusion or renal replacement therapy (RRT), and adverse events (specifically: allergic reactions, itching, rashes).

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two other databases on 23 February 2018. We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of critically ill people who required fluid volume replacement in hospital or emergency out-of-hospital settings. Participants had trauma, burns, or medical conditions such as sepsis. We excluded neonates, elective surgery and caesarean section. We compared a colloid (suspended in any crystalloid solution) versus a crystalloid (isotonic or hypertonic).

Data Collection and Analysis

Independently, two review authors assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesised findings. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 69 studies (65 RCTs, 4 quasi-RCTs) with 30,020 participants. Twenty-eight studied starch solutions, 20 dextrans, seven gelatins, and 22 albumin or fresh frozen plasma (FFP); each type of colloid was compared to crystalloids. Participants had a range of conditions typical of critical illness. Ten studies were in out-of-hospital settings. We noted risk of selection bias in some studies, and, as most studies were not prospectively registered, risk of selective outcome reporting. Fourteen studies included participants in the crystalloid group who received or may have received colloids, which might have influenced results. We compared four types of colloid (i.e. starches; dextrans; gelatins; and albumin or FFP) versus crystalloids. Starches versus crystalloidsWe found moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference between using starches or crystalloids in mortality at: end of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.09; 11,177 participants; 24 studies); within 90 days (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 10,415 participants; 15 studies); or within 30 days (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.09; 10,135 participants; 11 studies). We found moderate-certainty evidence that starches probably slightly increase the need for blood transfusion (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39; 1917 participants; 8 studies), and RRT (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48; 8527 participants; 9 studies). Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain whether either fluid affected adverse events: we found little or no difference in allergic reactions (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 24.91; 7757 participants; 3 studies), fewer incidences of itching with crystalloids (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.82; 6946 participants; 2 studies), and fewer incidences of rashes with crystalloids (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.89; 7007 participants; 2 studies). Dextrans versus crystalloidsWe found moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference between using dextrans or crystalloids in mortality at: end of follow-up (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11; 4736 participants; 19 studies); or within 90 days or 30 days (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3353 participants; 10 studies). We are uncertain whether dextrans or crystalloids reduce the need for blood transfusion, as we found little or no difference in blood transfusions (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; 1272 participants, 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence). We found little or no difference in allergic reactions (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 144.93; 739 participants; 4 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No studies measured RRT. Gelatins versus crystalloidsWe found low-certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference between gelatins or crystalloids in mortality: at end of follow-up (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.08; 1698 participants; 6 studies); within 90 days (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; 1388 participants; 1 study); or within 30 days (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.16; 1388 participants; 1 study). Evidence for blood transfusion was very low certainty (3 studies), with a low event rate or data not reported by intervention. Data for RRT were not reported separately for gelatins (1 study). We found little or no difference between groups in allergic reactions (very low-certainty evidence). Albumin or FFP versus crystalloidsWe found moderate-certainty evidence that there is probably little or no difference between using albumin or FFP or using crystalloids in mortality at: end of follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 13,047 participants; 20 studies); within 90 days (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.04; 12,492 participants; 10 studies); or within 30 days (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06; 12,506 participants; 10 studies). We are uncertain whether either fluid type reduces need for blood transfusion (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.80; 290 participants; 3 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Using albumin or FFP versus crystalloids may make little or no difference to the need for RRT (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.27; 3028 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence), or in allergic reactions (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.33; 2097 participants, 1 study; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Using starches, dextrans, albumin or FFP (moderate-certainty evidence), or gelatins (low-certainty evidence), versus crystalloids probably makes little or no difference to mortality. Starches probably slightly increase the need for blood transfusion and RRT (moderate-certainty evidence), and albumin or FFP may make little or no difference to the need for renal replacement therapy (low-certainty evidence). Evidence for blood transfusions for dextrans, and albumin or FFP, is uncertain. Similarly, evidence for adverse events is uncertain. Certainty of evidence may improve with inclusion of three ongoing studies and seven studies awaiting classification, in future updates.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^116575r8]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hydration in heat illness and heat stroke — euhydration is an important factor in reducing hyperthermia, and dehydration predisposes patients to hyperthermia by decreasing sweat rates and increases thermal strain at a given temperature. We recommend that dehydration be minimized in heat illness and, for patients with mild and moderate heat illness, we recommend using oral fluid replacement as first-line therapy for dehydration. For heat stroke, we recommend the use of intravenous fluids, not oral, for rehydration, and any effort to provide hydration in suspected heat stroke should not delay rapid whole-body cooling. As those with exertional heat stroke (EHS) may be volume depleted, we recommend initiating rehydration treatment with 1–2 L of isotonic (0.9% sodium chloride or lactated Ringer's) fluids for adult patients or 20 mL/kg estimated body weight for pediatric patients.

Fluid Therapy

Dehydration can be assumed to be 5%–10% (50–100 mL/kg). As noted above, the degree of dehydration is usually overestimated. The severity of extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction may be indicated by serum urea and hematocrit concentrations. Serum Na concentration is not reliable for determining ECF deficit because of the osmotic effect of hyperglycemia-induced dilutional hyponatremia, and the low Na content of the elevated lipid fraction of the serum in DKA. Corrected Na, ie for normal glucose levels, can be estimated by adding 1.6 mEq to the measured value for each 100 mg/dL blood glucose above normal.
During the first 1–2 hours, 10–20mL/kg 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) should be provided to restore peripheral perfusion.
Maintenance can be calculated as 1000 mL for the first 10 kg body weight + 500 mL for the next 10 kg + 20 mL/kg over 20 kg or 1500 mL/m² body surface area.
The remainder of replacement after the loading dose, based on 5%–10% dehydration, and maintenance, can be distributed over the subsequent 22–23 hours. While many guidelines call for calculating replacement over 48 hours, there is no evidence basis for this being safer or more efficacious. Fluids that have recently been administered orally at home (if not vomited) and parenteral fluids provided in the emergency room or referring institution need to be incorporated into the calculation.
Except for severely ill and very young individuals, oral intake should begin before 24 hours.
While urinary output should be carefully documented, urinary losses should not be added to fluid requirements, except in the presence of HHS.
After initial 0.9% NaCl bolus, rehydration/maintenance should be continued with 0.45% NaCl. The measured Na can increase to the level of the corrected Na during rehydration as glycemia declines and then decline to normal levels if the corrected level was elevated.
Continued use of 0.9% saline after the initial resuscitation may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
To prevent unduly rapid decline in plasma glucose concentration and hypoglycemia, 5% glucose should be added to the IV fluid when the plasma glucose falls to 300 mg/dL (17 mmol/L). An efficient method of providing glucose as needed without long delays entailed by the changing of IV solutions is to have two IV fluid bags connected, one containing 10% dextrose and the appropriate Na and K concentrations and the other with the same salt concentrations but no dextrose, the so-called "two bag system".
K (40 mEq/L or up to 80 mEq/L as needed) can be provided as half potassium chloride (KCl), half potassium phosphate (KPO₄; to replenish low phosphate levels and to decrease the risk of hyperchloremia) or as half KPO₄ and half K acetate (which, like lactate, is converted to bicarbonate to help correct acidosis) after serum K is < 6 mmol/L or urine flow is established. Serum K concentration increases by approximately 0.6 mEq/L for every 0.1 decrease in pH, so that the serum K level does not reflect the large deficit from diuresis and vomiting, ∼5 mEq/kg body weight. Both K and phosphate shift markedly from intracellular to extracellular compartments with acidosis and re-enter cells rapidly with insulin-induced glucose uptake and rehydration.
Bicarbonate administration is not indicated in pediatric DKA. There is no evidence that bicarbonate facilitates metabolic recovery. Restoring circulatory volume will improve tissue perfusion and renal function, increasing organic acid excretion and reversing lactic acidosis. The administration of insulin stops further synthesis of ketoacids and reactivates the Krebs cycle, permitting metabolism of ketoacids, and regeneration of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate therapy may cause paradoxical central nervous system (CNS) acidosis, rapid correction of acidosis can cause hypokalemia, the additional Na can add to hyperosmolality, and alkali therapy can increase hepatic ketone production, potentially slowing recovery.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^111TyiA9]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Maintenance fluid

In providing maintenance fluids, care should be taken to avoid causing tissue edema. This requires limitation of crystalloid administration, which can only really be achieved in the post-resuscitation period. Crystalloid fluid administration is not without hazards. Excessive crystalloid administration is associated with edema of skin, abdominal organs (leading to abdominal compartment syndrome), kidneys (leading to renal compartment syndrome, contributing to acute renal failure) and heart (leading to myocardial dysfunction). The ideal concept would be to use a strategy where the fluid stays intravascular and expands this compartment for longer. However, the design of the recent large studies involving HES showed that ongoing use of these fluids in critically ill patients, beyond initial resuscitation (even in the trauma subgroup analysis), was without benefit and may increase the need for renal replacement therapy.

During the post-resuscitation phase, crystalloids are not only required for fluid supplementation, but also as vehicles for administration of medication, including antibiotics, sedation and inotropes/vasopressors. The fluid required for the administration of these solutions together with those required for nutrition should as a guide not exceed 2 ml/kg/h. 0.9% "normal" saline has often been the fluid of choice for this purpose; however, concerns about both the sodium and chloride load may favor other "balanced" fluids. This fluid can again be substituted for the one designed specifically for maintenance of daily fluid and electrolyte requirements once certainty regarding fluid requirements and responsiveness has been reached. During this period, the solutions infused as medications may also be made more concentrated to limit volume requirements.

It must be remembered that intravenous fluids are drugs providing both electrolytes and water. While calculating these requirements, the patient's medication and feed also need to be incorporated to avoid excessive volumes of each.
