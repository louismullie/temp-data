## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Prevention of clotting in adults during hemodialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for preventing clotting in adults during hemodialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the balance between preventing extracorporeal circuit thrombosis and minimizing bleeding. Then, I should verify the standard first-line agent and its dosing ranges. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic and guideline-based adjustments, including when to use low molecular weight heparin and when to avoid or minimize anticoagulation. After that, I should consider special populations and alternatives like regional citrate or heparin-free strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized dosing approach and state the bottom-line recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: hemodialysis exposes blood to artificial surfaces, activating coagulation and risking circuit clotting, so anticoagulation is usually required, but patients with ESRD also have high bleeding risk, so dosing must be individualized and periodically reassessed as risk changes [^955e99dd] [^c9385f07].

> I will now examine the default agent and its dosing. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) remains the most commonly used anticoagulant for routine hemodialysis; typical practice is a loading bolus of 25–30 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 1,500–2,000 units/hour, with the infusion stopped about 30 minutes before the end of dialysis to limit post-dialysis bleeding, and this aligns with FDA labeling and nephrology society guidance [^2ea3851e] [^ca07b507] [^955e99dd].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for UFH in renal failure. UFH is cleared both hepatically and renally, but its short half-life of roughly 1–1.5 hours allows relatively rapid reversal of effect after stopping the infusion, and protamine can be used for urgent reversal; this pharmacokinetic profile supports UFH as the pragmatic first choice in ESRD, though interindividual variability is substantial and mandates clinical monitoring of circuit clotting and access bleeding [^955e99dd] [^887fe9fe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about LMWH. I initially thought LMWH might be broadly interchangeable with UFH, but I should double-check accumulation risk. LMWHs are predominantly renally cleared and can accumulate in severe CKD, with meta-analytic data showing higher anti-Xa levels and increased major bleeding when standard therapeutic enoxaparin doses are used in patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min; thus, if LMWH is chosen, dose reduction and anti-Xa monitoring are advised, and even then, evidence in chronic hemodialysis is limited and mixed, so UFH remains preferred in many settings [^8b0418b4] [^fb7a9f7f] [^5a170d64].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In patients at increased bleeding risk, I should confirm that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimized; strategies include heparin-free dialysis with high blood flow and periodic saline flushes, regional citrate anticoagulation, heparin-coated dialyzers, or citrate-enriched dialysate, recognizing that citrate requires calcium monitoring and adds complexity, while saline flushes may reduce delivered dose and increase nursing workload [^c9385f07] [^bce357bf] [^d12558be].

> I need to check dosing in obesity and in patients already on systemic anticoagulants. For obesity, standard weight-based UFH dosing is typically used, but clinical response varies and may require titration; for patients on oral anticoagulants, additional heparin is often still needed because INR in the 2–3 range does not reliably prevent intradialytic clotting, and if used, heparin doses are commonly reduced by about 50% or individualized to the lowest effective dose with careful observation of access bleeding and circuit patency [^423d7e2d] [^11112af0].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration. In routine practice, UFH dosing is adjusted empirically based on visual assessment of dialyzer and lines for clotting and on post-dialysis access bleeding; some centers target an aPTT ratio around 1.5–2.0 times baseline or use activated clotting time, but many programs individualize without rigid targets, and periodic platelet counts are prudent to screen for HIT, especially with prolonged heparin exposure [^955e99dd] [^edfb0302].

> But wait, what if UFH is contraindicated or not tolerated. In confirmed or suspected HIT, all heparins must be stopped and non-heparin alternatives such as argatroban, danaparoid, or bivalirudin are recommended for RRT; argatroban is not renally cleared and is a common choice, though it requires aPTT monitoring and can be expensive, while regional citrate is favored when systemic anticoagulation is undesirable and local expertise exists [^cb49e76c] [^21efb231] [^9cd271a2].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a typical 70 kg adult without excess bleeding risk, a reasonable starting regimen is UFH 2,000 units IV bolus followed by 1,500 units/hour, stopping the infusion 30 minutes before the end of dialysis; titrate subsequent sessions based on clotting and access bleeding, with typical adjustments of 500–1,000 units to the bolus and 100–500 units/hour to the infusion, and consider switching to LMWH only if there is a compelling reason and local expertise for monitoring and dose adjustment [^955e99dd] [^2ea3851e].

> I should confirm the bottom line. There is no universally fixed heparin dose for all hemodialysis patients; the most defensible default is UFH 25–30 units/kg bolus with 1,500–2,000 units/hour infusion, individualized to clotting and bleeding observed during and after dialysis, with dose reduction or omission in those at high bleeding risk and consideration of regional citrate or heparin-free strategies when appropriate; evidence quality is limited, so clinical judgment and local protocols should guide care [^2ea3851e] [^955e99dd] [^06c2c63e].

---

For routine hemodialysis, use **UFH 25–30 units/kg IV bolus** [^2ea3851e] followed by **1,500–2,000 units/hour** [^ca07b507] for 3–4 hours, stopping 30 minutes before the end [^955e99dd]. Adjust to patient weight, session length, and bleeding risk; reduce dose or omit in high bleeding risk [^c9385f07]. LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin 0.4–0.6 mg/kg) is an alternative [^69db46db] but may accumulate in renal failure; monitor anti-Xa if used [^edfb0302]. For high bleeding risk, use regional citrate [^ff940091], saline flushes, or heparin-coated dialyzers [^a341ba67].

---

## Unfractionated heparin (UFH) dosing

UFH is the **standard first-line anticoagulant** for hemodialysis due to its short half-life, reversibility with protamine, and extensive clinical experience [^955e99dd].

- **Standard dosing**: 25–30 units/kg IV bolus [^2ea3851e] followed by 1,500–2,000 units/hour [^ca07b507] for 3–4 hours, stopping 30 minutes before the end of dialysis [^955e99dd].
- **Individualization**: Adjust based on patient weight, session duration, hematocrit, and bleeding risk; higher hematocrit may require increased dose [^955e99dd].
- **High bleeding risk**: Reduce dose or omit heparin; consider regional citrate, saline flushes, or heparin-coated dialyzers [^c9385f07] [^bce357bf].

---

## Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dosing

LMWH is an alternative to UFH, offering predictable pharmacokinetics and convenient once-dialysis dosing, but **renal clearance may lead to accumulation** [^477f2b41].

- **Enoxaparin**: 0.4–0.6 mg/kg IV bolus at the start of dialysis; monitor anti-Xa if available [^edfb0302].
- **Tinzaparin**: 75 IU/kg IV bolus at the start of dialysis; monitor anti-Xa if available [^5d4635c0].
- **Accumulation risk**: Use cautiously in severe renal impairment; monitor anti-Xa levels when possible [^8b0418b4].

---

## Regional anticoagulation strategies

Regional anticoagulation confines anticoagulation to the extracorporeal circuit, **reducing systemic bleeding risk** [^ff940091].

| **Anticoagulant** | **Dosing and monitoring** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Citrate | - Infuse into arterial line to achieve post-filter ionized calcium 0.25–0.35 mmol/L <br/> - Requires calcium supplementation | - Effective <br/> - Complex <br/> - Risk of hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis [^ff940091] |
| Prostacyclin (epoprostenol) | - 4–8 ng/kg/min infusion <br/> - Monitor for hypotension | - Effective <br/> - Expensive <br/> - May cause hypotension [^bce357bf] |
| Nafamostat mesylate | - 20–50 mg/h infusion <br/> - Adjust based on clinical response | - Short half-life <br/> - Regional effect <br/> - Limited availability [^32a5b596] |

---

## Anticoagulation in special populations

- **High bleeding risk**: Use regional citrate, saline flushes, or heparin-coated dialyzers; minimize or omit systemic heparin [^c9385f07] [^bce357bf].
- **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Use argatroban, danaparoid, or bivalirudin; avoid all heparins [^cb49e76c] [^21efb231].
- **Pediatric patients**: Weight-based UFH dosing with careful monitoring; LMWH data are limited [^c9385f07].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **UFH**: Monitor aPTT or ACT when available; adjust based on clotting and bleeding [^955e99dd].
- **LMWH**: Monitor anti-Xa levels when available, especially in renal impairment [^edfb0302].
- **Clinical assessment**: Adjust dosing based on visual clotting, access bleeding, and patient-specific factors [^955e99dd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Anticoagulant** | **Standard dosing** | **Adjustments** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| UFH | 25–30 units/kg bolus + 1,500–2,000 units/hour | - Weight <br/> - Hematocrit <br/> - Bleeding risk | - First-line <br/> - Reversible |
| Enoxaparin | 0.4–0.6 mg/kg IV bolus | Anti-Xa monitoring | Accumulation in renal failure |
| Tinzaparin | 75 IU/kg IV bolus | Anti-Xa monitoring | Accumulation in renal failure |
| Citrate | Regional infusion to post-filter Ca 0.25–0.35 mmol/L | Calcium supplementation | Complex, effective |
| Prostacyclin | 4–8 ng/kg/min infusion | Hypotension monitoring | Expensive, effective |

---

The standard hemodialysis anticoagulation is **UFH 25–30 units/kg bolus** [^2ea3851e] with **1,500–2,000 units/hour** [^ca07b507], stopping 30 minutes early; individualize by weight, session length, and bleeding risk, and use alternatives such as LMWH, regional citrate, or heparin-free strategies when indicated [^955e99dd].

Background

Haemodialysis (HD) requires safe and effective anticoagulation to prevent clot formation within the extracorporeal circuit during dialysis treatments to enable adequate dialysis and minimise adverse events, including major bleeding. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may provide a more predictable dose, reliable anticoagulant effects and be simpler to administer than unfractionated heparin (UFH) for HD anticoagulation, but may accumulate in the kidneys and lead to bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation strategies (including both heparin and non-heparin drugs) for long-term HD in people with kidney failure. Any intervention preventing clotting within the extracorporeal circuit without establishing anticoagulation within the patient, such as regional citrate, citrate enriched dialysate, heparin-coated dialysers, pre-dilution haemodiafiltration (HDF), and saline flushes were also included.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to November 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled studies (quasi-RCTs) evaluating anticoagulant agents administered during HD treatment in adults and children with kidney failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. Treatment effects were estimated using random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE).

Main Results

We included 113 studies randomising 4535 participants. The risk of bias in each study was adjudicated as high or unclear for most risk domains. Compared to UFH, LMWH had uncertain effects on extracorporeal circuit thrombosis (3 studies, 91 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.42; I² = 8%; low certainty evidence), while major bleeding and minor bleeding were not adequately reported. Regional citrate anticoagulation may lower the risk of minor bleeding compared to UFH (2 studies, 82 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). No studies reported data comparing regional citrate to UFH on risks of extracorporeal circuit thrombosis and major bleeding. The effects of very LMWH, danaparoid, prostacyclin, direct thrombin inhibitors, factor XI inhibitors or heparin-grafted membranes were uncertain due to insufficient data. The effects of different LMWH, different doses of LMWH, and the administration of LMWH anticoagulants using inlet versus outlet bloodline or bolus versus infusion were uncertain. Evidence to compare citrate to another citrate or control was scant. The effects of UFH compared to no anticoagulant therapy or different doses of UFH were uncertain. Death, dialysis vascular access outcomes, blood transfusions, measures of anticoagulation effect, and costs of interventions were rarely reported. No studies evaluated the effects of treatment on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospital admissions. Adverse events were inconsistently and rarely reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Anticoagulant strategies, including UFH and LMWH, have uncertain comparative risks on extracorporeal circuit thrombosis, while major bleeding and minor bleeding were not adequately reported. Regional citrate may decrease minor bleeding, but the effects on major bleeding and extracorporeal circuit thrombosis were not reported. Evidence supporting clinical decision-making for different forms of anticoagulant strategies for HD is of low and very low certainty, as available studies have not been designed to measure treatment effects on important clinical outcomes.

### Anticoagulation in chronic hemodialysis: progress toward an optimal approach [^0f536660]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Appropriate anticoagulation for hemodialysis (HD) requires a subtle balance between under- and over-heparinization to prevent extracorporeal circuit (ECC) clotting and bleeding, respectively. We discuss five key issues relating to anticoagulation therapy for chronic HD in adults following a review of relevant literature published since 2002: (i) options for standardization of anticoagulation in HD settings. The major nephrology societies have issued low evidence level recommendations on this subject. Interventional studies have generally investigated novel low-molecular weight heparins and provided data on safety of dosing regimens that cannot readily be extrapolated to clinical practice; (ii) identification of clinical and biological parameters to aid individualization of anticoagulation treatment. We find that use of clinical and biological monitoring of anticoagulation during HD sessions is currently not clearly defined in routine clinical practice; (iii) role of ECC elements (dialysis membrane and blood lines), dialysis modalities, and blood flow in clotting development; (iv) options to reduce or suppress systemic heparinization during HD sessions. Alternative strategies have been investigated, especially when the routine mode of anticoagulation was not suitable in patients at high risk of bleeding or was contraindicated; (v) optimization of anticoagulation therapy for the individual patient. We conclude by proposing a standardized approach to deliver anticoagulation treatment for HD based on an individualized prescription prepared according to the patient's profile and needs.

### Use and safety of unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation during maintenance hemodialysis [^9d7ae7db]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is essential to hemodialysis, and unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the most commonly used anticoagulant in the United States. However, there is no universally accepted standard for its administration in long-term hemodialysis. Dosage schedules vary and include weight-based protocols and low-dose protocols for those at high risk of bleeding, as well as regional anticoagulation with heparin and heparin-coated dialyzers. Adjustments are based largely on clinical signs of under- and overanticoagulation. Risks of UFH use include bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, anaphylaxis, and possibly bone mineral disease, hyperkalemia, and catheter-associated sepsis. Alternative anticoagulants include low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, heparinoids, and citrate. Anticoagulant-free hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis also are potential substitutes. However, some of these alternative treatments are not as available as or are more costly than UFH, are dependent on country and health care system, and present dosing challenges. When properly monitored, UFH is a relatively safe and economical choice for anticoagulation in long-term hemodialysis for most patients.

### What are the anticoagulation options for intermittent hemodialysis? [^dd96ef5b]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Prevention of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit was one of the major hurdles that had to be overcome to enable the expansion of routine outpatient hemodialysis to free-standing satellite centers and the home. Unfractionated heparin, the anticoagulant of choice for many years, is now being replaced by low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) in an expanding number of countries. This trend is attributable to the ease and convenience of the administration of LMWHs coupled with their reliability and predictability of dosing. However, the choice of which LMWH to use depends on the duration and frequency of the dialysis sessions. For patients who are allergic to heparin or have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, alternative anticoagulants — the direct thrombin inhibitors and heparinoids — are now available. These agents either have short half-lives (and therefore need to be delivered by infusions), or prolonged half-lives, which allows simple bolus administration, but increases the risk of drug accumulation, overdosage and hemorrhage. In patients at risk of bleeding, regional anticoagulants enable anticoagulation to be limited to the extracorporeal circuit. Prostanoids and nafamostat mesilate are expensive regional anticoagulants, and citrate infusions add complexity to the procedure. A citrate-based dialyzate has now been introduced that might enable heparin-free dialysis or reduce systemic anticoagulant requirements.

### Heparin sodium injection (Heparin sodium) [^2ea3851e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.8 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from heparin sodium injection to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

2.9 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.10 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Pharmacodynamics of unfractionated heparin during and after a hemodialysis session [^46a8b6c1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-Xa activity is used as a clinical guide to anticoagulation with heparin, but heparin dosing regimens for hemodialysis were established before anti-Xa assays were developed; thus, the optimal regimen for heparin dosing was not determined. The aim is to confirm the interesting characteristics of unfractionated heparin pharmacokinetics for hemodialysis anticoagulation, provide insight into the hemorrhagic risk of hemodialysis patients, and determine the dose of unfractionated heparin and its adequate mode of administration.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study of the pharmacokinetics of unfractionated heparin performed during and after a 4-hour midweek hemodialysis session.

Setting & Participants

35 long-term hemodialysis patients at the Sainte-Marguerite Unit of the Marseille University Hospital, Marseille, France.

Predictor

Hemodialysis anticoagulation with continuous unfractionated heparin infusion at a dose of 50 IU/kg/session (25 IU/kg/h during the first hour, 12.5 IU/kg during the second and third hours, and stop during the last hour).

Outcome & Measurements

Anti-Xa activity was monitored during the 10 hours after the beginning of the hemodialysis session. Levels of 0.3 to 0.7 IU/mL are considered sufficient for anticoagulation. Pharmacokinetics was determined by using a population approach (nonlinear mixed-effects modeling). The final model and corresponding parameter values (including interindividual and residual variability) were used to simulate 1,000 replicates.

Results

No case of clotting was recorded. A pharmacokinetic model with 1 compartment and first-order elimination best fitted the data. Terminal half-life was 54 minutes. Median anti-Xa activities were 0.55 IU/mL at peak, 0.25 IU/mL at end of the 4-hour session, and less than 0.1 IU/mL at 90 minutes after the session. We simulated a continuous infusion of the dose of 50 IU/kg for 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. Peak values were 1.1, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.5 IU/mL, respectively. Values at the end of the session were 0.12, 0.18, 0.3, and 0.5 IU/mL, respectively. Values became less than 0.1 IU/mL at 15, 60, 105, and 120 minutes after the session, respectively.

Limitations

Interindividual variability in unfractionated heparin pharmacokinetics.

Conclusions

Unfractionated heparin administered by means of a 3-hour continuous infusion for hemodialysis anticoagulation provided an efficient and safe effect that quickly disappeared after the end of the session.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^9cd271a2]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Argatroban during renal replacement therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — it is not renally cleared and dialytic clearance by high-flux membranes is considered clinically insignificant. Evidence includes one small prospective, dose-finding study in continuous renal replacement therapy (n = 30) and a secondary analysis of historical controlled treatment studies (47 patients) across seven different methods of renal replacement therapy. The incidence of new thrombosis (0%-4%) and major bleeding (0%-6%) while on argatroban in these studies was low, and an RCT during intermittent hemodialysis in patients without HIT (n = 13) showed similar results.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting of extracorporeal circuits during continuous renal replacement therapy [^ff940091]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major comorbidity in hospitalised patients. Patients with severe AKI require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) when they are haemodynamically unstable. CRRT is prescribed assuming it is delivered over 24 hours. However, it is interrupted when the extracorporeal circuits clot and the replacement is required. The interruption may impair the solute clearance as it causes under dosing of CRRT. To prevent the circuit clotting, anticoagulation drugs are frequently used.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for preventing clotting in the extracorporeal circuits during CRRT.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 12 September 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs or cluster RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of pharmacological interventions to prevent clotting of extracorporeal circuits during CRRT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted and assessed independently by two authors. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary review outcomes were major bleeding, successful prevention of clotting (no need of circuit change in the first 24 hours for any reason), and death. Evidence certainty was determined using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

A total of 34 completed studies (1960 participants) were included in this review. We identified seven ongoing studies which we plan to assess in a future update of this review. No included studies were free from risk of bias. We rated 30 studies for performance bias and detection bias as high risk of bias. We rated 18 studies for random sequence generation,ÃÂ ÃÂ six studies for the allocation concealment, three studies for performance bias, three studies for detection bias,ÃÂ nine studies for attrition bias,ÃÂ 14 studies for selective reporting and nine studies for the other potential source of bias, as having low risk of bias. We identified eight studies (581 participants) that compared citrate with unfractionated heparin (UFH). Compared to UFH, citrate probably reduces major bleeding (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.62; moderate certainty evidence) and probably increases successful prevention of clotting (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.87; moderate certainty evidence). Citrate may have little or no effect on death at 28 days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, moderate certainty evidence). Citrate versus UFH may reduce the number of participants who drop out of treatment due to adverse events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.49; low certainty evidence). Compared to UFH, citrate may make little or no difference to the recovery of kidney function (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; low certainty evidence). Compared to UFH, citrate may reduceÃÂ thrombocytopenia (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.03; low certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether citrate reduces a cost to health care services because of inadequate data. For low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus UFH, six studies (250 participants) were identified. Compared to LMWH, UFH may reduce major bleeding (0.58, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.58; low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether UFH versus LMWH reduces death at 28 days or leads to successful prevention of clotting. Compared to LMWH, UFH may reduce the number of patient dropouts from adverse events (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 3.53; low certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether UFH versus LMWH leads to the recovery of kidney function because no included studies reported this outcome. It was uncertain whether UFH versus LMWH leads to thrombocytopenia. It was uncertain whether UFH reduces a cost to health care services because of inadequate data. For the comparison of UFH to no anticoagulation, one study (10 participants) was identified. It is uncertain whether UFH compare to no anticoagulation leads to more major bleeding. It is uncertain whether UFH improves successful prevention of clotting in the first 24 hours, death at 28 days, the number of patient dropouts due to adverse events, recovery of kidney function, thrombocytopenia, or cost to health care services because no study reported these outcomes. For the comparison ofÃÂ citrate to no anticoagulation,ÃÂ no completed study was identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently,ÃÂ available evidence does not support the overall superiority of any anticoagulant to another. Compared to UFH, citrate probably reduces major bleeding and prevents clotting and probably has little or no effect on death at 28 days. For other pharmacological anticoagulation methods, there is no available data showing overall superiority to citrate or no pharmacological anticoagulation. Further studies are needed to identify patient populations in which CRRT should commence with no pharmacological anticoagulation or with citrate.

### Revised algorithm for heparin anticoagulation during continuous renal replacement therapy [^d4f60bab]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Premature clotting of the circuit is the most common reason for unplanned interruptions in renal replacement therapy (RRT) and discrepancies between the prescribed and delivered dose of RRT. The recent guideline from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) working group recommended citrate as the first-line anticoagulant for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). For patients with contraindications to citrate, either unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin was recommended.

Worldwide, unfractionated heparin is the most commonly used anticoagulant to maintain circuit patency. The potential risks including bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are well known. In 2010, we designed an algorithm to enable the nursing staff to manage heparin during CRRT effectively and safely. In response to new knowledge and changes in clinical practice, we have revised the algorithm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Algorithm for heparin anticoagulation during CRRT. APTTr activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, CRRT continuous renal replacement therapy, HIT heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, INR international normalised ratio

The main principles of the algorithm are maintained as follows:
The indication for heparin should be reviewed daily. Heparin should be avoided in patients with an increased bleeding risk.
Unfractionated heparin is administered via the circuit unless the patient needs systemic anticoagulation for other reasons.
The dose of heparin is based on actual body weight.
Dosing of heparin is "individualised" depending on the patient's risk of bleeding and previous circuit life.
There is no target activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (APTTr) but APTTr ≤ 2 is maintained to prevent overanticoagulation.
Nonpharmacological methods should be considered regularly to maintain circuit patency.

The main changes to the algorithm are the following:
We previously suggested adding heparin to the circuit priming solution before the blood is in contact with plastic surfaces to coat the surfaces of the filter membrane and circuit tubing. It has since been brought to our attention that a randomised controlled cross-over study in 11 patients on CRRT showed no beneficial effect of heparin rinse on the thrombogenicity of the circuit, complement activation or blood leukocyte counts. Therefore, instead of using 10,000 IU heparin in 1 l of 0.9% saline to prime a circuit with total volume ~270 ml, we suggest administering a bolus of 2500 IU heparin on connection.
Following the withdrawal of activated protein C, a reference to this drug has been removed from the algorithm.

The systemic effects of heparin are a potential drawback of CRRT. We hope that our proposed algorithm reduces this risk and allows effective and safe anticoagulation.

3.2.2 Monitoring the treatment with heparins

Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)‐based dose adjustment is still recommended for UFH to achieve an optimal therapeutic level (aPTT range 1.5‐2.0). 16 For LMWH anti‐Xa level monitoring calibrated specifically for each therapeutic agent is compulsory in CKD stages 4 and 5. The initial monitoring is performed 2 to 4 hours before and postdose. Regular twice a week monitoring could be useful. 16 Underdosage is defined as peak anti‐Xa levels < 0.5 IU/mL. Optimal therapeutic levels are 0.1 to 0.3 IU/mL for prophylactic dosing and 0.4 to 1 IU/mL for therapeutic dosing. 16 In the absence of clear guidelines and clinical trial‐based indications, adapted local protocols could be useful. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia is difficult to control in ESRD since fondaparinux is contraindicated. Another essential issue is the need to split the total LMWH dose into two equal doses in patients at high hemorrhage risk. This recommendation is derived from the Cochrane databases, showing that single‐dose regimens are not more effective, rather more convenient for the patient. 33

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dd3affb0]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The potential publication bias detected must be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Although the use of objective searching methods we could not eliminate this bias. Because of the lack of clear and consistent definition of major and minor bleeding in the retrieved studies, we opted to evaluate the risk of total bleeding. However, it would have been interesting to measure the risk of hemorrhage according to its severity, where major bleeding has a greater impact on the patient but also on the type of care needed. A standardized definition of major and minor bleeding needs to be used in future investigations; such definition is already provided by the subcommittee on control of anticoagulation of the scientific and standardization committee of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis.

The random effect model cannot compensate for the entire heterogeneity found between studies. High heterogeneity could be caused by multiple factors. The inclusion of different study designs in our review. We believe that the crossover and parallel-design should not be different for the measured outcomes in this context. Because of the small number of trials, it was not possible to analyze LMWH separately. LMWH have different pharmacokinetics and kidney failure does not alter similarly their elimination. For instance, enoxaparin might seem safe when there is clear evidence of its bioaccumulation. Finally, the trials used different doses and had variable follow-up time. The dosage, the use of low or high flux dialysis, types of membranes, hemodiafiltration and hemodialysis procedures, all these factors would contribute to the measured heterogeneity.

4.2 What we do not know

Heparin‐based anticoagulation is challenging in patients undergoing dialysis. Poor anticoagulation can affect the quality of dialysis session. Patients undergoing dialysis frequently receive OACs or platelet antiaggregants. That is why systemic anticoagulation becomes a sensitive matter in long‐term hemodialysis. UFH is used according to a classic protocol, while LMWHs are administered as a bolus dose at the start of dialysis and heparin‐like molecules are administered in particular situations. The attitude towards LMWH use in hemodialysis patients is variable. The FDA has not approved their use in the United States, while other local guidelines either recommend them, or do not provide clear indications. 39 According to several small‐scale studies and a meta‐analysis published in 2004, LMWHs appear to be safe and as effective as UFH. For these reasons, a protocol for the prospective monitoring and use of heparin‐based anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients with VTE was initiated in 2015 and is still ongoing. 39

Oral anticoagulation. Although OACs are necessary in severe CKD and ESRD, evidence is inconsistent, often of unsatisfactory quality, and it draws attention to the potentiation of hemorrhagic risks. There are available data for warfarin, but data for DOACs are entirely inconclusive. In patients with AF, the existing guidelines have a different approach. The American guideline recommends warfarin even in dialysis patients with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 2 and INR between 2 and 3 (class IIa, LOE B) and does not allow the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in ESRD and dialysis patients. Equally important is the recommendation to initiate therapy after a strictly individualized evaluation of the risk‐benefit ratio. 19 The ESC guideline recommends the preferential use of DOACs in patients with eGFR 5 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and does not provide information for dialysis. For CKD requiring renal transplantation, there are no randomized trials and thus DOACs should be administered according to eGFR also considering the possible interactions with the immunosuppressant medication. 18 Both guidelines highlight how difficult it is to provide standard recommendations in the absence of randomized controlled trials. 9

### Danaparoid use for haemodialysis in a morbidly obese patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-need for a higher than recommended weight-based dosing [^520aa0eb]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

What Is Known and Objective

Heparin is widely used to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during haemodialysis (HD). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially devastating immune mediated adverse drug reaction caused by the emergence of antibodies that activate platelets in the presence of heparin, leading to a pro-thrombotic state. Danaparoid is an alternative anticoagulant used in patients on HD with HIT but its dosing recommendations in obese patients on HD are relatively scarce.

Case Summary

We report a case of a 48-year-old morbidly obese patient who received weight-based dosing of danaparoid for HD with monitoring of anti-Xa activity. However, despite the patient's anti-Xa level being within the therapeutic range at various time points, the circuit lines kept clotting during HD.

What Is New and Conclusion

The report provides evidence that the manufacturer's recommendations on dosing danaparoid based on body weight may lead to sub-optimal therapeutic benefit and highlight the need for higher than recommended weight-based dosing in obese individuals on dialysis.

### The effect of citrate dialysate on intradialytic heparin dose in haemodialysis patients: study design of a randomised controlled trial [^0fb4d516]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Study protocol

After enrolment, each patient's dose of intradialytic heparin is minimised during a two-week run-in period (Fig. 1) using study protocol (Table 1) which is based on a standardised visual clotting score. The visual clotting score is quantified by inspecting the venous chamber and all four quadrants of the dialyser at the end of the HD session (0: clear dialyser/no clots; 1: few strands/small clots; 2: half clotted; 3: three-quarters clotted; 4: completely clotted, unable to return blood) (Table 1). The heparin dose is reduced to reach a target visual clotting score of 2, then increased slightly and maintained, to achieve the lowest possible dose required to prevent clotting (Table 1). The CHD during the last HD session of the run-in period is considered to be the patient's baseline heparin dose. Patients still requiring intradialytic heparin after the two-week run-in period, and who still meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, are randomised to one of two treatment sequences (Fig. 1). For sequence 1, patients undergo six HD sessions over two weeks with AD (control), followed by six HD sessions over two weeks with CD (intervention). For sequence 2, patients undergo six HD sessions over two weeks with CD (intervention), followed by two weeks of AD (control) (Fig. 1). Patients begin each study phase (AD and CD) with their baseline intradialytic heparin dose, determined at the end of the run-in period. Nurses subsequently adjust intradialytic heparin dose per protocol (Table 1) during each HD session of each study phase. At the end of the first study phase (two weeks), a 68-h washout period ensures no potential for a carry-over effect. After the wash-out period, patients cross-over to the other treatment for the next two weeks beginning again with their baseline heparin dose (Fig. 1). A two-week duration for each strategy is chosen to ensure adequate time to attain the minimum required heparin dose.

### Does warfarin safely prevent clotting of hemodialysis catheters? a review of efficacy and safety [^f3503dfd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the efficacy and safety of warfarin to prevent tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) thrombosis in the hemodialysis population. Literature searches of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were performed until April 1, 2007. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional publications. Minidose (1 mg/day) warfarin is ineffective in preventing TCC malfunction. Warfarin titrated to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.0, 1.8–2.5, and 2.0–3.0 was found to decrease the rate of thrombosis in selected patients. Early initiation of warfarin after catheter placement may be advantageous. Despite evidence of efficacy, safety is of greater concern. There were no major bleeds reported at an INR range of 1.5–2.5 specifically in catheter studies. However, an increase in major bleeding episodes has been reported with INR ranging from 1.4 to 3.0 in patients receiving warfarin for other indications (e.g., graft patency or cardiovascular indications). There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of warfarin to prevent TCC thrombosis in all patients, primarily because of safety concerns. There is an increased risk of bleeding associated with warfarin use in the hemodialysis population. If a decision is made to use warfarin on a case-by-case basis, literature to date suggests that an INR target of 1.5–2.5 should suffice. Bleeding must be monitored carefully in this population, especially in patients using antiplatelet medications for concurrent conditions.

### Development of a predictive model for nafamostat mesylate dosing in hemodialysis [^32a5b596]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Anticoagulation is essential during HD to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is commonly administered during HD in patients who are not at heightened risk of bleeding or heparin allergies. In patients with a high risk of bleeding, systemic anticoagulation is often contraindicated, necessitating alternative strategies, such as maintaining a high blood flow rate, intermittent saline flushing, reducing dialysis duration, or using heparin-coated dialyzers.

Nevertheless, in patients who are at a high risk of both bleeding and extracorporeal circuit clotting, these measures alone may not ensure adequate dialysis. Although no standardized approach exists for such cases, several alternative anticoagulation methods have been proposed, including low-dose heparin, sodium citrate-containing dialysate, epoprostenol, and regional citrate anticoagulation. Among them, nafamostat is a widely used alternative anticoagulant in South Korea and Japan.

In the 2021 Korean Society of Nephrology hemodialysis guidelines, nafamostat is conditionally recommended (Grade B) as an alternative to heparin for anticoagulation in patients undergoing HD at high risk of bleeding. However, the guidelines also state that the level of evidence supporting this recommendation is low owing to the lack of large-scale randomized trials.

Nafamostat has been investigated as an anticoagulant during HD in patients at a high risk of bleeding since the 1980s. However, in the absence of randomized controlled trials, no established guidelines exist for optimal dosing. According to the approved drug labeling, nafamostat is administered at 20–50 mg/h, with dose adjustments made based on clinical symptoms. Clinical data suggest an average dose of 35 mg/h.

The findings of a few previous studies examining nafamostat dosing during HD are summarized as follows.

### Considerations for systemic anticoagulation in ESRD [^4a925a4d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

In the setting of end-stage kidney disease, the incidence and risk for thrombotic events are increased and use of anticoagulants is common. The incidence of bleeding, however, is also a frequent issue and creates additional challenges in the management of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with end-stage renal disease are typically excluded from large clinical trials exploring the use of anticoagulants, which limits our knowledge of optimal management approaches. Furthermore, varying degrees of renal failure in addition to conditions that alter the pharmacokinetics of various anticoagulants or pharmacodynamic response may warrant alternative approaches to dosing. This review will explore systemic chronic anticoagulation therapy in the setting of chronic kidney disease where hemodialysis is required. Agents discussed include vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, oral factor Xa antagonists, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Clinical challenges, approaches to dosing regimens, and tools for measuring responses and reversal will be explored.

### The effect of citrate dialysate on intradialytic heparin dose in haemodialysis patients: study design of a randomised controlled trial [^458f59d0]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin is the most common anticoagulant used in haemodialysis (HD), although it has many potential adverse effects. Citrate dialysate (CD) has an anticoagulant effect which may allow reduction in cumulative heparin dose (CHD) compared to standard acetate dialysate (AD).

Methods

This double-blinded, randomised, cross-over trial of chronic haemodialysis patients determines if CD allows reduction in CHD during HD compared with AD. After enrolment, intradialytic heparin is minimised during a two-week run-in period using a standardised protocol based on a visual clotting score. Patients still requiring intradialytic heparin after the run-in period are randomised to two weeks of HD with AD followed by two weeks of CD (Sequence 1) or two weeks of HD with CD followed by two weeks of AD (Sequence 2). The primary outcome is the change in CHD with CD compared with AD. Secondary outcomes include metabolic and haemodynamic parameters, and dialysis adequacy.

Discussion

This randomised controlled trial will determine the impact of CD compared with AD on CHD during HD.

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^00b6c345]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the available data does not allow to determine which heparin form is safer when used for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis. The risk of hemorrhage was not statistically significant when LMWH was compared to UFH, and lipid levels remained comparable or lower with LMWH. As for osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia, the data does not allow making a reliable comparison with UFH. The potential sources of bias discussed earlier and the quality level of the retrieved studies hinder the interpretation of observed results. LMWH have been used in hemodialysis for many years, but we are still in dire need of trials addressing the aforementioned limitations. Future studies need to use larger sample size during a sufficiently long follow-up and a clearer definition of the outcome measured to make their results usable and interpretable. Anticoagulation is mandatory for most patients undergoing hemodialysis treatments, and the choice of anticoagulation agent must be supported by stronger evidence.

### Heparin-coated dialyzer membranes: is non-inferiority good enough? [^a341ba67]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence on the optimal anticoagulation regimen for hemodialysis in patients at high bleeding risk is scarce. The HepZero study is the first large multinational study comparing two different anticoagulation strategies to avoid systemic heparinization. The use of a heparin-coated dialysis membrane proved to be non-inferior to saline infusion. Superiority of either treatment, however, could not be demonstrated. These findings challenge current guidelines but equally raise questions on the choice of either strategy as compared with regional citrate anticoagulation.

### Prevention of catheter lumen occlusion with rT-PA versus heparin (pre-CLOT): study protocol of a randomized trial [^fe7ed573]. BMC Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In Canada approximately 5 to 40% of hemodialysis patients utilize a central venous catheter for vascular access for hemodialysis. The major complications of these catheters include infection, thrombosis, and poor blood flow resulting in inadequate hemodialysis. Approximately fifty percent of hemodialysis catheters fail within one year of insertion, with up to two-thirds secondary to thrombosis.

Inter-dialytic catheter locking with variable concentrations of heparin, usually based on the catheter priming volume, is commonly undertaken to prevent thrombosis. The evidence to guide the use of specific locking solutions, including the strength and amount of solution, is limited. Even the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (K-DOQI) guidelines for vascular access do not provide recommendations for the locking of catheters to prevent thrombosis during the interdialytic period.

The critical care medicine and oncology literature have provided some evidence for the use of prophylactic anticoagulant catheter locking solutions to decrease catheter-related thrombosis. While a meta-analysis suggested heparin reduced thrombus formation, the heparin dose utilized was extremely variable, ranging from 5,000 units every 12 hours to a continuous infusion of 1 unit/mL (combined with an infusion of total parenteral nutrition). The generalizability of these results to hemodialysis catheters which are larger in size, utilized for longer periods, and require a solution to remain in-situ for up to 72 hours, is questionable.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^955e99dd]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Platelet activation in the extracorporeal circuit accelerates thrombin generation via the intrinsic coagulation pathway, so that anticoagulation is usually required to prevent thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin is used as the standard anticoagulant worldwide in view of its proven efficacy, ease of use and long safety record unless the patient has recent or active bleeding, thrombocytopenia, heparin allergy or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

With a mean half-life of 1.5 hours, heparin is usually administered as a loading dose of 1000–2000 IU followed by a continuous infusion of 500-1500U/h that is discontinued approximately 30 minutes before the end of the dialysis session. Monitoring can be performed by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (aPTTr) or the whole-blood activated clotting time aiming for around 150% of pre-dialysis or centre normal values. But in practice the bolus dose, infusion rate and stopping times are adjusted empirically, according to clot formation in the dialysis circuit, and the time for needle sites to stop bleeding. Heparin dose may need to be increased with higher haematocrit, or reduced / withdrawn in patients at risk of haemorrhage, those with thrombocytopenia or on long term anticoagulation.

Alternatively, a low molecular weight heparin may be used, having a longer half-life, given as a single 'arterial limb' bolus at the start of dialysis. Although monitoring can be performed using anti-Xa activity, these are not always available and laboratory testing correlates less directly with clinical effect, so as with unfractionated heparin, dose adjustment is usually empirical, but larger or repeated doses may be needed depending on convective clearance and session length, and reduced doses for those at risk of haemorrhage. Several systematic reviews comparing low-molecular-weight with unfractionated heparin have found no difference in the incidence of bleeding complications, post-dialysis access bleeding, or thrombosis of the extracorporeal circuit. With its convenience for nursing staff, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin is becoming more common in Europe.

### Alternative methods of anticoagulation for dialysis-dependent patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^35c00f4d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients who are continually exposed to heparin are at risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin-induced antibodies have been reported to occur in 0–12% of hemodialysis (HD) patients. The diagnosis or suspicion of HIT in this patient population requires careful confirmation of the diagnosis and substitution of heparin with an alternate anticoagulant for dialysis. Alternate agents such as the direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudin and argatroban) are available, but careful dosing and monitoring of the anticoagulant effect are required. Despite careful dosing, hemorrhagic complications have occurred with these agents. Unfortunately there are limited options for treatment of hemorrhagic complications and no specific antidotes are available for the direct thrombin inhibitors. In this report the currently available alternatives to heparin for dialysis, including dosing and monitoring recommendations, are reviewed.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) requiring renal replacement therapy — clinical guidance includes that hemodialysis without anticoagulant therapy is not recommended in acute or subacute HIT. There are no head-to-head studies and there is no direct evidence supporting one alternative nonheparin anticoagulant over another in patients with acute HIT who require renal replacement therapy. In patients with acute or subacute HIT who require renal replacement therapy, we suggest the use of argatroban or danaparoid over other nonheparin anticoagulants (Grade 2C). Remarks note that the cost of argatroban may be prohibitive at some clinical centers and we further suggest that if the prothrombotic state of HIT appears to have resolved (as seen by normalization of the platelet count), saline flushes during dialysis would be a reasonable option; there has been more experience with danaparoid than argatroban, while argatroban is supported by prospective data and pharmacokinetics.

### Development of a predictive model for nafamostat mesylate dosing in hemodialysis [^11112af0]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the mean nafamostat dose across 419 dialysis sessions was 22.05 ± 6.68 mg/h, which was generally lower than the doses reported in previous studies. However, clotting severe enough to interrupt dialysis occurred in only 10 sessions (2%).

In our analysis, the top four variables that significantly influenced nafamostat dosage were oral anticoagulant use, dry body weight, age, and hemoglobin level. Among these, oral anticoagulant use had the strongest impact as an independent factor, serving as a significant dose-reducing variable for nafamostat (coefficient: −14.20, 95% CI − 18.28 to − 10.12, P < 0.001). Dose adjustments for heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) have been explored in several small-scale studies involving patients undergoing HD receiving oral anticoagulants. Under certain conditions, some studies have suggested that HD can be performed without additional heparin when using standard oral anticoagulants with an international normalized ratio of 2–3. Other studies proposed that heparin or LMWH dosing should be reduced to less than 50% of the standard dose in patients receiving oral anticoagulants. The European Best Practice Guidelines recommend individualized heparin dose reduction in patients taking oral anticoagulants to ensure that a minimal effective dose is required to prevent thrombosis.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: consensus, controversies, and challenges [^4364a11f]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The last 50 years have witnessed a multitude of publications evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of many different thromboprophylaxis interventions. There is widespread consensus that thromboprophylaxis safely reduces morbidity and mortality. More than 25 evidence-based guidelines, published since 1986, also recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in the majority of hospitalized patients. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is recognized as a key safety priority for hospitals. Some of the remaining areas of controversy that will be discussed in this paper include the role of individual risk assessments to determine thrombosis risk and prophylaxis, replacement of low-dose heparin by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the optimal duration of prophylaxis, the role of combined thromboprophylaxis modalities, the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis with regional analgesia, the use of LMWHs in chronic renal insufficiency, and the emerging role of new oral anticoagulants as thromboprophylactic agents. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, rates of thromboprophylaxis use remain far from optimal. Successful implementation strategies to bridge this knowledge:care gap are the most important current challenges in this area. These strategies must be multifaceted, utilizing local, systems-based approaches as well as legislation and incentives that reinforce best practices.

Renal replacement therapy — acute heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (Recommendation 6.1): In patients with acute HIT who are receiving renal replacement therapy and require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the dialysis circuitry, the ASH guideline panel suggests treatment with argatroban, danaparoid, or bivalirudin rather than other non-heparin anticoagulants (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). The choice of agent may be influenced by drug factors, patient factors, and clinician experience. Evidence was from nonrandomized studies without randomized controlled trials. Among 97 patients receiving argatroban, 18 deaths were reported with none the result of thrombosis; one patient underwent amputation and 3 developed thrombotic events, major bleeding occurred in 3 of 50 treatment courses in one study and in 2 of 30 patients in another, and one patient required co-intervention with aspirin. Among 115 patients receiving danaparoid during hemodialysis, 8 nonfatal thromboembolic events occurred (2 required amputation), 28 died, 11 had nonfatal major bleeding events, 7 had minor bleeding events, 11 had nonfatal adverse events, and 14 had fatal adverse events. Among 3 patients who received fondaparinux, 3 developed thromboses that were managed by increasing the dose. Among 114 patients who received bivalirudin during dialysis, 13 experienced major bleeding events; among 114 patients who received bivalirudin during dialysis, no amputations were reported, 7 had new thromboembolic events, and 32 died.

### The contact activation inhibitor AB023 in heparin-free hemodialysis: results of a randomized phase 2 clinical trial [^42004e2a]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic hemodialysis have repeated blood exposure to artificial surfaces that can trigger clot formation within the hemodialysis circuit. Dialyzer clotting can lead to anemia despite erythropoietin and iron supplementation. Unfractionated heparin prevents clotting during hemodialysis, but it is not tolerated by all patients. Although heparin-free dialysis is performed, intradialytic blood entrapment can be problematic. To address this issue, we performed a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study comparing AB023, a unique antibody that binds factor XI (FXI) and blocks its activation by activated FXII, but not by thrombin, to placebo in 24 patients with ESRD undergoing heparin-free hemodialysis. Patients were randomized to receive a single predialysis dose of AB023 (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, and safety and preliminary efficacy were compared with placebo and observations made prior to dosing within each treatment arm. AB023 administration was not associated with impaired hemostasis or other drug-related adverse events. Occlusive events requiring hemodialysis circuit exchange were less frequent and levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and C-reactive protein were lower after AB023 administration compared with data collected prior to dosing. AB023 also reduced potassium and iron entrapment in the dialyzers, consistent with less blood accumulation within the dialyzers. We conclude that despite the small sample size, inhibition of contact activation-induced coagulation with AB023 was well tolerated and reduced clotting within the dialyzer. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03612856.

### Anticoagulation in hemodialysis: a narrative review [^ca378f48]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has historically been considered necessary to maintain the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) and preserve dialysis efficiency. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the most commonly used anticoagulant due to low cost and staff familiarity. Despite widespread use, there is little standardization of heparin dosing protocols in the United States. Although the complication rates with UFH are low for the general population, certain contraindications have led to exploration in alternative anticoagulants in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Here we review the current evidence regarding heparin dosing protocols, complications associated with heparin use, and discuss alternatives to UFH including anticoagulant-free routine HD.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^c9385f07]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adult guidelines for dialysate composition (sections 5.1–5.3) are generally applicable to children, though there are a number of additional considerations.

In children with residual kidney function, tubular dysfunction is not uncommon, leading to electrolyte wasting and hypokalaemia or acidosis. Calcium balance is also more complex in children: the normal range for calcium is age-dependent and growing children require a positive calcium balance, so that hypocalcaemia may be both more common and more harmful, and yet vascular calcification is sometimes seen even in children and adolescents, in whom calcium-phosphate product is an important risk factor. Similarly, dietary protein intake is often proportionately greater than that of adults, and pre-dialysis acidosis therefore more common. The complexity and clinical heterogeneity of these issues therefore argues strongly for a more individualized approach to dialysate composition in children.

Thermal exchanges during dialysis may also be more significant particularly in neonates and younger children, due to the proportionately greater blood flow, and sometimes a reduced capacity for compensation due to body size. Hypothermia should therefore be avoided by individualising dialysate temperature, with intradialytic monitoring in those most at risk. Control of thermal exchanges is available on some modern dialysis machines.

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

Danaparoid, lepirudin, and fondaparinux for renal replacement therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — danaparoid has been successfully used despite dependence on renal clearance. The highest level of evidence supporting danaparoid includes one small pilot study (five patients with continuous venovenous hemofiltration) and a retrospective review of intermittent hemodialysis cases (n = 122), in which thrombosis of either the patient or the hemodialysis circuit occurred in 7% of the 97 patients with HIT and major bleeding occurred in 6%, and only one-third of patients had HIT confirmed with a functional assay. For lepirudin, because of the prolonged half-life in renal failure, intermittent doses prior to dialysis may continue to exert an anticoagulant effect between sessions, and small studies evaluating hirudin during continuous venovenous hemofiltration have reported an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. The evidence regarding the use of fondaparinux is limited to case reports.

### Thromboembolism and anticoagulant management in hemodialysis patients: a practical guide to clinical management [^c4067b62]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

The need for anticoagulation in dialysis patients is common and the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and atrial fibrillation in this population is high. While direct data are lacking on the management of anticoagulation in dialysis patients, careful weighing of risks and benefits on the basis of evidence from other populations is crucial. VTE should be managed with adjusted dose warfarin for most patients. Placement of an inferior vena cava filter is a reasonable option for those patients with unacceptable bleeding risks. Studies are ongoing to assess the safety of some low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), which may potentially be useful for long-term anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients. In atrial fibrillation the available data on risk of bleeding, risk of stroke, and patient preferences should all be taken into account when considering long-term anticoagulation. We have constructed an evidence model to help quantitate the risks and benefits for an individual patient. The impact of dialysis on risk of bleeding is such that the risk of bleeding will outweigh the benefit in many patients, and anticoagulation will not be used: in some of these patients aspirin therapy may be an alternative. Finally, in the area of prevention of graft and access thrombosis, some randomized controlled trials are available, but none have to date shown benefit from anticoagulation for primary or secondary prevention of thrombosis, and the risk of bleeding in these studies was high.

### The effect of citrate dialysate on intradialytic heparin dose in haemodialysis patients: study design of a randomised controlled trial [^a168349d]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study setting

This randomised crossover clinical trial is performed within three community HD units in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where unfractionated heparin is used for standard intradialytic anticoagulation. All participants provide written informed consent. The study protocol is approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary, and is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (ClinicalTrials.gov).

Study population

Eligible patients are ≥ 18 years, and on outpatient conventional HD three times per week for at least three months. Exclusion criteria include: contraindication to heparin, heparin-free HD, known clotting disorder, warfarin therapy, dialysing with a dysfunctional central venous catheter (blood flow rate consistently < 300 mL/min and/or frequent use of thrombolytic), vascular access dysfunction, planned vascular access conversion or procedure during the study period, use of high calcium dialysate, active medical issue, planned kidney transplant during the study period, planned conversion of dialysis modality (peritoneal dialysis, nocturnal dialysis) during the study period, or inability to provide informed consent. Patients with recent modifications to their erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose are reviewed by the investigator for eligibility.

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb973541]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are among the preferred anticoagulant for preventing and treating venous thrombosis. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed similar efficacy between LMWH and unfractionated heparin (UFH) for acute deep venous thrombosis prevention, and no bleeding risk difference with a reduced mortality rate in favor of LMWH. LMWH are replacing UFH as the first line treatment for pulmonary embolism and unstable angina, a choice mainly due to their predictable effect and convenient use.

Despite the fact that the European Best Practice Guidelines for hemodialysis recommended the use of LWMH for the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) anticoagulation, UFH remains the most frequent choice for hemodialysis treatment in North America. While cost may be the main argument for not using LMWH in hemodialysis, their safety remains a major concern. UFH is metabolized by both hepatic and renal pathways but LMWH are mainly cleared through the kidneys leading to a potential bioaccumulation and an increased risk of hemorrhage. A meta-analysis conducted by Lim et al. evaluated the safety and efficacy of LMWH in hemodialysis, finding no difference between LMWH and UFH for both bleeding and thrombosis of the ECC. While the sample was large enough to evaluate efficacy (thrombosis), limited data was available to evaluate the risk of bleeding, leading to large confidence intervals (CI), and therefore limited conclusions.

UFH is known to modify the lipid profile, to induce osteoporosis, and to carry a risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the impact of LMWH on these outcomes in hemodialysis remains unclear.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety of LMWH compared to UFH as an anticoagulant of the ECC among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. The primary outcomes were the risk of minor and major bleedings, cardiovascular events and osteoporotic fractures. Secondary outcomes were changes in lipid profile, osteoporosis and HIT.

2.7	Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM INJECTION to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.8	Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.9	Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 units/kg to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 units/hour to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^c345279c]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, being closely connected to cardiovascular disease. CKD involves an elevated thromboembolic risk and requires anticoagulation, but the high rates of hemorrhage render it quite challenging.

Hypothesis

There are no consensus recommendations regarding anticoagulation in CKD. Due to the currently limited data, clinicians need practical clues for monitoring and optimizing the treatment.

Methods

Based on the available data, this review outlines the benefit‐risk ratio of all types of anticoagulants in each stage of CKD and provides practical recommendations for accurate dosage adjustment, reversal of antithrombotic effect, and monitoring of renal function on a regular basis.

Results

Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the efficient and safe use of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in mild and moderate CKD. On the contrary, the data are poor and controversial for advanced stages. DOACs are preferred in CKD stages 1 to 3. In patients with stage 4 CKD, the choice of warfarin vs DOACs will take into consideration the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and patient characteristics. Warfarin remains the first‐line treatment in end‐stage renal disease, although in this case the decision to use or not to use anticoagulation is strictly individualized. Anticoagulation with heparins is safe in nondialysis‐dependent CKD, but remains a challenge in the hemodialysis patients.

Conclusions

Although there is a need for cardiorenal consensus regarding anticoagulation in CKD, adequate selection of the anticoagulant type and careful monitoring are some extremely useful indications for overcoming management challenges.

### The effect of oral anticoagulation on clotting during hemodialysis [^423d7e2d]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Between 5% and 10% of hemodialysis patients are treated with oral anticoagulants. It is currently unknown whether additional anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is needed to prevent clotting during hemodialysis.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, cross-over study 10 patients treated with oral anticoagulants (phenprocoumon) received either no additional anticoagulation or low dose dalteparin (bolus of 40 IU/kg body weight) before dialysis. Efficacy of hemodialysis was measured by normalized weekly Kt/V and urea reduction rate (URR). Thrombus formation was evaluated by measurement of D-dimer and inspection of air traps and dialyser.

Results

The median international normalized ratio (INR) did not differ between both observation periods (phenprocoumon 2.2(2 to 3) vs. dalteparin 2.1(2 to 2.9). The anti-Xa level in dalteparin patients was 0.33 (0.27 to 0.38) IU/mL after 2 hours and 0.16 (0.03 to 0.23) IU/mL after 4 hours of hemodialysis. The median increase of D-dimer was significantly higher in patients without additional dalteparin therapy during hemodialysis (DeltaD-dimer 0.23 microg/mL vs. 0.03 mug/mL) (P = 0.0004). Complete thrombosis of the dialyser membrane occurred in one patient in the phenprocoumon group but in none with combined treatment. The extent of thrombosis in the arterial and venous air trap and dialyser was significantly less in patients with additional dalteparin therapy (P = 0.0014, P = 0.0002, and P = 0.0005, respectively). Weekly Kt/V and URR was similar in both groups.

Conclusion

Standard oral anticoagulation with an INR between 2 and 3 is insufficient to prevent clotting during hemodialysis. Additional low dose anticoagulation with a LMWH or heparin is necessary to facilitate treatment.

### Safety and tolerability of the protein C activator AB002 in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis: a randomized phase 2 trial [^ca170fe7]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This trial was not intended to investigate AB002 in comparison to heparin, as the intended initial target populations are those patients who are not suitable for intradialytic heparin use. However, aside from the increased bleeding risk associated with systemic use during hemodialysis, heparin is known to have heterogenous effects that complicate dosing in ESRD patients, including bone mineral disease, hyperkalemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical interest in heparin alternatives has understandably been focused on patient populations with known heparin intolerance or elevated bleeding risk, but safe non-heparin alternatives could displace heparin if clinical outcomes, such as reduction in morbidity and mortality compared to heparin, justify such a move.

Based on non-clinical and clinical data, administration of very low, yet antithrombotic doses of AB002 (< 4 µg/kg, intravenous bolus or infusion) does not appear to alter any standard laboratory markers of hemostasis, such as coagulation, bleeding times, or platelet aggregation. This is fundamentally different from the changes induced by other antithrombotic agents, such as platelet antagonists and anticoagulants, including infused recombinant APC. We thus contemplate that in addition to ESRD patients who cannot receive heparin due to increased risk of bleeding, AB002 may be suitable as a non-heparin option in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is a rare, but life-threatening complication of heparin exposure that results in disseminated or peripheral blood clots, hypercoagulability, and thrombocytopenia. Repeated heparin exposure in the course of maintenance hemodialysis is of particular concern for the development of HIT.

The limitations of this study include the small patient number, limited racial, ethnic, and female representation, and single-dose administration, which preclude a conclusion of whether AB002 employed as a multiple dose regimen can achieve safe and functional clot prevention. This study was conducted at a single site and reflects the demographic makeup of the region. While the short half-life of AB002 is advantageous for use during hemodialysis, it restricted our ability to assess long term effects of repeat-dose treatment on factors such as anemia or chronic inflammation, which contribute to morbidity and mortality associated with chronic hemodialysis in ESRD. Given the anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of recombinant APC administration in disease models –, including in ischemic stroke, it is conceivable that AB002 may also impart beneficial effects on chronic inflammation or anemia in this patient population. Additional studies in which AB002 is administered repeatedly during heparin-free hemodialysis will be critical to testing this hypothesis.

In summary, the evidence to guide selection of the optimal catheter locking solution in the primary prevention of catheter malfunction is limited. While preliminary data would suggest rt-PA may be an effective locking solution, the optimal dose and frequency of administration are unknown. The Prevention of Catheter Lumen Occlusion with rt-PA versus Heparin (PreCLOT) study will compare the use of rt-PA versus heparin in the primary prevention of hemodialysis catheter malfunction.

### Safety and efficacy of low molecular weight heparins for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal failure: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^5a170d64]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins (LWMH) are the preferred initial treatment for many thromboembolic disorders but are renally excreted and relatively contraindicated in patients with renal failure because of concerns of increased bleeding risks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LMWH compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for preventing thrombosis of the extracorporeal dialysis circuit. Studies were identified with the use of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and FirstSearch; reference lists were reviewed; and pharmaceutical companies were contacted. Randomized, controlled trials that compared an LMWH with another anticoagulant during hemodialysis in patients with ESRD and reported at least one of bleeding, extracorporeal circuit thrombosis, or anti-Xa levels were chosen. Two reviewers independently extracted data on methodologic quality, study design, clinical outcomes, and anti-Xa levels. Seventeen trials were included in this systematic review, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis. It was found that LMWH did not significantly affect the number of bleeding events (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 3.43), bleeding assessed by vascular access compression time (weighted mean difference, -0.87; 95% CI, -2.75 to 1.02), or extracorporeal circuit thrombosis (relative risk, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.91) as compared with UFH. LMWH seem to be as safe as UFH in terms of bleeding complications and as effective as UFH in preventing extracorporeal circuit thrombosis. However, inferences from these trials assessing anticoagulation for patients who undergo hemodialysis will continue to be weak until larger, more rigorous randomized trials are conducted.

### Filtering out use of DOACs in hemodialysis [^2d08fc48]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Published data exploring the best approach to initiating and maintaining anticoagulation in the setting of renal support therapy are scarce, as these patients were excluded in clinical trials. When developing an anticoagulation regimen in this setting, it is important to assess thrombosis risk, identify the unique drivers for thrombosis and bleeding, and recognize the limitations of supporting evidence behind approved prescribing indications for renal impairment. Available literature and considerations for using direct acting oral anticoagulants in the setting of renal support are reviewed.

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be8fd5aa]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a rare but severe adverse reaction to heparin. Although Bramham et al. did not observe any HIT; we cannot reach any conclusion regarding this outcome. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was reported between 1 and 3% with UFH, while it was less than 1% with LMWH. UFH binds to the platelet factor 4 (PF4). Antibodies then recognize this complex, which leads to an autoimmune reaction and thrombocytopenia. Because a long chain of saccharides is needed to bind to PF4, and that LMWH are composed of short chains, it is believed that LMWH is less likely to form such complexes.

Our review has some limitations. Except for bleeding and cardiovascular events, we could not obtain data on every one of our primary outcomes. Our analyses were based on the secondary outcomes, and they might not be effective surrogates to infer on the main outcomes. The bleeding risk with LMWH may have been misestimated as some of the studies included an exploratory phase to determine the right LMWH dosage, which is partly based on occurrence of bleeding events, while UFH treatment arm did not go through such phase since patients were already stable under that regimen.

### Safety of low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin in hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^176eb41a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review reports on safety of LMWH compared to UFH when used for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis. There was no statistical difference for risk of bleeding in the LMWH compared to the UFH group. We also showed lower levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides when exposed to LMWH compared to UFH. LDL-cholesterol levels tended to be lower using LMWH but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Because of the small numbers of studies, we were not able to estimate the differential risk of cardiovascular events, osteoporotic fractures and HIT.

A decade after the publication of the first meta-analysis published by Lim et al. we conducted a new systematic review to re-evaluate LMWH bleeding risk in hemodialysis compared to UFH by including all new relevant studies. Lim et al. found similar overall bleeding risk (RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.27, 3.43), a result that is consistent with our study. Our updated meta-analysis adds to this earlier study by narrowing the CI and reducing the upper limit from three to two, supporting that, at least, LMWH does not carry a higher risk of bleeding. Our results are also consistent with observed bleeding risk among patients without renal failure using LMWH for their primary indication. Renal-dependent clearance of LMWH remains a concern. A prospective observational cohort study evaluated the bioaccumulation of dalteparin when administered at the therapeutic dose twice a day. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) inferior to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a significant bioaccumulation of dalteparin at the end of the study. On the other hand, two studies were conducted among critically ill patients with severe renal insufficiency, and did not observe bioaccumulation of dalteparin using a prophylactic dose of 5000 IU once a day. The later schedule is closer to the hemodialysis context.

### Unfractionated heparin for hemodialysis: still the best option [^275c966e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the anticoagulant of choice for most maintenance hemodialysis units in the United States. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the norm in Western Europe, but is not approved for this indication in the United States. UFH is likely to remain the agent of choice in the United States because of its relative ease of use, safety, and low cost. Coating tubing and dialyzers with heparin is now possible, but systemic anticoagulation with heparin is usually still required. The additional cost of this innovation does not yet justify its use. Side effects of both UFH and LMWH include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperkalemia. It is uncertain whether osteoporosis is an important side effect, as vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, age, and debility are confounding factors. When UFH poses a risk or its use is contraindicated, e.g., after development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the use of direct thrombin inhibitors, regional citrate anticoagulation, citrate dialysate, and heparin-free dialysis may be appropriate.

### Different effects of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin on some thrombogenesis markers during hemodialysis: a cross-over study [^69db46db]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin constitute fundamental anticoagulants during hemodialysis (HD). We aimed to investigate the effect of UFH and enoxaparin on plasma levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF 1+2) and thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT) as markers of intravascular thrombogenesis during HD.

Methods

We enrolled 22 chronic HD patients, who were randomly assigned to either iv enoxaparin (n = 11) or UFH (n = 11) anticoagulation, and followed prospectively for 12 weeks before crossing over to the alternate therapy for further 12 weeks. Plasma levels of PF 1+2 and TAT were measured by immunoassay at the start, at 10 and 180 min of HD session after each period of evaluation.

Results

The baseline PF 1+2 and TAT levels were comparable under enoxaparin and UFH treatment. PF 1+2 significantly decreased during both UFH (χ² ANOVA = 9.82, P = 0.007) and enoxaparin (χ² ANOVA = 29.40, P < 10⁻⁶) anticoagulated HD, while over-HD TAT levels changes differed depending on the type of heparin. The switch from enoxaparin to UFH treatment was connected with a significantly higher PF 1+2 after 10 and 180 min as well as higher TAT concentration after 180 min of HD. Only during enoxaparin anticoagulated HD 34% PF 1+2 decrease and TAT levels after 180 min of HD was closely associated with heparin dosage.

Conclusion

Single bolus of enoxaparin ensures efficient and convenient anti-thrombotic protection during HD procedure. Enoxaparin mean dose of 0.67 mg/kg, which is generally lower than manufacturer's instructions, can be recommended for over-dialytic regular use.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics will be presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or medians and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables, and absolute and relative proportions for categorical variables. To determine the effect of CD compared with AD on reduction in CHD (the primary outcome) a random intercept linear mixed model will be used, with CD or AD as the main exposure, subjects as source of random effects, baseline heparin dose values as covariate (at least 2 of 3 measures from the first of two weeks of each period), and final heparin dose values as outcome (at least 2 of 3 measures of the second week of each period). This model takes into account the correlation of data caused by repeated measures for each subject given the crossover design of the study. Treatment, treatment period, and treatment sequence will be modelled as fixed effects. If there is no evidence of period or carry-over effects, all comparisons will be presented relative to AD, without the need for consideration of carry-over effects.

KDIGO AKI — regional citrate anticoagulation versus heparin during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) randomized trials — reports the following dosing targets and outcomes. In a continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) trial, heparin was titrated to an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 45–65 seconds and citrate to a postfilter ionized calcium between 1.0–1.4 mg/dl (0.25–0.35 mmol/l); the trial was stopped after 79 filters because citrate significantly improved filter survival (124.5 hours vs. 38.3 hours; P < 0.001) and reduced filter terminations for clotting (16.7% vs. 53.5%; P = 0.004). In a continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) trial that randomized 48 patients with 102 circuits analyzed, heparin dosing was a bolus of 300–500 U followed by 500 U/h to achieve aPTT 50–70 seconds while citrate (500 mmol/l) targeted postfilter ionized calcium 1.0–1.2 mg/dl (0.25–0.30 mmol/l); circuit survival did not differ, but major bleeding and transfusion needs were greater with heparin. A small crossover study in 10 CVVH patients showed short filter life (13 hours with regional heparinization; 17 hours with citrate) without bleeding. In the largest postdilution CVVH trial (200 patients), nadroparin was given as 2850 U bolus then 380 U/h without monitoring and citrate (500 mmol/l) at 3 mmol per liter blood flow; safety favored citrate with two vs. 20 regimen changes (P > 0.001), adverse events included citrate accumulation (n = 1) and early clotting due to protocol violation (n = 1) with citrate versus bleeding (n = 16) or severe thrombocytopenia (n = 4) with nadroparin, while circuit survival did not differ.

### The effect of citrate dialysate on intradialytic heparin dose in haemodialysis patients: study design of a randomised controlled trial [^1b6677a0]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Data collection

Baseline characteristics

Baseline patient demographics (age, gender, HD vintage, race), comorbidities, cause of ESRD, labs, and HD prescription (dialyser, dialysate composition and temperature, blood and dialysate flow rates, target weight, anticoagulation) are extracted from HD charts and the Southern Alberta Renal Program database.

Cumulative heparin dose

The CHD is calculated per HD session, and determined from HD run sheets. Specifically, CHD is the initial heparin bolus, plus the hourly heparin infusion rate multiplied by the time on HD during which heparin is infused, per session, in heparin units. For the primary outcome, the CHD for the last two HD runs of each study phase are recorded, averaged, and used to calculate change from baseline CHD. The last two HD sessions of each phase is chosen to allow adequate time in each phase for heparin dose minimisation.

Visual clotting score, inter-and intra-rater reliability

The clotting score is a visual grade of dialyser and venous chamber clotting (Table 1). To ensure consistency, scoring of dialyser/venous chamber clotting for heparin dose adjustments are performed at the end of each HD session by a single, trained research nurse. A second HD nurse independently and blindly scores the dialyser/venous chamber appearance; this second clotting score is recorded to assess inter-rater reliability, but is not used to adjust the heparin dose per protocol. To assess for intra-rater reliability, at the end of each HD session during the run-in phase, the dialyser quadrants are captured in four photographs by the same trained research nurse, using a digital camera on a tripod, with standardised lighting, at a standardised distance and height from the dialyser. The dialyser is rotated by 90° for each of the four photographs, to visually capture the full circumferential view of the dialyser. The photographs are re-presented in a blinded fashion to the same research nurse at a later date to be re-scored.

Metabolic, anticoagulation, and inflammatory parameters

Serum total calcium, ionized calcium, albumin, magnesium, bicarbonate, haemoglobin, urea, PT/INR, aPTT, B2M, and CRP are collected at the beginning of the first HD session of the study (whether randomised to Sequence 1 or 2), and drawn again both pre and post HD for the last HD sessions of each study phase. Ionized calcium is drawn pre and post HD during the first and last HD session in each study phase.

### Anticoagulation strategies in continuous renal replacement therapy: can the choice be evidence based? [^bced7a0b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Critical illness increases the tendency to both coagulation and bleeding, complicating anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We analyzed strategies for anticoagulation in CRRT concerning implementation, efficacy and safety to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.

Methods

We carried out a systematic review of the literature published before June 2005. Studies were rated at five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, A being the highest. Grades are labeled with minus if the study design was limited by size or comparability of groups. Data extracted were those on implementation, efficacy (circuit survival), safety (bleeding) and monitoring of anticoagulation.

Results

Due to the quality of the studies recommendation grades are low. If bleeding risk is not increased, unfractionated heparin (activated partial thromboplastin time, APTT, 1–1.4 times normal) or low molecular weight heparin (anti-Xa 0.25–0.35 IU/l) are recommended (grade E). If facilities are adequate, regional anticoagulation with citrate may be preferred (grade C). If bleeding risk is increased, anticoagulation with citrate is recommended (grade D(-)). CRRT without anticoagulation can be considered when coagulopathy is present (grade D(-)). If clotting tendency is increased predilution or the addition of prostaglandins to heparin may be helpful (grade C(-)).

Conclusion

Anticoagulation for CRRT must be tailored to patient characteristics and local facilities. The implementation of regional anticoagulation with citrate is worthwhile to reduce bleeding risk. Future trials should be randomized and should have sufficient power and well defined endpoints to compensate for the complexity of critical illness-related pro- and anticoagulant forces. An international consensus to define clinical endpoints is advocated.

### Safety and efficacy of tinzaparin anticoagulation during nocturnal hemodialysis [^5f998259]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The safety and efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the prevention of extracorporeal dialysis circuit clotting among in-center extended duration nocturnal hemodialysis (INHD) patients are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of tinzaparin, among INHD patients receiving 6–8 h hemodialysis, 3 times per week.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine antifactor Xa levels at time 0, 2 h, 4 h mid-hemodialysis (mid-HD), 6 h, and at end of each INHD session for 4 weeks and to determine extracorporeal dialysis circuit clotting and bleeding events after switching from unfractionated heparin to tinzaparin, using a standard protocol of tinzaparin delivery at the initiation and midpoint of HD.

Results

All 16 patients in The Ottawa Hospital INHD program were converted to tinzaparin and followed for 177 INHD sessions. Mean antifactor Xa level at 2 h of HD was 0.41 ± 0.21 (SD) IU/mL, at 4 h (mid-HD) 0.19 ± 0.17 IU/mL, at 6 h 0.44 ± 0.21 IU/mL, and at dialysis end 0.26 ± 0.14 IU/mL. Antifactor Xa levels were undetectable at the start of INHD, suggesting no tinzaparin accumulation. Five patients required an increase in tinzaparin due to extracorporeal dialysis circuit clotting. There were no bleeding events. One patient required a switch to fondaparinux due to an adverse reaction.

Conclusion

Tinzaparin was safe and efficacious for most INHD patients without accumulation or bleeding. The conversion from unfractionated heparin to tinzaparin required an increased tinzaparin dose for 31% of INHD patients.

### A multi-center, prospective, open-label, 8-week study of certoparin for anticoagulation during maintenance hemodialysis – the membrane study [^534b0d2b]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate anticoagulation is a precondition for effective hemodialysis to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit and to improve biocompatibility of artificial membranes. For this purpose, unfractionated heparin (UFH) is currently the most widely used anticoagulant. However, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have the advantage over UFH in that they show less nonspecific binding to endothelium, macrophages, platelets and plasma proteins, a more predictable anticoagulant response, and usually have a low requirement for monitoring. Furthermore, chronic UFH use may cause a number of untoward effects, such as heparin induced dyslipidemia, an increased risk of bleeding, allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis and aldosterone suppression.

Certoparin was shown to be safe and effective in patients with chronic renal insufficiency in a recent subgroup analysis of the CERTIFY study. Its action may be partially reversed by protamine hydrochloride. Compared to other LMWHs certoparin has an intermediate renal clearance of antiXa activity (3.6–4.1%) and body weight independent dosing. The present feasibility trial was designed to provide data on the efficacy and safety of certoparin in the prophylaxis of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit in patients receiving routine hemodialysis 2–3 times per week.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^bce357bf]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

For patients at increased risk of bleeding, several options are used in clinical practice. Firstly, several techniques require no anticoagulation to be administered during dialysis, including: combining a high blood flow rate and regular pre-dialyzer circuit flushing every 15–30 minutes; using a heparin coated dialyzer; adding heparin to the rinsing solution; or using a dialysate containing citrate.

Secondly, a regional anticoagulant can be used such as citrate, prostacyclin (epoprostenol) or nafamostat (not currently available in UK). Regional anticoagulation with citrate and epoprostenolol have both been reported to reduce the risk of haemorrhage compared to heparin, though there are drawbacks: epoprostenol may induce hypotension and is costly, whereas citrate administration requires re-infusion of calcium based on electrolyte monitoring, adding complexity and nursing staff time. Finally, lower doses of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin have been used with caution in patients at risk of bleeding.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, usually occurring shortly after regular exposure to heparin, and sometimes with thrombosis, may occur in heparin-treated dialysis patients. The risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia can be estimated using the 4T scoring system, and is usually confirmed by laboratory testing and detailed guidelines on diagnosis and treatment are published by the British Society of Haematology, but in suspected or confirmed cases, all heparins should be withdrawn. The risk of thrombosis increases with the severity of thrombocytopaenia, and anticoagulation is usually started with either the direct thrombin inhibitor argatroban, or a natural (danaparoid) or synthetic (fondaparinux) heparinoid. Argatroban is reversible, given by continuous infusion, and requires careful laboratory monitoring with aPTTr. The heparinoids are renally excreted and have prolonged half-lives in dialysis patients, such that monitoring of the bolus given with a dialysis session can be based on anti-Xa activity prior to the following session. Once the platelet count returns to normal, patients are usually anticoagulated with warfarin, but in the majority of cases antibodies disappear with time, and patients have been successfully re-challenged with unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins once laboratory testing becomes negative.

Adverse events during dialysis (Guidelines 7.1–7.3)

We suggest that during washback, dialysis lines and dialyser are observed to ensure residual blood loss is kept to a minimum. [2C]

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^887fe9fe]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Heparin treatment

Heparin, no matter of type, is administered according to the classic rules, depending on the associated disorder (acute coronary syndrome/VTE). Dose adjustment is necessary in advanced CKD and is primarily based on guideline recommendations (Table 4). 28, 29, 30

Table 4
Dose adjustment for heparins according to chronic kidney disease stage (adapted from Hughes et al 15, European Society of Cardiology guidelines 28, 29, 30)

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is preferred because it has a short half‐life that allows for the anticoagulant effect to wear off within 1 to 4 hours, even in patients with severe renal dysfunction at high hemorrhagic risk. In addition to this, there is an antidote (protamine) used to rapidly reverse the effects of UFH, although the guidelines recommend UFH in severe CKD without adjustment of impaired renal clearance and interpatient variability of accumulation. Therefore, nephrology practice recommends decreasing the initial standard dose by 33%, and subsequently dose adjustment based on aPTT. 16 In the NSTEMI guideline, indications are primarily based on dose adjustments. 29 The primary argument is the high hemorrhagic risk per se in severe CKD.

Low‐molecular‐weight heparin s (LMWHs) are preferred owing to their pharmacokinetic predictability, ease of administration without the need for monitoring. Renal clearance is indirectly proportional to molecular weight, therefore it requires dose adjustments in CKD stages 4 and 5 (Table 4). For dosage adjustment purposes, it is recommended to monitor the activity of antifactor Xa (anti‐Xa level) in order to avoid underdosage and achieve optimal therapeutic level, respectively. 16 Dosing indications are the result of either small‐scale open‐label studies, or analysis of CKD subgroups in the randomized trials, adopted by guidelines. Enoxaparin is the most commonly used low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) and the 1‐mg/kg QD regimen recommended in severe CKD the most studied. There is no data for dalteparin and tinzaparin in severe CKD; therefore, it is preferable to avoid administering them. 16 Although preferred in cases of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia, fondaparinux is not recommended in severe CKD.

### The effect of citrate dialysate on intradialytic heparin dose in haemodialysis patients: study design of a randomised controlled trial [^0d18b73b]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Four observational studies specifically address heparin use with CD in maintenance HD patients. One study included 277 chronic HD patients from eight HD units in an eight-week long, open-label, sequential four-phase study. The primary outcome was change in mean effective conductivity clearance with CD (and reduced heparin) versus AD (and standard heparin dose). Each study phase was two weeks long (6 HD sessions). In the first baseline phase, patients received AD and 100% of their standard heparin dose. In subsequent phases, patients received CD and decreasing amounts of heparin (second phase: CD and 100% of standard heparin dose; third phase: CD and 80% of standard heparin dose; fourth phase: CD and 2/3 of standard heparin dose). At the end of the study, there was no difference in dialysis adequacy between baseline (AD with 100% heparin) and subsequent phases (CD with decreased heparin). Even with a 33% reduction in heparin, there was no difference in HD circuit clotting, and dialysis adequacy was maintained. This study did not assess if a reduced heparin dose was possible with AD. In another prospective study, chlorhydric-acid based dialysate was compared with CD in ten patients treated with post-dilution online haemodiafiltration. During treatments with CD, the heparin dose was decreased by half, then completely discontinued. In 120 CD sessions without heparin, dialysis adequacy was unchanged, and only one clotting episode related to vascular access stenosis was experienced. Two further observational studies, published in abstract form only, included 20 and 31 chronic HD patients, respectively, who had prolonged bleeding from vascular access needling sites post HD. Patients were switched from AD to CD, and intradialytic heparin doses were reduced by 30% after two months, and 55% after four months, respectively. In both studies, heparin reduction with CD was achieved without decrease in dialysis adequacy.

### Anticoagulation with osocimab in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized phase 2 trial [^9fc1cd6b]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Randomization and study treatment

Participants were randomized between lower-dose osocimab and lower-dose placebo in a ratio of 2:1, and higher-dose osocimab and higher-dose placebo in a ratio of 2:1. Different placebos were needed because a larger volume was administered in the higher-dose group than in the lower-dose group. Participants were centrally assigned using an interactive web-response system and covariate-adaptive randomization. Covariates included geographical region, age, previous major adverse cardiovascular event, dialysis access via catheter, low-dose aspirin use, diabetes and atrial fibrillation. After randomization, there was a 1-week pretreatment period where participants underwent three hemodialysis sessions to establish a baseline for adverse events without treatment. Participants then received osocimab in a lower- or higher-dose regimen or placebo for 6 months in the main treatment period followed by an extension period of up to 12 months, or until the last study participant had completed their 6-month main treatment period. The lower-dose osocimab regimen consisted of a 105 mg loading dose followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 52.5 mg, and the higher-dose regimen consisted of a 210 mg loading dose followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 105 mg. A matching placebo was provided in identical-appearing vials. Treatments were administered subcutaneously in the abdomen no more than 1 h before dialysis. Heparin was administered as per usual during the dialysis sessions. The maximum duration of treatment was 18 months, and the trial was stopped when the last randomized participant completed 6 months of treatment.

### Heparin sodium and dextrose (heparin sodium in dextrose) [^8a1b2e16]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.6 Converting to Warfarin

To ensure continuous anticoagulation when converting from HEPARIN SODIUM to warfarin, continue full heparin therapy for several days until the INR (prothrombin time) has reached a stable therapeutic range. Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.7 Converting to Oral Anticoagulants other than
Warfarin

For patients currently receiving intravenous heparin, stop intravenous infusion of heparin sodium immediately after administering the first dose of oral anticoagulant; or for intermittent intravenous administration of heparin sodium, start oral anticoagulant 0 to 2 hours before the time that the next dose of heparin was to have been administered.

2.8 Extracorporeal Dialysis

Follow equipment manufacturer's operating directions carefully. A dose of 25 to 30 units/kg followed by an infusion rate of 1,500 to 2,000 units/hour is suggested based on pharmacodynamic data if specific manufacturers' recommendations are not available.

### Comparison between tinzaparin and standard heparin for chronic hemodialysis in a Canadian center [^5eb13e32]. American Journal of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparins offer several advantages over standard heparins, but their use for maintenance hemodialysis has been limited in North America because of their higher cost. Our objective was to compare tinzaparin to standard heparin during maintenance hemodialysis over an 8-week period, in regard to the visual aspect of the extracorporeal circuit, filter reuse, bleeding and time for compression of vascular access at the end of hemodialysis session, nursing time devoted to anticoagulation administration, level of satisfaction of patients and nurses, and relative cost.

Methods

Thirty-two chronic hemodialysis adult patients with peripheral accesses were randomly divided into two groups in a cross-over design: tinzaparin for 4 weeks followed by standard heparin for 4 weeks, or vice versa. Hemodialysis was performed thrice weekly over 3.5–4 h using large surface reused filters. Standard heparin was administered as an initial bolus of 50–75 units per kilogram followed by an infusion to maintain an activated clotting time (ACTESTER) between 150 and 200 s and discontinued 30–45 min before the end of the session. The initial dose of tinzaparin was 3,500 IU anti-Xa for patients usually receiving 7,500 units or less of standard heparin, or 4,500 IU anti-Xa for patients receiving more than 7,500 units of standard heparin, and it was injected as a bolus in the arterial line at the beginning of hemodialysis. Dosage adjustments were made by increments or decrements of 500 IU.

Results

A total of 6 patients did not require any adjustment in their dose of tinzaparin and remained at the initial dose, while the remaining 26 necessitated adjustments of the initial dose of tinzaparin: 20 patients required increments from the initial dose whereas 6 required reductions. For most patients, 27 of them, the standard heparin dose was kept at the same level throughout the study period (since it was their usual regimen and they were in stable medical conditions). According to the monitoring scale, the visual aspects of the tubing of the extracorporeal circuit and of the dialyzers at the end of the session were similar for both tinzaparin and standard heparin. The time of compression of the vascular access at the end of the hemodialysis sessions was not significantly different with tinzaparin than with standard heparin. However, as indicated below, most patients noted less bleeding (or oozing) from their access (during compression and thereafter, in the few hours after hemodialysis) with tinzaparin than with standard heparin. Clotting was observed more frequently in the arterial and venous bubble traps with tinzaparin than with standard heparin. The presence of clot(s) was observed in the arterial and venous bubble traps in, respectively, 18 ± 12 and 10 ± 6% of the sessions with tinzaparin, while in, respectively, 3 ± 4 and 2 ± 4% of the sessions with standard heparin (p < 0.005). Despite a tendency for a reduced reuse number of the dialyzers, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Among the 30 patients who completed the study, 2 reported excessive bleeding from their vascular access with tinzaparin whereas 8 reported such an excessive bleeding with standard heparin. The level of satisfaction of patients and nurses for tinzaparin was extremely good. The main reasons stated by the patients was reduced bleeding from their access after dialysis. The nurses preferred tinzaparin because of the simplicity and the rapidity of its administration, the lack of monitoring required, and the decreased bleeding/oozing tendency from the vascular access sites. The time spent for anticoagulation during a hemodialysis session was reported as 5 min with standard heparin (if no ACTESTER monitoring), 25–30 min with standard heparin (if ACTESTER monitoring required), and 1 min with tinzaparin. The cost analysis revealed that although tinzaparin is more than six times more expensive than standard heparin, the use of tinzaparin becomes similar to the use of standard heparin (USD 7.33 vs. USD 7.62 Canadian dollars for one hemodialysis session) if ACTESTER monitoring is performed (assuming that 22% of the sessions are routinely monitored and that one ACTESTER device is necessary for 8–10 dialysis stations, as applied in our unit).

Conclusion

Our experience with tinzaparin was positive: it represents a simple and easy way to offer anticoagulation during maintenance hemodialysis, it seems associated with less postdialysis bleeding, it saves precious nursing time and is widely appreciated by patients and staff.

### Using and monitoring of therapeutic high-dose enoxaparin in a heparin-resistant dialysis patient with recurrent thromboembolic events [^4e87106b]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The use of enoxaparin is generally not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing haemodialysis. We describe the administration of high-dose enoxaparin in a haemodialysis patient with heparin resistance and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) outlining a novel dosing regimen along an innovative method for monitoring antifactor Xa activity. As a last resort of his recurrent DVT, a critically ill intensive care unit patient undergoing dialysis was prescribed high-dose enoxaparin, administered exclusively after dialysis, on dialysis days for a period of 2months. Antifactor Xa activity was measured 4hours postadministration with a target range of 0.7–1.2IU/mL. The patient's DVT demonstrated clinical improvement, antifactor Xa levels were maintained within the therapeutic range and haemoglobin levels remained stable with no signs of bleeding. This case reports the implementation of a high-dose enoxaparin dosing and monitoring strategy in a high-risk patient. However, further studies involving larger patient cohorts are required to validate this approach.

### Intravenous and subcutaneous weight-based dosing of the low molecular weight heparin tinzaparin (innohep) in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis [^5d4635c0]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage renal disease are subject to a broad range of thrombotic complications. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are effective antithrombotic agents; however, they are cleared largely by renal mechanisms, raising uncertainty about their use in renally impaired patients.

Methods

Twelve chronic hemodialysis subjects were administered two single doses of the LMWH tinzaparin, 75 IU/kg, 2 weeks apart: subcutaneously (SC) on an off-dialysis day and intravenously (IV) just before dialysis.

Results

Mean maximal anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) activity was 0.33 IU/mL 4.0 hours after SC administration and 1.33 IU/mL 0.25 hours after IV administration. Anti-Xa half-lives were 3.89 and 2.31 hours, respectively. Anti-Xa activity returned to baseline within 24 hours of administration by either route. Consistent with population pharmacokinetic analyses of clinical study subjects with severe renal impairment, anti-Xa clearance after tinzaparin administration was reduced 28% relative to subjects with normal renal function. All 12 study subjects completed hemodialysis without requiring additional anticoagulation. One subject had minimal clotting in the dialyzer drip chamber, and one subject had mild prolonged bleeding at the vascular access site after dialysis needle removal. No major bleeding events occurred.

Conclusion

Tinzaparin, 75 IU/kg, SC on an off-dialysis day and IV just before dialysis is well tolerated in chronic hemodialysis patients. The weight-based regimen of 75 IU/kg IV just before dialysis provides adequate anticoagulation. SC weight-based dosing on off-dialysis days is a feasible regimen for further clinical thromboprophylaxis efficacy studies in hemodialysis patients. The risk for clinical overdose in severely renally impaired patients using this weight-based regimen of tinzaparin is unlikely.

### Safety and tolerability of the protein C activator AB002 in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis: a randomized phase 2 trial [^c8e28d4d]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been estimated to be 13.4%, according to a recent systematic review. CKD has a high risk for progression to ESRD, a condition requiring renal replacement therapies, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation, to maintain survival. In patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis, exposure of blood to foreign surfaces within the hemodialysis circuit activates coagulation and causes blood loss due to entrapment. Anemia is a common complication of ESRD, with approximately 85% of hemodialysis patients requiring erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. Despite this, many ESRD patients have erythropoietin-resistant anemia and/or anemia of inflammation and cannot tolerate additional blood loss during hemodialysis, which would further worsen their anemia, prognosis, and quality of life –.

The most commonly employed anticoagulant for reducing hemodialysis circuit clotting is unfractionated heparin. Heparin reduces patient blood loss due to blood entrapment in the hemodialysis circuit, as well as the incidence of circuit changeouts resulting from complete dialyzer occlusion. However, approximately 10% of ESRD patients do not receive heparin during hemodialysis due to heparin-resistance, heparin intolerance, increased bleeding risk, or cultural preferences. In patients undergoing heparin-free hemodialysis, the incidence of dialyzer clotting has been reported to occur in up to 10% of dialysis sessions. When a circuit changeout occurs, it is estimated that up to 180 mL blood is lost, attributable to the fill volume of the dialyzer and tubing. While saline flushes can be used to maintain circuit patency during heparin-free hemodialysis, they can reduce dialyzer efficiency and increase patient fluid volume.

To address this need for a safe, heparin-free strategy to prevent hemodialysis circuit clotting in this patient population, we conducted a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary antithrombotic efficacy of AB002 administration (NCT03963895). Here, we show that AB002 demonstrates a favorable safety profile, with no treatment-related adverse events (AE) and no clinically relevant bleeding. Additionally, in patients receiving AB002, clotting severity in the dialysis circuit is significantly reduced, the frequency of thrombo-occlusive events requiring changeout is numerically reduced, and exploratory biochemical markers indicative of clot generation are reduced.

### Meta-analysis: low-molecular-weight heparin and bleeding in patients with severe renal insufficiency [^8b0418b4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dose adjustment or laboratory monitoring of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min), but the basis for this recommendation is unclear.

Purpose

To compare levels of anti-Xa heparin and risk for major bleeding in LMWH-treated patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less versus those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min by using standard weight-adjusted therapeutic doses, empirically adjusted doses, or prophylactic doses of LMWH.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) searched to December 2005 with no language restrictions. The authors also searched reference lists and contacted experts.

Study Selection

Observational or subgroups of randomized studies that included non-dialysis-dependent patients with varying degrees of renal function who were treated with LMWH and reported creatinine clearance and anti-Xa levels or major bleeding.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on patient characteristics, renal function, LMWH treatment, anti-Xa levels, and major bleeding. The pooled odds ratio of major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less was calculated by using the Peto method.

Data Synthesis

Eighteen studies using 3 preparations of LMWH (15 studies using enoxaparin, 2 using tinzaparin, and 1 using dalteparin) were included. Peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after a subcutaneous injection were statistically significantly higher in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min in studies that used a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (4 studies) but not in studies of empirically dose-adjusted enoxaparin (3 studies). Data were insufficient to assess the relationship between anti-Xa and renal function for prophylactic doses of enoxaparin and therapeutic doses of tinzaparin or dalteparin. In 12 studies involving 4971 patients, LMWH was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk for major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min (5.0% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.19 to 4.27]; P = 0.013). When analyzed according to LMWH preparation, major bleeding was increased when a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was used (8.3% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 3.88 [CI, 1.78 to 8.45]) but may not be increased when an empirically adjusted dose of enoxaparin is used (0.9% vs. 1.9%; odds ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.09 to 3.78]; P = 0.23 for heterogeneity). There were insufficient studies to assess the risk for major bleeding with tinzaparin, dalteparin, and prophylactic doses of enoxaparin.

Limitations

The data for tinzaparin and dalteparin were limited. Data are observational, and the potential for confounding cannot be excluded.

Conclusions

Non-dialysis-dependent patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less who are treated with standard therapeutic doses of enoxaparin have elevated levels of anti-Xa and an increased risk for major bleeding. Empirical dose adjustment of enoxaparin may reduce the risk for bleeding and merits additional evaluation. No conclusions can be made regarding other LMWHs.

Pegmusirudin — this chemically modified hirudin derivative is produced by coupling two polyethylene glycol side chains to recombinant hirudin, which prolongs the half-life of hirudin from 60 min after IV bolus injection to about 12 h in patients with normal renal function; cleared by the kidneys with prolonged half-life in renal insufficiency, it underwent phase 2 evaluation in end-stage renal disease patients on routine hemodialysis, provided anticoagulation during and between sessions, but produced excessive bleeding leading to early study termination and is unlikely to undergo further development.

### Fondaparinux: another potential treatment for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II? [^5965dd16]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II is a highly morbid and potentially life-threatening condition with limited treatment options in older patients at high risk of bleeding who develop acute kidney injury (AKI). The recent study by Tardy-Poncet et al. showing that argatroban may be a safe and valid therapeutic option in this patient population is therefore of utmost clinical importance. However, when discussing other alternative therapies for HIT type II, the authors did not mention recent experience with fondaparinux, a selective synthetic antithrombin-mediated inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa.

Fondaparinux has often been used off-label to treat HIT type II in patients without AKI. Maximal treatment efficacy was obtained in all patients at an approximately sixfold less bleeding risk than in subjects treated with direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), including argatroban. As compared with DTIs, fondaparinux therapy is also more user-friendly (intermittent subcutaneous injections instead of continuous infusion) and less expensive. Fondaparinux is predominantly cleared renally. However, accumulation, and hence toxicity, is not expected to occur in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). Indeed, because of its low molecular weight (1.7 kDa) and lack of binding to proteins other than antithrombin, fondaparinux should be eliminated easily by all currently used intermittent and continuous RRT techniques in critically ill patients. Moreover, fondaparinux may form a perfect combination with regional citrate anticoagulation to reduce clinical but also dialysis circuit and filter thrombosis. Of course, appropriate guidelines for dose finding, dose modification, and efficacy monitoring of fondaparinux during RRT must be elaborated.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d7a2c2fa]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

High-quality anticoagulation management is required to keep these narrow therapeutic index medications as effective and safe as possible. This article focuses on the common important management questions for which, at a minimum, low-quality published evidence is available to guide best practices.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

Most practical clinical questions regarding the management of anticoagulation, both oral and parenteral, have not been adequately addressed by randomized trials. We found sufficient evidence for summaries of recommendations for 23 questions, of which only two are strong rather than weak recommendations. Strong recommendations include targeting an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 for patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy (Grade 1B) and not routinely using pharmacogenetic testing for guiding doses of vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1B). Weak recommendations deal with such issues as loading doses, initiation overlap, monitoring frequency, vitamin K supplementation, patient self-management, weight and renal function adjustment of doses, dosing decision support, drug interactions to avoid, and prevention and management of bleeding complications. We also address anticoagulation management services and intensive patient education.

Conclusions

We offer guidance for many common anticoagulation-related management problems. Most anticoagulation management questions have not been adequately studied.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: a practical guide to common clinical challenges [^8afe737d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Phase III trials involving DOACs have excluded patients with severe renal dysfunction (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or dialysis. 22, 23, 25 Apixaban exhibits minimal renal clearance, but the clinical significance of this is uncertain and there are varying recommendations regarding when to dose adjust. 10, 38, 60 Patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min were excluded in both AF and VTE trials using apixaban. 24, 61, 62 Nonetheless, FDA‐approved prescribing information requires no dose adjustment for apixaban in patients with renal impairment alone, including patients with end‐stage renal disease and those on hemodialysis. 10 To qualify for apixaban dose adjustment, one must meet at least 2 of the following characteristics; just remember your ABCs:
Age ≥ 80 years.
Body weight ≤ 60 kg.
Creatinine (serum) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL.

The Europeans provide an alternative guidance, recommending standard dosing for CrCl > 30 mL/min, reduced dose for CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min, and avoidance for CrCl < 15 m/min. 38 The 2018 AF guidelines recommend both warfarin and apixaban for patients with end‐stage renal disease (CrCl < 15 m/min or on dialysis). 28 However, warfarin has little proven benefit and a large risk of harm in end‐stage renal disease. There is growing evidence that apixaban in patients with AF and advanced CKD or end‐stage renal disease may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin 63, 64 or, at the very least, similar rates of bleeding. 65

Rivaroxaban use in severe CKD, particularly in patients on dialysis, is quite contentious. The package labeling states that rivaroxaban can be used in patients on dialysis, albeit at a reduced dose. However, this is based on limited pharmacokinetic data. 9 The limited observational data suggested varying effects on bleed risk compared with warfarin in patients with stage 5 CKD or on dialysis. 59, 66 Regardless, major guidelines and consensus documents do not recommend use of rivaroxaban in patients with stage 5 CKD or on dialysis. 59

### Warfarin anticoagulation in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review of bleeding rates [^74f56898]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite common use of warfarin, the bleeding risk associated with this treatment in hemodialysis (HD) patients is unknown.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Inclusion criteria were case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in dialysis patients that examined the bleeding risk associated with warfarin use compared with no warfarin or subcutaneous heparin. Studies with fewer than 10 subjects, case reports, abstracts lacking complete data sets, review articles, and editorials were excluded.

Predictor

Warfarin use compared with no warfarin or subcutaneous heparin.

Outcomes

Data for bleeding were reported as rates: number of bleeding episodes per number of patient-years of warfarin exposure or follow-up.

Results

Of 79 articles and abstracts, 5 met inclusion criteria and 3 more could be added after investigators provided additional information. All studies were of HD patients, and 7 of 8 evaluated the use of warfarin for the prevention of HD access thrombosis. Intensity of anticoagulation varied. Meta-analysis was not possible because of study heterogeneity. Studies of full-intensity anticoagulation and the 1 randomized controlled trial of low-intensity anticoagulation showed major bleeding episode rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.54 events/patient-year of warfarin exposure. These rates are approximately twice as high as those of HD patients receiving either no warfarin or subcutaneous heparin.

Limitations

This review is based largely on data from observational studies in which bleeding rates may be confounded by comorbidity. Relatively small sample sizes may provide imprecise estimates of rates.

Conclusion

Low- and full-intensity anticoagulation use in HD patients is associated with a significant bleeding risk, which has to be balanced against any potential benefit of therapy. This has to be considered carefully when prescribing warfarin to HD patients.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) — HIT: In patients with acute HIT who are receiving renal replacement therapy and require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the dialysis circuit, the ASH guideline panel suggests treatment with argatroban, danaparoid, or bivalirudin rather than other non-heparin anticoagulants (conditional recommendation; very low certainty in the evidence about effects). In patients with subacute HIT A, subacute HIT B, or remote HIT who are receiving renal replacement therapy, are not otherwise receiving anticoagulation, and require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the dialysis circuit, the panel suggests regional citrate rather than heparin or non-heparin anticoagulants (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects); the choice of agent may be influenced by drug factors (availability, cost), patient factors (liver function), and clinician experience, and citrate is not appropriate for patients with acute HIT who require systemic rather than regional anticoagulation.

### Avoidance of systemic anticoagulation during intermittent haemodialysis with heparin-grafted polyacrilonitrile membrane and citrate-enriched dialysate: a retrospective cohort study [^d12558be]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Haemodialysis treatment requires anticoagulation or antithrombotic treatment to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit. Strategies which induce systemic anticoagulation should however be avoided in patients with bleeding risks. In this setting, the European Best Practice Guidelines recommend haemodialysis without systemic anticoagulation by using either regular saline flushing or regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).

Heparin-free haemodialysis with saline flushes requires removal of all air from dialyzer and lines during priming, prevention of air introduction in the extracorporeal system during dialysis and a high blood flow rate. After rapidly increasing extracorporeal blood flows, saline flushes are administered every 15–30 minutes into the pre-dialyzer limb. Saline boluses vary between 25 to 200 mL administered every 15 to 30 minutes. Coagulation in the circuit has been reported with a variable frequency, 5 to 50%, with early termination of the dialysis session in 5 to 7%. Mean treatment duration varied between 3 and 4 hours. Previous reports documented preserved clearance efficiency in haemodialysis using intermittent saline flushes. The recent prospective and randomized HepZero study in maintenance dialysis patients has shown that only half of the 127 patients in the control group, receiving saline flushes of 100–300 mL every 30 minutes or predilution infusion of 1–2 litres per hour in haemodiafiltration, were able to complete 4 hours of dialysis without reaching one of the clotting-related events of the composite endpoint. RCA uses the calcium inhibiting actions of trisodium citrate, infused into the arterial line of the dialyzer, to block the coagulation cascade. Calcium-citrate complexes are cleared into the dialysate and calcium-infusion in the venous return line restores plasma calcium concentration and prevents hypocalcaemia. This strategy is a safe and feasible option for intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) in children and adults with increased bleeding risk. As an alternative approach, a citrate containing dialysate was developed by replacing some of the acetate with citrate. The use of a low-concentrated citric acid (0.8 mmol/L) dialysate does not require additional calcium supplementation, has been proven to be safe, to improve dialyzer clearance and to decrease heparin requirements. The use of a heparin-grafted dialyzer has also been shown to reduce heparin requirements but is less efficient in terms of clotting of the extracorporeal circuit and dialysis efficacy than RCA. A recent prospective and controlled trial showed that use of the heparin-grafted polyacrilonitrile (AN69ST) dialyzer in the absence of systemic anticoagulation was complicated by circuit coagulation in 31.5% of 4-hour dialysis sessions. Our hypothesis is that the combination of a heparinized dialyzer membrane with citrate-enriched dialysate might further reduce clotting risk of the extracorporeal circuit in the absence of systemic anticoagulation. This approach has not been previously investigated, but has been used routinely for IHD of patients considered at increased bleeding risk during admission at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our institution. The primary endpoint of the present retrospective study was to determine the incidence rate of extracorporeal circuit clotting during haemodialysis sessions with the heparin-grafted AN69ST dialyzer in combination with a citrate-enriched dialysate.
