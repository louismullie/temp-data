## Question

what is a common drug to use to prevent asian flush

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what drug is commonly used to prevent Asian flush. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of Asian flush and whether any drug targets that mechanism. Then, I should verify which medications have direct clinical evidence for preventing or masking the flushing. Next, I will check safety, dosing, and practical considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats about off-label use and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Asian flush reflects ALDH2 deficiency, which slows acetaldehyde clearance and drives vasodilation and flushing after alcohol; importantly, there is no approved therapy that reverses ALDH2 deficiency itself, so any pharmacologic approach will be symptomatic rather than disease-modifying [^115RZTRZ] [^112AnPzo].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence for a topical option. A randomized, split-face trial in JAMA Dermatology showed that brimonidine gel 0.33% applied 30 minutes before alcohol significantly reduced facial erythema at 60 minutes and maintained benefit through 120 minutes, with participants rating high likelihood of reuse and recommendation; this is the most direct, placebo-controlled evidence for masking alcohol-induced flushing.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral options. I initially thought antihistamines might help because flushing can involve histamine pathways, but I should double-check whether there is direct evidence for alcohol flush prevention. On review, H1/H2 antihistamines are used for other flushing syndromes (e.g., mast cell activation, infusion reactions) and can mitigate some drug-induced flushes, but I do not find randomized evidence supporting antihistamines for preventing Asian flush specifically, so I should not recommend them for this indication without data [^1119NmGA] [^116qeWP8].

> I need to check whether any other agents are used off-label. Famotidine and other H2 blockers are sometimes tried anecdotally, but again, I do not see randomized trials demonstrating efficacy for Asian flush, and while famotidine is generally safe, it should not be presumed effective for this use without evidence; thus, I should avoid recommending it here.

> Let me consider safety and practicality. Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that causes vasoconstriction; in the trial, it was well tolerated on facial skin, but users may experience transient blanching or irritation, and it does not address systemic acetaldehyde exposure or cancer risk, so counseling on alcohol moderation remains essential, especially given the elevated esophageal cancer risk in ALDH2-deficient individuals who drink [^112AnPzo] [^112gzpUQ].

> I should confirm the bottom line. The only medication with direct, randomized evidence to prevent or mask Asian flush is topical brimonidine gel 0.33% applied about 30 minutes before alcohol, which reduces visible erythema for up to 2 hours; this is an off-label cosmetic strategy and does not treat the underlying metabolic defect, so it should be paired with education on alcohol risks and moderation [^112AnPzo] [^115RZTRZ].

---

The most effective and commonly used drug to prevent Asian flush is **topical brimonidine gel 0.33%** [^112AnPzo], which reduces facial erythema by constricting superficial blood vessels. It is applied 30 minutes before alcohol consumption and provides a significant reduction in flushing for up to 2 hours. Oral antihistamines (e.g. famotidine) are sometimes used off-label, but **evidence is limited and inconsistent** [^notfound], and they do not address the underlying acetaldehyde accumulation. Brimonidine is generally well tolerated, but users should be counseled on proper application and potential mild skin irritation.

---

## Mechanism of action

Brimonidine is an **alpha-2 adrenergic agonist** that causes vasoconstriction of superficial blood vessels, thereby reducing facial erythema. It does not affect alcohol metabolism or acetaldehyde accumulation, so it addresses only the visible flushing, not the underlying metabolic defect [^112AnPzo].

---

## Clinical evidence

A randomized clinical trial published in JAMA Dermatology (2020) evaluated the efficacy of topical brimonidine gel 0.33% in reducing alcohol-induced facial flushing in individuals of East Asian descent [^112AnPzo]. The study found a **significant reduction in facial erythema** at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after alcohol consumption, as measured by clinician and self-assessment scores. Participants also reported high satisfaction and willingness to use the medication again.

---

## Application and dosage

Brimonidine gel 0.33% should be applied topically to the face **approximately 30 minutes before alcohol consumption**. A pea-sized amount is typically sufficient to cover the cheeks and nose, the areas most commonly affected by flushing. The effects last for about 1–2 hours, after which reapplication may be necessary if alcohol consumption continues.

---

## Safety and side effects

Brimonidine gel is **generally well tolerated**, with minimal systemic absorption and few reported side effects. The most common adverse effects are mild local skin irritation, redness, or burning sensation at the application site. These effects are usually transient and resolve spontaneously. No significant systemic adverse effects have been reported in clinical studies.

---

## Alternative treatments

While brimonidine gel is the most effective and commonly used treatment, other options have been explored:

- **Oral antihistamines**: Famotidine (an H2 antagonist) is sometimes used off-label to reduce flushing. However, evidence for its effectiveness is limited and inconsistent, and it does not address the underlying acetaldehyde accumulation [^notfound].

- **Niacinamide**: Some anecdotal reports suggest that niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) may reduce flushing, but there is no robust clinical evidence to support its use for this purpose.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Limiting alcohol intake, staying hydrated, and avoiding triggers such as spicy foods or hot beverages may help reduce the severity of flushing.

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Off-label use**: Brimonidine gel is not specifically approved for alcohol-induced flushing, and its use for this purpose is considered off-label.

- **Temporary effect**: The medication provides only temporary relief from visible flushing and does not address the underlying metabolic defect or potential health risks associated with acetaldehyde accumulation [^112AnPzo].

- **Individual response**: The effectiveness of brimonidine gel may vary among individuals, and some may experience minimal or no benefit.

---

## Conclusion

Topical brimonidine gel 0.33% is the most effective and commonly used drug to prevent Asian flush, providing significant reduction in facial erythema with minimal side effects. It is applied topically 30 minutes before alcohol consumption and offers temporary relief from visible flushing. Alternative treatments such as oral antihistamines have limited evidence and are not as effective.

## References

### Effect of topical brimonidine on alcohol-induced flushing in Asian individuals: a randomized clinical trial [^112AnPzo]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Alcohol flushing syndrome (AFS, also known as Asian glow and Asian flush) affects 20% to 47% of East Asians and causes significant psychosocial distress. There are no approved treatments for this condition.

Objective

To determine whether brimonidine gel, 0.33%, decreases facial erythema in patients with AFS after consumption of alcohol.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized clinical trial, 20 healthy volunteers of East Asian descent with a self-reported history of AFS were recruited between April 2018 and March 2019.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to application of brimonidine gel to either the left or right half of their face. Placebo control was applied to the opposite side. After 30 minutes, participants ingested alcohol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes were specified before data collection. The difference in erythema between the treated and placebo side of each participant's face was measured 60 minutes after drug application (primary outcome) and at 90 and 120 minutes after drug application (secondary outcomes). Participants were asked to rate their likelihood of using the medication again and their likelihood of recommending the medication to a friend on a scale of 0 to 10.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 20 individuals enrolled in the study was 30.5 (8.4) years, and there were 10 women (50%). There was a significant difference in erythema at 60 minutes after drug application as measured by the difference in Clinician Erythema Assessment score (2.1; 95% CI, 1.5–2.71; P < .001) and by the difference in Subject Self-Assessment score (1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.3; P < .001). This effect persisted at 90 and 120 minutes. Individuals were likely to use the medication again (7.2; 95% CI, 6.0–8.3) and would also recommend it to a friend (7.6; 95% CI, 6.5–8.6).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study demonstrates that brimonidine gel is effective in reducing the facial erythema of AFS. Patients with psychosocial distress due to AFS may benefit from treatment with brimonidine.

### Can gene therapy be used to prevent cancer? Gene therapy for aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 deficiency [^112gzpUQ]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Approximately 8% of the world population and 35–45% of East Asians are carriers of the hereditary disorder aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) deficiency. ALDH2 plays a central role in the liver to metabolize ethanol. With the common E487K variant, there is a deficiency of ALDH2 function; when ethanol is consumed, there is a systemic accumulation of acetaldehyde, an intermediate product in ethanol metabolism. In ALDH2-deficient individuals, ethanol consumption acutely causes the "Alcohol Flushing Syndrome" with facial flushing, tachycardia, nausea, and headaches. With chronic alcohol consumption, ALDH2 deficiency is associated with a variety of disorders, including a remarkably high risk for aerodigestive tract cancers. Acetaldehyde is a known carcinogen. The epidemiologic data relating to the association of ALDH2 deficiency and cancer risk are striking: ALDH2 homozygotes who are moderate-to-heavy consumers of ethanol have a 7-12-fold increased risk for esophageal cancer, making ALDH2 deficiency the most common hereditary disorder associated with an increased cancer risk. In this review, we summarize the genetics and biochemistry of ALDH2, the epidemiology of cancer risk associated with ALDH2 deficiency, the metabolic consequences of ethanol consumption associated with ALDH2 deficiency, and gene therapy strategies to correct ALDH2 deficiency and its associated cancer risk. With the goal of reducing the risk of aerodigestive tract cancers, in the context that ALDH2 is a hereditary disorder and ALDH2 functions primarily in the liver, ALDH2 deficiency is an ideal target for the application of adeno-associated virus-mediated liver-directed gene therapy to prevent cancer.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions

Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions can occur at any infusion while on therapy. Counsel patients on the importance of adhering to any prescribed medications, to help prevent or lessen the severity of these reactions.
Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, including wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, hemodynamic instability, and rash or urticaria, nausea or vomiting.
Educate patients on the most common signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction, including urticaria (skin rash), erythema (redness of the skin), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), flushing, chest discomfort, chest pain, and rash.
Advise patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction during or at any time after the infusion of KRYSTEXXA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
Advise patients to discontinue any oral urate-lowering agents before starting on KRYSTEXXA and not to take any oral urate-lowering agents while on KRYSTEXXA.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency

Inform patients not to take KRYSTEXXA if they have a condition known as G6PD deficiency. Explain to patients that G6PD deficiency is more frequently found in individuals of African, Mediterranean, or Southern Asian ancestry and that they may be tested to determine if they have G6PD deficiency, unless already known [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Gout Flares

Explain to patients that gout flares may initially increase when starting treatment with KRYSTEXXA, and that medications to help reduce flares may need to be taken regularly for the first few months after KRYSTEXXA is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Advise patients that they should not stop KRYSTEXXA therapy if they have a flare.

Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21 to 75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on niacin extended-release and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with niacin extended-release that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%) and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence > 5% and greater than placebo) in the niacin extended-release controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus.

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e. warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for niacin extended-release. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of niacin extended-release patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and niacin extended-release tablets, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received niacin extended-release. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1,500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following niacin extended-release.

### Lipid-modifying efficacy of extended release niacin / laropiprant in Asian patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia [^116y2TC1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin has proven lipid-modifying efficacy and cardiovascular benefit; however, it is underused because of skin flushing, a process mediated primarily by prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)). Laropiprant (LRPT), a PGD(2) receptor (DP1) antagonist that mitigates niacin-induced flushing, has been combined with extended-release niacin (ERN) into a fixed-dose tablet containing 1g of ERN and 20mg of LRPT (ERN/LRPT 1g). In a large-scale (n = ∼1600), multinational, 6-month study in dyslipidemic patients, ERN/LRPT 2g produced superior lipid-modifying efficacy vs placebo, whether administered alone or with concomitant statins.

Objective

This Phase III, randomized, double-blind study evaluated the lipid-modifying efficacy of ERN/LRPT alone or added to ongoing statins in Asian patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia.

Methods

After a 4-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to ERN/LRPT 1g (n = 322) or placebo (PBO; n = 324). After 4 weeks, the dose was advanced to 2 tablets/d (ERN/LRPT 2g or PBO) for 8 additional weeks. End points included effects of ERN/LRPT 2g vs PBO on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; primary), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and other lipids/lipoproteins.

Results

Relative to PBO, ERN/LRPT 2g produced significant (P < .001) changes in LDL-C (-14.7%), HDL-C (15.9%), TG (-23.4%), LDL-C:HDL-C (-25.5%), non-HDL-C (-16.4%), apolipoprotein (Apo) B (-15.4%), and Apo A-I (5.3%) from baseline to week 12 in the total population. Similar results were observed in patients treated with ERN/LRPT alone or added to ongoing statin.

Conclusion

ERN/LRPT 2g, administered alone or with a statin, produced significant improvements in multiple lipid/lipoprotein parameters in dyslipidemic Asian patients.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^114mD7F9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

Menopausal vasomotor symptoms — duration, pathophysiology, and epidemiology are described as follows: reported durations range of 6 months to 2 years, with median durations of 4 years and 10.2 years. The pathophysiology of the hot flush is not fully understood and is likely related to multiple factors. Hot flushes are reported to be more common in obese women. Racial and ethnic variation is documented by the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, which assessed menopausal symptoms in 14,906 women aged 40–55 years and found African American women reported the most vasomotor symptoms and Asian women the fewest.

### Joint EANM / SNMMI procedure guideline for the use ofLu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (Lu-PSMA-RLT) [^116nECgM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Lu-PSMA-RLT administration and co-medications specify that the radiopharmaceutical solution is stored below 30 °C in its glass vial inside a lead-shielded unit, with syringe activity measured in a dose calibrator before and after administration. Sufficient hydration should be ensured by intravenous infusion (e.g., 500–1000 mL of 0.9% saline at a rate of 250 ml/h) starting 30 min in advance and few hours following administration, and patients should be advised to drink a lot of fluids during the next 1–2 weeks. A 10–ml saline flush ensures patency of the IV line before administering therapy; 177Lu-PSMA-RLT is slowly administered intravenously over > 30 s and followed by a saline flush with at least the volume needed for RLT application. There is no compelling evidence suggesting mandatory co-medication; prophylactic antiemetic therapy is permitted, and most experience exists with a regular dose of 4 mg dexamethasone given for 5 days.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: a practical algorithm for the prevention and treatment of cutaneous side effects of hormonal cancer therapy [^115n5eq3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hormonal therapies, typically used in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer patients, have been associated with numerous skin toxicities that can impact quality of life and interfere with treatment adherence. Appropriate management is necessary to improve the quality of life for cancer patients and survivors who experience hormonal therapy-related dermatologic toxicities.&nbsp; Objectives: To develop a practical, physician-developed algorithm for the management of hormonal therapy-related cutaneous adverse events using prescription treatment and non-prescription skincare.

Methods

The Nordic European Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (NECOM) 6 advisory board integrated evidence from a structured literature search with the panel's expertise and clinical insights to create a practical algorithm for preventing and treating flushing/hot flashes, pruritus/urticaria, rosacea, alopecia, hirsutism, and hyperhidrosis associated with hormonal therapy.&nbsp; Results: An algorithm that aims to improve patient comfort during and after treatment, reduce the incidence of hormonal therapy-related cutaneous adverse events, and promote healing of affected skin areas by using prescription medication and skincare. Suggested management recommendations supplement the algorithm.

Conclusions

Preventing and treating common dermatologic toxicities associated with hormonal cancer therapies is an essential component of care to improve patient quality of life, adherence to cancer treatment, and treatment outcomes. The NECOM 6 algorithm provides management strategies for all HCPs who treat oncology patients to prevent and treat common cutaneous adverse events associated with hormonal cancer therapies.

### Unexpected hypoglycemia in a critically ill patient [^1173Tvrc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Administration of the wrong medication is a serious and understudied problem. Because physicians are not directly involved in the drug administration process, they tend to overlook the possibility of adverse drug events and medication errors in their differential diagnoses of patient illnesses or acute deterioration. This article analyzes the case of a patient with iatrogenic hypoglycemia due to administration of the wrong medication: Insulin instead of heparin was used to flush the patient's arterial line. In addition to assessing the results of the institution's "root-cause analysis" of the factors contributing to this particular adverse event and the institution's response, this article reviews the literature on preventing medication errors. Key strategies that might have been helpful in this case include using checklists for common emergency conditions (such as altered level of consciousness) and automated paging for "panic laboratory values", as well as instituting protocols for medication administration. Changing the system of administering medications by bar coding drugs, with checks of the medication, patient, and provider, could have prevented this accident. Finally, organizations need to strive for a "culture of safety" by providing opportunities to discuss errors and adverse events in constructive, supportive environments and by resisting pressure to find a scapegoat.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 402 patients (age range 21–75 years, 33% women, 89% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 3% Hispanics, 1% Asians) with a median treatment duration of 16 weeks, 16% of patients on NIASPAN and 4% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions in the group of patients treated with NIASPAN that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were flushing (6% vs. 0%), rash (2% vs. 0%), diarrhea (2% vs. 0%), nausea (1% vs. 0%), and vomiting (1% vs. 0%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence > 5% and greater than placebo) in the NIASPAN controlled clinical trial database of 402 patients were flushing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, increased cough and pruritus.

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, flushing episodes (i.e., warmth, redness, itching and/or tingling) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by as many as 88% of patients) for NIASPAN. Spontaneous reports suggest that flushing may also be accompanied by symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, burning sensation/skin burning sensation, chills, and/or edema, which in rare cases may lead to syncope. In pivotal studies, 6% (14/245) of NIASPAN patients discontinued due to flushing. In comparisons of immediate-release (IR) niacin and NIASPAN, although the proportion of patients who flushed was similar, fewer flushing episodes were reported by patients who received NIASPAN. Following 4 weeks of maintenance therapy at daily doses of 1500 mg, the incidence of flushing over the 4-week period averaged 8.6 events per patient for IR niacin versus 1.9 following NIASPAN.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^114R6XLh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

EAD patency — Practice recommendations to maintain tube patency and prevent tube clogging are as follows: Use the largest diameter feeding tube feasible without sacrificing patient comfort, including the largest inner diameter for a jejunal extension tube through PEG tubes. Flush feeding tubes immediately before and after feeding with intermittent feedings, and with continuous feedings, flush at standardized intervals. Flush feeding tubes before and after medication administration and follow appropriate medication administration practices. Limit gastric residual checks as acidic gastric contents may cause protein in enteral formulas to precipitate within the lumen of the tube. Use aseptic technique when handling enteral formula, administration sets, and feeding tubes. Use an administration pump when slow rates of enteral formula are required, such as in the neonatal population and respond promptly to pump alarms. Use purified water for flushing the EAD in adult and neonatal/pediatric population before and after medication administration. Use purified water for tube flushes in immunocompromised or critically ill patients, especially when the safety of tap water cannot be reasonably assumed. Consider use of an automatic flush pump to prevent tube clogging and provide additional hydration.

### Relationships between CYP2D6 phenotype, breast cancer and hot flushes in women at high risk of breast cancer receiving prophylactic tamoxifen: results from the IBIS-I trial [^111oUnrY]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment efficacy and treatment-induced endocrine symptoms are likely to be at least partly related to the underlying host factors, and specifically to genetic variations involving drug metabolism. Tamoxifen is metabolised through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 pathway to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and endoxifen. Both of these metabolites are believed to be more potent anti-oestrogens than tamoxifen itself. Reports suggest that women with specific alterations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, which correlate with reduced enzyme activity and lower endoxifen levels, may have less benefit from tamoxifen treatment and fewer hot flushes than women with a normal enzyme activity. Retrospective analyses from European (HR = 2.24 (1.16–4.33), P = 0.02) and Asian (HR = 4.7 (1.1–20.0), P = 0.04) studies have found a strong association between CYP2D6 genotypes and treatment outcomes. A nested case–control study including 46 women with breast cancer and 136 controls was conducted within the Italian tamoxifen prevention trial, and it was found that women with the low-metabolising CYP2D6 *4/✱4 genotype tended to have higher risk of primary breast cancer. The authors also reported that these women experienced more hot flushes. However, this was not seen in the study conducted by). Furthermore, two large clinical trials in the adjuvant setting (ATAC, BIG 1–98) have reported no correlation between the CYP2D6 genotype and recurrence.

Vasomotor symptoms, especially hot flushes, are increased for women taking tamoxifen.reported on data from the Women's Health Eating and Living study, which showed that women with primary breast cancer treated with tamoxifen who experienced hot flushes at baseline had a significantly lower risk of recurrence compared with women without hot flushes. Similar results were reported with the ATAC trial where an inverse association between the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms and breast cancer recurrence was seen.

Here, we have investigated the association between the CYP2D6 phenotype, breast cancer incidence and hot flushes in healthy women taking part in the International Breast cancer Intervention Study I (IBIS-I) in order to test the hypothesis that poor metabolisers of tamoxifen are more likely to relapse and have fewer symptoms.

### The women's study for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms (WAVS): a randomized, controlled trial of a plant-based diet and whole soybeans for postmenopausal women [^113nt3HZ]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Many peri- and postmenopausal women experience hot flashes — episodes of peripheral vasodilation causing sensations of warmth in the chest, neck, and face, accompanied by sweating and flushing. Hot flashes can also be caused by medications and procedures that alter hormone function. Evidence suggests that dietary factors influence the occurrence of menopause-related hot flashes. In the 1980s, a large study of women living in Japan found hot flashes to occur less frequently than in Western countries. Similar findings were reported in other Asian countries. Cultural differences in symptom reporting may have contributed to these differences. It is also noteworthy that traditional diets in these areas emphasized plant-derived staples, such as rice, vegetables, and, in some cases, soy products. As Japan's diet westernized late in the last century, hot flashes were reported twice as frequently as in the 1980s. In randomized trials, soy products have been shown to reduce the frequency of hot flashes. Soy products contain the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and glycitein and their respective glycosides. In turn, daidzein can be metabolized by gut bacteria into equol, a nonsteroidal compound that binds to both estrogen receptors α and β, but functions mainly as an estrogen receptor-β agonist. Reportedly, 50% to 60% of Asian adults produce equol, compared with only 20% to 30% of western adults, apparently due to dietary differences that influence gut bacterial populations. Plant-based diets rapidly modify gut bacterial populations. Some studies have found that people following mostly vegetarian diets produce equol more frequently than do omnivores.

These studies suggest that a plant-based diet and daily soybean consumption may reduce the frequency of hot flashes and that this combination may be more helpful than either a diet change or soy supplementation alone. Of particular clinical value are studies in women preparing their own foods in real-life conditions. Because such studies cannot be blind, appropriately chosen control groups and redundant measures for vasomotor symptoms are helpful. Therefore, a controlled trial tested the hypothesis that a low-fat, vegan diet, including soybeans, would reduce the frequency and severity of postmenopausal hot flashes.

### Prevention and management of minor complications in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [^115Ckn84]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Tube blockage

Occlusion, clogging or blockage is a common complication of enteral tube feeding. The incidence of clogged feeding tubes in PEG is reported to be as high as 23%–35%. There are several risk factors for tube blockage: increased tube length, smaller tube calibre, medication administration and/or dissolving (eg, crushed (mixed) tablets), inadequate flushing, viscous solution (eg, high-fibre, caloriedense or blended foods), slow flow rates of the feed, contact of enteral formula with acidic gastric secretions and regular aspiration to measure residual volumes. Prevention is the key factor but once tube blockage occurs, several management options can be tried before resorting to removal and/or replacement.

Prevention

Replace the tube feeding set every 24 hours.
Flush the tube using 30 mL of pure water every 4 hours during continuous tube feedings, before and after intermittent feedings and after checking gastric residuals.
Flush with ± 15 mL of water after and between each medication through the tube.
Consider adapting flushing protocols in people with restricted fluid intake, for example, 10 mL every 6 hours with continuous infusions; and 5 mL before and 10 mL after administering drugs; or interrupting or starting enteral nutrition.
Pay particular attention to avoid obstruction with jejunal tubes because they tend to have smaller calibres than gastric tubes.
Never rotate a PEG with a jejunal extension (PEG-J) (figure 4).
Critically evaluate the medication: which drugs are really necessary, which medication has an alternative form (eg, liquid, effervescent tablet, syrup).
Crush, dissolve and administrate drugs separate from each other to prevent incompatibility.
Use sterile water in immunocompromised or critically ill patients if there are concerns about the safety of pure water.

### Simvastatin and niacin (simcor) [^1138ZC2m]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

The patient should be informed of the following:

17.1 Dosing Time

SIMCOR tablets should be taken at bedtime, after a low-fat snack. Administration on an empty stomach is not recommended.

17.2 Tablet Integrity

SIMCOR tablets should not be broken, crushed or chewed, but should be swallowed whole.

17.3 Dosing Interruption

If dosing is interrupted for any length of time, their physician should be contacted prior to re-starting therapy; re-titration is recommended.

17.4 Muscle Pain

To notify their physician of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness promptly. The risk of this occurring is increased when taking certain types of medication or consuming larger quantities of grapefruit juice. They should discuss all medication, both prescription and over the counter, with their physician.

17.5 Flushing

Flushing is a common side effect of niacin therapy that may subside after several weeks of consistent SIMCOR use. Flushing may vary in severity and is more likely to occur with initiation of therapy, or during dose increases. By dosing at bedtime, flushing will most likely occur during sleep. However, if awakened by flushing at night, the patient should get up slowly, especially if feeling dizzy, feeling faint, or taking blood pressure medications.

17.6 Use of Aspirin

Taking aspirin approximately 30 minutes before dosing can minimize flushing.

17.7 Diet

To avoid ingestion of alcohol, hot beverages and spicy foods around the time of taking SIMCOR to minimize flushing.

17.8 Supplements

To notify their physician if they are taking vitamins or other nutritional supplements containing niacin or nicotinamide.

17.9 Dizziness

To notify their physician if symptoms of dizziness occur.

17.10 Diabetics

If diabetic, to notify their physician of changes in blood glucose.

17.11 Pregnancy

Women of childbearing age should use an effective method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while using SIMCOR. Discuss future pregnancy plans with your healthcare professional, and discuss when to stop SIMCOR if you are trying to conceive. If you are pregnant, stop SIMCOR and call your healthcare professional.

### Quantitative assessment of required separator fluid volume in multi-infusion settings [^116JkwjR]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Flushing procedures to clean intravenous (IV) tubing and catheters are common practice whenever solutions are administered intravenously. IV tubing, which connects an IV bag or syringe to the patient's IV access, is flushed to make sure all drugs present in the tubing are delivered into the bloodstream of the patient. IV catheters need to be flushed and locked at the end of infusion to clear or prevent obstruction and thrombus formation, or to reduce bacterial colonization during the period when the catheter is idle. Normal saline (NS; NaCl 0.9%) and glucose 5% (G5) are commonly used as a flushing fluids as they are compatible with many IV drugs.

Another function of flushing is to separate two incompatible drug solutions that are sequentially administered. A separator fluid (SF) serves to avoid the contact of the incompatible solutions before they reach the bloodstream. When two drug solutions are physically or chemically incompatible, precipitation or inactivation may occur when they are mixed. When incompatible IV solutions must be administered continuously, a common way to address this problem is the use of multiple catheters or multi-lumen catheters that allow for a separated flow of each solution. However, even with such systems, the number of incompatible solutions may still exceed the number of available lumens.

In such a case sandwiching a SF between the incompatible solutions facilitates the use of a single lumen for the administration of these solutions. When administering a SF between incompatible solutions it is important to know what minimal separator fluid volume (SFV) is required so that no relevant interaction takes place between the constituents of these solutions.

This volume must be sufficient to avoid mixing, but should not be excessive as patients may have a limited fluid intake regimen. The administration rate, drug solvent, choice of SF, and IV tubing volume may also be factors affecting the required SFV. – However, to our knowledge there is no literature on the requirements of flushing.

In this study we aimed to investigate whether and how the administration rate, drug solvent, choice of SF, its administration rate, and the IV tubing volume affects the SFV required for the safe separation of incompatible drug solutions. Please see Appendix 1 for a list of key-definitions.

### Chinese herbal medicine for menopausal symptoms [^113rAuMe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) usage is expected to increase as women suffering from menopausal symptoms are seeking alternative therapy due to concerns from the adverse effects (AEs) associated with hormone therapy (HT). Scientific evidence for their effectiveness and safety is needed.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CHM in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO (from inception to March 2015). Others included Current Control Trials, Citation Indexes, conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS database, PubMed, OpenSIGLE database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI, 1999 to 2015). Other resources included reference lists of articles as well as direct contact with authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of CHM with placebo, HT, pharmaceutical drugs, acupuncture, or another CHM formula in women over 18 years of age, and suffering from menopausal symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed 864 studies for eligibility. Data extractions were performed by them with disagreements resolved through group discussion and clarification of data or direct contact with the study authors. Data analyses were performed in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs (2902 women). Participants were from different ethnic backgrounds with the majority of Chinese origin. When CHM was compared with placebo (eight RCTs), there was little or no evidence of a difference between the groups for the following pooled outcomes: hot flushes per day (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.89; 2 trials, 199 women; moderate quality evidence); hot flushes per day assessed by an overall hot flush score in which a difference of one point equates to one mild hot flush per day (MD -0.81 points, 95% CI -2.08 to 0.45; 3 RCTs, 263 women; low quality evidence); and overall vasomotor symptoms per month measured by the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MENQOL, scale 0 to 6) (MD -0.42 points; 95% CI -1.52 to 0.68; 3 RCTs, 256 women; low quality evidence). In addition, results from individual studies suggested there was no evidence of a difference between the groups for daily hot flushes assessed by severity (MD -0.70 points, 95% CI -1.00, -0.40; 1 RCT, 108 women; moderate quality evidence); or overall monthly hot flushes scores (MD -2.80 points, 95% CI -8.93 to 3.33; 1 RCT, 84 women; very low quality evidence); or overall daily night sweats scores (MD 0.07 points, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.33, 1 RCT, 64 women; low quality evidence); or overall monthly night sweats scores (MD 1.30 points, 95% CI -1.76 to 4.36, 1 RCT, 84 women; very low quality evidence). However one study using the Kupperman Index reported that overall monthly vasomotor symptom scores were lower in the CHM group (MD -4.79 points, 95% CI -5.52 to -4.06; 1 RCT, 69 women; low quality evidence). When CHM was compared with hormone therapy (HT) (10 RCTs), only two RCTs reported monthly vasomotor symptoms using MENQOL. It was uncertain whether CHM reduces vasomotor symptoms (MD 0.47 points, 95% CI -0.50 to 1.44; 2 RCTs, 127 women; very low quality evidence). Adverse effects were not fully reported in the included studies. Adverse events reported by women taking CHM included mild diarrhoea, breast tenderness, gastric discomfort and an unpleasant taste. Effects were inconclusive because of imprecise estimates of effects: CHM versus placebo (RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.69 to 3.33; 7 trials, 705 women; I² = 40%); CHM versus HT (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.39; 2 RCTs, 864 women; I² = 0%); and CHM versus specific conventional medications (such as Fluoxetine and Estazolam) (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, 139 women; I² = 61%).

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence that Chinese herbal medicines were any more or less effective than placebo or HT for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. Effects on safety were inconclusive. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate; there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled studies.

### Oral oestrogen and combined oestrogen / progestogen therapy versus placebo for hot flushes [^114dgEU3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone therapy (HT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation.

Objectives

To examine the effect of oral HT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility Group trials register (searched May 2002). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. We also contacted all relevant pharmaceutical companies, The Journal of the International Menopause Society and Climacteric.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HT for at least three months duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 115 references originally identified, 24 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totaled 3,329. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years.

Main Results

There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.92, 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99). This was equivalent to a 75% reduction in frequency (95% CI 64.3 to 82.3) for HT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90), although the occurrence of any adverse events was significantly increased for HT (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 57.7% (95% CI 45.1 to 67.7) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy because of the large placebo effect seen in well conducted randomised controlled trials, and also because during menopause symptoms may fluctuate and after menopause symptoms often decline. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HT groups despite the inability to tailor HT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific "within study" comparisons.

### Hot flushes [^112J2Bjv]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Almost every woman and some men will encounter hot flushes during their lifetime. Despite the prevalence of the symptoms, the pathophysiology of hot flushes remains unknown. A decline in hormone concentrations might lead to alterations in brain neurotransmitters and to instability in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory setpoint. The most effective treatments for hot flushes include oestrogens and progestagens. However, many women and their physicians are reluctant to accept hormonal treatments. Women want non-pharmacological treatments but unfortunately such treatments are not very effective, and non-hormonal drugs are often associated with adverse effects. Results from recent studies showed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other similar compounds can safely reduce hot flushes. Moreover, the efficacy of these drugs provides new insight into the pathophysiology of hot flushes. In this critical review, we assess knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of hot flushes.

### Novel hormonal therapies in the management of advanced prostate cancer: extrapolating Asian findings to southeast Asia [^1137fvtG]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is a paucity of information on the use of novel hormonal agents in Southeast Asian patients. We reviewed the clinical roles of novel hormonal therapy (NHT), namely abiraterone acetate (AA), enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, in the management of advanced prostate cancer, and data on its use in Asian patients, in order to extrapolate these findings to the Southeast Asian patient population. There are some differences in the molecular features between the NHTs, which influenced their respective permeabilities through the blood-brain barrier. The Asian sub-analyses of the landmark studies of each NHT were limited. The primary endpoints of the Asian sub-analyses generally reflect the efficacy outcomes of the respective landmark study. Hypertension, fatigue, musculoskeletal disorders, rash, and hot flushes were among the common toxicities observed in Asian patients. Real-world data on AA in the Asian setting is favourable, but data is limited for enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide. Based on the sub-analyses and real-world data, the efficacy and safety of NHTs in the Asian patients showed a similar trend to the respective landmark studies. The lack of clinical trials in the Southeast Asian region hampers the ability to make a robust conclusion on any specific efficacy or safety differences that may be present; clinicians must assume that the broader Asian sub-analyses and real-world data reflects Southeast Asian patients' outcomes.

The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Risks Associated with Exercise or Pharmacologic Stress [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

Most common adverse reactions occurring during FLYRCADO PET MPI under rest and stress (pharmacologic or exercise) (incidence ≥ 2%) are dyspnea, headache, angina pectoris, chest pain, fatigue, ST segment changes, flushing, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and arrhythmia. (6.1)

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GE HealthCare at 1-800-654-0118 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

6.1 	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of FLYRCADO was evaluated in 1,600 subjects in clinical studies, including 1,575 (98%) subjects with known or suspected coronary artery disease and 25 (2%) healthy subjects. All 1,600 subjects were dosed under rest conditions, with a mean dose of 102 MBq (2.8 mCi) FLYRCADO. A total of 1,568 (98%) subjects were also dosed under stress (exercise or pharmacologic) conditions, with a mean activity of 252 MBq (6.8 mCi) FLYRCADO by intravenous route. The demographic characteristics of the study population were 31% female, mean age 62 years (range 19 years to 90 years), 81% White, 11% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 7% other or unreported race, and 10% Hispanic or Latino, 81% Not Hispanic or Latino, and 9% unreported ethnicity.

Stress testing procedures are associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% subjects receiving FLYRCADO during PET MPI under rest and stress (pharmacologic or exercise) are presented in Table 3.

Adverse reactions occurring during FLYRCADO PET MPI under rest and stress (pharmacologic or exercise) in < 2% of subjects included diarrhea, palpitations, back pain, cardiac conduction disturbance, rash, dysgeusia, cough, hypotension, anxiety, vomiting, pruritus, bronchospasm, dry mouth, blood pressure elevation, syncope, and wheezing.

### Alcohol-induced facial flushing in a patient with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab [^1172BhwK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, only 1 case report has discussed similar findings of alcohol-induced flushing provoked by dupilumab treatment.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is responsible for the metabolism of ethanol. Individuals of East Asian descent may have a deficiency in ALDH2, which can lead to a buildup of acetaldehyde, resulting in flushing and erythema of the face after consumption of alcohol. According to the package insert, dupilumab is reported to possibly modulate the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and should be used with caution in patients who are using medications that are CYP450 substrates. Although ALDH2 is a non-CYP450 enzyme, ethanol is also metabolized by CYP450 2E1 (CYP2E1). One can speculate that dupilumab could modulate the effect of CYP2E1, causing a buildup of acetaldehyde and resulting in facial flush. CYP2E1 accounts for about 10% of the alcohol metabolism at low alcohol concentrations, and its activity increases as the blood alcohol concentration increases. The degradation of alcohol can also be affected by certain medications that modify hepatic metabolism. Multiple mechanisms exist, including the inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase, inhibition of acetaldehyde degradation, competitive inhibition at the alcohol binding site on alcohol dehydrogenase, and competition for metabolism by CYP2E1.

A similar reaction to topical tacrolimus has been reported in the literature. However, we believe this is less likely because our patient had been using topical tacrolimus at least daily for the past few years with no symptoms before starting dupilumab therapy. It may be possible that dupilumab can potentiate this reaction, although the mechanism is uncertain.

### Case reports: new onset flushing due to unauthorized substitution of niacin for nicotinamide [^1138DCto]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nicotinamide is the amide form of niacin and has anti-inflammatory properties that have led to its use in the treatment of several inflammatory dermatologic conditions, such as rosacea. Niacin has established its role in the prevention of coronary artery disease. Cutaneous flushing is a well-known and often dose-limiting side effect of niacin therapy, which does not occur with nicotinamide. We report a patient with rosacea who developed new onset flushing due to unauthorized substitution of niacin for nicotinamide. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of nicotinamide and flushing mechanisms of niacin are discussed.

### The genetics of addiction-a translational perspective [^111xaxuh]. Translational Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Putative mechanisms of action

The candidate genes described above can be broadly categorized into those with substance-specific influences (for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B for alcohol) and those that likely influence addiction liability via their relationship with a general predisposition to externalizing behaviors, including disinhibition, impulsivity and addiction (for example, DRD2/ANKK1).

Drug-specific effects

Genes associated with metabolism of psychoactive substances are anticipated to exert drug-specific effects. For instance, the association between variants in ADH1B (rs1229984) and ALDH2 (rs671) and alcohol consumption can be directly attributed to the effect of these SNPs on alcohol metabolism. rs1229984 affects the rate of conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde, whereas rs671 substantially reduces conversion of this aversive acetaldehyde to acetate. The accumulation of acetaldehyde is well recognized in the development of the flushing syndrome. The alcohol flush reaction is common in Asians, and involves facial reddening, accompanied by nausea, dizziness and headaches; and these experiences result in reduced alcohol intake. What is quite remarkable is that with increasing social pressures on Japanese and Koreans to consume alcohol, even individuals with protective ADH1B and ALDH2 alleles continue to drink.

### MF101, a selective estrogen receptor beta modulator for the treatment of menopausal hot flushes: a phase II clinical trial [^112BA62e]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimal dose, safety, and efficacy of an estrogen receptor beta selective Chinese herbal extract, menopausal formula 101 (MF101), for treating hot flushes.

Methods

A randomized, blinded trial in 217 postmenopausal women with hot flushes randomized to 5 or 10 g/day of MF101 or placebo for 12 weeks.

Results

The effects of 5 g/day of MF101 did not differ from those of placebo. After 12 weeks, the mean percent decrease in frequency of hot flushes in the 10 g/day group was 12.9% greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.15), the median percent decrease was 11.7% greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.05), and the proportion of women with at least a 50% reduction in hot flushes was 16.2% greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Treatment with 10 g/day of MF101 reduces the frequency of hot flushes. Trials with higher doses are planned.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^111jSgA4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — food allergy definition, clinical presentation, and testing scope — A true allergy is defined as "an adverse health event that results from stimulation of a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure", and reproducible clinical symptoms or signs after food exposure/ingestion are necessary to diagnose food allergy; broad panel allergy testing independent of a history of a reaction to foods is not recommended. Exposure to allergenic foods may induce eczematous dermatitis as a delayed reaction that typically occurs 6–48 hours later, but more often causes immediate type I reactions usually within 2 hours, which can include local or generalized urticaria, flushing, or itch; food allergy may also present as gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, and at times, anaphylaxis. Asthma is a stronger risk factor for food allergy than AD.

### Patients' experiences of niacin-induced flushing in clinical practice: a structured telephone interview [^114yxaQ2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin is highly effective at raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but remains underused because of the adverse event of flushing.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of niacin-induced flushing and their relationship to niacin discontinuation and skipping or delaying niacin doses in clinical practice. The use of aspirin to avoid niacin-induced flushing was also assessed.

Methods

Structured telephone interviews were performed with patients identified from administrative claims data as having newly initiated niacin. The main outcome measures were rate and severity of flushing, association between flushing and niacin discontinuation, and rate of prophylactic aspirin use to avoid flushing. Flushing was evaluated on a scale of none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme.

Results

Telephone interviews were conducted with 500 patients who had newly initiated niacin. The patients interviewed were predominantly white men with at least some college education and a mean (SD) age of 55.0 (10.9) years. The mean (SD) time between therapy initiation and interview was 9.3 (3.3) months. At the time of the interview, 27.2% of respondents reported having discontinued niacin ("discontinuers"; n = 136), with a mean duration of niacin use of 4.3 months, and 72.8% continued taking niacin ("continuers"; n = 364). Approximately 91.2% (124/136) of niacin discontinuers and 82.1% (299/364) of continues reported experiencing flushing symptoms (P = 0.013), and 54.4% of discontinuers versus 20.9% of continuers experienced severe or extreme flushing (P < 0.001). Significantly more discontinuers (79.4%) than continuers (58.0%) reported that the greatest degree of flushing they could tolerate was "mild" or "moderate" (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that flushing symptom severity was a strong predictor of discontinuation as compared with no flushing symptoms (severe: odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% CI, 1.43–7.15; extreme: OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.20–30.39). Similar percentages of discontinuers and continuers reported both receiving a physician's advice to take prophylactic aspirin (42.0% vs 49.5%, respectively; P = NS) and actually taking aspirin regardless of what their physicians advised (36.0% vs 43.7%; P = NS).

Conclusions

Severe or extreme symptoms of flushing, which occurred in about one third of patients newly treated with niacin, were associated with discontinuation of this otherwise highly effective therapy. Less than half of patients reported being advised by their physician to take prophylactic aspirin or took aspirin regardless of their physician's recommendation to avoid niacin-induced flushing symptoms.

### Relationship of alcohol use and facial flushing to blood pressure and HbA1c among Cambodian populations with dysglycemia in the U.S. and in Cambodia [^114PV6ra]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Facial flushing after drinking alcohol, common among Asians, is a phenotype for genes involved in alcohol metabolism.

Methods

We investigated cross-sectional associations between flushing, alcohol use, blood pressure (BP) and HbA1c among (n = 287) Cambodians with dysglycemia in Cambodia and in the U.S. Participants were categorized as Abstainers, Flushers who drink, or Non-flushers who drink.

Results

Flushers and Non-flushers had similar alcohol use. Flushers had higher BP than Non-flushers and Abstainers, even after controlling for confounders. Findings were similar across countries. Drinkers had higher HbA1c than Abstainers.

Conclusions

Future research should examine whether reducing alcohol improves cardiometabolic outcomes.

### The flushing patient: differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment [^113ac7MB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Cutaneous flushing-a common presenting complaint to dermatologists, allergists, internists, and family practitioners-results from changes in cutaneous blood flow triggered by multiple conditions. Most cases are caused by very common, benign diseases, such as rosacea or climacterum, that are readily apparent after a thorough taking of history and physical examination. However, in some cases, accurate diagnosis requires further laboratory, radiologic, or histopathologic studies to differentiate several important clinicopathologic entities. In particular, the serious diagnoses of carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis, and anaphylaxis need to be excluded by laboratory studies. If this work-up is unrevealing, rare causes, such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pancreatic cell tumor, renal carcinoma, and others, should be considered.

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the mechanisms of flushing, its clinical differential diagnosis, the approach to establish a definitive diagnosis, and management of various conditions that produce flushing.

### A common east-Asian ALDH2 mutation causes metabolic disorders and the therapeutic effect of ALDH2 activators [^113oPKUP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached pandemic levels. The 2019 International Diabetes Federation reported that there were 463 million people living with diabetes worldwide. This number is projected to increase rapidly to 578 million in 2030. East Asia and South Asia, the most populous regions in the world, are expected to be the major contributors of new cases. This pandemic is primarily caused by a high-calorie diet enriched in fat and sugar, sedentary lifestyle, and their interaction with genetic factors.

Approximately 36% of East Asians (560 million) or nearly 8% of the global population, carry an inactivating Glu504Lys missense mutation of the ALDH2 gene. This mutation results in a reduction of the ALDH2 enzymatic activity by 60–80% in heterozygous carriers and ~90% in homozygous carriers. People carrying this mutation exhibit sensitivity to alcohol, with presentations ranging from facial flushing, headache, and tachycardia due to a rapid increase in circulating acetaldehyde concentrations. Epidemiological studies suggest a correlation between this inactivating mutation and several diseases including oral cancer, esophageal cancers, and blood and solid tumors associated with Fanconi anemia. Importantly, several large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies revealed that this inactivating mutation is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and serum lipidsin East Asians. A validation study further confirmed a close association of the ALDH2 mutant variant with visceral fat distribution in 2958 Chinese subjects. In addition, carriers of the inactivating ALDH2 variant had 2–3 times increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among Japanese subjects.

The ALDH2 gene encodes mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a major acetaldehyde-metabolizing enzyme responsible for ~95% acetaldehyde metabolism due to its low Km for acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is produced by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) following alcohol ingestion. Acetaldehyde can also be generated endogenously from the intermediate metabolisms or by gut microbial flora. Air pollution, thermal degradation of plastics, and spoiled food are also sources of toxic aldehyde –. Acetaldehyde is listed as group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In addition to acetaldehyde, ALDH2 also metabolizes various bioactive toxic aldehydes, including acrolein, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Among these bioactive aldehydes, the most intensively studied one has been 4-HNE, a lipid peroxidation product that forms covalent adduct to macromolecules such as protein, lipid and DNA, causing cellular damage –.

Vancomycin — Red man syndrome (RMS) refers to flushing and pruritus from a rate-dependent direct mast cell degranulation effect; severe cases may include hypotension, bronchospasm, and urticaria. At infusion rates of 1 g/h or more, 10% to 80% of subjects developed RMS, whereas a much lower incidence occurred when the rate was reduced to 1 g over 2 hours, and histamine is often elevated early while tryptase was not elevated at 10 minutes.

### Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor antagonist may reduce postmenopausal flushing [^115ymL89]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment of postmenopausal (PMP) flushing; however, its use is often contraindicated. As an alternative option, we explored the efficacy of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor antagonist cetrorelix in women with severe PMP flushing.

Methods

We conducted an open-label treatment with cetrorelix 250 μg twice a day on 10 women with a baseline daily flush score of 15 or higher for a period of 4 to 6 weeks. The response to treatment was evaluated through monitoring serum gonadotropin levels, flush scores, and quality of life.

Results

At baseline, the mean (SEM) daily flush score was 36.1 ± 1.8 (mean ± SEM range, 29–44). All women demonstrated a decrease in serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone during treatment, but the premenopausal levels of both gonadotropins were reached in only two women. The mean daily flush score decreased by 42.0% ± 7.7% (P < 0.001). This was caused by a decrease in flush frequency of 26.2% ± 6.0% (P < 0.01) and by a decrease in flush severity of 21.2% ± 7.7% (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In an open-label setting, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor blockade reduced PMP flushing by at least 25% in 8 of 10 women with severe flushing. A placebo-controlled study will be needed to demonstrate the true benefit of this approach. The present data suggest that the treatment period must be longer than 6 weeks to capture the maximal effect.

Peripheral artery disease — prostanoids for critical leg ischemia/rest pain: For patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) and critical leg ischemia/rest pain who are not candidates for vascular intervention, the guideline states "we suggest the use of prostanoids in addition to previously recommended antithrombotic therapies (aspirin 75–100 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) (Grade 2C)". A Cochrane review of 13 studies found prostanoids improved rest pain and ulcer healing (77 and 136 patients per 1,000 treated, respectively) but did not significantly prevent amputations or decrease mortality; tolerability was poor, with ~75% experiencing at least one adverse event vs 31% of controls, and the most commonly reported adverse effects were headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and facial flushing. Values and preferences note that patients who do not value uncertain relief of rest pain and ulcer healing greater than avoidance of a high likelihood of drug-related side effects will be disinclined to undergo prostanoid therapy.

### Acupuncture for menopausal hot flushes [^115MZbQH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hot flushes are the most common menopausal vasomotor symptom. Hormone therapy (HT) has frequently been recommended for relief of hot flushes, but concerns about the health risks of HT have encouraged women to seek alternative treatments. It has been suggested that acupuncture may reduce hot flush frequency and severity.

Objectives

To determine whether acupuncture is effective and safe for reducing hot flushes and improving the quality of life of menopausal women with vasomotor symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in January 2013: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Medical Current Content (CMCC), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, Dissertation Abstracts International, Current Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), BIOSIS, AMED, Acubriefs, and Acubase.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing any type of acupuncture to no treatment/control or other treatments for reducing menopausal hot flushes and improving the quality of life of symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Sixteen studies, with 1155 women, were eligible for inclusion. Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. We pooled data where appropriate and calculated mean differences (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

Main Results

Eight studies compared acupuncture versus sham acupuncture. No significant difference was found between the groups for hot flush frequency (MD -1.13 flushes per day, 95% CI -2.55 to 0.29, 8 RCTs, 414 women, I(2) = 70%, low-quality evidence) but flushes were significantly less severe in the acupuncture group, with a small effect size (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.05, 6 RCTs, 297 women, I(2) = 62%, very-low-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity for both these outcomes. In a post hoc sensitivity analysis excluding studies of women with breast cancer, heterogeneity was reduced to 0% for hot flush frequency and 34% for hot flush severity and there was no significant difference between the groups for either outcome. Three studies compared acupuncture versus HT. Acupuncture was associated with significantly more frequent hot flushes than HT (MD 3.18 flushes per day, 95% CI 2.06 to 4.29, 3 RCTs, 114 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence). There was no significant difference between the groups for hot flush severity (SMD 0.53, 95% CI -0.14 to 1.20, 2 RCTs, 84 women, I(2) = 57%, low-quality evidence). One study compared electroacupuncture versus relaxation. There was no significant difference between the groups for either hot flush frequency (MD -0.40 flushes per day, 95% CI -2.18 to 1.38, 1 RCT, 38 women, very-low-quality evidence) or hot flush severity (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.85 to 1.25, 1 RCT, 38 women, very-low-quality evidence). Four studies compared acupuncture versus waiting list or no intervention. Traditional acupuncture was significantly more effective in reducing hot flush frequency from baseline (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.31, 3 RCTs, 463 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence), and was also significantly more effective in reducing hot flush severity (SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.35, 3 RCTs, 463 women, I(2) = 0%, low-quality evidence). The effect size was moderate in both cases. For quality of life measures, acupuncture was significantly less effective than HT, but traditional acupuncture was significantly more effective than no intervention. There was no significant difference between acupuncture and other comparators for quality of life. Data on adverse effects were lacking.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective for controlling menopausal vasomotor symptoms. When we compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture, there was no evidence of a significant difference in their effect on menopausal vasomotor symptoms. When we compared acupuncture with no treatment there appeared to be a benefit from acupuncture, but acupuncture appeared to be less effective than HT. These findings should be treated with great caution as the evidence was low or very low quality and the studies comparing acupuncture versus no treatment or HT were not controlled with sham acupuncture or placebo HT. Data on adverse effects were lacking.

### AAAAI mast cell disorders committee work group report: mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) diagnosis and management [^1119NmGA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). High credibility.

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) — antihistamines for prevention and symptom control: Nonsedating H1 antihistamines are generally preferred and can be increased to 2 to 4 times the standard dose; sedating H1 antihistamines might acutely cause drowsiness and chronically lead to cognitive decline, particularly in the elderly. H2R antihistamines can be used as first-line therapy for gastrointestinal symptoms and might help H1R antihistamines attenuate cardiovascular symptoms. Recommendations for antihistamine therapy for MC activation disorders are based on expert opinion, and H1R and H2R antihistamine receptors work better as prophylactic than acute treatment. In patients with MCAS, H1R blockers reduce dermatologic manifestations, such as flushing and pruritus, along with tachycardia and abdominal discomfort, and later-generation nonsedating H1R antihistamines, such as fexofenadine and cetirizine, are often used at 2 to 4 times US Food and Drug Administration–approved doses.

### Huge extrahepatic gallstone on percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tip-a pediatric case report [^115yyaPL]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications in adults undergoing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography are rare with 3–10% and can be classified as access-related, non-vascular, vascular, drainage catheter, or stent-related. Most common complications include pain, infection, bile leakage, and catheter occlusion. In children undergoing percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, drainage dislodgement is the most common complication. Typical catheter-related complications are obstruction, dislodgement, kinking, or fracture. To prevent occlusion, patients and caregivers are trained to frequently flush the drainage catheter. Common guidelines for percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography in pediatric patients are lacking; therefore, it remains unclear how different factors in biliary interventions may cause complications and influence outcomes.

Gallstones are rare in pediatric patients and there are no reported cases of gallstones associated with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in pediatric patients. Gallstones can be classified into cholesterol and pigment stones and are associated with genetic factors, obesity, parenteral nutrition, infection, antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone, and biliary malformations (choledochal cyst, pancreaticobiliary maljunction). Furthermore, cholelithiasis is a well-described late toxicity in survivors of childhood cancer, especially after treatment with high doses of platinum, vinca alkaloid, or total body irradiation.

A rare cause of biliary stent/drainage obstruction are fungal balls caused by Candida species. They might present clinically with obstructive fungal cholangitis and imaging by ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography shows filling defects within the stent or intrahepatic bile ducts. Broad-spectrum antifungal medication combined with frequent flushing is supposed to prevent re-obstruction within days as reported by Story et al.

Central venous catheter (CVC) precipitate occlusion — recognition, treatment, and prevention: Medications and parenteral nutrition (PN) components can precipitate in the line, often suspected when the CVC is functional between medications but not after an infusion. Nonfibrinolytic agents aim to increase precipitate solubility by changing lumen pH, including 70% ethanol for lipid residue and sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide for basic medications; acidic medications and calcium phosphate crystals have been treated with 0.1% hydrochloric acid, a practice largely discontinued due to concerns about damaging the CVC. Prevention includes flushing with normal saline between each medication dose, avoiding simultaneous incompatible agents, discouraging heparin with concurrent ethanol locks, and if heparin must be used, removing the ethanol lock, flushing with normal saline, and then instilling heparin.

### Alcohol flush does not aid in endoscope channel drying but may serve as an adjunctive microbiocidal measure: a new take on an old assumption [^114cxeXp]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol is perceived to aid flexible endoscope channel drying, however we previously showed alcohol increased the time required to dry some channels with forced air versus water alone. Yet, alcohol may prevent microorganism outgrowth during storage. Drying endoscope channels has been shown to prevent outgrowth, but it is unknown if incomplete drying (< 10 µL remaining) provides similar protection.

Methods

Endoscope channel test articles were used to determine the efficacy of 70%-30% alcohol flush for prevention of Pseudomonas aeruginosa outgrowth and drying efficiency. For non-alcohol flushed channels, the impact of forced air drying on outgrowth of P. aeruginosa was determined.

Results

Alcohol flush (70%-30%) prevented outgrowth with little to no recovery of P. aeruginosa during ambient storage. 70% alcohol increased channel drying time by 1.5 or 3-fold compared to 50% alcohol or water, respectively. Forced air drying of non-alcohol flushed channels greatly reduced the initial contamination level and prevented outgrowth. Incomplete drying of contaminated channels was akin to no application of forced air. Applying forced air for more time than necessary to remove residual liquid did not completely eliminate the low level recovery of P. aeruginosa.

Conclusions

Flushing with reduced concentrations of alcohol may provide a strategy to prevent microbial outgrowth while reducing drying time.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of CYTALUX was evaluated in four open label clinical studies, two studies (N = 44 and N = 150) in patients with ovarian cancer and two studies (N = 100 and N = 112) in patients with known or suspected cancer in the lung. A total of 406 patients received 0.025 mg/kg of CYTALUX via intravenous administration.

The demographic characteristics of the study population were 82% female (66% female in lung studies), mean age 64 years (range 26 to 89 years), 85% White, 6% Black or African American, 5% Asian, and 4% other race, 5% Hispanic or Latino, 92% Not Hispanic or Latino, and 3% unreported ethnicity.

Adverse reactions that occurred in > 1% of patients are presented in Table 1.

### Symptom management in premenopausal patients with breast cancer [^114SEZms]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Women with breast cancer have many adverse symptoms, of which some are specific to premenopausal patients. Management of these common symptoms include non-hormonal drugs, such as antidepressants and antiseizure compounds to alleviate hot flushes. Non-oestrogenic vaginal lubricants seem to moderately decrease occurrence of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Transdermal testosterone alone has not been shown to improve libido in these women. Options for fertility preservation include cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes before chemotherapy. Exercise is the one evidenced-based intervention shown to positively affect cancer-related fatigue. However, effective prevention and treatments for peripheral neuropathy and paclitaxel acute pain syndrome remain elusive. Weight-bearing exercise helps to maintain bone strength with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. Use of bisphosphonates in women taking aromatase inhibitors (combined with ovarian suppression in premenopausal women) to prevent bone fractures has not been substantiated, although it should be considered in women with osteoporosis. No specific drug has been shown to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis alone. Although some effective treatments can counteract symptoms related to cancer or treatments, research is needed to expand evidence-based care in premenopausal survivors of breast cancer.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^116ZUnjF]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Psychosocial interventions are efficacious in treating alcohol use disorder 58, and are the mainstay of treatment. The predominant treatment goal for alcohol dependence has traditionally been abstinence. Acamprosate and naltrexone have been shown to reduce the risk of returning to drinking when prescribed in conjunction with psychosocial interventions 59, and neither have cardiac‐related contraindications. Disulfiram works in a different manner (inhibition of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme leading to a build‐up of acetaldehyde and associated unpleasant physical effects), and its deterrent effect can improve the outcome of treatment when a third party is involved to assist with compliance 60. At the usual prescribed dose of 200–250 mg/day, the disulfiram‐alcohol interaction varies from mild flushing to distressing nausea, headache, dizziness and chest tightness. Fatal cases reported in the medical literature suggest that cardiac causes of death are common 61. In the early days of disulfiram use, patients were given a test dose of alcohol, and most patients developed some ECG changes during the reaction (e.g. QT‐prolongation). Hypotension and hypertension are also common, and the potentially fatal outcome of a disulfiram‐alcohol reaction in a patient with heart disease means that disulfiram is not usually offered to this group.

Abstinence from alcohol is likely to produce the best outcomes for established hypertension, arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy, but may not be a feasible or acceptable goal for many patients. Intervention strategies have now broadened to include reduction of alcohol intake, and even alcohol‐dependent people with loss of control over the past 12 months can reduce their drinking 62. Treatment programmes aiming at harm reduction help to establish self‐determined controlled drinking and use this as a bridge to long‐term abstinence 63, 64. Interventions aiming at reducing total alcohol consumption and/or modifying the drinking pattern are associated with positive effects in harmful, hazardous or alcohol‐dependent drinkers 65.

### Temsirolimus [^113QMip5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions

Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, including but not limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, apnea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus. These reactions can occur very early in the first infusion, but may also occur with subsequent infusions. Patients should be monitored throughout the infusion and appropriate supportive care should be available. Temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all patients with severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy administered.

Temsirolimus injection should be used with caution in persons with known hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or its metabolites (including sirolimus), polysorbate 80, or to any other component (including the excipients) of Temsirolimus injection.

An H1antihistamine should be administered to patients before the start of the intravenous temsirolimus infusion. Temsirolimus injection should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to an antihistamine, or patients who cannot receive an antihistamine for other medical reasons.

If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the Temsirolimus infusion, the infusion should be stopped and the patient should be observed for at least 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the severity of the reaction). At the discretion of the physician, treatment may be resumed with the administration of an H1-receptor antagonist (such as diphenhydramine), if not previously administered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)], and/or an H2-receptor antagonist (such as intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the Temsirolimus infusion. The infusion may then be resumed at a slower rate (up to 60 minutes).

A benefit-risk assessment should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus therapy in patients with severe or life-threatening reactions.

Panel
Alcohol, acetaldehyde, and the east Asian flushing syndrome

The major clearance pathway for blood alcohol is that an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), mainly ADH1, oxidises it to acetaldehyde, which causes discomfort at sufficient concentrations. An aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), mainly ALDH2, then detoxifies the acetaldehyde (oxidising it to acetate, which does not cause discomfort). Fast clearance of alcohol or, particularly, slow breakdown of acetaldehyde can cause individuals to limit alcohol intake.

In African and European populations, acetaldehyde is broken down quickly enough to maintain tolerably low concentrations in drinkers. In east Asian populations, there is a common loss-of-function variant of the ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12 (rs671). Even a single copy decreases acetaldehyde breakdown enough for the concentration to become uncomfortably high after drinking alcohol. This variant is an important determinant of the east Asian flushing reaction to alcohol, and of alcohol intake. Less importantly, a genetic variant of the ADH1B gene on chromosome 4 (rs1229984) that is common in east Asia increases alcohol clearance rates. Together, these two single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly affect alcohol exposure (table 1), and each has been shown to decrease substantially the incidence of alcoholism.

Both variants involve a G→A mutation, with the A allele decreasing alcohol exposure. Each variant has three possible genotypes, AA, AG, and GG, so the two variants define nine possible genotypes. Alcohol intake is affected more by the decreased rate of breakdown of acetaldehyde than by the increased alcohol clearance rate. Hence, when describing these nine genotypes the rs671 genotype is given first and the rs1229984 genotype second, and alphabetic order corresponds to increasing alcohol intake: AA/AA, AA/AG, AA/GG; then AG/AA, AG/AG, AG/GG; then GG/AA, GG/AG, GG/GG.

Table 1
Two east Asian genetic variants that alter alcohol metabolism

The ALDH2 -rs671 variant, which is common only in east Asian populations, greatly slows acetaldehyde breakdown, and the resulting accumulation of acetaldehyde can cause severe discomfort that strongly reduces alcohol intake. Studies of this variant have confirmed the trial evidence that alcohol causally affects blood pressure and some other physiological traits. A less important genetic variant, ADH1B -rs1229984, accelerates alcohol conversion to acetaldehyde and reduces alcohol intake.

### Evidence for a role of hot flushes in vascular function in recently postmenopausal women [^113uLD3u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Observational studies indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) prevents cardiovascular disease, but randomized clinical trials have not confirmed this effect. Hot flushes were more likely to be present in women starting HT in observational studies, whereas these symptoms were mild or absent among women attending randomized clinical trials. We hypothesized that vascular function may differ in women with and without vasomotor hot flushes.

Methods

One hundred forty-three recently postmenopausal women showing a broad range of variation in hot flushes were studied with radial artery tonometry. Pulse wave analyses were assessed at baseline and after nitroglycerin and salbutamol challenges. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for paired comparisons after challenges with nitroglycerin and salbutamol.

Results

Neither baseline arterial stiffness nor endothelial function differed between women without or with mild, moderate, or severe hot flushes. However, after nitroglycerin challenge, the time to the onset of the reflected wave (dependent on pulse wave velocity) was 9.5% longer (P = 0.014), and the time to the first systolic peak (dependent on the rapid phase of ventricular ejection) was 13.9% longer (P = 0.025) in women with severe hot flushes as compared with asymptomatic women.

Conclusion

Women with severe vasomotor hot flushes show greater vascular responsiveness to nitroglycerin than women without hot flushes. This may partially explain the conflicting data between observational and randomized HT studies.

### Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 in aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia and hematopoietic stem cells [^114gnkhr]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment depends on the ability to metabolize exogenously and endogenously generated toxins, and to repair cellular damage caused by such toxins. Reactive aldehydes have been demonstrated to cause specific genotoxic injury, namely DNA interstrand cross-links. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a member of a 19 isoenzyme ALDH family with different substrate specificities, subcellular localization, and patterns of expression. ALDH2 is localized in mitochondria and is essential for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby placing it directly downstream of ethanol metabolism. Deficiency in ALDH2 expression and function are caused by a single nucleotide substitution and resulting amino acid change, called ALDH2✱2. This genetic polymorphism affects 35–45% of East Asians (about ~560 million people), and causes the well-known Asian flushing syndrome, which results in disulfiram-like reactions after ethanol consumption. Recently, the ALDH2✱2 genotype has been found to be associated with marrow failure, with both an increased risk of sporadic aplastic anemia and more rapid progression of Fanconi anemia. This review discusses the unexpected interrelationship between aldehydes, ALDH2 and hematopoietic stem cell biology, and in particular its relationship to Fanconi anemia.

### Ancestry-based pharmacogenomics, adverse reactions and carbamazepine: is the FDA warning correct? [^11194o8o]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In an effort to prevent potentially fatal adverse reactions to carbamazepine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert in 2007 containing pharmacogenomic information, which is still in effect today. The alert states that carbamazepine-induced skin reactions are significantly more common in patients with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B✱1502 allele and that these people are almost exclusively from 'broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians'. This study reviews the medical evidence relied upon by the FDA and finds that the alert does not accurately reflect the medical evidence relied upon in 2007 or evidence that has been generated over the last 5 years since the label was created. The FDA drug labeling should be modified to reflect current medical evidence.

### Temsirolimus (torisel) [^1135qsqB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions

Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, including but not limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, apnea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus. These reactions can occur very early in the first infusion, but may also occur with subsequent infusions. Patients should be monitored throughout the infusion and appropriate supportive care should be available. Temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all patients with severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy administered.

TORISEL should be used with caution in persons with known hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or its metabolites (including sirolimus), polysorbate 80, or to any other component (including the excipients) of TORISEL.

An H1antihistamine should be administered to patients before the start of the intravenous temsirolimus infusion. TORISEL should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to an antihistamine, or patients who cannot receive an antihistamine for other medical reasons.

If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the TORISEL infusion, the infusion should be stopped and the patient should be observed for at least 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the severity of the reaction). At the discretion of the physician, treatment may be resumed with the administration of an H1-receptor antagonist (such as diphenhydramine), if not previously administered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)], and/or an H2-receptor antagonist (such as intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the TORISEL infusion. The infusion may then be resumed at a slower rate (up to 60 minutes).

A benefit-risk assessment should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus therapy in patients with severe or life-threatening reactions.

### Pathogenesis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^117KgdJv]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

The underlying respiratory disease is activated by unknown mechanism and results in an intense infiltration of mast cells and eosinophils into the entire respiratory mucosa. These cells synthesize leukotrienes (LTs) at a very high rate and mast cells also release histamine and tryptase and synthesize PGD(2) a vasodilator and bronchoconstrictor. Furthermore, AERD patients under synthesize from arachidonic acid (AA) a peculiar product called lipoxins, which opposes inflammation generated by leukotrienes. Finally, cysLT1 receptors are over expressed and highly responsive to LTE(4), further augmenting the underlying inflammatory disease. This inflammatory condition is partly inhibited by synthesis of PGE(2) through COX-1. PGE(2) partially inhibits 5-lipogygenase conversion of AA to LTA(4) and blocks release of histamine and tryptase from mast cells. When COX-l is inhibited by ASA or NSAIDs, PGE(2) synthesis stops and an enormous release of histamine and synthesis of LTs occurs. The upper respiratory reaction is mediated by both histamine and LTs but the bronchospastic reaction is mediated by LTs. The systemic effects of flush, gastric pain and hives are mediated by histamine. Aspirin desensitization can not be explained by disappearance of LT synthesis since urine LTE(4) levels are still elevated at acute ASA desensitization. However, mast cell products such as histamine, tryptase and PGD(2) are no longer released or synthesized at acute desensitization. It is more likely that a diminution in number or function of cysLT receptors accounts for the diminished inflammatory response found in ASA desensitization.

### Western black willow [^116cDNtv]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions include, but are not limited to urticaria; itching; edema of extremities; respiratory wheezing or asthma; dyspnea; cyanosis; tachycardia; lacrimation; marked perspiration; flushing of face, neck or upper chest; mild persistent clearing of throat; hacking cough or persistent sneezing.

1)	Local Reactions

A mild burning immediately after injection is expected; this usually subsides in 10–20 seconds. Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection, making this injection route undesirable. Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route.

Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common. Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter.

Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable, but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased. In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing.

Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or use of oral antihistamines.

2)	Systemic Reactions

Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient's allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions.14Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response. It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is always a possibility. Fatalities are rare but can occur.5Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and urticaria.13, 14

Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions. Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions. Refer to "OVERDOSAGE" section.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

PEPCID was studied in 7 US and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 1442 patients were treated with PEPCID, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17–91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian.

The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of PEPCID-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation.

The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials:

Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue

Cardiovascular: palpitations

Gastrointestinal: elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth

Hematologic: thrombocytopenia

Hypersensitivity: orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm

Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia

Nervous System/Psychiatric: seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence

Skin: pruritus, dry skin, flushing

Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder

Other: impotence

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval

Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis

Hematologic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia

Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria

Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps

Nervous System/Psychiatric: confusion, agitation, paresthesia

Respiratory: interstitial pneumonia

Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome

### A 29-year-old woman with flu-like symptoms: review of influenza diagnosis and treatment [^117QQUns]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Peaks of seasonal influenza activity occur annually in many countries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Using the case of Ms R, a 29-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and was evaluated for influenza, considerations regarding symptoms and signs, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of influenza are discussed. Symptoms of influenza can be similar to those of other respiratory viruses, making diagnosis challenging. Laboratory testing should be reserved for patients who are seriously ill or for whom test results may affect management or have public health implications. For most cases of influenza, treatment is supportive and specific antiviral medication is not needed. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Educating patients on practical steps to reduce the spread of influenza in the community is critical.

Drug reaction categories to platinum agents — definitions and notes: Mild reaction (hot flushing, rash, pruritus) contrasts with severe reaction (shortness of breath, changes in blood pressure requiring treatment, dyspnea, GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting]) and life-threatening reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) with acute onset, generalized hives, respiratory compromise, severe hypotension, and GI symptoms [nausea, vomiting]. Most mild reactions are infusion reactions and more commonly are caused by taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel), but can also occur with platinum agents (ie, carboplatin, cisplatin), whereas most severe reactions are allergic reactions and more commonly are caused by platinum agents. When H1 blocker antihistamine, H2 blockers, or corticosteroids are referenced, examples include diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine; cimetidine and famotidine; and methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone. In the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard resuscitation (ACLS) procedures should be followed.

### Acetaldehyde-driven mRNA methylation and expression changes in ethanol-metabolizing enzyme genes [^116oSADa]. Epigenetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acetaldehyde, a highly reactive and toxic metabolite of ethanol, exerts diverse biological effects, including tissue damage, carcinogenesis, oxidative stress, the alcohol flush reaction, and a significant role in addiction. Genetic factors that affect the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism play a crucial role in acetaldehyde accumulation. Increased activity of enzymes (such as ADH, catalase, and CYP2E1) responsible for converting ethanol to acetaldehyde or reduced activity of ALDH2 which metabolizes acetaldehyde to acetate, can lead to toxic acetaldehyde buildup and flushing responses, particularly in East Asian populations. Heavy alcohol consumption also contributes to acetaldehyde accumulation. Interestingly, acetaldehyde levels remain low even after binge drinking. While the blood ethanol concentration in binge drinkers is approximately 40 mm, blood acetaldehyde levels are typically only around 10–50 µM. The mechanisms underlying the rapid clearance of acetaldehyde after alcohol consumption remain poorly understood.

We hypothesize that acetaldehyde modulates the expression of alcohol-metabolizing enzyme genes through feedback mechanisms, reducing the activity of ADH, catalase, and CYP2E1 while enhancing ALDH2 activity via epigenetic mechanisms, particularly RNA methylation. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed both neuronal and non-neuronal cell models to explore acetaldehyde-induced changes in mRNA methylation and expression of these genes. Given the minimal ADH activity in the brain, our study focused on three key genes: the catalase gene (CAT), the cytochrome P450 2E1 gene (CYP2E1), and the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene (ALDH2). RNA methylation modifications may regulate the expression of alcohol metabolizing enzymes at the post-transcriptional (RNA) level, potentially accelerating the clearance of toxic acetaldehyde and preventing its accumulation in the body after alcohol consumption. Our study results provide partial support for this hypothesis.

### Duration of menopausal hot flushes and associated risk factors [^111dYHhc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the duration of moderate-to-severe menopausal hot flushes and identify potential risk factors for hot flush duration.

Methods

The Penn Ovarian Aging Study cohort was monitored for 13 years. Hot flushes were evaluated at 9-month to 12-month intervals through in-person interviews. The primary outcome was the duration of moderate-to-severe hot flushes estimated by survival analysis (n = 259). Potential risk factors included menopausal stage, age, race, reproductive hormone levels, body mass index (BMI), and current smoking. A secondary analysis included women who reported any hot flushes (n = 349).

Results

The median duration of moderate-to-severe hot flushes was 10.2 years and was strongly associated with menopausal stage at onset. Hot flushes that started near entry into the menopause transition had a median duration greater than 11.57 years; onset in the early transition stage had a median duration of 7.35 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.94–8.89; P < .001); and onset in the late transition to postmenopausal stages had a median duration of 3.84 years (95% CI 1.77–5.52; P < .001). The most common ages at onset of moderate-to-severe hot flushes were 45–49 years (median duration, 8.1 years; 95% CI 5.12–9.28). African American women had a longer duration of hot flushes than white women in adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

The median duration of hot flushes considerably exceeded the timeframe that is generally accepted in clinical practice. The identified risk factors, particularly menopausal stage, race, and BMI, are important to consider in individualizing treatment and evaluating the risk-to-benefit ratio of hormones and other therapies.

### Variant aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2✱2) is a risk factor for coronary spasm and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^116gxYUj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays a key role in removal of not only ethanol‐derived acetaldehyde, but also other toxic aldehydes such as 4‐hydroxy‐2‐nonenal (4‐HNE) derived from lipid peroxidation. 1, 2 Up to 40% of East Asians carry a variant ALDH2 or ALDH2✱2 (Glu504Lys) genotype with deficient activity and suffer from alcohol (ethanol) flushing syndrome (AFS) including facial flushing, headache, nausea, and palpitation, in response to a small amount of alcohol intake attributed to accumulation of acetaldehyde. 2, 3, 4, 5 Recent studies indicate that carriers of ALDH2✱2 genotype have a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Coronary spasm is not rarely demonstrated in AMI patients in Japan, 12, 13 and we have reported that ALDH2✱2 genotype is associated with coronary spastic angina (CSA). 14 ALDH2 protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by removing toxic aldehydes such as 4‐HNE in experimental AMI models. 2, 15, 16, 17 However, the underlying mechanisms linking ALDH2 to AMI in humans remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the clinical features of AMI patients with ALDH2✱2 by comparing to those with wild‐type ALDH2✱1/✱1 in acute ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who underwent reperfusion therapy with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

### Chlorhexidine-a commonly used but often neglected culprit of dialysis associated anaphylactic reactions (case report) [^1161vREA]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 1 (incident Dialysis patient)

Case 1 was a 65-year-old Chinese lady with a background history of advanced chronic kidney disease. She was admitted for acute on chronic kidney injury requiring dialysis. During her admission, she was not started on new medications. She had a known drug allergy towards Penicillins but does not recall the details of the allergic reaction. Her chronic medications include insulin, frusemide, calcium acetate, atorvastatin, renal vitamin, glipizide, bisoprolol, omeprazole, alfacalcidol, cholecalciferol, gabapentin and intravenous erythropoeitin. She underwent her first hemodialysis session via a non-chlorhexidine coated dialysis catheter in view of uremia and metabolic acidosis. She was dialysed for 2.5 h, at a blood flow rate of 150 ml/min and dialysate flow rate of 300 ml/min. A Polysulfone dialyser (Fresenius Medical Care, F6HPS) was used. Dialysis was anticoagulation free in view of recent catheter insertion and the session was event-free.

At her second dialysis treatment, the patient was given a 500-unit Heparin bolus, followed by a 500-unit/hour maintenance dose of Heparin to improve circuit patency. However, she developed generalized pruritus after an hour and Heparin was stopped. She completed 3 h of dialysis. Similarly, a Polysulfone dialyser was used and blood flow and dialysate flow rates were maintained at 150 ml/min and 300 ml/min respectively.

She was then given a 2-day break before her next dialysis session. Unfortunately, she developed shortness of breath, flushing, and tachycardia 2 min into her 3rd dialysis session. The treatment had to be terminated. It was anti-coagulation free as there were suspicions that Heparin might have prompted the development of pruritis in the last treatment. She was given intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone and intravenous diphenhydramine emergently with complete resolution of symptoms.

### Prevalence, severity, and associated factors in women in east Asia with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^111hkqmu]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which include hot flashes, sweating, and night sweats, are common for many women during the perimenopausal or postmenopausal period. Each of these phases is hormonally heterogenous but more consistent within each phase and even duration from final menstrual period can impact VMS frequency and severity. The prevalence of menopausal VMS has been reported to range from 43% to 84% among East Asian women, but few studies have used nationally representative samples. -

Menopausal VMS has been shown to negatively impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (eg, impairments to daily activities and work productivity), and the magnitude of this burden increases with VMS severity. Although clinical practice guidelines recognize a continued role for hormone therapy (HT) to manage symptoms, particularly for women < 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause, HT is associated with long-term safety concerns including the potentially increased risk of breast cancer, and an increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism. In addition, many women are not eligible for HT due to contraindications or other health risks. Alternative treatment options are needed, and a number are under active research.

In Asian countries, the use of prescription treatment for menopausal VMS is limited compared with Western countries, partially due to cultural beliefs and preference for over- the-counter treatments or traditional herbal medicine. More evidence is needed to understand the epidemiology of VMS associated with menopause, the impact of burden on HRQoL, and the current treatment landscape, as well as womens' healthcare-seeking behavior and key driving factors in East Asia.

The aim of this study was to understand further the prevalence, severity, impact, and treatment of VMS, using real-world, selfreported data from a cross-sectional survey in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with VMS in East Asia.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^115CTEtQ]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN safe practices — enteral medication preparation and administration through an EAD — include several directives. Use available liquid dosage forms only if they are appropriate for enteral administration, and if liquid dosage forms are inappropriate or unavailable, substitute only immediate-release solid dosage forms. Prepare immediate-release solids per pharmacist instructions by crushing simple compressed tablets to a fine powder and mixing with purified water or opening hard gelatin capsules and mixing the powder with purified water. Use only appropriate instruments to measure and prepare enteral medication. Use only clean enteral syringes (≥ 20 mL with ENFit device) to administer medication through an EAD. Provide tube irrigation around dosing: prior to administering medication, stop the feeding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL water, then flush the tube again with at least 15 mL water, repeat with the next medication, and flush the tube one final time with at least 15 mL water. Restart enteral feeding in a timely manner, and hold the feeding by 30 minutes or more only if separation is indicated to avoid altered drug bioavailability. Consult with an adult or pediatric pharmacist for patients who receive medications coadministered with enteral nutrition (EN).

### East Asian variant of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 is associated with coronary spastic angina: possible roles of reactive aldehydes and implications of alcohol flushing syndrome [^113KAKcZ]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary spastic angina (CSA) is a common disease among East Asians, including Japanese. The prevalence of alcohol flushing syndrome associated with deficient activity of the variant aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2✱2) genotype is prevalent among East Asians. We examined whether CSA is associated with the ALDH2✱2 genotype in Japanese.

Methods and Results

The study subjects consisted of 202 patients in whom intracoronary injection of acetylcholine was performed by angiography on suspicion of CSA (119 men and 83 women; mean age, 66.2 ± 11.4 years). They were divided into CSA (112 patients) and control groups (90 patients). ALDH2 genotyping was performed by the direct application of the TaqMan polymerase chain reaction system on dried whole blood. Clinical and laboratory data were examined using conventional methods. The frequencies of male sex, ALDH2✱2 genotype carriers, alcohol flushing syndrome, tobacco smoking, and the plasma level of uric acid were higher (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.007, respectively) and the plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower (P < 0.001) in the CSA group than in the control group. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that ALDH2✱2 genotype and smoking were significantly associated with CSA (P < 0.001 and P = 0.024, respectively).

Conclusions

East Asian variant ALDH2✱2 genotypes and, hence, deficient ALDH2 activity were associated with CSA in Japanese. These data support further investigation of treatment targeting aldehydes for CSA.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^116qeWP8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer — management of drug reactions to taxane, liposomal doxorubicin, or biotherapeutic agents (mild reaction): In IV or IP settings, mild reaction (hot flushing, rash, pruritus, pain in chest/abdomen/pelvis/back) is managed as follows. Stop infusion. Symptoms often resolve quickly after stopping infusion. Administer H1 blocker antihistamine to treat symptoms. If staff agree and vital signs remain stable, rechallenge with drug at slower infusion rate and administer premedication with H1 blocker antihistamine, corticosteroids, H2 blockers. If repeat mild reaction, then do not rechallenge/readminister. Potential candidate for desensitization with each infusion. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Genetic determinants of both ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism influence alcohol hypersensitivity and drinking behaviour among scandinavians [^11547d4y]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although hypersensitivity reactions following intake of alcoholic drinks are common in Caucasians, the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance are not known. In contrast, in Asians, alcohol-induced asthma and flushing have been shown to be because of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) 487lys, causing decreased acetaldehyde (the metabolite of ethanol) metabolism and high levels of histamine. However, the ALDH2 487lys is absent in Caucasians.

Objectives

To investigate the genetic determinants of self-reported alcohol-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Caucasians.

Methods

The study included two population-based studies of 1216 and 6784 adults living in Copenhagen. Assessment of alcohol consumption and hypersensitivity reactions (in a subgroup) was performed by a questionnaire and was related to common SNPs of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and ALDHs.

Results

In both populations, alcohol drinkers with a genetically determined fast metabolism of ethanol (the A allele of the ADH1b rs1229984) had an increased risk of alcohol-induced hypersensitivity reactions (odds ratio AA/AG vs. GG in combined populations: 1.82, 95% CI 1.04–3.17). In both populations, a common SNP encoding ALDH1b1 (rs2228093) was found to be significantly associated with alcohol-induced hypersensitivity (odds ratio TT vs. CC in combined populations: 2.53, 95% CI 1.31–4.90).

Conclusions

Our data support that alcohol sensitivity in Caucasians is genetically determined and suggest that a histamine-releasing effect of acetaldehyde represents a plausible biological mechanism. Furthermore, we present the first report of a clinically significant SNP within the acetaldehyde-metabolizing system in a Caucasian population.

### Ospemifene's effect on vasomotor symptoms: a post hoc analysis of phase 2 and 3 clinical data [^1146aU5k]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of ospemifene 60mg/d on vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women using clinical safety and efficacy data from five phase 2 and 3 studies.

Methods

The incidence of hot flush treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was compiled from five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies; baseline parameters associated with hot flush incidence were also identified. Ospemifene's effects on the frequency and severity of hot flushes were evaluated in a previously unpublished, 6-week, placebo-controlled study.

Results

Analysis of pooled hot flush TEAE data for 2,166 women showed an incidence of hot flush of 8.5% for ospemifene and 3.2% for placebo (P < 0.0001). Hot flushes were most frequent during the first 4 weeks of ospemifene treatment and decreased in frequency thereafter. Logistic regression analysis revealed that hormone therapy within 6 months before study start (P = 0.0234), longer study treatment duration (P = 0.0234), and more hot flush days per month at baseline (P = 0.0313) were associated with more hot flushes. Ospemifene 60mg/d did not worsen the frequency and severity of existing hot flushes in a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial of 198 postmenopausal women who were experiencing moderate to very severe hot flushes.

Conclusions

In randomized trials, hot flush TEAEs were more frequent with ospemifene 60mg/d than with placebo, particularly among women with prior history of hormone therapy use. The majority of hot flushes, however, waned after 4 weeks of ospemifene treatment. Ospemifene did not worsen existing hot flushes in women experiencing moderate to very severe hot flushes.

### Relief of hot flushes with new plant-derived 10-component synthetic conjugated estrogens [^112j7wWe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

A study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of synthetic conjugated estrogens B, a new plant-derived 10-component conjugated estrogens product, for the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Highly symptomatic menopausal women (N = 281) received 12 weeks of a once-daily oral treatment with 0.3 mg, 0.625 mg, or 1.25 mg of 10-component synthetic conjugated estrogen or placebo. Patients recorded the daily frequency and severity of hot flushes. Statistical analyses compared results at weeks 4, 8, and 12 with baseline values.

Results

Statistically significant reductions (P < .05) in the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms were observed for all 3 dosage strengths of 10-component synthetic conjugated estrogen compared with placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in all treatment groups were headaches. No difference in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events was seen between placebo and 10-component synthetic conjugated estrogen groups.

Conclusion

The 0.3-mg, 0.625-mg and 1.25-mg dose strengths of 10-component synthetic conjugated estrogen significantly reduced the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms compared with placebo, and were well tolerated during this 12-week study.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^116UaFXn]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) administration — nursing policies, procedures, and practices are specified as practice recommendations to "Define the quality control process for receipt, distribution, storage, preparation, handling, and administration of EN products", "Use sterile liquid EN formulations in preference to powdered, reconstituted, or blenderized preparations, whenever possible", and "Administer EN by, or under the direct supervision, of competent personnel as defined by the organization". The personnel who administer EN will "Either accept the delivery of the EN container identified with the patient-specific label or select the product from the unit-based inventory and places the patient-specific label", "Visually inspect the product or preparation for damage to the container, altered formula characteristics, and expiration date limits", and "Confirm that the EN container with the patient-specific label reflects what has been ordered by the prescriber. Verify patient identifiers, product name, and route (and rate) of administration", then "Perform proper handwashing prior to entering the patient care area as well as prior to working with the feeding administration. Don clean gloves prior to working with the feeding tube and administration set", and "Use aseptic technique in setting up and connecting the feeding administration set and related equipment". Bedside steps include "use a small clean towel under the patient feeding tube connection to facilitate a clean area", "Verify patient identifiers at the bedside… and verify appropriate patient positioning for feeding", "Trace tubing from point of the enteral access device… and confirm that there has been no dislocation", "Position the EN container appropriately… and set up the administration set, priming it as indicated", and "Flush EAD and attach administration set using aseptic technique", noting "The EN container and administration set make up the EN 'delivery device' and are attached together until discarded". Additional directives are to "Cover the end with a clean cap for any disconnection… If a pump is being used as for continuous feeding, program it based on the EN order", "Base any change to the administration rate on documented EN orders", "Do not interrupt feeding administration for routine care unless specifically ordered… If the feeding must be interrupted, flush the tube", "Ensure that administration of enteral medication via the EAD is reviewed and approved… by a knowledgeable pharmacist", and "Document EN processes in the patient's EHR… including hourly rates as well as amount of intake, and water flushes". The rationale explains "The purpose of policies and procedures is to ensure that staff follow a consistent standard of care and quality at all levels" and that "Procedures describe the specific methods for following policies in practice".

### Fomepizole to treat disulfiram-ethanol reaction: a case series [^112nXVGC]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER) due to acetaldehyde accumulation occurs after drinking ethanol during disulfiram therapy. DER may result in life-threatening toxicity requiring urgent critical care. Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor used to treat toxic alcohol poisoning, has been suggested for treating DER by preventing the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde. However, its effectiveness and safety have been poorly assessed in this setting. Cases: Ten DER patients (median age, 40years; 7 males/3 females) were included in the study. DER features consisted of consciousness impairment (median Glasgow coma score, 13; need for mechanical ventilation, 30%) with flushing (50%), vomiting (40%), electrocardiogram abnormalities (30%) and circulatory failure requiring norepinephrine (30%). Patients were successfully treated with a single intravenous infusion of fomepizole (median dose, 7.5mg/kg). The three patients receiving norepinephrine did not improve until fomepizole was administered. The other seven patients improved promptly following fomepizole infusion without requirement for vasopressor support. All patients fully recovered. Local pain at the injection site was the only reported adverse reaction in one patient. Conclusion: Our case series supports the effectiveness and safety of fomepizole in rapidly reversing DER-induced vasodilatation and toxicity.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^115v9vty]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines — scope and evidence methods state that the Society convened a panel to review the literature and develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of anaphylaxis, with an emphasis on a field-based perspective, and that the review also included literature regarding the definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention of anaphylaxis. Methodologically, anaphylaxis, with its potentially drastic course, does not lend itself to study in randomized, controlled trials, so the authors reviewed the literature for the best available evidence, including observational studies, case series, limited controlled trials, extrapolation from physiological data, and expert consensus.

### H1-antihistamines for primary mast cell activation syndromes: a systematic review [^111yM4W8]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary mast cell activation syndromes (MCAS) are a group of disorders presenting with symptoms of mast cell mediator release.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of orally administered H1 -antihistamines in the treatment of primary MCAS compared with placebo and other pharmacologic treatments.

Methods

We systematically searched five databases and three trial repositories and contacted an international panel of experts to identify published and unpublished trials.

Results

A total of 36 potentially relevant studies were identified. Of these, five crossover trials, enrolling a total of 71 patients (63 adults), met the eligibility criteria. All five of these studies were judged to be at moderate or high risk of bias. Two studies compared an H1 -antihistamine with placebo, two compared two different H1 -antihistamines, and one study compared H1 - and H2 -antihistamines with oral cromolyn sodium. Four of the five randomized controlled trials were historic (reported from 1983–1993), small (enrolling 8–15 patients), and used agents and/or dosing regimens that are now less commonly used in clinical practice (i.e. azelastine, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, and ketotifen). The fifth trial, which enrolled 33 adults with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis found 4 weeks of treatment with the second-generation H1 -antihistamine rupatadine, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvements in quality of life, symptom control (itching, wheals and flares, flushing, tachycardia, and headache, but not gastrointestinal symptoms), and reduction in itching and whealing after standardized skin provocation to elicit Darier's sign.

Conclusions

There is an urgent need for large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and safety of second-generation H1 -antihistamines in treatment of primary MCAS.

### The evidence gap between alcohol consumption and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in east Africa-Authors' reply [^112yH8Ui]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

We welcome the comments by Jin Zhang and colleagues on our study, which reported the strong role of alcohol consumption in oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) in east Africa. Our findings, which showed that alcohol consumption was a risk factor for ESCC, are consistent with the IARC monographs. In Kenya and Tanzania, we found that a large proportion of male patients with ESCC was attributable to alcohol consumption. Public health actions to reduce harmful alcohol consumption will benefit not only cancer prevention but also prevention of other NCDs and alcohol-associated harms in society.

Zhang and colleagues highlight investigations to further refine the association between alcohol consumption and risk of ESCC. Many of these suggestions are already in the pipeline, given that the ESCCAPE study is contributing to a genome-wide association study of ESCC in Africa. Genetic influences on alcohol metabolism — notably polymorphisms of ADH and ALDH2 genes — are known to influence concentrations of acetaldehyde and risk of ESCC, and have been well studied in Asian populations, but not in African populations. We have not been able to investigate such effect modification without genotyping because there is no known accessible proxy, such as self-reported alcohol flushing, in African populations. Although interactions between genes and the environment will be studied, investigating the primary effect of a main exposure is an important first step. A genetic-based precision component is unlikely to benefit or be feasible for primary prevention strategies tackling alcohol; however, such a component might help to refine the identification of individuals at high risk for early detection.
