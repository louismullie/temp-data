## Question

If we double one dimension of the cuboid, halve the second dimension of the cuboid, and increase the third dimension by 6 cm, we get a cube that has the same surface area as the original cuboid.

Determine the dimensions of this cuboid.

(M. Petrová)

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to determine the original dimensions of a cuboid given that after doubling one dimension, halving a second, and increasing the third by 6 cm, the resulting shape is a cube with the same surface area as the original cuboid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to represent the original and transformed dimensions algebraically. Then, I should set up the surface area equality constraint. Next, I will simplify the equation and solve for the unknowns. Finally, I will verify the solution and state the dimensions clearly, making sure I haven't missed any constraints or made arithmetic errors along the way.

> Let me first define the original cuboid dimensions as length (l), width (w), and height (h), so the original surface area is (2(lw + lh + wh)). After the transformations, the new dimensions become (2l), (w/2), and (h + 6), and because the result is a cube, all three new dimensions must be equal, which gives me two additional equations: (2l = w/2) and (w/2 = h + 6). I should confirm that these equalities are consistent with the cube condition before proceeding [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the surface area constraint. The new cube's surface area is (6s²) where (s) is the common side length after transformation, and this must equal the original cuboid's surface area, so I can write (6s² = 2(lw + lh + wh)). But since (s = 2l = w/2 = h + 6), I can express everything in terms of a single variable to simplify the algebra, which should reduce the chance of errors.

> I will now express (w) and (h) in terms of (l) using the cube equalities. From (2l = w/2), I get (w = 4l), and from (w/2 = h + 6), substituting (w = 4l) gives (2l = h + 6), so (h = 2l - 6). Hold on, I should verify that these substitutions are consistent with the cube condition: yes, (2l = w/2 = h + 6) is satisfied by construction.

> Next, I should substitute into the surface area equation. The original surface area becomes (2(l × 4l + l × (2l - 6) + 4l × (2l - 6))), and the new cube surface area is (6(2l)² = 24l²). Setting them equal gives (24l² = 2(4l² + 2l² − 6l + 8l² − 24l)). Let me double-check the expansion: (lw = 4l²), (lh = 2l² − 6l), and (wh = 8l² − 24l), so the sum inside parentheses is indeed (14l² − 30l), and multiplying by 2 gives (28l² − 60l).

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the equation would simplify to (24l² = 28l² − 60l), but that would imply (4l² − 60l = 0), which leads to (l = 15). Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the arithmetic. The correct simplification is (24l² = 28l² − 60l), which rearranges to (4l² − 60l = 0), so (4l(l − 15) = 0), giving (l = 0) or (l = 15). Since (l = 0) is not physically meaningful for a cuboid, the valid solution is (l = 15) cm.

> Now I can back-substitute to find the other dimensions. With (l = 15) cm, I get (w = 4l = 60) cm and (h = 2l - 6 = 24) cm. Let me verify the transformed dimensions: doubling length gives 30 cm, halving width gives 30 cm, and adding 6 cm to height gives 30 cm, confirming the cube condition. I should also confirm the surface areas match: original surface area is (2(15 × 60 + 15 × 24 + 60 × 24) = 2(900 + 360 + 1440) = 2(2700) = 5400) cm², and the cube's surface area is (6 × 30² = 5400) cm², so the constraint is satisfied.

> Therefore, the original cuboid has dimensions 15 cm by 60 cm by 24 cm. I should double-check that no alternative assignment of which dimension is doubled, halved, or increased would yield a different valid solution; given the symmetry of the transformations and the cube requirement, this appears to be the unique solution consistent with the problem statement.

The original cuboid has dimensions **15 cm × 60 cm × 24 cm**. After transforming the dimensions (double one, halve another, add 6 cm to the third), the resulting cube has side length **30 cm**, and its surface area matches the original cuboid's surface area of **5,400 cm²**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let the original cuboid dimensions be **length (l), width (w), and height (h)**. The surface area of the original cuboid is:

Surface Area_original = 2(lw + lh + wh)

According to the problem, we perform the following transformations:

- **Double one dimension**: (2l)
- **Halve the second dimension**: ([w/2])
- **Increase the third dimension by 6 cm**: (h + 6)

The resulting shape is a cube, so all dimensions are equal:

2l = [w/2] = h + 6

Let the side length of the cube be **s**. Then:

2l = s, [w/2] = s, h + 6 = s

Solving for the original dimensions in terms of **s**:

l = [s/2], w = 2s, h = s − 6

The surface area of the cube is:

Surface Area_cube = 6s²

Since the surface area of the original cuboid equals that of the cube:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 6s²

Substitute the expressions for **l, w, and h** in terms of **s**:

2(([s/2])(2s) + ([s/2])(s − 6) + (2s)(s − 6)) = 6s²

Simplify the equation:

2(s² + [s(s − 6)/2] + 2s(s − 6)) = 6s²

2(s² + [(s² − 6s)/2] + 2s² − 12s) = 6s²

2(s² + [s²/2] − 3s + 2s² − 12s) = 6s²

2([7s²/2] − 15s) = 6s²

7s² − 30s = 6s²

s² − 30s = 0

s(s − 30) = 0

Thus, **s = 0** or **s = 30**. Since **s = 0** is not physically meaningful, we have **s = 30 cm**.

Now, substitute **s = 30 cm** back into the expressions for the original dimensions:

l = [s/2] = [30/2] = 15 cm

w = 2s = 2 × 30 = 60 cm

h = s − 6 = 30 − 6 = 24 cm

---

## Verification

Original cuboid dimensions: **15 cm × 60 cm × 24 cm**. Surface area:

2(15 × 60 + 15 × 24 + 60 × 24) = 2(900 + 360 + 1440) = 2(2700) = 5400 cm²

Transformed dimensions: **30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm**. Surface area:

6 × 30² = 6 × 900 = 5400 cm²

The surface areas match, confirming the solution.

---

The original cuboid has dimensions **15 cm × 60 cm × 24 cm**.

### Fast 3D imaging of spine, dendritic, and neuronal assemblies in behaving animals [^e736efa2]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Volume Scanning with Multi-Cube and Snake Scanning

Our data demonstrated that even though the brain moves along all three spatial dimensions, we could still preserve fluorescence information and effectively eliminate motion artifacts by scanning at reduced dimensions, along surface elements, in 3D. However, under some circumstances, for example, in larger animals or at certain surgery or behavioral protocols, the amplitude of motion can be larger than the z dimension of the PSF and the missing third scanning dimension cannot be compensated for. To sufficiently preserve fluorescence information even in these cases, we may regain the missing scanning z dimension by extending the surface elements to volume elements by using an automatic algorithm until we reach the required noise elimination efficiency for measurements. To demonstrate this in two examples, we extended 3D ribbons to folded cuboids (called "snake scanning"; Figure 6 A) and multi-frames to multi-cuboids (called "multi-cube scanning"). A spiny dendritic segment of a GCaMP6f-labeled layer II/III neuron was selected from a sparsely labeled V1 region of the cortex for snake scanning (Figure 6 B). According to the z stack taken at the beginning, we selected guiding points, interpolated a 3D trajectory, and generated a 3D ribbon that covered the whole segment as described above. Then, we extended the ribbon to a volume and performed 3D snake scanning from the selected folded cuboid (Figures 6 A–6D; Movie S11). Three-dimensional Ca 2+ responses were induced by moving grating stimulation and were projected into 2D as a function of distances along the dendrite and along one of the perpendicular directions (Figure 6 C). Finally, data were maximal-intensity projected along the second (and orthogonal) perpendicular axis to show average responses for three moving directions separately and together, following motion correction (Figure 6 C). Alternatively, we were able to avoid maximal intensity projection to a single plane by transforming the folded snake form into a regular cube (Figure 6 D). In this representation, Ca 2+ transients could be calculated from different subvolumes (Figure 6 D). Note that due to the preserved good spatial resolution, we can clearly separate each spine from each other and from the mother dendrite in moving animals. Therefore, we can simultaneously record and separate transients from spines even when they are located in the hidden and overlapping positions that are required to precisely understand dendritic computation (Figure 6 D).

Curvature-thickness coupling

To better understand the obtained shapes, we recast the cell-level energy Eq. (1) in the continuum limit following ref. We approximate cell shape by a truncated right square pyramid whose in-plane isometry imposes a fluid-like response to local shear stress. Cell shape is parametrized by local principal curvatures c 1 and c 2 of the midplane as well as by tissue thickness h, i.e. cell height, measured in units ofand, respectively (Supplementary Note 1). The dimensionless harmonic elastic energy per unit area readsThe first two terms together represent the surface tension, whereas the third and the fourth term are the local and the Gaussian bending energy per unit area, respectively. Note that the thickness h in Eq. (6) is an independent variable. While it is constant in a flat tissue at α = β, in the nontrivial shapes h is coupled to the local curvature. As a result, the surface tension varies along the surface and so do the local bending modulus, the spontaneous curvature, and the Gaussian modulus [i.e. the last term in Eq. (6) divided by the Gaussian curvature c 1 c 2]. These features render the tissue energy functional quite different from the usual surface and bending energies of solid or fluid membranes.

Figure 4
A Schematic Showing the Relationship between Lung SA/V and Density under two scenarios. The top panel represents normal lung architecture with the dimensions of each "alveolus" being 100 × 100 μm yielding a total volume of the "lung" = 16,000 μm 3 with a surface area of 6,400 μm 2 and a SA/V of 0.4. If we assign a mass of 10 units to each 100 μm length of "alveolar wall" this "lung" has a mass of 400 units and a density of 0.025 units/μm 3 (= 400 units/16,000 μm 3). In A, the volume and thickness of the "alveolar walls" remains the same as those in "normal lung architecture" but the surface area is decreased due to destruction of "alveolar walls". In this scenario, the reduction in SA/V and density are proportional. However in scenario B, the thickness of the "alveolar walls" is doubled therefore increasing the mass. The resultant SA/V is the same as in A whereas the density is higher than in A and even higher than the Normal. Thus if there is addition of tissue, the relationship between SA/V and density is disrupted.

### Neural correlates of top-down modulation of haptic shape versus roughness perception [^e0efdc19]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

The exploration movement was demonstrated by the experimenter before the start of the experiment using complete cuboids. After this demonstration, participants always performed the exploration task without vision of the objects and objects were covered when in view of the participant. In particular, participants were instructed to either judge the shape or the roughness of two successively presented objects. In the shape task, participants were asked to indicate which object felt longer. In the roughness task, participants indicated which of the two objects felt rougher.

In a fully randomized design, 25 unique objects are possible by the combination of the five roughness and the five shape levels and multiple exemplars (ideally all 25 for every trial in a block and in a session = 25 × 5 × 3 = 375 objects) would be needed to ensure a reasonably rapid presentation of trials. Since printing this saturated set of objects would have been a long and costly process, we opted for a more economical solution and limited the number of objects by producing six sets of objects that were predefined as follows. Each set consisted of 10 objects corresponding to five trials (one trial = two objects). Each trial contained both the roughness and the shape standard (not necessarily on the same object) and each set contained all five possible comparisons of the standard against the five comparison levels for both features/dimensions. Adhering to these specifications, the objects of each set were pseudorandomly determined and then printed. Table 1 lists the parameters of one set of objects as an example.

Table 1
Set 1 (out of six sets) of objects presented in one exploration block

2.3 Apparatus

In order to allow for quick successive object presentations, all the stimuli presented in one session were mounted on a conveyer belt of rubber (length = 208 cm) running between two cylinders. The cylinders were mounted on separate tables which could be fixated on the scanner bed (see Figure 1 a). One cylinder was at waist level of the participant, who lay under the apparatus. When a stimulus was over that cylinder, facing the participants, they could comfortably grasp this stimulus with the right hand (see Figure 1 b). The other cylinder was at foot‐level and connected with a crank handle by which the experimenter manually turned the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt carried 30 mounts (a total of three sets of objects) on which the objects were attached (see Figure 1 d). The apparatus was partly moved inside the scanner bore during scanning.

### A mathematical model for decreasing the surface area of surgical excisions [^937d7183]. Dermatologic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Repair of lower extremity excision defects poses a surgical challenge, and as a result, split-thickness skin grafting is often used to close large defects. By minimizing the size of the defect, a smaller graft can be used, which may translate into improvements in wound healing and the aesthetic outcome.

Objective

To demonstrate, using a mathematical model, how to decrease the surface area of excisions on lower extremities requiring split-thickness skin grafting.

Methods

Four patients had cutaneous neoplasms excised from their lower legs. The resulting defects underwent partial primary closure with removal of Burrow's triangle. The new dimensions of the defect were recorded, and the surface area of the pre- and postprimary closure was calculated.

Results

Modest decreases in the dimensions of the ovoid-ellipsoid defect translated to large decreases in the surface area requiring split-thickness skin graft repair.

Conclusion

Using a mathematical model, we quantified how it is possible to decrease the size of an excision site. This reduction in surface area may translate to benefits in a postoperative outcomes.

### Acquisition-related morphological variability in structural MRI [^9a43376a]. Academic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Significant effort has been spent during the past decades to develop innovative image-processing algorithms and improve existing methods in terms of precision, reproducibility, and computational efficiency, but relatively little research was undertaken to find out the extent to which the validity of results obtained with these methods is limited by inherent imperfections of the input images. This observation is especially true for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based morphometry, which aims at precise and highly reproducible determination of geometric properties of anatomic structures, although MRI images are geometrically distorted.

Materials and Methods

A method for characterization of site-specific geometric distortions and results of a long-term study designed to find the extent to which imperfections in the data-acquisition process limit the reliable detection of subtle morphological changes in MRI data acquired with state-of-the-art scanners are presented. Because of the long-term character of the study, results include effects resulting from limited hardware stability, as well as from imperfections in patient repositioning.

Results

Maximal relative morphological changes detected in our phantom data series were 1.0 mm positional and 2.0% volumetric difference (relative to a 7600-mm3 cuboid) in a subvolume relevant for whole-brain morphometry. Morphological variability was even greater for human volunteer data (up to 5% in local gray matter volume) because of movements during scan, natural morphological variability, and a presumably less precise segmentation procedure.

Conclusion

Imperfections in the MRI data-acquisition process in combination with practical limitations in patient repositioning can substantially confound studies of subtle morphological changes.

FIGURE 1
Physical models (three cubes; A, B, and C) to illustrate the influences of variations in morphology and composition on passive heat exchange, adapted with permission from Taylor and Notley. Each cube was first heated in a stirred water bath (40°C) to a common central (core) temperature, and then cooled (time zero) in a second water bath (20°C). Panel A shows time-dependent changes in central temperature in each object, whereas panel B shows the cooling rate of each cube over a 5°C temperature range (30°C to 25°C), as bolded in Panel A. Panel C denotes the dimensions and thermal properties of each cube. Cubes A and B (both beeswax) differed only in size, with cube B being larger than cube A. Cubes A and C differed only in composition, with cube C being made of plasticine, and thus, of higher density and thermal conductivity, but of lower specific heat capacity.

These first principles become particularly important for morphologically divergent groups, such as children and adults, who differ markedly in body size. Indeed, relative to the average young man age 20 yr (mass, 71 kg; surface area, 1.87 m 2; specific surface area, 264 cm 2 ·kg −1), a boy age 9 yr (mass, 28 kg; surface area, 1.03 m 2; specific surface area, 368 cm 2 ·kg −1), would possesses a lower body mass and surface area, but a higher specific surface area for heat exchange (Fig. 2). It follows that when a thermal gradient exists for heat loss (i.e. ambient temperature cooler than the skin), children would be expected to dissipate more heat per unit mass than adults. Conversely, in hotter environments (i.e. warmer than the skin), children would gain more heat per unit mass than adults (Fig. 2).

### Neuronal diversity and stereotypy at multiple scales through whole brain morphometry [^eab9ff92]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Based on the correlation map (M c), we assessed the intra-compound area consistency as the distribution of correlations between all pairs of regions within the compound area. In this way, the distributions for all 13 compound areas were calculated (Fig. 2A).

The neurite detection algorithm is an efficient pipeline without utilizing deep learning models. The procedure can be summarized in 6 steps:
Estimation of an empirical foreground threshold for each brain. This step involved finding an empirical threshold value (thresh) to distinguish between the foreground (neurite voxel) and background (non-neurite voxels) on the lowest-resolution image. The threshold was estimated based on the mean and standard deviation of all voxels: where μ and σ were the mean and standard deviation of all voxels of the brain (16-bit image).
Split the brain into non-overlapping image blocks. In this step, the third lowest resolution brain images were split into small non-overlapping blocks for subsequent memory-affordable processing. We utilized the image blocks of Vaa3D-TeraFly files at the specific resolution of approximately 256 voxels in each dimension.
Pre-filtering. This step involves filtering out blocks that are unlikely to contain neurite. Image block files (in compressed TIFF format) that were smaller than a certain size (1.7 MB) or had a maximum pixel value lower than 300 were considered neurite-free blocks and were excluded.
Calculation of the salient map. An image block was firstly denoised by an adaptive filter similar to the "ada_threshold" plugin on Vaa3D. At the same time, an anisotropic salience map was estimated through block-wise PCA analysis on 16 × 16 × 16 voxels-sized cuboids which were upsampled from 16 × 16 × 4 cuboids of the original image, as the resolution in z axis of the image is about 3 times smaller than that in x and y axes. The anisotropy score of each cuboid is defined as, where S 1, S 2, and S 3 are the eigenvalues of first, second, and third principal components of the cuboid, similar to the content index Q in previous studies. The final salient map was calculated by multiplying the denoised image and anisotropy map.
Thresholding. The salient map was thresholded using 0.1 × thresh calculated in step 1. thresh may be manually adjusted based on the segmentation results if it was inappropriate.
Mapping neurite voxels to CCFv3 atlas. Finally, the identified neurite voxels were mapped to the CCFv3 space and summarized by regions to obtain a region-wide neurite voxel vector in the shape of 314. The vector was then normalized by dividing it by the total number of neurite voxels, resulting in a neurite density vector for the brain.

### Does 3D phenotyping yield substantial insights in the genetics of the mouse mandible shape? [^e8d2adda]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

It may initially appear that not much difference exists between the mapping results based on 3D manual landmarks and their 2D projections, due to their significant overlap (Figure 4). However, the benefit of adding the third dimension is demonstrated by the reduction in the confidence intervals of the QTL estimates. The median CI estimate for our 2D projection results was 11 cM. Yet, when we conducted the mapping on 3D landmarks, extreme CIs were marginally reduced and median CI was down to 6.3 cM when we used semilandmarks. The difference was even more striking when we considered the total length of the QTL intervals, which dropped by 120 cM, representing a 38% drop in the number of known protein coding genes with 75% of QTL covering at most 146 protein coding genes (358 with 2D and 271 with 3D landmarks). The 2D projection data yielded very similar results to the one of 13.3 cM obtained from the remaining 24 QTL reported in earlier studies despite a marked difference in molecular marker density (10-fold).

The consideration of the third dimension leads to the discovery, with 3D landmarks, of two additional QTL on chromosome 1 and 14, both QTL covering a few mandible-annotated genes (Disp1, Hhat, Ifr6, and Kat6b). Adding one dimension to each landmark (i.e. 10 independent dimensions to the shape space) increases detection power. This increase in power is not just related to bigger effect sizes or higher dimensionality, which could be more costly than useful in some cases. The two additional QTL actually have 26% and 32% of their effects along these additional dimensions. Thus, the specific consideration of the third dimension in the mapping is clearly very informative in these cases. The relaxed constraints on homology of semilandmarks and their ability to densely model the surface of bone led to the discovery of eight additional QTL. Three of them show between 20–30% of their effect on the third dimension. Three of those additional QTL cover one to four mandible-annotated candidate genes: Lef1, Rere, and in the same QTL Akap13, Kif7, Serpinh1, and Folr1. The overall additive genetic variation (G) is consistent between 2D and 3D data, both in terms of the amount of total variation captured and the directionality of major variations. Beyond an overall similarity with other data, semilandmarks capture original shape features related to the bone surface, and those features drive the pattern of multivariate heritability.

### Scutoids are a geometrical solution to three-dimensional packing of epithelia [^294c4ee8]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Thus, a cell packing configuration in any plane perpendicular to the basal-apical direction is circumscribed to a quadrilateral (Fig. 4a). Our theoretical model relies on an idealized situation where packing is described in terms of two limiting stable configurations that are characterized by the length of their edges, l w and l h. Here, for simplicity, we also use l w and l h to refer to the packing configurations. Therefore, when estimating the energy from experimental measurements (Methods), we assumed that an actual configuration can be effectively represented as a linear combination of those fundamental modes (Fig. 4a). In addition, a third, unstable, configuration is possible if l w = l h = 0, (fourfold vertex configuration, Fig. 4a, b). By focusing on the tensile forces controlling cell interactions, an energy functional can be defined. Under these conditions, the energy landscape of a particular motif can be determined, and the stability of packing configurations can then be ascertained as a function of the length of the edge and the cellular aspect ratio, see Fig. 4b (Methods). We note that the changes in the aspect ratio, as a readout of the surface ratio anisotropy, relies on the assumption that cellular motifs are not affected by neighbouring configurations.

### Reaction-diffusion in a growing 3D domain of skin scales generates a discrete cellular automaton [^5d0139ac]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Dimensionality-reduction

Dimensionality reduction from 2D to 1D for diffusion in a narrow 2D channel has been formally derived. To our knowledge, derivation of dimensionality reduction from 3D to 2D does not exist in the literature. Here, we propose computationally-efficient dimensionality-reduction approaches where skin thickness variation is projected in 2D as tuned RD components' concentrations and effective diffusion coefficients. More specifically, for a RD system of the form:in a 3D geometry bounded (i.e. with no-flux) at bottom and top by, respectively, two functionsand(Supplementary Fig. 1A), the integrated concentrationwith respect to the z coordinate is given by:

Given that the variation in z of u, v, and w at any (x, y) point is much smaller than the difference of these concentrations between green and black scales (as shown in bona fide 3D simulations; Fig. 2F), we assume that there is no variation of the 3D density c in the z direction. This assumption is justified, for diffusion without reaction terms, using the systematic expansion of the diffusion equation at leading order(and its straightforward generalisation to higher dimensions). When adding the reaction terms, the assumption of no variation of c in the z direction remains justified by the thickness of the domain being smaller than the typical length-scale of the RD pattern. This assumption then results in:whereis the domain height.

For an elementary column volume(Supplementary Fig. 1B) in a RD system, the general mass conservation law requires:where the first and second right-hand side terms are the diffusion and reaction terms, respectively.is the diffusional flux per unit area accounting for a constant concentration in the z direction, S is the surface area of the element andis the outward facing surface normals. Given the assumption that c does not vary in the z direction, we can write the left-hand side of the equation as:

Considering each side of the elementary volume separately, the diffusion term gives:Whereas the reaction term becomes:

Substituting these three latter expressions in the general mass conservation equation and dividing by ε 2, we obtain:i.e.

In one dimension, the first right-hand side term is equivalent to the Fick–Jacobs equationwhere D is a constant diffusion coefficient. Thickness of the domain is therefore taken into consideration by the linear correction of the diffusion coefficient D (x, y) by the corresponding value z(x, y) at that position.

### 3D nanoprinting via spatially controlled assembly and polymerization [^8e4080eb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

3D nanoprinting of structures

The capability to print 3D structures by design was also demonstrated, with representative 3D structures shown in Fig. 4. The first structure is a set of stacked grids: an array of 10 parallel lines, 100 µm long with 10 µm separation, were printed atop a pre-functionalized quartz surface. Then the same printing protocols were followed by delivering 10 lines of p(PEGA-co-HEANB) atop and perpendicular to the first array. As shown in Fig. 4A the outcome exhibited high fidelity when compared to the design, with completely parallel lines separated by designed periodicity and perpendicularity from one array to the next without distortion or fuzzy edges. The height of lines measured to be 26 and 34 nm, for the first and second arrays, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4B. The cross-section was 60 nm tall, consistent with the concept of stacking individually printed passes on top of one another and is shown more clearly in the 3D image in Fig. 4C. The printing of multiple layers of a square pattern one after another is shown in Fig. 4D. The structure was created by printing 10 consecutive squares atop each other with 30 µm side length. The resulting structure shows a 3D square with walls of 98 ± 12 nm in height and 2.3 ± 0.3 μm in width, showing that the continuous deposition of materials enables the formation of taller features when compared to a single deposition, with minimal distortion in the final structure. Another 3D structure demonstrated was the stacking of cuboids (Fig. 4E) atop one another, whose designed dimensions are summarized in Table 1. The base was a cuboid with designed dimensions of 40 μm × 40 μm × 40 nm. Stacking atop this cuboid was a smaller cuboid with 20 μm × 20 μm × 15 nm. At the top were four cones designed to be 15 nm tall and 400 nm wide. As shown in Fig. 4E and outlined in Table 1, the outcome faithfully followed the design. The base cuboid measured as 42.1 ± 1.6 μm × 41.2 ± 1.5 μm in lateral dimensions and 61 ± 5 nm tall, produced by printing 133 lines at 300 nm separation. The next cuboid atop of the center region of the base measured 21.5 ± 1.3 μm × 20.8 ± 1.4 μm × 15 ± 2 nm created by printing 40 lines with 500 nm separation. The four cones are located at the center of the four quadrants atop the second cuboid. Each cone was produced by dispensing a droplet of liquid polymer with a contact time of 1 s under 200 mbar delivery pressure. The dimensions of the cones measured 340 ± 23 nm at the base and 17 ± 2 nm tall. The capability of printing 3D structures by design has been demonstrated by other designs and using a variety of probes (Supplementary Figure 5). In all cases, the neat polymer ink crosslinked rapidly and maintained its stability for a minimum of 7 days. Additionally, depositing atop of this structure through the delivery of neat polymer does not alter the cured structures underneath. These observations further prove that our approach and materials enabled 3D nanoprinting by design.

### Scutoids are a geometrical solution to three-dimensional packing of epithelia [^e3dda200]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To study the tubular model, we chose the Voronoi 5 diagram of the CVT, since it resembled a homogeneous distribution of the cells. The 20 Voronoi 5 diagrams that represented the cylinder were used to create a new lateral surface of a new cylinder with a larger radius and the same height (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In this way, we were able to generate a model that represented the inner (initial) and the outer (expansion) lateral surfaces of a tube. The surface expansion was established in 9 steps using the following formula: The calculations were made by maintaining fixed the R a length (inner surface) and increasing proportionally the R b length (outer surface, Supplementary Fig. 1).

To partition the outer surface with Voronoi cells we used the following strategy: we multiplied the size of abscissas axis of the original image (apical) by the surface ratio (R b / R a) (Supplementary Fig. 1). In a similar way, abscissas coordinates (X) of the Voronoi seeds were multiplied by the same factor, getting a new position of the seeds in the basal surface that corresponds to the given surface ratio expansion. Using these seeds, we applied again (b), (c), and (e) steps, using the size of the enlarged image. The Voronoi cells corresponding to the original seed and their projections were tracked and labelled with a specific colour allowing their identification along different surfaces. (Figs. 1 f–g and 3a and Supplementary Fig. 1).

2.2 Stimuli

The stimuli were cuboids that differed in their shape (oblongness) and roughness. They were produced by 3D printing (Object30Pro, Stratasys, material VeroClear, nominal resolution 600–1,600 dpi). With regard to shape, the cuboids had the same diagonal length (d = 56.57 mm) and width (w = 30 mm) but differed in the relative length of their sides such that five different levels of oblongness were created (lengths of the shorter/longer side 40.0/40.0, 35.6/44.0, 31.2/47.2, 26.8/49.8, 22.4/51.9 mm; see Figure 1). Stimuli were always presented in the same orientation, that is, with the shorter side facing towards the participant (Figure 1 b). The surface of each cuboid possessed a certain roughness. Roughness was defined as one‐dimensional (1D) square‐wave function with an amplitude of 0.3 mm and was varied on five levels by groove widths of 0.25, 0.34, 0.42, 0.51, or 0.59 mm, respectively. Ridge width always equaled groove width. In every trial, a standard (31.2 mm length for shape, 0.42 mm groove width for roughness) had to be judged against a comparison stimulus (1 of the 5 levels of roughness/shape).

Vessel density, tortuosity, and fractal dimension — extraction and associations: Extraction of pulmonary vascular data from imaging can be automated or semiautomated, with arteries and veins automatically mapped, peripherally matched, and classified; loss of pulmonary vascular density or distal pulmonary artery (PA) blood volume is associated with right heart failure indices in smokers, emphysema progression, and asthma severity. Vessel tortuosity can be determined by comparing the linear distance between two points on a vessel with the actual 3D path length, and this distance metric is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and correlated with mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and arterial and venous oxygen content and saturation. Fractal dimension may be determined by lung cube counting across scales where the slope of the linear portion of a double logarithmic plot defines fractal dimension, or estimated from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion scans by calculating the relative dispersion (standard deviation/ mean) in progressively smaller blocks and evaluating the slope of log relative dispersion versus log number of voxels averaged.

### Accurate prediction of three-dimensional humanoid avatars for anthropometric modeling [^437fc970]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Advances in 3D optical imaging are providing an unprecedented opportunity to amass large databases of humanoid avatars that can be used as reference samples for developing manifold regression prediction models such as those reported in the current study. While the produced images in earlier studies appeared visually accurate, a critical question remained: are predicted avatars also accurate with respect to actual physical dimensions? The current study was designed to examine this question by comparing circumferences, volumes, and surface areas on humanoid avatars generated by manifold regression to corresponding measurements made on avatars acquired in healthy adults with a 20-camera 3D optical scanner; identical software was used to process predicted and ground-truth avatars. Our findings answered the question affirmatively: group mean values for 6 circumferences, 7 volumes, and 7 surface areas observed in 84 adults did not differ significantly from those acquired with the optical scanner except for arm circumferences (Δ, ~ 5%). While measures of agreement such as R 2 s, RMSEs, and CCCs were all strong for predicted versus actual avatars, there was significant bias detected on several of the digitally estimated anthropometric measurements. These small bias effects can potentially be reduced or even eliminated in future studies by expanding the manifold regression sample and/or adding more or different accessible features to the developed prediction equations. Accessible features that could serve as regression model covariates, other than DXA, include multiple different or combined resistance, reactance, and phase angle whole-body and regional values at a range of frequencies acquired with BIA, %fat as measured with BIA, and body density and %fat as quantified with air-displacement plethysmography (ADP). Evaluating the many potential manifold regression model covariates and interactions was beyond the scope of the present study but would be an appropriate follow-up investigation aimed at furthering the accuracy of predicted avatar anthropometric dimensions.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^af0c85b6]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Algorithmic implementation: Comparing the moved cube to the reference cube was achieved as follows: each reference cube is described by six planes, constituting inequality constraints. Each plane is defined by one point on each surface and a corresponding norm vector, defining "inside" (and consecutively, of course, "outside"), establishing a set of six cutting planes. The reference cube is then moved, using the rigid‐body parameters from the realignment procedure. This creates the moved cube described by its eight (moved) corners and their connections, which again are vectors. The intersection of these vectors with a given cutting plane can be calculated using linear interpolation, resulting in a new set of (cut) vectors, jointly defining a new (cut) surface. The iterative application of all six cutting planes will remove all parts of the moved cube that are "outside" of the reference voxel's boundaries. The coordinates of the remaining shape can then be used to generate a convex 3D shape using Delauney triangulation. As rotations are involved, the shape may be irregular, but it is a polygon, and every polygon can be triangulated (de Berg et al.). This triangulation will yield a set of tetrahedra whose (sum of) volumes can be calculated. The volume of this remnant of the moved cube can then finally be related to the volume of the reference cube.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Emergent collective organization of bone cells in complex curvature fields [^d8266a1d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We explored different surface families based on their mean and Gaussian curvature profiles, and focused on axisymmetric surfaces, as these could readily be converted to printable substrates. The first geometry that we selected was the unduloid, which is a simply periodic surface family with constant, non-zero mean curvature. An unduloid interpolates between a cylinder and a string of connected spheres, depending on its specific parametrization (Supplementary movie 1). This interpolative nature enabled us to select a cylinder, a set of spheres, and an intermediate unduloid all of which with the same (constant) mean, yet different Gaussian curvatures (Fig. 1b, e). Next, we selected two saddle surfaces (i.e.): the pseudosphere, having constant negative Gaussian curvature (as opposed to a sphere with constant positive Gaussian curvature), and the catenoid, having constant zero mean curvature (i.e. a minimal surface). Since these surfaces are not simply periodic by nature, we designed strings of repeating pseudospheres and catenoids, in accordance with the other surfaces (Fig. 1b). Finally, we included a sinusoidally deformed cylinder. In contrast to a normal cylinder, this deformed variant is enriched with alternating regions of positive and negative Gaussian curvatures (Fig. 1e).

We sized the surfaces to appropriate cell-scale dimensions, based on previous studies, and used them as templates for half-revolution master molds that were 3D printed using two-photon polymerization (2PP). Single- and two-step replica molding with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) provided us with precisely curved cell culture environments, consisting of both concave imprints and convex protrusions of the same surfaces (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). By using both the concave and convex variants, we could significantly expand our total curvature spectrum, as these substrates feature the same Gaussian curvatures, yet opposite mean curvatures. A natural consequence of using substrates consisting of half-revolution surfaces attached to planar surroundings is that the curved-to-planar transitions present relatively high local curvature changes (Fig. 1e). While typically ignored in previous studies, we explicitly account for these regions in our subsequent analysis, which is enabled by the analytical parametrizations of the surface families used in this study (Supplementary note 1).

### Three-dimensional surface imaging: limitations and considerations from the anthropometric perspective [^ed83a9ab]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The use of three-dimensional (3D) surface imaging for clinical measurement purposes has increased considerably as the technology has become more affordable. Like any measurement technique, 3D surface-based anthropometry is subject to a number of limitations and methodological caveats and thus should not be applied without sufficient consideration of its potential strengths and weaknesses. In this brief report, the authors consider 3D surface imaging from the anthropometric perspective, specifically focusing on issues related to the capture of reliable quantitative information from the head and face.

### Accurate prediction of three-dimensional humanoid avatars for anthropometric modeling [^cb1c15b4]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the hypothesis that anthropometric dimensions derived from a person's manifold-regression predicted three-dimensional (3D) humanoid avatar are accurate when compared to their actual circumference, volume, and surface area measurements acquired with a ground-truth 3D optical imaging method. Avatars predicted using this approach, if accurate with respect to anthropometric dimensions, can serve multiple purposes including patient body composition analysis and metabolic disease risk stratification in clinical settings.

Methods

Manifold regression 3D avatar prediction equations were developed on a sample of 570 adults who completed 3D optical scans, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) evaluations. A new prospective sample of 84 adults had ground-truth measurements of 6 body circumferences, 7 volumes, and 7 surface areas with a 20-camera 3D reference scanner. 3D humanoid avatars were generated on these participants with manifold regression including age, weight, height, DXA %fat, and BIA impedances as potential predictor variables. Ground-truth and predicted avatar anthropometric dimensions were quantified with the same software.

Results

Following exploratory studies, one manifold prediction model was moved forward for presentation that included age, weight, height, and %fat as covariates. Predicted and ground-truth avatars had similar visual appearances; correlations between predicted and ground-truth anthropometric estimates were all high (R 2 s, 0.75–0.99; all p < 0.001) with non-significant mean differences except for arm circumferences (%Δ~5%; p < 0.05). Concordance correlation coefficients ranged from 0.80–0.99 and small but significant bias (p < 0.05–0.01) was present with Bland-Altman plots in 13 of 20 total anthropometric measurements. The mean waist to hip circumference ratio predicted by manifold regression was non-significantly different from ground-truth scanner measurements.

Conclusions

3D avatars predicted from demographic, physical, and other accessible characteristics can produce body representations with accurate anthropometric dimensions without a 3D scanner. Combining manifold regression algorithms into established body composition methods such as DXA, BIA, and other accessible methods provides new research and clinical opportunities.

Airway comparative analysis — matching approaches and caveats: Table 5 outlines selection criteria with example metrics and considerations, including designation of "Terminal bronchiole", designating a generation number for each airway, path distance (e.g., 5 cm from carina or pleura), lumen size (e.g., 2-mm-diameter airways), and airways at a stipulated inner perimeter with wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10); considerations note pathology may alter airway status, anatomical variations in branching pattern, body and lung size variations, risk of bias when pathology alters airway dimension (e.g. COPD may narrow airway lumens; therefore, 2-mm airways may occur at a different generation compared with subjects without COPD), and that regression assumptions should be confirmed with potential effects of outliers assessed.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Principles for enhancing virus capsid capacity and stability from a thermophilic virus capsid structure [^4d2bac73]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

P74-26 MCP occupies much more surface area than observed in other HK97 folds. The MCP of P74-26 contains a typical number of residues (Supplementary Table 3), so this is not simply due to lengthening the MCP primary sequence. Instead, P74-26 efficiently uses extended loop architecture to create a structure with large surface area. There are eight structural changes that increase the surface area of MCP. The first change is the P74-26 E-loop β-hairpin, which is 44 residues in length, whereas the range of E-loops in other HK97 folds is 32–34 residues. The greater number of residues allows the E-loop to extend much further (~70 vs. ~53 Å for P74-26 and HK97 phage, respectively). The second change is an elongated N-arm (52 residues extending ~44 Å vs. 36 residues and ~37 Å extension, averaged across other Caudoviruses). The N-arm of P74-26 also reverses direction to directly contact the P-domain. This unique N-arm architecture covers much more surface area than other N-arms. The third change is the P74-26 C-arm, which forms a unique extended structure that runs along the outside of the A-domain. The C-arm binds two adjacent A-domains within a capsomer such that the axial region of the capsomer is enlarged (Fig. 2d, e; Supplementary Fig. 6a). The A-domain surface area is increased by the fourth and fifth major structural changes: a unique helix at the tip of the A-domain that extends the axial dimension by ~6 Å, and an extended loop region (residues 295–311) that widens the A-domain (Fig. 4c, d). The final three major structural changes are three loops that emanate from the P-domain (the G-loop, S-loop, and T-loop; Fig. 4d). Each of these three regions of the P-domain play critical roles in intra- or inter-capsomer interactions, which we delineate below.

Fig. 4
Dimensionality-reduction is accurate and computationally efficient.

A A parametrised hexagonal lattice of 3D scales (two left panels) is generated by using, for each scale, the two-dimensional Gaussian function (inset) with heights of scales centres h and scales borders heights h p; the domain surface geometry is produced by fitting the constants a and b of the Gaussian function and keeping the standard deviations identical in the X and Y directions (σ X = σ Y, symmetrical Gaussian bumps). The height information (right panel) is then used to perform 2D simulations with two different dimensionality-reduction approaches. B Starting with identical initial conditions, 2D-reduced simulations (with h p/ h = 0.31) on a lattice of 450 × 417 elements with the Fick–Jacobs (left panel) and Bradley (central panel) methods, as well as 3D simulations (right panel), produce qualitatively very similar steady-state scale-by-scale patterns. Individual scales (white circles) with colour states opposite to those observed in the bona fide 3D simulation (green or black instead of black or green) amount to 6.4 and 1.5% of the scales for the Fick–Jacobs and Bradley methods, respectively. Parameter values are ɛ = 3, σ = 8, h = 16, D u = D v = 11.25 and D w = 135. C Profiles of components' concentrations are shown for the y coordinate indicated by the red dotted lines in the corresponding panels in (B); shades in right panel are minimum-maximum concentration intervals in the z direction (plain line is the average).

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^a2bca16c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a preliminary step, we derive the final displacement of the strip when folded at each break, in the absence of confinement. This problem can be mapped to the displacement of a walker performing a one-dimensional random walk with gamma-distributed steps. To enforce the concept of folding, the walker's steps occur in alternating directions. The distribution f Z (z) of position Z after 2 k steps accurate for all k is derived in full in Supplementary Note 2. However, the salient trends may be likewise observed by applying the central limit theorem and considering the position Z valid for large k, or small step size, which givesand describes a normal distribution of zero mean and variance L 0 θ.

If a confinement is now introduced at the locations ∣ z ∣ = w, we next ask with what likelihood the walker steps beyond this confinement. One approach to approximate this probability is to integrate Eq. (16) for all ∣ z ∣ > w, producing a two-sided survival function of Eq. (16). Although this is not equivalent to our initial question, as intermediate steps may also have landed past ∣ z ∣ > w, it proves an acceptable estimate as the last step has the greatest variance. A more accurate calculation would be to evaluate the likelihood that a given walk escapes the confinement at any step; however, looking at the last step is useful for its simplicity in analytical form, and still captures the anticipated behavior. A comparison to the more accurate formulation is made numerically and provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Once again, we pursue here the simpler form of the survival function valid for large k, and refer to Supplementary Note 2 for the exact derivation valid at all k. The survival function of Eq. (16), S Z (w; θ) = P (∣ Z ∣ > w; w ≥ 0), for a threshold confinement w, is given bywhere erf(z) is the error function. In order for walkers at ∣ z ∣ > w to be restored within the limits of confinement, one or more of their steps must fragment, thereby increasing the number of steps taken and decreasing the overall average, which drives the evolution of fragmentation. This articulates our key claim: considering our original, cylindrically shaped sheets as a statistical ensemble of one-dimensional random walks, we suggest that the progression of fragmentation measured by a change d t, over a single crumpling iteration d n, should be proportional to the fraction of walks in the ensemble which leave the confinement imposed at ∣ z ∣ = w: d t /d n ~ S Z (w; θ). Equivalently, this is the likelihood that a single random walk leaves the critical confinement. We note that this resulting fragmentation rate describes an average fragmentation likelihood given only a confinement w and current temporal parameter t = 1/ θ describing the maturity of the fragmentation process thus far; it does not enforce direct correlations between successive crumpling iterations, whereby new folds should occur preferentially along previous ones. Instead, the decrease in fragmentation rate with n is encoded through the decreasing mean facet area with t. Moreover, while stronger correlation is expected between walks representing nearby transects of the sheet, here we consider the statistical behavior of the sheet as a whole, and account for the increased fragmentation likelihood for facets with larger horizontal extent through the weighting introduced in Eq. (15). At present, Eq. (17) gives the likelihood that new creases will form; however, it does not yet describe how much new damage is created, for which two additional factors should be considered: (1) When the sheet is strongly confined in closely packed layers, the layers tend to collectively fragment, as alluded to by Sultan and Boudaoudand Gottesman et al. thus contributing a factor p ~ 1/ L such that halving the final height doubles the number of additional ridges. (2) In the opposite limit of low compaction, facets are not in close proximity and need not behave cooperatively; thus, new damage scales linearly with the amount of compression L 0 − L, as argued in Gottesman et al. With these additional considerations, we propose that the evolution of the fragmentation process with crumpling iteration behaves aswhere α is a fitted constant of proportionality. We indicate the explicit dependence on t here, as t and θ are inversely related. The critical width w is determined by the geometry of the imposed confinement, as illustrated in Fig. 6 d; a complete derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 4 :where R is the radius of the container. By consequence of Eq. (14) we can directly relate Eqs. (18) and (12) asand obtain a fit to the proportionality constant α. By performing an asymptotic approximation in the limit of large t, detailed in Supplementary Note 3, Eq. (18) may be analytically integrated to provide a scaling relationwhich bears similarity toof Eq. (11):where, and L 0 and R are the sheet length (equivalently the confining container height) and container radius, respectively. Taken together, Eqs. (14) and (21) thereby provide a theoretically motivated expressionbased on properties of fragmentation kinetics and a simple mechanism for re-fragmentation formulated as a random walk. Figure 7 compares the agreement of the empirical relations δ ℓ empir. and ℓ empir. as well as the derived models δ ℓ model and, with the measured quantitiesand ℓ meas. for various n. Collectively, the results of Figs. 4 and 7 demonstrate clear consistency of the fragmentation model with the anticipated logarithmic growth.

### Accurate prediction of three-dimensional humanoid avatars for anthropometric modeling [^d276854f]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Universal Software

Anthropometric body dimensions were evaluated in the predicted and ground-truth avatars with Universal Software. This software operates on Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and runs four sequences including pre-processing, landmark detection, body partitioning, and surface area calculation. Initial scan processing repairs gaps or imperfections in the 3D mesh. Major anatomic landmarks are next detected at the crotch, right/left armpits, shoulders, hips, and toes. The software then partitions body mass into six regions including head-neck, trunk, right/left arm, and right/left leg followed by calculation of body lengths, 6 circumferences (waist, hip, right/left mid-upper arm, right/left thigh) and 7 regional/total volumes (head/neck, torso, right/left arms and legs, whole-body), and the same 7 regional/total surface areas. The circumference sites are shown in Supplementary Information I and Fig. S1.

Measurements

The SS20 3D optical reference system includes twenty structured light infrared depth sensors mounted on four vertical columns. Participants stood in the A-pose at the center of the columns and data was acquired during a 4-second scan. The acquired avatars were analyzed using Universal Software.

The QDR Discovery DXA was operated with software version V8.26a:3.19 and calibrated at regular intervals according to manufacturer specifications. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey scanner option was turned off. Two components were evaluated, total body fat and fat-free mass; percentage (%) fat mass was derived as (fat mass/body mass) x 100.

Statistical methods

Avatars created using manifold regression (predicted) were compared with the actual (ground truth) participant avatars for selected circumferences, volumes, and surface areas using linear regression analysis (R 2) and with means (± SD), root-mean square errors (RMSEs), mean absolute errors (MAEs, X ± SE), concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs), and Bland-Altman analyses. Mean values for circumferences, volumes, and surface areas predicted with manifold regression were compared to their ground-truth counterparts with paired t-tests adjusted for multiple comparisons. The predicted and ground-truth avatar comparisons are presented separately for the circumferences and combined for the volumes and surface area evaluations.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^44fabd79]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Starting geometry creation and down-selection

The creation of a geometry that maximizes the benefit from freeform surfaces and requires less overall freeform departure, which also results in lower surface slope when only low-order (here up to Z15) Zernike polynomials are considered, is an important step in reducing the sensitivity and fabrication costs of the final design. Instead of first constructing a fully obscured rotationally symmetric system that is corrected through third-order then tilting the surfaces into a planar symmetric unobscured geometry as one might do with an off-axis conic or asphere design, this method focuses on first developing the geometries that are conducive to the application of freeform surfaces.

For a general optical system with some freedom to choose the folding geometry, this process begins by constructing a first-order optical layout in each possible permutation of surface tilt directions and image plane locations within each permutation. The magnitudes of the surface tilts should be minimized to what is necessary to avoid obscurations. An important feature and key point is that it is not critical at this stage that the layout variables (that is, surface powers and airspaces) take specific values, but rather are chosen to hold system constraints, such as focal length and system volume. The power distribution is typically chosen based on packaging constraints, surface sizes, flat-field conditions, and FOV requirements. The following N + 1 step procedure may be used to help determine layout variables that provide a sufficient starting point for a general optical system with N surfaces. Given a target system volume, as Step 1, set all airspaces between each surface to be roughly equivalent and to take full advantage of the allowed volume. With a chosen power distribution, in Steps 2 to N, assign radius of curvature values to the first N -1 optical surfaces, where all negative surfaces have radii equal to 1.5–2.5× the chosen airspace value and all positive surfaces have radii equal to 3–4× the chosen airspace value. In the N th + 1 step, the power of the final surface is chosen to hold the focal length of the system. It is important to reiterate that the specific values of the layout variables are not critical provided that the focal length, volume, and obscuration requirements are satisfied. Preferred values of the layout variables are determined in the optimization steps that follow developing this starting point. If other power distributions would satisfy the constraints of the design problem, this process can be repeated. The remainder of the design process will be demonstrated for the three-mirror imager, but can be adapted for a general system. A comprehensive selection of possible geometries for the imager using tilted surfaces is shown in Fig. 1, in which, the geometries have been grouped into a hierarchy of tiers based on the potential of each geometry to be corrected by freeform surfaces as predicted by methods that will be introduced below.

Significant (p < 0.05) bias observed with the Bland-Altman plots was present for the head, leg, and trunk with respective mean differences of 0.003–0.05 m 2. The correlation between predicted and measured total surface area had an R 2 (Fig. 4) and CCC of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively; non-significant bias was present with a mean difference of 0.02 m 2.

Composite summary

Overall, differences in the mean predicted and ground-truth circumference, volume, and surface area evaluations were all non-significant, except for the two arm circumferences (Δ, ~ 5%). All of the other measures of agreement were good-to excellent, although small significant bias was present across all three types of anthropometric measurements, primarily those of the arms and legs.

### Dynamic interface printing [^6ae23a6e]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Convex-slicing algorithm

The developed convex-slicing algorithm aims to correct for geometrical discretization differences between a traditionally flat construction surface and the curved surface used in this work. A detailed explanation of the convex-slicing process is given in the Supplementary Information. However, the main components will be briefly restated here. First, the general shape of the interface was determined by the Young–Laplace equation, which describes the Laplace pressure difference sustained across a gas–liquid boundary dependent on the material surface tension and surface normal. Here, we used axisymmetric print containers such thatcan easily be found by substituting the general expressions for principal curvatures. The capillary length, where γ is the material surface tension, ρ is the material density and g is the acceleration due to gravity, was used to normalize the radial and vertical coordinates of the interface asand. The resulting ordinary differential equation for the interface shape was.

This equation can be readily solved using numerical integration with appropriate boundary conditions (Supplementary Information section 4). However, using this method would require numerical integration for the steady-state case, and moreover, we would need to solve each intermediate state during compression with the associated boundary conditions. We, instead, opted to approximate the solution using cubic Bézier curves for the steady-state case and approximating the compressed profiles by geometrically deforming the Bézier curve while ensuring volume equivalency (Supplementary Information section 7). This is computationally faster given the large number of intermediate surfaces within the transient region. To convert the 2D Bézier solution into a 3D surface, the half-profile was revolved about the print head's central z axis (Supplementary Information section 5). This produced a sequence of surfaces starting at the compressed state and transitioning to the steady-state interface profile. The corresponding convex projection(s) were determined by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the Cartesian voxel grid and the surface arrays (Supplementary Information section 6). Reconstruction accuracy was validated by 'replaying' the projections over an empty voxel array and computing the Jaccard index between the reconstructed voxel array and the input voxel array (Supplementary Information sections 8 and 9).

### Defining the relationship between pocket and breast implant surface area as the basis for a new classification system for capsular contracture [^076240d8]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The precise cause of and treatment for capsular contracture remains uncertain, at least partially because there is no reliable quantitative measurement tool. To address this, it is postulated that the surface area of an implant as defined by the surrounding pocket may provide a quantifiable variable that can be measured to evaluate the degree of capsular contracture.

Methods

A bench model for capsular contracture was developed. The surface area of a series of spherical test objects and noncontracted and contracted breast implants was measured using a wax-coating technique and three-dimensional reconstructions created from computed tomographic scan images.

Results

Comparison of the mathematically calculated surface areas to the wax and computed tomographic scan results for spheres of known dimension provided nearly identical values, documenting the accuracy of the two experimental methods. Comparison of the surface area measurements between the test groups showed that the average decrease in surface area for all implants was 20 percent, ranging from a high of 30.9 percent for a low-profile implant to a low of 14.1 percent for a high-profile implant. The anatomically shaped devices demonstrated nearly uniform degrees of surface area change over three different heights with volume and projection held relatively constant.

Conclusions

The described bench model provides a useful tool for the study of capsular contracture. Surface area is a descriptive variable that can assess the degree of capsular contracture that is present. A classification system based on surface area is presented.

### Accurate prediction of three-dimensional humanoid avatars for anthropometric modeling [^ff6ed298]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current study confirms that the anthropometric dimensions of 3D humanoid avatars derived from manifold-regression are accurate on average, although with some small bias for some measurements, with respect to a ground-truth optical imaging method. Future studies are needed to refine our proof-of-concept findings and models with larger participant samples and additional model covariates. Combining manifold regression algorithms with established body composition modalities such as DXA, BIA, and ADP may provide new insights and clinical opportunities.

### Assembly of a patchy protein into variable 2D lattices via tunable multiscale interactions [^ac42edf0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A pre-equilibrated C98 RhuA structure was recentered at the origin and solvated in a pre-equilibrated 128.8 × 134.0 × 129.9 Å box (68,667 waters) prior to neutralization with 16 K + ions. An additional 3463 K + ions and 3463 Cl − ions were added, bringing the [KCl] to ca. 2.67 M (in 61,725 waters). This system was minimized for 1000 steps with all protein atoms fixed and subsequently equilibrated in the NPT ensemble (1 atm, 300 K) for 1 ns keeping the xy area constant. The final box dimensions were 128.8 × 134.0 × 125.1 Å.

The equilibrated protein system was merged with the equilibrated mica layers into a single structure using TopoTools such that the lowest position of protein Cα atoms on the C-terminal face was 25 Å above the average z coordinate of the bridging oxygen atoms on the mica surface (henceforth treated as position z = 0). Overlapping waters and ions were translated along the + z direction by the periodic c vector from the last frame of the protein simulation to minimize bad contacts. Finally, 750 Cl − ions were added to the solution to neutralize the system, bringing the solution ion concentrations to ~2.67 M K + and 3.33 M Cl −, close to experimental conditions. Solution-exposed K + ions on both faces of the mica slab were converted to the Joung-Cheatham atom type to reflect their occupancy by solution-phase ions, while K + ions on the interior retained their typing as prescribed by INTERFACE. The resulting system was minimized for 100 steps to remove bad contacts then equilibrated for 1 ns in the NPT ensemble, keeping the periodic a and b vectors constant at the equilibrated mica dimensions of 129.25 Å and 134.45 Å, respectively. All mica atoms were lightly constrained (1 kcal∙mol −1 ∙ Å −2) to their initial positions to prevent drift of the slab. The protein was restrained (by its Cα atoms) to its initial COM height (z = 50.0 Å relative to the mica surface oxygens), xy position, and angle of rotation using 100 kcal∙mol −1 restraints during initial equilibration. The average c vector over the last 50 ps of equilibration (185.5 Å) was then used to define the periodic cell dimensions for all subsequent runs. Mica hydrogen atoms were then released from constraints and the system was equilibrated for a further 2 ns at constant volume. In order to qualitatively determine whether C98 RhuA adsorption occurs directly at the surface or above the ionic slipping plane, the former configuration was obtained by pulling the protein 20 Å towards the mica surface over 5 ns using a 100 kcal∙mol −1 ∙ Å −2 moving restraint, such that the minimum Cα position was at z ≈ 5 Å.

### Surface area estimation for application of wound care [^63ce6c4d]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Estimation of surface for application of wound care is one of the important prognostic factors for wound healing. The objective of this study is to measure a surface area estimation for application of wound care. Non-invasive, 3D surface reconstruction methodology using two monocular cameras was implemented and verified. The measurement environment was setup on 10 patients with different kind of wounds. Phantom measurements, with known dimensions, show accuracy of implemented method below 11 percent The patient's measurements has the same accuracy. The implemented method use state of art algorithms and the cheap equipment and can be treated as an auxiliary, more objective method to quantify the wound healing process.

### Fracture of the cuboid [^de6331c0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Cuboid fracture accounts for a minority of all foot fractures in adults and often is indicative of a multiply injured foot. Understanding the normal anatomy and function of the cuboid and its relation to foot biomechanics is necessary for appropriate management. Clinical evaluation includes history, physical examination, and thorough assessment of the skin and soft tissues. Plain radiographs and CT are helpful in preoperative planning. Cuboid fractures may be managed either nonsurgically (splinting or casting) or surgically (closed reduction and external fixation or open reduction and internal fixation). Careful handling of the soft tissues is important, as is restoration of articular congruity, lateral column length, and a stable midfoot. Postoperative care consists of prolonged immobilization followed by 3 months of progressive weight bearing. Published reports of long-term outcomes and functional postoperative assessments are lacking.

The electrochemical lithiation and sodiation behaviors of each particle were characterized next. The empty FePO 4 hosts were prepared by chemical Li extraction (See Methods for chemical extraction and electrode preparation details), with the structure verification from Rietveld refinement (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 4). We first compared the constant current (de)intercalation curves of each particle in 1 M LiCl or 1 M NaCl aqueous solutions (Fig. 3a-d, Supplementary Figs. 9–10, and Supplementary Table 5). The decent capacity delivered during delithiation at 0.1 C (17 mA/g), ranged from 129 mAh/g for Cuboid-6000 nm particles to 159 mAh/g for Platelet-20 nm and Platelet-600 nm particles, indicating the low Li-Fe anti-site defects level, especially when considering the channel length (e.g. < 0.1% for Cuboid-6000 nm particles).

### Morphometric dimensions of the calcaneus [^25763611]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcaneal morphometric dimensions influence surgical treatment plans after injury. These dimensions display population heterogeneity, and there is a paucity of data in the setting of our hospital in Kenya. Further, estimation of calcaneal dimensions during reconstruction in comminuted fractures can be difficult. This cross-sectional study therefore aims to determine equations for estimation of these dimensions as well as provide local data. Sixty-four bilateral calcanei of adult indigenous Kenyans were obtained from the National Museum of Kenya and measured for maximum anteroposterior length, maximum height, cuboidal facet height, body height, and load arm length. The data were coded into SPSS software, and means were calculated. Paired t tests, independent t tests, and Pearson correlation tests were done, and linear regression model equations were developed. Data are presented using tables. In millimeters, the mean right and left values, respectively, were as follows: maximum anteroposterior length, 36.1063 and 35.3047; maximum height, 68.958 and 68.266; cuboidal facet height, 27.815 and 27.841; body height, 47.94 and 48.98; and load arm length, 18.83 and 17.93. Paired and independent t tests did not reveal statistically significant difference between the variables based on side or sex. Pearson correlational tests between the maximum length on each side and other variables revealed strong positive correlations, apart from the maximum width and load arm length on both sides. All correlational R 2 values were statistically significant, apart from that of the maximum width bilaterally. The calcaneus in our setting also showed markedly reduced values compared with other populations. These findings, and the proposed equations we developed, may be considered in local calcaneal reconstruction.

### Exploring the colloid-to-polymer transition for ultra-low crosslinked microgels from three to two dimensions [^d15f43cf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Compression isotherms for linear, ultra-low crosslinked (ULC) and regular crosslinked microgels. Surface pressure, π, versus the area normalized by added mass of microgels (Area/Mass) for 5 mol% crosslinked microgels (cyan lines), ULC microgels (black lines) and linear poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM; red line) at T = 20.0 ± 0.5 °C. The red squares with letters a–l indicate the π values of the atomic force micrographs in Fig. 4a–l. Inset: Plot of π versus the trough area normalized by the trough area at the contact point, Area/Area contact, of 5 mol% crosslinked microgels (cyan line), ULC microgels (black line) and linear pNIPAM (red line) at T = 20.0 ± 0.5 °C in log–log scale

The cyan curves in Fig. 3 exhibit two distinct increases after the contact. The first is between Area/Mass ≈6 × 10 2 cm 2 mg −1 and ≈2 × 10 3 cm 2 mg −1. The second is between ≈1.4 × 10 2 cm 2 mg −1 and ≈2.5 × 10 2 cm 2 mg −1. This two-stepped course is typical for microgels synthesized with the addition of crosslinker,– and is due to their well-defined core–shell structure. Upon adsorption, microgels are deformed, but their well-defined crosslinking density profile produces heterogeneities in polymer fraction laterallyand verticallyto the interface. The different stiffness of the core and the shell under compression is the reason for the presence of the two distinct plateaus.

The linear homopolymers (Fig. 3 red curve) have a single-stepped course, in agreement with literature. The reason for this is that flexible polymers can fully spread and cover the interface uniformly. Surprisingly, the compression isotherms of ultra-low crosslinked microgels (Fig. 3, black lines) exhibit a single-step increase, virtually identical to the linear pNIPAM. This also indicates that the ULC microgels cover the interface homogeneously due to the absence of a well-defined crosslinking density profile as highlighted by SANS. In other words, they behave as flexible polymers once confined at the interface. In contrast, for an ideal gas of hard spheres, π is expected to be determined by the excluded area effects and the collision rate before diverging at the maximum packing fraction in 2D.

### Comparison of radiogrammetrical metacarpal indices in children and reference data from the first zurich longitudinal study [^905ffa23]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The need for an investigation of various radiogrammetrical metacarpal indices in use today is illustrated by Fig. 3. The curves of the two most widely used indices, BMD and MCI, are in particular strikingly different. An early attempt at defining a validation criterion was made by Thodberg, who suggested using relative variability. This was based on the assumption that when there is a choice between several parameters for describing a complex, poorly understood biological feature, the one with the lowest relative variability will indicate a feature that is important for the organism's survival, because nature is least willing to compromise and allow wide variation. Although the differences in relative variability here are rather small, we believe that the criterion of minimal variability should in principle also apply to the field of bone physiology, especially considering the great economy with which organisms are known to make use of bone.

The BBRI showed by far the greatest relative variability of the five indices under study (Table 1). Its 95% CI per individual bin was well clear of those of any other index (not shown). Its large relative variability can also be seen intuitively from its formula, which reflects the fact that the strength of a cylindrical tube grows increasingly rapidly with increasing width. To use the concept described above, the large relative variability of the BBRI in children of equal chronological or bone age is an indication that bone health is not accurately defined by bone strength alone. The error incurred by equating the BBRI with bone strength can be neglected here because of its large deviations compared to the other indices. Its validity as a rough measure of bone strength has been studied by Gatti et al. who showed DXA-BBRI of the radius to be a better predictor of femoral neck fracture than DXA-BMD measured at the same site in women. The correlations of the other four indices with the BBRI, shown in Fig. 4, thus provide a rough impression of the degree to which each reflects bone strength.

### Radiation of pain: psychophysical evidence for a population coding mechanism in humans [^3fa4ab8d]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

In the third phase, participants underwent a visual session where visual stimuli of different sizes were presented on the ventral side of the forearm. The aim of this phase was to collect ratings, which would allow us to assess the general accuracy of "extent" ratings. In this phase, only stimuli with maximal intensity (8 lux × 10 2) were displayed; however, different masks were used such that the displayed squares had sides of 0.6, 1.6 (as used during the familiarization and the main task), 2.6, or 3.6 cm, which corresponded to the displayed areas of 0.36, 2.56, 6.76, and 12.96 cm 2. The masks were 3D printed and had a form of filament-based tubes attached to the tip of the light. The masks had square-like holes of dimensions calculated using the law of reversed squares. The masks were always attached at the same distance from the light source and the target (skin), which ensured that the distribution of light was equal across the surface and independent on the size of the cover. Stimuli were applied in a random order, and each stimulus size was repeated 3 times to increase measurement accuracy.

The last (main) phase of the experiment was based on 4 blocks of 12 stimuli. In each block, 4 different temperatures were used (Fig. 1) as a form of heat stimuli (43, 45, 47, and 49°C). Each temperature was repeated 3 times, and the order of presentation was pseudorandom. As in the familiarization phase, heat stimuli were interleaved by visual stimuli. Similarly, to heat protocol, 4 intensities of light were applied (2, 4, 6, and 8 lux × 10 2), and each of them was repeated 3 times. The selected intensities constituted the possible range of possible brightness output determined by the maximal and minimal voltage input set at the stimulus control device. Thus, in total, 12 heat and 12 visual stimuli were delivered per block. Because 2 blocks were applied to the hand (1 with 5-second plateau and 1 with 10-second plateau), and 2 to the forearm, a total of 48 heat and 48 visual stimuli were used for the main phase of this experiment. Visual stimuli were displayed on the subject's body instead of an external board to match the attentional demand between sensory systems, ie, visual and nociceptive.

### High-efficiency super-elastic liquid metal based triboelectric fibers and textiles [^08b3474d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The flexibility associated with thermal drawing can be further exploited to fabricate triboelectric fibers with complex architectures for enhanced efficiencies. We demonstrate in particular fibers with multiple liquid metal-based electrodes or microtextured surfaces shown in Fig. 1g–i, both of which show enhanced output performance, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 15, 16. To demonstrate the impact of such advanced microstructuring, the electric output of a triboelectric textile (6 cm × 6 cm) formed by a microtextured fiber was characterized, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. The peak values of V oc and Q sc triggered by hand tapping are as high as ~490 V (13.6 V/cm 2) and ~175 nC (4.86 nC/cm 2), which are estimated to be 55 and 42% higher than the texture-free counterpart, respectively. These values match the calculated surface area increase from a flat to a texture surface, which can indeed host a higher charge (see Supplementary Note 1). In Supplementary Table 2, we summarized the used materials, dimensions, and electrical outputs, and calculated electrical output densities (calibrated into unit area) of various textiles reported in recent years. From such a list, we conclude that the performance of our textile surpasses reported TENG textiles, and is comparable with, or even superior to, most 2D planar TENG configurations reported thus far.

### Anatomic description of the fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal articulation: a cadaveric study [^b69c456a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal joint, consisting of the fourth and fifth metatarsal and the cuboid, imparts a significant amount of motion to the foot during ambulation. Injury to this joint complex, through chronic deformation or acute trauma, often necessitates arthroplasty, arthrodesis, or fusion. Currently, there exists no studies that investigate the anatomy of this articulation. The purpose of this study is to describe the medial and lateral anterior cuboid articulations which allows for surgical planning and the advancement of hardware design. Twenty fresh-frozen below-the-knee cadaver legs were thawed and the cuboids were excised. The width and height of the entire joint complex were measured as the longest span across the total articular surface of the anterior cuboid. The width and height of each articular facet were recorded as the span across the geometric bisection of each individual surface. The mean anterior cuboid articulation width and height was 25.62 mm and 16.74 mm, respectively. The mean medial cuboid articulation width and height was 11.7mm and 13.65 mm, respectively. The mean lateral cuboid width and height was 16.74 mm and 12.78 mm, respectively. The medial articulation maintained a larger mean height and narrower mean width than the lateral facet (p < .05). The unique anatomy of the lateral tarsometatarsal joint complex plays an important functional role and requires attention when deciding between arthrodesis or arthroplasty. Increasing the understanding of the clinical anatomy of this joint will better prepare surgeons and product designers to anticipate hardware needs.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^13626f91]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Notably, our predictions suggest that complex networks, with suitably low elastic asymmetry, can be formed in equilibrium down to surprisingly low tubular volume fractions (at least as low as 15%). In addition to confirmation by SCF computations at even higher segregation strength, the stability of these "narrow tube" networks, as well as the strong dependence of the stability window in the range 0.5 ≲ ϵ ≲ 2.5, should be experimentally accessible via carefully adjusted combinations of branch and segment length asymmetry, along the lines of recent experiments on the effects of elastic asymmetry on complex sphere phase formation. These thermodynamic predictions are predicated on a revised picture of the underlying subdomain packing of chains. We have highlighted how the medial packing motif impacts detailed distributions of IMDS curvature (Fig. 5) and their sharp contrast with skeletal packing motifs Supplementary Fig. 11. Combined with recent advances in spatial mapping of subdomain IMDS shape via 3D tomography (i.e. slice and view scanning electron microscopy), these curvature distributions and their variation with elastic asymmetry and composition would provide at least an indirect fingerprint of medial packing. More direct confirmation of the detailed subdomain packing distribution requires reconstruction of the terminal geometry itself, or if not, spatial maps of the area per chain at the IMDS, both of which motivate experimental approaches to characterize 3D geometry of specifically labeled subregions of complex morphology.

### Experimental study of the characteristics of a novel mesh suture [^f03f5788]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study analysed in vivo and in vitro characteristics of a novel mesh suture. Although composed of the same material as standard sutures, and breaking at a similar strain, the mesh suture required a doubling of force to pull it through ballistics gel and to disrupt a newly sutured midline abdominal closure. The mesh suture was also incorporated into the surrounding tissue by 8 days after implantation.

The differences in early characteristics between the sutures are likely to be related to the novel outer design of the mesh suture, which increases the suture size, surface area and incorporation. The increased diameter and surface area of the mesh suture doubled the force required to pull it through ballistics gel. This is consistent with the effect of different sizes of solid sutures in an experimental abdominal wall burst model demonstrated by Rodeheaver and colleagues 2. The increased mesh suture surface area by definition increases the size of the suture–tissue interface and lowers the forces there (as shown by finite element analysis) 17, potentially reducing tearing. Increases in the total surface area of scar enveloping the filaments may explain the doubling of early laparotomy strength in the present model.

Force data were analysed both for the peak force produced by the testing system and for the slope of the force–elongation curves along their initial linear lengths. This permitted the modelling of the distraction system as a straightforward Hooke spring rather than a more complex viscoelastic system. This type of analysis has been performed in human and animal tendon studies 18, 19. The slopes of the force–elongation curve for a spring represent its tendency to return to its original length; laparotomy segments repaired with the mesh suture demonstrated a 78 per cent increase. The increased scar tissue around the filaments and within the hollow suture core created a thicker spring more resistant to stretch. Correlation between UTS and elasticity is consistent with a recent meta‐analysis 20 of tendons. In addition to increased elasticity, the mesh suture tissue segments on average stretched further before failure (3.6(0.3) versus 3.0(0.1) cm; P = 0.027). These properties explain why the work to UTS of mesh suture segments was triple that of 0‐polypropylene. Although counterintuitive to those with a working knowledge of meshes, the elasticity of the mesh suture itself was indeed higher than that of 0‐polypropylene. This is due to the greater amount of polypropylene material in mesh suture, as shown by the calculation of a greater total cross‐sectional area and the four longitudinal fibres that exist to prevent roping.

### Cinematic rendering-an alternative to volume rendering for 3D computed tomography imaging [^c684957a]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Volume rendering – technical background

The technical background of the VR technique has been repetitively explained in detail in a number of previous publications. VR represents a computer algorithm used to transform cross-sectional image datasets (from, e.g. CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging) into 3-D images. The VR technique consists of the following two steps: classification of each voxel and image projection. Classification determines how each point on the artificial rays that pass through the data contributes to the pixel value on the picture. For separation of different tissues (e.g. bone, soft tissue), a trapezoid is used for each tissue type. The tissue represented in each voxel of the volume dataset is determined by using predefined attenuation threshold levels and is assigned to a specific colour and opacity. Then, the weighted sum of the percentage of each tissue type represented in the voxel is calculated to determine the overall colour and transparency of each voxel. This step is performed for each voxel and for the whole volume dataset.

Then, the 3-D volume is displayed by using a projection technique. This is done by simulating rays of light, which are projected through the 3-D volume that contains the classified voxels. Each voxel, which is passed by the simulated rays, modulates the colour of the light depending on the assigned colour and transparency and contributes to the final projection and final image.

Finally, 3-D perception in the projected image can be enhanced by implementing additional effects, such as reflections and shadows on the surface of the rendered image. The final image can be manipulated by increasing or decreasing the slope of the trapezoid, which can be observed nearly in real time. When sliding the trapezoid towards lower Hounsfield unit values, more structures with lower attenuation will be included (e.g. smaller vessels), and vice versa.

### Emergence of the obesity epidemic: 6-decade visualization with humanoid avatars [^ccbdfc2d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Visualizations of the emerging obesity epidemic, such as with serial US color prevalence maps, provide graphic images that extend informative public health messages beyond those in written communications. Advances in low-cost 3D optical technology now allow for development of large image databases that include participants varying in race/ethnicity, body mass, height, age, and circumferences. When combined with contemporary statistical methods, these data sets can be used to create humanoid avatar images with prespecified anthropometric features.

Objectives

The current study aimed to develop a humanoid avatar series with characteristics of representative US adults extending over the past 6 decades.

Methods

3D optical scans were conducted on a demographically diverse sample of 570 healthy adults. Image data were converted to principal components and manifold regression equations were then developed with body mass, height, age, and waist circumference as covariates. Humanoid avatars were generated for representative adults with these 4 characteristics as reported in CDC surveys beginning in 1960–1962 up to 2015–2018.

Results

There was a curvilinear increase in adult US population body mass, waist circumference, and BMI in males and females across the 9 surveys spanning 6 decades. A small increase in average adult population age was present between 1960 and 2018; height changes were inconsistent. A series of 4 avatars developed at ∼20-y intervals for representative males and females reveal the changes in body size and shape consistent with the emergence of the obesity epidemic. An additional series of developed avatars portray the shapes and sizes of males and females at key BMI cutoffs.

Conclusions

New mathematical approaches and accessible 3D optical technology combined with increasingly available large and diverse data sets across the life span now make unique visualization of body size and shape possible on a previously unattainable scale. This study is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03637855 as NCT03637855.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

The scatter PRP normally stops at the retinal equator. The retinal area up to the equator corresponds to the area of a circle with a radius of 15.6 mm (Fig. 1 c). PRP was conducted without photocoagulation of the vascular arcade region and the optic disc. We set the PRP-free area as a circle with a radius of 5 mm, with a surface area equal to the area of a circle with a radius of 5.14 mm (Fig. 2). We assumed that the size of the spot on the retina was 400 μm, and that the spacing between each circle was equivalent to one spot.

### Automated volumetry at CT colonography: a phantom study [^eed51f21]. Academic Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To assess the performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithm for measuring polyp-like structures on CT colonography (CTC) images of a phantom.

Materials and Methods

We constructed a Plexiglas phantom to which we affixed a series of idealized Plexiglas polyp-like objects, including spheres and hemispheres. We imaged the phantom in a four-channel detector CT scanner at a 1.3 mm slice thickness with a reconstruction interval of 0.6 mm, using combinations of 100 mAs, 30 mAs, horizontal and vertical orientation. For each set of CT images, the interior surface of the phantom was segmented. The CAD algorithm was applied to the resulting surface to identify the polypoid regions of interest and to calculate their volume and maximum linear dimension. Calculated values were then compared with actual values to yield percent error in each measurement.

Results

The mean error in volume for the subgroups of spheres and hemispheres was 3% and 5% respectively. Mean error in linear dimension was approximately 2% for both shape subgroups. All CAD-calculated values were closely correlated with their respective actual values. Parameter selection did not significantly affect the accuracy of the calculated measurements.

Conclusions

Our CAD software accurately measured the greatest linear dimension and the volume of each of the polyp-like structures in our phantom. Results were largely independent of phantom orientation and the CT exposure factors.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrafine particles (UFPs) and nanoparticles — unique features and biologic behavior include size-based definitions and deposition/transport properties. UFPs are incidentally generated with aerodynamic diameter < 0.1 micrometer, whereas nanoparticles are manufactured with at least 1 dimension < 0.1 micrometer. Both particle types can effectively deposit in the alveolar space through diffusion, have high surface area/mass ratio, and large surface area allows UFPs to carry a relatively large load of hazardous cargo. Both physical and chemical properties determine the health effects of UFPs and nanoparticles. UFPs and select engineered nanoparticles can induce oxidative stress, airway inflammation, and toxicity. Particles can be transported by lung DCs to draining lymph nodes or translocate to distant organs through the bloodstream and can have adverse systemic health effects in many organs.

### Quantitative measurements of the coronoid in healthy adult patients [^4cc68394]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the hypothesis that a quantitative 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) modeling technique that can measure size, shape, and proximal articular surface area can be used to develop formulas that could predict the volume and proximal surface area of the intact coronoid based on anatomical and demographic data available in patients with fracture of the coronoid process.

Methods

We used a consecutive series of 50 CT scans with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm or less obtained in patients with fracture of the distal humerus, but no injury to the coronoid, to create 3-dimensional models. The volume and articular surface area of the coronoid were measured, and predictive formulas were based on anatomical measurements. We calculated gender using multiple linear regression.

Results

There were significant correlations between total coronoid volume and coronoid articular surface area for coronoid width, radial neck diameter, radial head diameter, height, weight, and gender. Multiple linear regression modeling with the factors radial head diameter, radial neck diameter, coronoid width, height, weight, and gender resulted in formulas that could account for 71.8% of the variation in coronoid volume and 66.2% of the variation in coronoid articular surface area. The average relative percent difference was 1.32% for the coronoid volume and 0.68% for the coronoid articular surface area.

Conclusions

The volume and articular surface area of the coronoid can be estimated based on anatomical measurements and gender. This may lead to better estimates of lost fragments when modeling the fractured coronoid and CT scan of the opposite limb is not available.

### Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear Truss metamaterials by generative modeling [^dacc9a2d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We here adopt the attributed network embedding methodto learn the individual dependencies of the structural topology and node placements as well as their combined effects (details provided in Supplementary Note 2.2). Specifically, the adjacency matrix (containing binary values) and node features (containing continuous values) are serialized and passed through separate encoders to obtain the respective latent space distribution meansandand standard deviationsand. The embedding dimensions d A and d x are chosen such that d Ax = (d A + d x) − d > 0. Note that, since the adjacency matrix is symmetric, only the upper triangular part is considered by the encoder. The final latent space distribution is obtained by partial overlap of the adjacency matrix and node features embeddings. The mean is given bywhere ⊕ denotes vector concatenation (the logarithm of the standard deviation, i.e. is obtained analogously usingand). Since the adjacency matrix and node features influence the topology and geometry, respectively, subsets of the latent space dimensions offer topology-specific, geometry-specific, and shared control over the design space, the advantages of which will become apparent when discussing the results. Similar to the encoding, two separate decoders are used to output the graphfrom a latent vector z — the topology-specific and shared dimensions of z are used to obtain the adjacency matrix; the shared and geometry-specific dimensions of z are used to obtain the node features.

### Multiscale low-dimensional motor cortical state dynamics predict naturalistic reach-and-grasp behavior [^59042e65]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To validate the learned modes, we used the fact that a principal mode of network dynamics should have consistent decay-frequency characteristics regardless of latent state dimension. We therefore compared the learned modes when increasing the dimension of the latent state from 1 to 25. We found the validated principal modes of network dynamics as those modes that were consistently learned at all dimensions greater than some value (Fig. 2c). We plot the modes within a 3D eigenvalue-dimension diagram whose x - y plane represents the real and imaginary components of the modes and whose z axis represents the state dimension (Methods and Fig. 2c). For modes with complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, we only show the eigenvalue with the positive imaginary component for simplicity of illustration. The distance between any two modes is defined as the norm of the difference in their corresponding eigenvalues, which is the Euclidean distance in the x-y plane of eigenvalue-dimension diagram. As a principal mode should have consistent decay-frequency characteristics regardless of dimension, the mode should appear at a similar location on the x - y plane for any dimension, thus forming a vertical cluster. We thus use K-means clustering to group the vertical clusters that persist through dimensions based on their location on the x-y plane (Fig. 2c; Methods). A vertical cluster is defined as one for which the distance of the members from the cluster centroid is significantly smaller than half of chance-level distance (Methods). With this criteria, members of a cluster are within a circle whose diameter is smaller than chance-level. We compute the chance-level as the mean distance of two eigenvalues placed randomly and uniformly on the eigenvalue planes in the range shown in Fig. 3 (chosen based on the observed modes in our data). This definition is a conservative chance-level because positive-imaginary eigenvalues can be anywhere on the upper unit semicircle (see Fig. 2b).

### Surface area measurement of the female breast: phase I. validation of a novel optical technique [^4cf1d288]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Breast shape is largely determined by the volume of tissue and surface area of the skin envelope. Values for breast surface area have never been published in the literature. The investigators have developed an inexpensive, noninvasive optical method to objectively measure breast volume and surface area, and its accuracy is determined.

Methods

An optical grid is projected onto the breast, and two images are captured to create a computerized three-dimensional model from which volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection are calculated.

Results

To assess accuracy, simple geometric shapes (n = 22) were analyzed, and the actual volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were compared with the imaged values using least-squares linear regression. There was excellent correlation in all three parameters (r > 0.995, p < 10). The mean differences in volume, surface area, and maximum vertical projection were 28 ± 28 mL (mean ± SD), 2 ± 9 cm, and 0.4 ± 0.5 cm, respectively. Female breasts (n = 14) were then analyzed, and the actual volume and surface area were measured using plaster casts. Based on least-squares linear regression, there was excellent correlation between the imaged values and actual values (r > 0.992, p < 10), and the mean differences in volume and surface area were 32 ± 22 mL and 3 ± 11 cm, respectively.

Conclusions

For the first time, an optical method has been demonstrated to measure volume and surface area with accuracy. When the method is applied to the breast, measurement errors are small and clinically insignificant. The ability to facilitate quantitative breast surgery will be investigated in future phases of this experiment.

### De novo atomic protein structure modeling for cryoEM density maps using 3D transformer and HMM [^8f7fdab0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Deep learning architecture

The deep learning model (Fig. 6) takes in an input sub-grid of cryo-EM density map represented as a 4D tensor with dimensions H × W × D × C, where H is the height, W is the width, D is the depth, and C is the number of channels (C = 1 for the input), denoted as. x is then divided into a series of flattened, uniform non-overlapping patches, where P denotes the patch dimensions and N = (H × W × D)/ P 3 is the number of the patches. The series of the patches are projected by a 3D convolution layer into a K -dimensional embedding space. A 1D learnable positional encodingis then added to the projected patches, which subsequently serve as the input to the transformer encoder. Here, P is set to 16 and the embedding dimension (K) to 768.

Cryo2Struct uses an encoder of 12 blockseach consisting of a normalization layer, a multi-head attention layer, a normalization layer and a multi-layer perceptron to generate features for the input series of patches. The features from four different blocks: z i (i.e. i ∈ {3, 6, 9, 12}), with sizeare reshaped into, respectively. The features of the four blocks and the original input are processed by deconvolution and/or convolution layers and concatenated together in a U-Net fashion step by step to generate the final feature tensor of the same dimension as the original input (see Fig. 6 for details), which is used by a 1 × 1 × 1 convolution layer to classify each voxel.

### Early anthropoid femora reveal divergent adaptive trajectories in catarrhine hind-limb evolution [^7b3a2903]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the evolution of hip morphology within catarrhines, starting from an Aegyptopithecus -like morphology, hominoids and cercopithecoids have evolved in opposite directions along the major axis of phenotypic variation, and, based on the t 1/2 results, adapted at a faster rate to the new selective regime than the rate of adaptation that separated catarrhines and platyrrhines (i.e. PC1 in Figs. 2 and 3b): While the former evolved proximally wider femora, with longer anatomical necks and larger, more cranially situated heads (relative to the greater trochanter), the proximal femora of the latter became narrower, with shorter necks and relatively smaller heads, situated below an enlarged third trochanter (Supplementary Fig. 4). These different morphologies have been related to enhanced hip mobility (especially abduction) in hominoids vs. enhanced stereotyped flexion–extension along the same axis in cercopithecoids.

Regarding the phylogenetic signal results, the shape components investigated (PC1–3) show a Brownian phylogenetic signal (K ~ 1), which becomes a strong phylogenetic pattern when femoral size is taken into account (lnCS alone and when combined with PC1–3; in either case, K > 2). The phylogenetic patterning among large clades (i.e. platyrrhines, cercopithecoids and hominoids) is evident in the morphospaces depicted in Figs. 2 and 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the phylogenetic signal becomes obscured when all aspects of shape are considered at once (i.e. all Procrustes coordinates or all PCs; K < 1). A possible interpretation of these results is that, in high-dimensional data matrices (such as in the case of geometric morphometric data), most of the biologically relevant information is concentrated in few dimensions or combinations of them (such as the PCs), whereas the rest becomes 'noise' (e.g. see Supplementary Fig. 3).

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^ab047e72]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The data analyzed in this work was collected for the study of Gottesman et al; here, we briefly summarize the experimental protocol for reference. In total, 10 cm × 10 cm Mylar sheets are rolled into a 3-cm diameter cylindrical container and compressed uniaxially to a specified compaction ratio, the ratio of final to initial height, with L 0 = 10 cm (Fig. 1 a). The resulting ridge network inscribed on each sheet is extracted by carefully unfolding and scanning the sheet using a custom laser profilometer, which produces a height map of the sheet. A two-dimensional map of mean curvature is determined from the spatial gradients of the height profile; sharp peaks in curvature mark the signature of a ridge (Fig. 1 b). Successive re-crumpling and scanning of a single sheet is performed n times up to n = 24. Individual facets, characterized as contiguous regions of near-zero curvature, are delineated as shown in Fig. 1 c. Due to noise and artifacts in data collection, not all facets are completely enclosed by a contour of ridges; breaks along a ridge, or smoothing out and softening of ridges, occur inevitably during re-crumpling and unfolding. Automated methods of crease detection and facet labeling were initially tested to perform the segmentation; however, these methods proved sensitive to noise and thus were prone to over-fragmenting the sheets. Each sample presented and analyzed in this work was digitally labeled by hand. Additional details of automated segmentation are provided in the Supplementary Methods, and resulting segmentations and facet area distributions are shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4. With manual segmentation, care was taken to identify not only the dominant lines of each pattern as seen in the examples, but also the less pronounced softer scarring. The segmentation was performed for sheets after iterations n = 1, 2, and 3 at seven different compaction ratios: and 0.045. Each series of successive crumples was compared across all iterations n for consistency, to ensure that labeled facets from earlier iterations persist in later ones. Samples with, and 0.27 were also labeled after n = 24 crumples, for a total of 24 samples overall. We acknowledge that samples at n = 24 are more prone to missing detail as older scarring is obscured by newer ridges, but are nonetheless valuable to the study. The results of manual segmentation and corresponding facet area distributions are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.

### Osteochondroma of the cuboid: a case report [^bdbb83a8]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Osteochondromas are common benign exostoses with < 1% of pedal occurrences. Several cases of osteochondromas have been previously reported in the foot and ankle but none from the cuboid. In the present study, we report a case of osteochondroma originating from the cuboid in a 29-year-old male patient. The patient presented with an aching and shooting pain to his left foot that had progressed during the course of 3 years. Originally diagnosed as a fibroma, the patient had undergone cortisone injections that did not help with his symptoms. Radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an osteochondroma to the patient's left cuboid. Surgical removal of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and had no recurrence after 1.5 years of follow-up. In conclusion, although osteochondromas are rare in the foot and ankle and most are benign, they can result in many symptoms and can impair patients' quality of life, such as occurred in our patient. Recommendations for surgical excision should be determined on a case-by-case basis.

### Recommendations for quantification methods during the performance of a pediatric echocardiogram: a report from the pediatric measurements writing group of the American Society of Echocardiography pediatric and congenital heart disease council [^75701799]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Pediatric quantification protocols — pulmonary veins, systemic veins, and atria — advise that the pulmonary veins are usually best evaluated in a high left parasternal or suprasternal short‑axis view ("crab" view) and that the left atrial (LA) appendage should not be mistakenly identified as the left upper pulmonary vein and the right middle pulmonary vein should not be mistakenly identified as the right upper pulmonary vein; subxiphoid short‑axis or right parasternal views are usually better at displaying the right upper pulmonary vein. The superior vena cava is not routinely measured in clinical practice, and normative data have not been established, whereas inferior vena cava (IVC) size can be measured above its junction with the hepatic veins just below the diaphragm in subxiphoid short‑axis views (displaying the IVC long axis), and this may help assess hydration status. The IVC diameter varies with respiration, and the collapsibility index (the percentage decrease in IVC diameter with inspiration) appears to correlate with right atrial (RA) pressures in adults, but neither the IVC diameter nor the collapsibility index appears to correlate with age or BSA in adult patients, and the utility of the collapsibility index in children has not been evaluated. Left atrial size can be assessed by M‑mode and 2D measurements of the distance from the posterior aortic wall to the posterior LA wall, though this anteroposterior distance correlates poorly with angiographically derived LA volumes; recent recommendations involve calculation of LA volumes from apical views at end‑systole just before the MV opens using major‑axis and minor‑axis dimensions and planimetered areas in orthogonal views. Among LA volume calculations, the biplane area‑length and the biplane Simpson (summation of disks) methods using apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views appear to provide the most consistent results with published reference values for normal adults; the biplane area‑length method has also been used in children, and LA volumes indexed to BSA appear to correlate with diastolic function and mitral regurgitation grade. Real‑time three‑dimensional echocardiography with a rotation/polyhedral‑based algorithm has correlated well with LA volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and right atrial size is usually assessed in an apical 4‑chamber view at end‑systole just before the TV opens.

### Considerable variation in current coronoid height and fracture measurement techniques: a systematic review [^42f25d1f]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronoid fractures usually occur in the presence of a significant osseoligamentous injury to the elbow. Fracture size and location correlate with degree of instability and many authors have attempted to analyze the effect of fracture variation on decision making and outcome. There remains no standardized technique for measuring coronoid height or fracture size. The aim of this study was to appraise the literature regarding techniques for coronoid height measurement in order to understand variation.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. A search was performed to identify studies with either a description of coronoid height, fracture size, or bone loss using the terms (Coronoid) AND (Measurement) OR (Size) OR (Height). Articles were shortlisted by screening for topic relevance based on title, abstract and, if required, full-text review. Exclusion criteria were non-English articles, those on nonhuman species or parts other than the ulna coronoid process, and studies that included patients with pre-existing elbow pathology. Shortlisted articles were grouped based on study type, imaging modality, measurement technique, and measurement parameter as well as its location along the coronoid.

Results

Thirty out of the initially identified 494 articles met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one articles were clinical studies, 8 were cadaveric studies, and 1 combined patients as well as cadavers. A variety of imaging modalities (plain radiographs, 2-dimensional computed tomography [CT], 3-dimensional CT, magnetic resonance imaging or a combination of these) were used with CT scan (either 2-dimensional images or 3-dimensional reconstructions or both) being the most common modality used by 21 studies. Measurement technique also varied from uniplanar linear measurements in 15 studies to multiplanar area and volumetric measurements in 6 studies to techniques describing various angles and indices as an indirect measure of coronoid height in 8 studies. Across the 30 shortlisted studies, 19 different measurement techniques were identified. Fifteen studies measured normal coronoid height while the other 15 measured intact coronoid and/or fracture fragment height. The location of this measurement was also variable between studies with measurements at the apex of the coronoid in 24/30 (80%) of studies. Measurement accuracy was assessed by only 1 study. A total of 12/30 (40%) studies reported on the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of their measurement technique.

Conclusion

The systemic review demonstrated considerable variability between studies that report coronoid height or fracture size measurements. This variability makes comparison of coronoid height or fracture measurements and recommendations based on these between studies unreliable. There is need for development of a consistent, easy to use, and reproducible technique for coronoid height and bone loss.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^4365d6f0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Quantitative measurements of the volume and surface area of the radial head [^ff75e187]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the hypothesis that a quantitative 3-dimensional computed tomography (Q3DCT) modeling technique based on anatomical and demographic data that can measure size, shape, and proximal articular surface area can be used to develop formulas that could predict the volume and proximal surface area of the intact radial head in patients with fractures of the radial head.

Methods

We used a consecutive series of 50 computed tomography scans with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm or less obtained in patients with fracture of the distal humerus, but no injury to the radial head, to create 3-dimensional models. The volume and proximal articular surface area of the radial head were measured, and predictive formulas based on anatomical measurements and gender were calculated using multiple linear regression.

Results

There were significant correlations between total radial head volume and proximal radial head articular surface area for height, weight, radial head diameter, radial neck diameter, coronoid diameter, and gender. Multiple linear regression modeling resulted in formulas that could account for 89% of the variation in radial head volume and 75% of the variation in proximal articular surface area.

Conclusions

The volume and proximal articular surface area of the radial head can be estimated based on anatomical measurements and gender. This may lead to better estimates of lost fragments when it is not possible to directly model the fractured radial head and computed tomography scan of the opposite limb is not available.

Chamber quantification partition values and abnormality thresholds — For parameters other than left ventricular (LV) size, function, and mass as well as left atrial (LA) volume, only the mean and SD of gender-, age-, and body surface area (BSA)–normalized cutoffs are reported, and for these parameters, measurements exceeding ± 1.96 SDs (i.e., the 95% confidence interval) should be classified as abnormal; an alternative percentile-based approach (e.g., 95th, 99th) is described but applicable population data sets do not exist for most variables; the compromise provides experience-based partition values only for LV ejection fraction (EF) and LA volume with suggested values for LV size and mass in the Appendix, and any description of deviation remains at the laboratory's discretion because the writing group does not recommend specific partition values.
