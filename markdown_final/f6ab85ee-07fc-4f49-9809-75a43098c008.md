## Question

Can Prozac cause hepatotoxicity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Prozac (fluoxetine) can directly injure the liver and, if so, how strong the evidence is and what the clinical implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility sources, particularly FDA labeling, to see if hepatotoxicity is acknowledged. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility based on hepatic metabolism. Next, I will review case-level and review-level clinical data to gauge frequency and severity. After that, I need to check guideline perspectives on monitoring and management. Finally, I will synthesize a risk profile and practical recommendations, making sure I separate pharmacokinetic cautions in liver disease from intrinsic hepatotoxic risk.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence from FDA labeling, since that carries the highest evidentiary weight. Multiple FDA documents list hepatitis as an adverse reaction to fluoxetine, with "rare" frequency for hepatitis in some labels and "unknown frequency" in others, which establishes that clinically apparent liver injury has been observed, albeit infrequently [^116CF9i8] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify what "rare" actually means here. The SPL entries define "rare" as less than 0.1%, suggesting fewer than 1 per 1,000 patients for overt hepatitis, while "unknown frequency" reflects sporadic postmarketing reports without a reliable denominator; importantly, case-counting alone can under- or overestimate risk, which is why incidence frameworks based on real-world data have been advocated to complement case reports [^116CF9i8] [^113GHr85] [^112yimCy].

> Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine via CYP pathways, making the liver a key site of biotransformation and, by extension, potential idiosyncratic injury; drugs with high hepatic metabolism have been associated with higher DILI signals in observational analyses, though that association is not deterministic and should be interpreted cautiously [^116wLcG2] [^115rA4xV] [^111pz3dF].

> Wait, let me verify clinical case evidence that links fluoxetine to clinically meaningful liver injury. There is a pediatric case report describing probable drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) one month after fluoxetine initiation, with hepatitis as part of the multisystem involvement, and DRESS itself is also listed among fluoxetine's postmarketing reactions, reinforcing biological plausibility for immune-mediated hepatic injury in rare cases [^115KyZpB] [^113GHr85].

> I should now review broader antidepressant hepatotoxicity data to contextualize frequency and risk tier. Reviews suggest that 0.5% to 3% of patients on antidepressants may have asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations, and that all antidepressants can rarely cause idiosyncratic DILI; initially I thought fluoxetine was explicitly placed in an "intermediate risk" category, but wait, I should double-check that wording because the review actually highlights citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine as having the least apparent risk and lists several higher-risk non-SSRI agents, leaving fluoxetine neither in the "least risk" nor "high-risk" group by explicit designation [^116VDXNm].

> Let me consider what is not well established, so I don't overstate the signal. I do not see robust epidemiologic data here that quantify a high incidence of severe DILI uniquely attributable to fluoxetine, nor a consistent pathologic "signature" pattern or latency beyond the general idiosyncratic timeframe described for many drugs; this absence of a strong epidemiologic signal is consistent with a rare, sporadic risk profile for serious injury in real-world settings that often require careful case adjudication [^112yimCy] [^112fCZxJ].

> Hold on, I should ensure I separate hepatotoxicity from pharmacokinetic cautions in hepatic impairment. FDA labeling emphasizes that cirrhosis and other liver diseases slow fluoxetine and norfluoxetine clearance, warranting lower or less frequent dosing; this is a metabolism/clearance issue and does not itself prove intrinsic hepatotoxicity, though it does raise prudence about exposure and co-medications in patients with liver disease [^11466MTq] [^111LZNQb] [^115v6xbf].

> I will now synthesize a clinically useful risk profile. Causality is supported at a low frequency by FDA-recognized reports of hepatitis and rare immune-mediated reactions such as DRESS, with a biologically plausible, idiosyncratic mechanism anchored in hepatic metabolism; the overall frequency of overt hepatitis appears rare, while mild asymptomatic enzyme elevations occur in a small minority across antidepressants; severity ranges from transient transaminitis to rare severe hepatitis in hypersensitivity contexts; specific patient-level risk factors are not well defined beyond general DILI considerations like polypharmacy and preexisting liver disease [^116CF9i8] [^113GHr85] [^116VDXNm].

> Next, I should review pragmatic monitoring and management guidance so recommendations are aligned with standards. AASLD guidance favors targeted monitoring for agents with a high likelihood of hepatotoxicity rather than blanket testing for all medications, and fluoxetine labeling focuses on dose adjustment in hepatic impairment rather than mandated routine liver test monitoring; in suspected DILI, standard supportive care, drug discontinuation, and consideration of guideline-based measures such as early evaluation for acute liver failure and potential use of N-acetylcysteine in early-stage ALF apply, tailored to clinical severity and competing diagnoses [^11679m5e] [^116bp9Mt] [^1167Ckw6] [^1176572R].

> But wait, what should trigger action at the bedside. New-onset jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, marked ALT/AST or bilirubin elevations, systemic rash or facial edema, eosinophilia, or features suggestive of DRESS should prompt immediate reassessment and discontinuation of fluoxetine while alternative etiologies are excluded, given the idiosyncratic nature and potential severity of hypersensitivity-associated liver injury [^113GHr85] [^11679m5e].

> Bottom line: Yes, Prozac (fluoxetine) can cause hepatotoxicity, but it is rare and typically idiosyncratic; FDA labeling acknowledges hepatitis and hypersensitivity syndromes including DRESS, case reports corroborate causality in isolated instances, mechanistic plausibility exists via hepatic metabolism, and current guidance supports vigilance with targeted monitoring rather than routine testing, along with prompt discontinuation and guideline-based management if clinically significant liver injury is suspected [^116CF9i8] [^113GHr85] [^113GHr85] [^116wLcG2] [^11679m5e].

---

No, Prozac (fluoxetine) is not considered hepatotoxic in most patients, but **rare idiosyncratic liver injury** can occur, including hepatitis and jaundice [^116CF9i8] [^113GHr85]. The overall risk of severe liver injury is low, and **routine liver monitoring is not required** for patients without liver disease [^11679m5e]. In patients with hepatic impairment, use lower or less frequent dosing [^11466MTq] and monitor liver function. Discontinue fluoxetine if significant liver enzyme elevations or clinical signs of liver injury occur.

---

## Incidence and clinical significance of hepatotoxicity

Regarding **incidence**, fluoxetine-associated hepatotoxicity is rare [^116CF9i8], with an estimated rate of less than 0.1% [^111ec78c]. For **clinical significance**, most cases are mild and reversible after discontinuation [^116VDXNm]; severe injury (e.g. acute liver failure) is extremely rare.

---

## Clinical manifestations of fluoxetine-induced hepatotoxicity

Fluoxetine-induced hepatotoxicity may present with a range of **clinical and laboratory findings**, including [^11679m5e]:

| **Clinical manifestations** | **Laboratory findings** |
|-|-|
| Jaundice | Elevated ALT/AST |
| Fatigue | Elevated alkaline phosphatase |
| Nausea | Elevated bilirubin |
| Abdominal pain | Prolonged INR |
| Dark urine | ∅ |
| Pruritus | ∅ |

---

## Risk factors for hepatotoxicity

Several factors may **increase the risk of hepatotoxicity** with fluoxetine:

- **Pre-existing liver disease**: Patients with hepatic impairment [^11466MTq] have reduced clearance and prolonged half-life of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine [^116bp9Mt].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Idiosyncratic reactions may be influenced by genetic factors affecting drug metabolism [^1143fcdM].

- **Concomitant medications**: Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 may increase fluoxetine levels and hepatotoxic risk [^116wLcG2].

---

## Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity

The exact mechanisms are **not fully understood**. Proposed mechanisms include **idiosyncratic reactions** — unpredictable immune-mediated or metabolic responses [^11214awP] — and **metabolic pathways**, whereby extensive hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 [^116wLcG2] may produce reactive intermediates [^111pz3dF].

---

## Comparison with other antidepressants

Compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine has a **relatively low risk of hepatotoxicity** [^116VDXNm]. Agents with a **lower risk** include fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, and paroxetine, whereas those with a **higher risk** include nefazodone [^112DwLh4], duloxetine, bupropion, trazodone, and agomelatine.

---

## Monitoring and management guidelines

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) in patients with risk factors [^11679m5e].

- **Routine monitoring**: Not required for patients without liver disease.

- **Clinical monitoring**: Educate patients to report symptoms of liver injury (jaundice, dark urine, fatigue).

- **Management**: Discontinue fluoxetine if significant LFT elevations or clinical signs occur [^11679m5e].

---

## Recommendations for patients with pre-existing liver conditions

- **Dose adjustment**: Use lower or less frequent dosing [^11466MTq] in hepatic impairment [^116bp9Mt].

- **Close monitoring**: Regularly monitor LFTs and clinical signs of liver injury [^11679m5e].

- **Alternative medications**: Consider antidepressants with lower hepatotoxic risk if significant liver impairment exists [^116VDXNm].

---

## Summary and clinical implications

Fluoxetine is **generally safe regarding hepatotoxicity**, with rare idiosyncratic reactions [^11214awP]. Clinicians should recognize risk factors, monitor appropriately, and promptly manage liver injury if it occurs.

### Prozac [^116bp9Mt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Specific populations**: As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Renal disease**: In depressed patients on dialysis (N = 12), fluoxetine administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function. While the possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired patients.

- **Geriatric pharmacokinetics**: The disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly subjects (> 65 years of age) did not differ significantly from that in younger normal subjects. However, given the long half-life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not adequate.

### Prozac [^11466MTq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the elimination half-lives of these substances. A lower or less frequent dose of fluoxetine should be used in patients with cirrhosis. Caution is advised when using Prozac in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect its metabolism [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

Drug hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of fulminant hepatic failure in the United States. We describe a rare case of a patient who developed an acute liver injury after initiation of therapy with quetiapine but, after conservative management and a trial of steroids, has fully recovered. This is the second reported case of quetiapine-induced liver injury in the published literature.

### Analytically confirmed intentional overdose of the antidepressant vortioxetine [^114yvjj4]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Low credibility.

Information from pre-licensing clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggests that therapeutic and supra-therapeutic dosing of vortioxetine is not associated with severe unwanted effects. There is limited information from non-fatal and fatal cases of vortioxetine overdose to determine the potentially toxic dose of this antidepressant drug.

Our patient took a reported overdose of 1,260 mg of vortioxetine, with post-ingestion concentrations nearly 15-fold those seen in regular therapeutic use of the drug. Despite this large analytically confirmed overdose, he did not develop any clinically significant features. In particular, there was no evidence of serotonin syndrome. Additional reporting of analytically confirmed vortioxetine overdoses will allow clinicians and licensing authorities to further understand the safety of this medication in overdose.

### Fluoxetine [^116DBG1L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In a study on juvenile rats, unique fluoxetine toxicities were observed that did not appear in adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day doses were approximately 0.1 to 0.2, 1 to 2, and 5 to 10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric patients receiving the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day. Rat exposures to norfluoxetine, the major metabolite, were approximately 0.3 to 0.8, 1 to 8, and 3 to 20 times, respectively, the pediatric exposure at the MRHD.

A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine intraperitoneally. In 4-week-old mice given doses 0.5 and 2 times the oral MRHD of 20 mg/day on a mg/m² basis for 4 weeks, there was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses; however, overall growth (body weight gain or femur length) was not affected.

- **Geriatric use**: U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials included 687 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 93 patients aged ≥ 75 years. The efficacy in geriatric patients has been established [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. For pharmacokinetic information in geriatric patients, [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but the possibility of greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in the elderly.

### Severe hepatotoxicity with jaundice associated with paroxetine [^112A75W9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatotoxicity due to paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is very rare, and to the best of our knowledge, only five cases of liver injury in association with paroxetine have previously been reported in the medical literature. We describe the clinical, biochemical, and pathological findings in a patient with paroxetine hepatotoxicity, which was reversed after withdrawal of the drug. The present case and the others previously reported suggest that hepatotoxicity should be taken into account as a rare complication, sometimes severe, that may occur with paroxetine.

### Symbyax [^111QSGA4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

These fluoxetine toxicities in juvenile rats have not been observed in adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day doses in this study are approximately 0.1–0.2, 1–2, and 5–10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric patients receiving the MRHD of 20 mg/day. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, are approximately 0.3–0.8, 1–8, and 3–20 times, respectively, the pediatric exposure at the MRHD.

A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4-week-old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0.5 and 2 times the oral MRHD of 20 mg/day on a mg/m² basis. There was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses, but the overall growth (body weight gain or femur length) was not affected.

- **Elderly patients**: Clinical studies of Symbyax did not include sufficient numbers of patients ≥ 65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Oral medications with significant hepatic metabolism at higher risk for hepatic adverse events [^111pz3dF]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Reactive metabolites generated by hepatic metabolism are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), but supporting data are limited. If this is true, then compounds with significant hepatic metabolism should cause more DILI than those without it. We conducted a study to examine the relationship between hepatic metabolism and DILI of prescription medications.

We systematically extracted the metabolism characteristics of 207 of the most widely prescribed oral medications in the United States. Compounds with more than 50% hepatic metabolism were characterized as those with significant hepatic metabolism (n = 149). Hepatic adverse events of interest were alanine aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit of normal, jaundice, liver failure, liver transplantation, or fatal DILI.

- **Results**: Compared with compounds with lesser hepatic metabolism, those in the significant hepatic metabolism group had a significantly higher frequency of alanine aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit of normal (35% versus 11%, P = 0.001), liver failure (28% versus 9%, P = 0.004), and fatal DILI (23% versus 4%, P = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in jaundice (46% versus 35%, P = 0.2) or liver transplantation (9% versus 2%, P = 0.11).

Twelve compounds with no hepatic metabolism had no reports of liver failure, liver transplantation, or fatal DILI.

- **Further analysis**: When the relationship between hepatic adverse events and the combination of hepatic metabolism and daily dose was examined, compounds with both significant hepatic metabolism and a daily dose greater than 50 mg (n = 50) were significantly more likely to present adverse outcomes.

### Fluoxetine [^117R6CSL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following the initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment. There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported. Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Drugs tightly bound to plasma proteins**: Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma proteins, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g. Coumadin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4**: In an in vivo interaction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. Additionally, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetine's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.

Hepatotoxicity monitoring in routine clinical practice

A commonsense approach to monitoring is to target individuals who are taking medications with a high likelihood of causing hepatotoxicity. Important considerations for liver biochemistry monitoring include: (i) reference ranges for serum aminotransferase levels that may vary among laboratories; (ii) the presence of baseline elevations in patients with underlying liver disease; (iii) latency of enzyme elevations that may vary from days to months, and rarely, even years (e.g. with nitrofurantoin and minocycline); and (iv) transient and self-limited aminotransferase elevations encountered with drugs like isoniazid and statins that can resolve with continued dosing, presumably because of metabolic and/or immunological adaptation.

- **Histological injury attributed to DILI**:
	- Examples include nodular regenerative hyperplasia seen with azathioprine and oxaliplatin. Reticulin stain highlights a nodular architecture with nodules made up of hyperplastic hepatocytes characterized by two-cell-thick plates bordered by atrophic hepatocyte plates. Note that the portal tract (arrow) is in the center of the nodule, termed reverse lobulation (original magnification ×10, reticulin stain).

	- Hepatocytes with ground-glass-like cytoplasm are characterized by a smooth homogeneous light pink color, as opposed to the typical grainy eosinophilic cytoplasm of normal hepatocytes. These hepatocytes are typically found in zone 3 and their development is often due to polypharmacy (original magnification ×10, hem).

### Drug-induced hepatotoxicity: 2005 [^1143fcdM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

The removal from the marketplace of several widely prescribed drugs due to hepatotoxicity has attracted considerable attention. Now under extensive review are means by which we can better identify hepatic risk prior to federal approval. Assessment of risk-to-benefit ratios regarding a novel agent with hepatotoxicity issues, especially one for a life-threatening condition, requires considerable judgment and education on the part of prescribers and patients.

The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury is broad, simulating almost all known liver disorders. Drug-induced liver injuries often have a somewhat characteristic signature regarding the type of injury (hepatocellular vs. cholestatic) and time of onset. The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury is often one of exclusion, with initial suspicion based on circumstantial evidence. Factors affecting susceptibility to drug-induced injury include age, sex, concomitant use of other drugs, and genetic polymorphism in metabolic pathways involved in activation or disposition of therapeutic drugs.

Drug-drug interactions present particular problems in patients, often elderly, who are receiving several drugs simultaneously. The mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury are many and varied. With many drugs, intermediary products produced during metabolism are highly reactive and toxic. In these situations, the balance between the rate of production of the metabolite and the effectiveness of the drug may determine whether or not hepatic injury occurs.

### Patients with chronic liver disease suggestive of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may be at higher risk for drug-induced liver injury [^111rzfSK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there have been no studies that systematically examined if individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We conducted a study to test if the frequency of suspected DILI from prescription agents is higher in individuals with chronic liver disease (CLD) suggestive of NAFLD.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^111FBHV3]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for drug-induced liver injury, specifically with respect to corticosteroids, the EASL 2019 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with idiosyncratic DILI.

### Acute liver injury secondary to sertraline [^116vLuSS]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Sertraline is widely prescribed to treat depression and anxiety disorders; however, hepatitis secondary to its use is a rare entity. A case is reported of a 26-year-old woman in her 20th week of pregnancy who presented with nausea, vomiting, malaise, and dark urine. This occurred six months after sertraline 50 mg daily was started for the treatment of depression. Three weeks prior to her presentation, the dose of sertraline was increased to 100 mg daily. The patient's liver biochemical profile demonstrated increased transaminases. The biopsy of the liver showed lobular hepatitis, with a mild prominence of eosinophils, suggestive of a drug-induced or toxin-induced aetiology. Extensive biochemical work-up failed to show any other pathology to account for her hepatitis. Liver function tests normalized after the cessation of sertraline, indicating a probable association between sertraline use and acute hepatocellular injury in our patient.

### Fluoxetine [^112eFQYV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

While taking fluoxetine, avoid activities requiring alertness such as driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. It can cause sleepiness and impair decision-making, thinking, or quick reactions. Additionally, do not consume alcohol while using fluoxetine.

- **Possible side effects**:

	- Fluoxetine may lead to serious side effects. For those with diabetes, there can be difficulties in controlling blood sugar levels; low blood sugar may occur while taking fluoxetine, and high blood sugar might happen when you stop. Consequently, your healthcare provider might adjust your diabetes medication dosage when you start or discontinue fluoxetine. Additionally, you may feel anxious or have trouble sleeping.

- **Common possible side effects**:

	- Unusual dreams
	- Sexual problems
	- Loss of appetite, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea or vomiting
	- Weakness or dry mouth
	- Flu symptoms
	- Feeling tired or fatigued
	- Change in sleep habits
	- Yawning
	- Sinus infection or sore throat
	- Tremor or shaking
	- Sweating
	- Feeling anxious or nervous
	- Hot flashes
	- Rash

- **Side effects specific to children and adolescents**:

	- Increased thirst
	- Abnormal increase in muscle movement or agitation
	- Nosebleeds
	- Urinating more often
	- Heavy menstrual periods
	- Possible slowed growth rate and weight change. Your child's height and weight should be monitored during treatment with fluoxetine.

### A young child with eosinophilia, rash, and multisystem illness: Drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms syndrome after receipt of fluoxetine [^115KyZpB]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction that usually occurs within six weeks of exposure to the offending drug. Diagnosis is usually straightforward in patients with pyrexia, skin rash, hepatitis, and eosinophilia with a preceding history of exposure to agents often associated with DRESS syndrome, such as aromatic anticonvulsants and sulfa drugs, but diagnosis of DRESS may still be a challenge. We report a 4-year-old child with probable DRESS syndrome complicated by multiple hematologic complications that developed one month after exposure to fluoxetine, a drug not known to be associated with such severe reactions.

### Symbyax [^115v6xbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Based on the individual pharmacokinetic profiles of olanzapine and fluoxetine, the pharmacokinetics of Symbyax may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment. The lowest starting dose should be considered for patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].

Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (N = 6) with clinically significant cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classification A and B) revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.

As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared to the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease. Norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared to the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects.

- **Gender**: Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. However, there were no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed.

- **Smoking status**: Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely required.

- **Race**: No Symbyax pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^1167Ckw6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, particularly in patients with herbal and dietary supplement (HDS)-induced liver injury, the ACG 2021 guidelines recommend considering evaluation for liver transplantation in patients developing acute liver failure (ALF) and severe cholestatic injury from DILI.

### Fluoxetine [^116wLcG2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and other unidentified metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by the demethylation of fluoxetine. In animal models, S-norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity equivalent to R- or S-fluoxetine. R-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney.

- **Variability in metabolism**: A subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are referred to as "poor metabolizers" of drugs like debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S-fluoxetine at a slower rate, thus achieving higher concentrations of S-fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of S-norfluoxetine at a steady state were lower. The metabolism of R-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at a steady state of the plasma concentrations of the four active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine achieves its pharmacological effects.

### Fluoxetine [^115M2pAR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:

	- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**:

		- **Carcinogenicity**: The dietary administration of fluoxetine to rats and mice for 2 years at doses of up to 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 1.2 and 0.7 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 80 mg on a mg/m² basis), produced no evidence of carcinogenicity.

		- **Mutagenicity**: Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on the following assays: bacterial mutation assay, DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells.

		- **Impairment of fertility**: Two fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis) indicated that fluoxetine had no adverse effects on fertility. However, adverse effects on fertility were seen when juvenile rats were treated with fluoxetine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology**:

	- Phospholipids are increased in some tissues of mice, rats, and dogs given fluoxetine chronically. This effect is reversible after cessation of fluoxetine treatment. Phospholipid accumulation in animals has been observed with many cationic amphiphilic drugs, including fenfluramine, imipramine, and ranitidine. The significance of this effect in humans is unknown.

### Severe liver injury after initiating therapy with atomoxetine in two children [^111tprLn]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Two children presented with acute hepatitis after starting therapy with atomoxetine (Strattera). In one child, no competing diagnosis could be identified, and liver injury resolved completely on withdrawal of the medication. In the second child, the evaluation was suggestive of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis; she subsequently improved with removal of atomoxetine and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Atomoxetine may cause clinically significant hepatotoxicity either by metabolic idiosyncrasy or by inducing autoimmune hepatitis.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^114oS7Cj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Although the exact mechanism of fluoxetine is unknown, it is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and α1-adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in vitro than do the tricyclic drugs.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Systemic bioavailability — in humans, following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 hours. The capsule and delayed-release capsule dosage forms of fluoxetine are bioequivalent. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with or without food. Fluoxetine delayed-release capsules, in a once-weekly formulation, contain enteric-coated pellets that resist dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. The enteric coating delays the onset of absorption of fluoxetine by 1 to 2 hours relative to that of the non-delayed release forms.

### Fluoxetine [^113ipmN4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In cases of fluoxetine tablet overdosage, several symptoms have been reported:

- **Delayed seizures and altered mental status**: These can lead to coma.

- **Cardiovascular toxicity**: This may be delayed and include QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, torsade de pointes, and cardiac arrest. While hypertension is most commonly seen, hypotension can occur, particularly with co-ingestants such as alcohol.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Patients experiencing multiple drug overdoses with other proserotonergic drugs may have an elevated risk of developing this syndrome.

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered for patients who present early following a fluoxetine overdose. It is advisable to contact a Poison Center (1–800–221–2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional management recommendations regarding overdosage.

### Citalopram overdose and severe serotonin syndrome in an intermediate metabolizing patient [^112wh1z4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of depression. Metabolism is primarily through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; the activity of the latter can vary depending on genetics. Although rare after single-agent exposure, large citalopram ingestions can lead to serotonin syndrome. We report a case of citalopram overdose in an intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizer complicated by severe serotonin syndrome.

- **Case details**: A 25-year-old female presented after intentional citalopram overdose with seizures, tachycardia, persistent neuromuscular findings, and severe hyperthermia requiring aggressive sedation and cooling. Protracted symptoms required critical care services throughout a 14-day hospital stay despite the traditional treatment of serotonin syndrome. Pharmacogenomic studies revealed intermediate CYP2C19 metabolism, which reduces citalopram inactivation and may cause increased levels and toxicity.

- **Discussion**: In the majority of serotonin syndrome cases, symptoms resolve rapidly after treatment initiation and discontinuation of the offending agents. Severe cases are typically associated with the ingestion of multiple serotonergic agents. Our patient had severe toxicity after single-agent ingestion. Pharmacogenetic testing identified abnormal CYP2C19 activity, and previous cases have associated enzyme dysfunction and citalopram toxicity.

- **Conclusion**: Citalopram overdose may be associated with severe serotonin syndrome, and further investigation is warranted to understand the impact of enzyme genotype on toxicity.

### A critical review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated bleeding: Balancing the risk of treating hepatitis C-infected patients [^114j4kQV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly being used to treat interferon-associated side effects in patients receiving hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. Because there is an increased risk of bleeding in HCV-infected patients who have developed cirrhosis and either portal hypertension or hepatic failure or both, we critically reviewed the literature on SSRI-associated bleeding.

- **Data sources and study selection**: We performed a MEDLINE search of literature from 1966 to the present using hemorrhage, SSRI, and antidepressants as search terms, and followed up on relevant citations. We reviewed 6 retrospective studies, 5 of which were case-control studies, and 18 case reports of bleeding in 37 people. Our review is supplemented with a case report of a possible connection between SSRI treatment and a fatal gastrointestinal bleed in an HCV-infected man.

- **Data synthesis**: Bleeding events in 12 out of 18 reports (67%) describing 19 out of 24 people (79%) were closely associated with the use of SSRIs.

- **Conclusion**: Combining aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with SSRIs for the treatment of interferon-associated neuropsychiatric side effects increases the risks of hemorrhage in patients with HCV who have developed cirrhosis and either portal hypertension or hepatic failure or both. We recommend that clinicians exercise caution when prescribing medications that can promote spontaneous bleeding to patients with multiple risk factors for internal hemorrhage.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, particularly in patients with specific phenotypes and immune-related hepatotoxicity, the EASL 2019 guidelines recommend that corticosteroid treatment for patients with immune-mediated hepatitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors should be decided by a multidisciplinary team. This team should include hepatologists if the drug-induced liver injury is sufficiently severe based on clinical and histological assessment.

### Fluoxetine [^112zCVGe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine, with an elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration, along with its active metabolite norfluoxetine, which has an elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after both acute and chronic administration, leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine range from 91 to 302 ng/mL, and norfluoxetine ranges from 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine are higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, due to fluoxetine's non-proportionate metabolism to dose. However, norfluoxetine appears to have linear pharmacokinetics; its mean terminal half-life following a single dose is 8.6 days, and after multiple dosing is 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ensure that even when dosing is stopped, active drug substances persist in the body for weeks. This depends primarily on individual patient characteristics, the previous dosing regimen, and the length of previous therapy at discontinuation. It is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when other drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine after discontinuation of fluoxetine.

### Hepatotoxicity associated with the new antidepressants [^112DwLh4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Safety profiles of classical and new antidepressants are well established, and hepatotoxicity is known to occur. Recently, several cases of severe hepatic injury associated with the new antidepressants have been reported, prompting us to quantify this risk.

- **Method**: To estimate the cumulative incidence of hepatic adverse reactions associated with antidepressants, we used cases of hepatic damage collected via spontaneous reporting included in the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System database. For exposure, we used data from drug sales to the Spanish National Health System.

- **Results**: The estimated reported incidence did not show major differences for the antidepressants studied, ranging from 1.28 cases per 100,000 patient-years for sertraline to 4.00 for clomipramine, except for nefazodone, which had the highest incidence at 28.96 cases per 100,000 patient-years.

- **Conclusion**: The reported incidence of hepatic adverse reactions to nefazodone seems to be higher than estimated so far. Given the high prevalence of depression and the widespread use of antidepressants, physicians should be alert to the possibility that these medications cause hepatitis and consider early discontinuation of an antidepressant if the condition is suspected.

### Drug-induced liver injury: Summary of a single topic clinical research conference [^11214awP]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains poorly understood. It is assumed that affected individuals possess a rare combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that, if identified, would greatly improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This single-topic conference brought together basic scientists, translational investigators, and clinicians with an interest in DILI. The goal was to define high-priority areas of investigation that will soon be made possible by The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). Since 2004, DILIN has been collecting clinical data, genomic DNA, and some tissues from patients who have experienced bona fide DILI. The presentations spanned many different areas of DILI and included novel data concerning mechanisms of hepatotoxicity, new "omics" approaches, and the challenges of improving causation assessment.

### Exploring treatment alternatives: Weekly dosing of fluoxetine for the continuation phase of major depressive disorder [^115KmsUw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Antidepressant medications are typically taken on a daily basis due to both tradition and the pharmacokinetics of these agents. Because fluoxetine and its primary metabolite, norfluoxetine, have long half-lives and flat dose-response curves, we examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing during the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Open-label treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine daily for 7 weeks began with 114 subjects. Subsequently, 70 subjects who met criteria for response were randomly assigned, in a double-blind design, to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg of fluoxetine daily [N = 21], 60 mg of fluoxetine weekly [N = 28], or placebo [N = 21], and followed for 7 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed in several clinical measures. Tolerability in the three groups was similar; there was no difference in dropout rates or adverse events.

Hence, weekly dosing of fluoxetine appears to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in the treatment of MDD. It is proposed that less frequent dosing could potentially benefit patients by enhancing adherence and minimizing the risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions.

### Clinical diagnostic scale: A useful tool in the evaluation of suspected hepatotoxic adverse drug reactions [^1132Rk1G]. Journal of Hepatology (2000). Low credibility.

Due to an absence of specific markers, the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is necessarily based on circumstantial evidence and is often inaccurate. We have evaluated the use of the clinical diagnostic scale (CDS) in the causality assessment of hepatotoxic adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports.

- **Methods**: 135 hepatic ADRs reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines in North East England from 1992 to 1996 were evaluated. Initially, "International Consensus Criteria" were used to classify reactions as "drug-related", "drug-unrelated", and "indeterminate". Using the CDS, each ADR was then categorized as either definite drug hepatotoxicity (score > 17), probable (14–17), possible (10–13), unlikely (6–9), or drug hepatotoxicity excluded (< 6). The CDS scores identified 88% of the cases classified as drug-related hepatotoxicity by consensus criteria and excluded 98% of those unrelated to the drugs.

- **Conclusions**: CDS scoring correlates well with the international consensus classification and may be a useful tool in the routine evaluation of suspected hepatotoxic drug reactions.

### Generalized seizures after acute fluoxetine overdose in four adolescents [^114rLfYq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is less frequently associated with severe toxicity in acute overdose compared with other psychotropic medications. Although rare, generalized seizures have been reported after isolated fluoxetine overdoses. Most cases in the literature have occurred between one and 16 hours following acute ingestion of ≥ 1000 mg. Here, we present a series of four cases of adolescents who presented to our pediatric emergency department with reported or witnessed seizures after acute fluoxetine overdose between March 2021 and January 2022. These cases included intentional ingestions of fluoxetine at doses between 600 and 1200 mg (10–19.5 mg/kg), each of whom had a single, witnessed episode of generalized seizure activity which occurred between three and nine hours post-ingestion.

All patients displayed signs of mild serotonin excess, and two met conventional criteria for the diagnosis of serotonin toxicity. All patients were evaluated by a medical toxicologist and were hospitalized for observation. No patient developed subsequent seizures or further complications related to the overdose, and no patient received neuroimaging, electroencephalography, or evaluation by a neurologist. Though previously described, seizures are an uncommon and potentially underappreciated complication after fluoxetine overdose and occurred in some of our patients at doses lower than those typically reported in the literature.

### Antidepressant-induced liver injury: A review for clinicians [^116VDXNm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Antidepressant drugs can cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI). This review examines clinical data relevant to antidepressant-induced liver injury and provides recommendations for clinical practice.

- **Method**:
	- A PubMed search was conducted for publications from 1965 onward related to antidepressant-induced liver injury. The search terms were "liver injury", "liver failure", "DILI", "hepatitis", "hepatotoxicity", "cholestasis", and "aminotransferase", cross-referenced with "antidepressant".

- **Results**:
	- Although data on antidepressant-induced liver injury are scarce, 0.5%-3% of patients treated with antidepressants may develop asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferase levels. All antidepressants can induce hepatotoxicity, especially in elderly patients and those with polypharmacy. Liver damage is in most cases idiosyncratic and unpredictable, and it is generally unrelated to drug dosage. The interval between treatment initiation and onset of liver injury is generally between several days and 6 months. Life-threatening antidepressant-induced liver injury has been described, involving fulminant liver failure or death. The underlying lesions are often of the hepatocellular type and less frequently of the cholestatic and mixed types.

	- **Greater risks of hepatotoxicity**:
		Antidepressants associated with greater risks of hepatotoxicity include iproniazid, nefazodone, phenelzine, imipramine, amitriptyline, duloxetine, bupropion, trazodone, tianeptine, and agomelatine.

	- **Least potential for hepatotoxicity**:
		Antidepressants that seem to have the least potential for hepatotoxicity are citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

### Efficacy, adverse events, and treatment discontinuations in fluoxetine clinical studies of major depression: a meta-analysis of the 20-mg/day dose [^1175RwAb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in adults with moderate-to-severe major depression are well established. However, most analyses combined dosages (20–80 mg/day) of the compound. We hypothesized that in patients taking 20 mg/day, efficacy would be maintained but the incidence of adverse events would be lower. We present a meta-analysis of efficacy and safety data for fluoxetine, 20 mg/day.

- **Method**: Data were from 3 double-blind studies (N = 417) that included patients with moderate-to-severe major depression (DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria) who received placebo or fixed-dose 20-mg/day treatment with fluoxetine. Efficacy was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D; HAM-D-17 total score and anxiety/somatization, retardation, sleep disturbance, and cognitive disturbance factors) and response and remission rates. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, reasons for discontinuation, and adverse events leading to discontinuation. Adverse events were evaluated to determine the emergence of activation and/or sedation.

- **Results**: At 20 mg/day, fluoxetine-treated patients demonstrated significantly greater remission and response rates and mean changes on HAM-D-17 total score and anxiety/somatization, retardation, and cognitive disturbance factor scores than placebo-treated patients (p < .001). The incidence of specific adverse events leading to discontinuation and the frequency of study discontinuations due to adverse events were similar among fluoxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients (6.1% vs. 5.8%, p = .879).

### Fluoxetine- and norfluoxetine-mediated complex drug-drug interactions: In vitro to in vivo correlation of effects on CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 [^111WU6Pt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Fluoxetine and its circulating metabolite norfluoxetine comprise a complex multiple-inhibitor system that causes reversible or time-dependent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family members CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Although significant inhibition of all three enzymes in vivo was predicted, the areas under the concentration-time curve (AUCs) for midazolam and lovastatin were unaffected by 2-week dosing of fluoxetine, whereas the AUCs of dextromethorphan and omeprazole were increased by 27- and 7.1-fold, respectively.

This observed discrepancy between in vitro risk assessment and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) profile was rationalized by time-varying dynamic pharmacokinetic models that incorporated circulating concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine enantiomers, mutual inhibitor-inhibitor interactions, and CYP3A4 induction. The dynamic models predicted all DDIs with less than twofold error. This study demonstrates that complex DDIs that involve multiple mechanisms, pathways, and inhibitors with their metabolites can be predicted and rationalized via characterization of all the inhibitory species in vitro.

### Analytically confirmed intentional overdose of the antidepressant vortioxetine [^115i6ExP]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Low credibility.

Poisoning and death from antidepressant overdose remain a significant public health issue. This potentially relates to the frequency of their prescription, particularly as they are often prescribed to individuals with a history of deliberate self-poisoning. It is recognized that there are differences in the risk of acute toxicity and death not only between different classes of antidepressant drugs but also within the same antidepressant drug class.

Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with a multimodal mechanism of action distinct from other antidepressants. It acts on several serotonin receptor subclasses — antagonist of 5-HT3, 5-HT7, and 5-HT1D receptors, agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, and partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor — and blocks the serotonin transporter (SERT). The in vivo mechanisms through which vortioxetine enacts its antidepressant, anxiolytic, and cognitive-enhancing effects are not fully understood. It was licensed for use in the European Union and the United States in 2013. Since 2015, it has been recommended in the UK as a third-line treatment option for patients with major depressive episodes, at a daily dose of 5 to 20 mg per day.

Our understanding of vortioxetine's potential toxicity is based on limited data, namely: information from the unwanted effects seen in pre-licensing clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and five case reports, including two non-fatal non-analytically confirmed overdoses, one case of serotonin syndrome attributed to therapeutic vortioxetine use, and two deaths where vortioxetine was detected.

### Which psychotropic medications induce hepatotoxicity [^115E5tEM]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Safe prescribing practices to minimize pharmaceutically induced liver damage or worsening of preexisting conditions require knowledge about medicines with hepatotoxic potential. This paper reviews psychotropic medications and their effects on the liver.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search was performed utilizing the phrase "drug-induced liver injury" with various categories of psychiatric drugs. Only articles written in English were utilized.

- **Results**: Hepatotoxicity can be acute or chronic in nature. Medication discontinuation is necessary in acute forms, while close monitoring is required in milder forms of medication-induced chronic liver damage. Nefazodone, pemoline, and/or tacrine are the highest offenders. Carbamazepine and valproate products (e.g. divalproex) can lead to this adverse event and should be avoided in patients with liver disease, persons with alcohol misuse, or those consuming high doses of acetaminophen.

- **Conclusion**: Knowing the risk levels associated with various medicines is important; prescribing multiple drugs with hepatotoxic effects should be avoided. One should educate patients about early warning signs of liver injury. Always provide clinical and laboratory monitoring before and during the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Clinical features and laboratory results govern medication prescribing with ongoing risk-to-benefit ratio assessment during pharmacotherapy.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^115rA4xV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to norfluoxetine and a number of other unidentified metabolites. The only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is formed by demethylation of fluoxetine. In animal models, S-norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to R- or S-fluoxetine. R-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney.

- **Variability in metabolism**: A subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Such individuals are referred to as "poor metabolizers" of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the TCAs. In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized S-fluoxetine at a slower rate, thus achieving higher concentrations of S-fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of S-norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of R-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the four active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, non-saturable pathways (non-2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine, which explains how fluoxetine achieves a balanced pharmacodynamic profile.

### Fluoxetine [^111LZNQb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine ensure that, even when dosing is stopped, the active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks, primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation. This persistence is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when other drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine.

- **Liver disease**: As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects. This suggests that the use of fluoxetine in patients with liver disease must be approached with caution. If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease, a lower or less frequent dose should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Renal disease**: In depressed patients on dialysis (N = 12), fluoxetine administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function.

- **Mechanism of action**: Although the exact mechanism of fluoxetine is unknown, it is presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that fluoxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. Studies in animals also suggest that fluoxetine is a much more potent uptake inhibitor of serotonin than of norepinephrine. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and α1-adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects of classical TCA drugs. Fluoxetine binds to these and other membrane receptors from brain tissue much less potently in vitro than do the tricyclic drugs.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Systemic bioavailability**: In humans, following a single oral dose of a 60 mg fluoxetine tablet, the peak plasma concentration of fluoxetine and the time to achieve peak plasma concentration were 49.6 ± 10.0 ng/mL and 7.20 ± 1.41 hours, respectively (both values are mean ± SD).
	- The capsule, tablet, and oral solution dosage forms of fluoxetine are bioequivalent. The exposure (Cmax, AUC) to fluoxetine was similar after administration of either one 60 mg fluoxetine tablet USP or three 20 mg fluoxetine tablets. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is probably not clinically significant. Thus, fluoxetine may be administered with or without food.
	- **Protein binding**: Over the concentration range from 200 to 1000 ng/mL.

- **Nonclinical toxicology**:

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**: The dietary administration of fluoxetine to rats and mice for 2 years at doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 1.2 and 0.7 times, respectively, the MRHD of 80 mg on a mg/m² basis), produced no evidence of carcinogenicity. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have been shown to have no genotoxic effects based on various assays, including bacterial mutation assay, DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells. Two fertility studies conducted in adult rats at doses of up to 7.5 mg/kg/day and 12.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.9 and 1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis) indicated that fluoxetine had no adverse effects on fertility. However, adverse effects on fertility were seen when juvenile rats were treated with fluoxetine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Animal toxicology and/or pharmacology**: Phospholipids are increased in some tissues of mice, rats, and dogs given fluoxetine chronically. This effect is reversible after the cessation of fluoxetine treatment. Phospholipid accumulation in animals has been observed with many cationic amphiphilic drugs, including fenfluramine, imipramine, and ranitidine. The significance of this effect in humans is unknown.

### Are all antidepressants really the same? The case of fluoxetine: A systematic review [^1135SNyR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine, the most widely studied of newer antidepressants, in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute treatment of depression in patients aged over 18 years.

- **Data sources**: Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2004. The search terms used included fluoxetin* or adofen or docutrix or erocap or fluctin or fluctine or fluoxeren or fontex or ladose or lorien or lovan or mutan or prozac or prozyn or reneuron or sanzur or saurat or zactin. MEDLINE (1966–2004) and EMBASE (1974–2004) were searched using fluoxetine and randomized controlled trial or random allocation or double-blind method. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched for published reports up to March 2004.

- **Study selection**: Only randomized controlled trials, whether blind or nonblind, were included.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 131 randomized controlled trials were eligible. A p-value less than .01 was chosen to test the null hypothesis, with a 99% confidence interval calculated to detect statistically significant differences with high confidence. Fixed- and random-effects relative risks, odds ratios (ORs), and Peto ORs were routinely calculated for each outcome measure. In terms of efficacy, there was a statistically significant difference favoring sertraline and venlafaxine over fluoxetine.

- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**: In two studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased greater than 2- to 10-fold when fluoxetine has been administered in combination. This influence may persist for three weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. Thus, the dose of TCAs may need to be reduced, and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is co-administered or has been recently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Benzodiazepines**: The half-life of concurrently administered diazepam may be prolonged in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels.

- **Antipsychotics**: Some clinical data suggest a possible pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics. Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.

- **Anticonvulsants**: Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.

- **Lithium**: There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported.

### Severe acute liver injury after hepatotoxic medication initiation in real-world data [^113shZBr]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Approaches to classify the hepatotoxic potential of medications are based on cumulative case reports of acute liver injury (ALI), which do not consider the size of the exposed population. There is little evidence from real-world data (data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from sources outside of a research setting) on incidence rates of severe ALI after initiation of medications, accounting for duration of exposure.

- **Objective**: To identify the most potentially hepatotoxic medications based on real-world incidence rates of severe ALI and to examine how these rates compare with categorization based on case reports.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This series of cohort studies obtained data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs on persons without preexisting liver or biliary disease who initiated a suspected hepatotoxic medication in the outpatient setting between October 1, 2000, and September 30, 2021. Data were analyzed from June 2020 to November 2023.

- **Exposures**: Outpatient initiation of any one of 194 medications with 4 or more published reports of hepatotoxicity.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Hospitalization for severe ALI, defined by either inpatient: (1) alanine aminotransferase level greater than 120 U/L plus total bilirubin level greater than 2.0 mg/dL or (2) international normalized ratio of 1.5 or higher plus total bilirubin level greater than 2.0 mg/dL recorded within the first 2 days of admission. Acute or chronic liver or biliary disease diagnosis recorded during follow-up.

### Fluoxetine [^111fzUhv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

These fluoxetine toxicities in juvenile rats have not been observed in adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day doses in this study are approximately 0.1–0.2, 1–2, and 5–10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric patients receiving the MRHD of 20 mg/day. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, are approximately 0.3–0.8, 1–8, and 3–20 times, respectively, the pediatric exposure at the MRHD.

A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4-week-old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0.5 and 2 times the oral MRHD of 20 mg/day on mg/m² basis. There was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses, but the overall growth (body weight gain or femur length) was not affected.

- **Geriatric use**: U.S. fluoxetine clinical trials included 687 patients ≥ 65 years of age and 93 patients ≥ 75 years of age. The efficacy in geriatric patients has been established [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. For pharmacokinetic information in geriatric patients, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4). No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experiences have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients.

### Prozac [^111Mjvy3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Prozac, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, meperidine, methadone, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, such as MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).

The concomitant use of Prozac with MAOIs is contraindicated. Additionally, do not initiate Prozac in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports have involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Prozac, discontinue Prozac before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Medically serious adverse effects of newer antidepressants [^111adWhg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Although newer antidepressants are considered safer than tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, they may still be associated with certain medically serious adverse effects. This review discusses cardiovascular adverse effects, seizures, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia, and agranulocytosis. Data regarding the incidence and risk factors are summarized. Strategies for reducing the risk of these adverse effects and managing them are suggested. Identification of risk factors, appropriate antidepressant choice, and, when possible, careful monitoring may significantly reduce the incidence of these adverse effects and the morbidity associated with them.

### Severe acute liver injury after hepatotoxic medication initiation in real-world data [^112yimCy]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Drug-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe and was historically a frequent reason for the withdrawal of approved drugs from 1975 to 2007. Despite its clinical importance, no systematic approach to classify hepatotoxicity exists to our knowledge. Researchers have used the number of published case reports of medication hepatotoxicity listed on the US National Institutes of Health LiverTox website to create categories of likelihood for medications to cause severe ALI: category A (well-known cause), ≥ 50 cases; category B (highly likely), 12–49 cases; category C (probable), 4–11 cases; and category D (possible), 1–3 cases. However, cases of drug-induced ALI are frequently underreported. Moreover, categorizing hepatotoxic drugs using case reports does not consider the number of individuals exposed and may not accurately reflect the incidence of severe ALI.

Assessing incidence rates of drug-induced ALI following medication initiation within real-world data, which relates to patient health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from sources outside of a research setting, offers an independent means of categorizing the potential hepatotoxicity of medications. Because drug-induced ALI is challenging to confirm in clinical practice, remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and is susceptible to misclassification, researchers could evaluate severe ALI based on laboratory measures of substantial hepatic injury after systematically excluding non-drug-related causes. This approach provides a more objective method of assessment.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^116KmBge]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Worldwide exposure to fluoxetine hydrochloride is estimated to be over 38 million patients (circa 1999). Of the 1,578 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine hydrochloride, alone or with other drugs, reported from this population, there were 195 deaths.

Among 633 adult patients who overdosed on fluoxetine hydrochloride alone, outcomes were as follows:

- **Fatal cases**: 34 resulted in a fatal outcome
- **Recovery**: 378 completely recovered
- **Sequelae experienced**: 15 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage, including:
	- **Neurological effects**: abnormal accommodation, abnormal gait, confusion, unresponsiveness, nervousness, vertigo, tremor
	- **Cardiovascular effects**: elevated blood pressure
	- **Other effects**: pulmonary dysfunction, impotence, movement disorder, hypomania
- **Unknown outcome**: 206 patients had an unknown outcome

The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal overdosage in adult patients were seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. The largest known ingestion of fluoxetine hydrochloride in adult patients was 8 grams in a patient who took fluoxetine alone and subsequently recovered. However, in an adult patient who took fluoxetine alone, an ingestion as low as 520 mg has been associated with a lethal outcome, but causality has not been established.

Among pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years), there were 156 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine alone or in combination with other drugs:

- **Fatal cases**: 6 patients died
- **Recovery**: 127 patients completely recovered
- **Complications**: 1 patient experienced renal failure
- **Unknown outcome**: 22 patients had an unknown outcome

One of the six fatalities was a 9-year-old boy who had a history of Tourette's syndrome with tics, attention deficit disorder, and fetal alcohol exposure.

### Analytically confirmed intentional overdose of the antidepressant vortioxetine [^116ReimY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Low credibility.

There have only been two published non-analytically confirmed cases of vortioxetine overdose. A 50-year-old male with major depressive disorder and previous substance use disorder (heroin, cocaine, and alcohol) and hepatitis C took an intentional overdose of 250 mg vortioxetine and 10 mg clonazepam. He presented to the ED around 5 hours later. At that time, his heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, level of consciousness, and neurological examination were normal, and there was no evidence of serotonin syndrome. He was observed for 12 hours and then discharged to an inpatient psychiatry unit. Urine immunoassay drug testing was positive for "benzodiazepines"; there was no additional toxicological analysis of blood and/or urine undertaken to determine if vortioxetine had been taken.

A 20-year-old female with depression ingested a "handful of medications"; her medicines included vortioxetine, lamotrigine, lurasidone, and extended-release bupropion. Of note, her psychiatrist had discontinued escitalopram approximately two weeks previously, but some escitalopram tablets were in the room where she was found. On presentation to the ED, she had features of serotonin syndrome: pyrexia (38 °C), tachycardia (150 beats per minute), dilated reactive pupils without ocular clonus, hyperreflexia in her legs, and inducible ankle clonus. She was admitted to critical care and treated with diazepam (40 mg/day), midazolam (4–6 mg/hour), and propofol (20–30 mg/hour). Twenty hours after ingestion, she developed hypertension (200/110 mmHg) and worsening pyrexia (38–39 °C) with ongoing myoclonus.

### Prozac [^1151itRM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: The following have been reported with fluoxetine overdosage:

- **Seizures**: These may be delayed, and an altered mental status, including coma, may occur.
- **Cardiovascular toxicity**: This may be delayed, with potential complications such as QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest. Hypertension is most commonly seen, but hypotension may occur, especially with co-ingestants such as alcohol.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Patients experiencing multiple drug overdoses involving other pro-serotonergic drugs may be at higher risk.

Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered for patients who present early following a fluoxetine overdose. It is advisable to contact a Poison Center at 1–800–221–2222 or consult a medical toxicologist for additional management recommendations.
