## Question

K check after replacement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about potassium monitoring after potassium replacement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of hypokalemia. Then, I should verify the route of replacement and its implications for monitoring. Next, I will stratify monitoring frequency by severity and route, consider special populations and high-risk scenarios, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm while double-checking safety thresholds and documentation requirements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity, because the monitoring cadence hinges on how low the potassium is and whether there are symptoms or ECG changes; mild hypokalemia is typically 3.0–3.4 mEq/L, moderate 2.5–2.9 mEq/L, and severe less than 2.5 mEq/L, with severe deficits or ECG changes mandating intravenous therapy rather than oral repletion [^116c8DvS].

> I need to check the route of replacement next, since oral potassium is preferred for stable patients with functioning GI tract, whereas IV potassium is reserved for severe deficits, ECG changes, ongoing losses, or inability to tolerate oral therapy; importantly, if serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L, oral replacement is inadequate and IV therapy should be used [^112AewMC] [^116c8DvS].

> Now, for mild hypokalemia treated orally, I should confirm that daily or every-other-day potassium checks are reasonable until stable, then space to weekly and eventually monthly once stable; wait, let me verify the maintenance cadence — yes, FDA labeling supports daily monitoring during correction and monthly to biannually for maintenance, with dose adjustments based on serial values [^112AewMC] [^1133WKat].

> For moderate hypokalemia treated orally, hold on, I should verify that more frequent checks are warranted; daily monitoring until normalization is appropriate, then weekly for 2–4 weeks, and monthly thereafter if stable, with earlier reassessment if symptoms, diuretic dosing, or comorbidities change [^112AewMC].

> For severe hypokalemia or any IV replacement, I need to ensure a tight monitoring window; initially I thought "every 2–4 hours", but wait, let me verify best practice — continuous ECG monitoring and checks every 1–2 hours are safer in this range, with more frequent checks if the patient is unstable or if high infusion rates are used; this aligns with pediatric critical care guidance and IV potassium labeling emphasizing ECG and serial potassium surveillance [^111y82gd] [^115wKdro].

> Next, I should review special populations and high-risk scenarios; in chronic kidney disease or on RAAS inhibitors, I should double-check that potassium is measured within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes and then every 3–6 months, with tighter intervals if baseline potassium is higher or eGFR is lower; in diabetic ketoacidosis, potassium must be checked frequently during insulin and fluid therapy, typically every 1–2 hours early on; in heart failure with MRAs, potassium and renal function should be rechecked at 3 days and 1 week, then monthly for 3 months; in the perioperative setting, electrolytes should be checked and corrected pre-op and rechecked post-op given fluid shifts; in pediatrics, use weight-based dosing and monitor more frequently due to higher fluxes [^1125hA23] [^115EgLFb] [^116bkViM] [^112AewMC].

> I will now examine safety thresholds and when to escalate; if potassium rises above 5.0–5.5 mEq/L during repletion, I should confirm the level to exclude pseudohyperkalemia, stop or reduce supplementation, review medications that raise potassium, and consider a binder if needed; conversely, if potassium fails to rise as expected, I need to check for ongoing losses, acid-base status, and especially hypomagnesemia, since low magnesium impedes potassium repletion and must be corrected first [^115qNq1M].

> Let me consider documentation and communication; I should confirm that each potassium value, the time of check, the replacement dose and route, and the clinical rationale for changes are recorded, and that the care team is notified of critical values, particularly when potassium is less than 2.5 or greater than 5.5 mEq/L, to ensure coordinated response and patient safety.

> But wait, what if the patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy or peritoneal dialysis; I need to ensure that potassium is monitored frequently during CRRT and that PD solutions are adjusted or supplemented as indicated, because CRRT replacement fluids and PD exchanges directly alter potassium balance and require serial checks to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia [^114BAr6D] [^114vyhsD].

> Finally, to synthesize a practical algorithm: for mild oral cases, check daily until stable, then weekly, then monthly; for moderate oral cases, check daily until normalization, then weekly for 2–4 weeks, then monthly; for severe or IV cases, check every 1–2 hours with continuous ECG until stable, then taper to every 4–6 hours, then daily until consistently in the normal range; always reassess sooner if symptoms, ECG changes, or medication changes occur, and escalate monitoring intensity in CKD, DKA, heart failure, perioperative states, or pediatrics [^112AewMC] [^111y82gd] [^1125hA23] [^1135r4eb] [^116bkViM].

---

After potassium replacement, **recheck potassium within 1–2 hours** for IV therapy and **within 4–6 hours** for oral therapy to assess response and detect rebound changes. For high-risk patients (CKD, heart failure, arrhythmias, or on RAAS inhibitors), **monitor more frequently** — every 2–4 hours initially — and adjust therapy based on trends. Always interpret results in clinical context and repeat testing if the result is unexpected or discordant with the clinical picture [^111y82gd] [^1135r4eb].

---

## General principles of potassium monitoring

- **Frequency of monitoring**: Potassium levels should be monitored frequently after replacement therapy, especially in patients with renal impairment, cardiac disease, or those receiving medications that affect potassium homeostasis [^112AewMC].

- **Route of administration**: The route of potassium administration significantly influences the timing of potassium level checks. Intravenous (IV) potassium replacement requires more frequent monitoring than oral supplementation due to the rapid onset of action and potential for hyperkalemia [^1133WKat] [^112D9KpM].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Clinical factors such as renal function, cardiac status, and concurrent medications (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics) necessitate individualized monitoring strategies [^1125hA23].

---

## Recommended timing for potassium level checks after replacement

| **Route of administration** | **Recommended timing for potassium level check** |
|-|-|
| Intravenous (IV) | Within 1–2 hours after completion of infusion |
| Oral | Within 4–6 hours after administration |
| Continuous infusion | Every 2–4 hours during infusion |

---

These recommendations align with clinical guidelines and expert consensus, emphasizing the need for **close monitoring** to prevent both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^1125hA23] [^112RLHGt].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring more frequent monitoring

Certain clinical scenarios necessitate **more frequent potassium monitoring** because of the increased risk of rapid potassium level fluctuations:

- **Renal impairment**: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) require more frequent monitoring due to impaired potassium excretion [^113YChVW].

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Patients with underlying cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, require close monitoring to prevent life-threatening hyperkalemia or hypokalemia [^115qNq1M].

- **Medications affecting potassium homeostasis**: Patients receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) require frequent monitoring due to the risk of hyperkalemia [^1125hA23].

- **Critical illness**: Critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), require frequent potassium monitoring [^1135r4eb].

---

## Risks associated with inadequate monitoring

Inadequate monitoring of potassium levels after replacement therapy can lead to **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Excessive potassium replacement or impaired renal excretion can result in hyperkalemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potentially fatal cardiac events [^1172XMC2].

- **Hypokalemia**: Inadequate replacement or ongoing potassium losses can result in persistent hypokalemia, causing muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmias, and neuromuscular complications [^113NFDQ5].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Rapid fluctuations in potassium levels can cause significant electrolyte disturbances, affecting cardiac and neuromuscular function [^111cZZL1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Several clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements provide **clear recommendations** on potassium monitoring after replacement therapy:

- **American Family Physician (AAFP)**: Recommends frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels after replacement therapy, especially in patients with renal impairment, cardiac disease, or those receiving medications affecting potassium homeostasis [^notfound].

- **UK Renal Association**: Recommends close monitoring of serum potassium levels in patients with hyperkalemia, with repeat measurements at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after identification and treatment of moderate or severe hyperkalemia [^117CXvpp].

- **American Heart Association (AHA)**: Emphasizes the importance of monitoring potassium levels in patients with heart failure or those receiving medications that affect potassium homeostasis, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and MRAs [^113Mbx4o].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical clinical approach to potassium monitoring after replacement therapy includes:

- **Initial monitoring**: Check potassium levels within 1–2 hours after IV replacement and within 4–6 hours after oral replacement [^notfound].

- **Subsequent monitoring**: Adjust the frequency of monitoring based on patient-specific factors, clinical stability, and response to therapy. For high-risk patients, monitor every 2–4 hours initially, then gradually decrease frequency as stability improves [^112AewMC].

- **Documentation**: Clearly document potassium levels, timing of checks, and clinical response to therapy to ensure continuity of care and facilitate clinical decision-making [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **IV potassium replacement**: Recheck potassium levels within 1–2 hours after infusion.

- **Oral potassium replacement**: Recheck potassium levels within 4–6 hours after administration.

- **High-risk patients**: Monitor more frequently (every 2–4 hours) initially, then adjust based on clinical stability.

- **Documentation**: Clearly document all potassium levels and clinical responses to therapy.

---

Potassium levels should be monitored frequently after replacement therapy, with **IV replacement checked within 1–2 hours** and **oral replacement within 4–6 hours**. High-risk patients require more frequent monitoring, and all results should be documented clearly to guide ongoing management.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium <br/> - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

Should I Be Concerned About Serum Potassium Levels Following Initiation of a RASi or Finerenone?

RASis can be associated with hyperkalemia, which can be managed by a reduction in potassium intake, as well as prescribing diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, or potassium binders to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the RASi dose or withdrawing treatment, which should only occur if mitigation strategies are ineffective. A meta-analysis comprising seven studies demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events with RASi discontinuation in individuals with CKD, suggesting that if the clinical situation is appropriate, RASi treatment should be continued for maximum benefit.

Those treated with finerenone should have a serum potassium concentration ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at initiation, and monitoring should take place 1 month after starting. If levels rise to > 5.5 mmol/L, finerenone should be stopped, with adjustments made to diet or the addition of diuretics and/or potassium binders. Treatment may resume when potassium levels are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L.

Considering the risk of hyperkalemia is increased with MRAs and RASis, implementing the pillar approach would be advantageous over the stepwise approach, as the addition of an SGLT2i to these therapies may decrease the occurrence of hyperkalemia events. Indeed, in CONFIDENCE, the incidence of hyperkalemia was lower with finerenone and empagliflozin combination therapy than finerenone alone, indicating another advantage of simultaneous administration of these drugs. Patient-and-physician-shared decision-making should be at the center of hyperkalemia management.

Should I Expect a Reduction in an Individual's UACR Following Initiation of Appropriate Treatments?

Early changes (i.e. 6 months) in UACR have been previously accepted as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney endpoints. Moreover, patients may be more likely to adhere to medications if they experience an improvement in UACR with the addition of medications.

UACR is highly variable between measurements and is impacted by numerous other factors (for example, glycemic and blood pressure control, diet, and physical activity); therefore, the lack of decline after initiating medication does not necessarily indicate treatment failure and thus treatment should continue. If UACR continues to climb or the eGFR falls significantly, despite using of all the treatment strategies, consider referral to a nephrologist to determine if another etiology may be present or if intensification of therapy is warranted.

### Potassium phosphates [^114xZWQf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The 100 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol (phosphorus 0.15 mmol/mL) and potassium 22 mEq (potassium 0.22 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central vein.
The 250 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol and potassium 22 mEq (phosphorus 0.06 mmol/mL and potassium 0.088 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central OR peripheral vein.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Dialysate potassium, dialysate magnesium, and hemodialysis risk [^112FxGU3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

One of the fundamental goals of the hemodialysis prescription is to maintain serum potassium levels within a narrow normal range during both the intradialytic and interdialytic intervals. Considering the extraordinarily high rate of cardiovascular mortality in the hemodialysis population, clinicians are obligated to explore whether factors related to dialytic potassium removal can be modified to improve clinical outcomes. Observational studies and circumstantial evidence suggest that extreme concentrations of serum and dialysate potassium can trigger cardiac arrest. In this review, we provide an overview of factors affecting overall potassium balance and factors modulating potassium dialysate fluxes in dialysis, and we review data linking serum and dialysate potassium concentrations with arrhythmias, cardiovascular events, and mortality. We explore potential interactions between serum and dialysate magnesium levels and risks associated with dialysate potassium levels. Finally, we conclude with proposed dialytic and novel nondialytic approaches to optimize outcomes related to potassium homeostasis in patients on hemodialysis. Dialysis clinicians need to consider changes in the overall clinical scenario when choosing dialysate potassium concentrations, and an effective change in practice will require more frequent serum potassium monitoring and responsive dialysis care teams.

Potassium supplementation is generally stopped after initiation, patients should be counseled to avoid high potassium-containing foods, and patients should be cautioned to avoid the addition of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Potassium levels and renal function should be rechecked within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation; subsequent monitoring should occur at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with any addition or increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) triggering a new cycle of monitoring. In view of hyperkalemia risk, the Writing Committee recommends that the routine triple combination of ACEIs, ARBs, and an aldosterone antagonist be avoided. The development of potassium levels in excess of 5.5 mEq per liter should generally trigger discontinuation or dose reduction of the aldosterone antagonist, and patients should be instructed specifically to stop the aldosterone antagonist during an episode of diarrhea or while loop diuretic therapy is interrupted.

### Potassium acetate [^1114Wi3Q]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Potassium Acetate Injection, 40 mEq must be diluted before use.

To avoid potassium intoxication, infuse potassium-containing solutions slowly. Potassium replacement therapy should be monitored whenever possible by continuous or serial electrocardiography (ECG). Serum potassium levels are not necessarily dependable indicators of tissue potassium levels.

Solutions which contain potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.

In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing potassium ions may result in potassium retention.

Solutions containing acetate ions should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Acetate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.

WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

Internists routinely replete potassium to a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality. Recent literature demonstrates that a potassium goal of > 3.5mmol/L likely coincides with the lowest risk of mortality. Based on these data, internists should individualize potassium goals rather than routinely aiming for a high-goal serum level of ≥ 4mmol/L.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolytes — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention: Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia have been associated with VA during an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and can increase the risk of torsades de pointes in patients on QT‑prolonging regimens; in torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first‑line therapy, and when both deficiencies are present, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate replacement of potassium. For prevention, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest rates of death were seen with potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and VA rates did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A double‑blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post‑MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30‑day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post‑MI period.

Primary aldosteronism — mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy initiation and monitoring algorithm specifies starting steps, goals, follow-up timing, and action branches based on blood pressure, potassium, kidney function, and renin. At initiation, the algorithm states: "With MRA initiation, consider hypertension severity and stop/reduce other anti-hypertensive medications if appropriate", "Stop K supplements within 2–4 days of MRA initiation unless severely hypokalemic", and "Recommend low sodium diet"; stated goals are "Blood pressure controlled; reduction of unnecessary other anti-hypertensive medications; normokalemia" and "Non-suppressed renin". Follow-up is scheduled at "2–3 MONTHS OR SOONER IF CLINICALLY INDICATED" to "Check BP, Potassium, Kidney Function, and Renin". Branch actions are as follows: if "BP Uncontrolled and Renin Not Suppressed", then "Add/Increase Non-MRA Anti-Hypertensive Medication"; if "BP Uncontrolled and Renin Suppressed OR Persistent Hypokalemia", then "Increase MRA Dose"; if "Renin Suppressed and other Non-MRA Anti-hypertensive Medications in Use", then "MRA Dose Increase; Stop/Reduce Non-MRA Anti-hypertensive Medications as Appropriate"; if "Renin Normal/ Increased vs Baseline", then "Routine Follow-up".

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome with osilodrostat: practical applications of recent studies with case examples [^117XgkeH]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Baseline evaluation needed before medication start

This example patient provides a good illustration of the steps to be taken before initiating osilodrostat. Obtaining potassium and magnesium levels and ECG measurements are critical both before initiating treatment, as a baseline, and during treatment with osilodrostat; this is also true with other adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, such as metyrapone and levoketoconazole or with the glucocorticoid receptor blocker mifepristone, to monitor for the development of low potassium or prolonged QTc on ECG. For patients starting specifically on osilodrostat, an ECG should be performed at baseline and 1 week after initiating therapy to ensure there is no QTc prolongation (although this is uncommon, as described later), in addition to checking for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and, if present, correcting these before beginning treatment. An ECG should be repeated again after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment (depending on age, cardiac history, concomitant medications, and electrolyte abnormalities); if the ECG is normal, follow-up can be determined by the clinical situation, such as with dose increases. Potassium levels should be closely monitored with osilodrostat dose changes and checked more often if levels are out of the normal range or if other risk factors for hypokalemia are present. Abnormalities should be managed proactively — if levels are low, potassium replacement should be administered and levels followed to ensure that they normalize; alteration of the osilodrostat dose is not typically necessary. Patients with hypokalemia may also benefit from starting mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone or eplerenone). Of note, if osilodrostat treatment is interrupted, potassium and other concomitant medications should be closely monitored, as doses may need to be reduced or discontinued (see the " Treatment interruption for COVID-19 " section).

ACTH monitoring during use of steroidogenesis inhibitors

This example patient's tumor growth was noted when an MRI was performed because of a substantial increase in ACTH. Conducting regular follow-up to measure plasma ACTH levels has been recommended when using steroidogenesis inhibitors because of the dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) feedback mechanism. In our practice, periodic monitoring of ACTH levels at approximately 3- to 6-month intervals is used to assess for potential substantial increases. It is important to note that many factors impact ACTH values, which often fluctuate widely.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^111r5wu5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: the stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^114MxsNz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large, population‐based study of new users of ACE‐I or ARB therapy, we demonstrate that adherence to guideline‐recommended electrolyte monitoring was poor. Less than one third of patients had a potassium measurement within 30 days of starting an ACE‐I or ARB, and only 76% had one in the year following medication initiation. On the other hand, the 1‐year occurrence of hyperkalemia was generally quite low in those with potassium measurements, the majority of whom had preserved eGFR, with only 1.7% developing potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L. People without potassium measurements tended to be of low predicted risk. These results suggest that more targeted protocols for monitoring potassium levels after ACE‐I/ARB initiation may be cost‐effective and safe.

There was a large increase in hyperkalemia risk among persons with low eGFR, a risk that was also present to a lesser extent in matched new users of β‐blocker therapy. This may suggest a need for heightened potassium monitoring in patients with reduced eGFR, even those taking medications thought to have only small effects on potassium, such as β‐blockers. Other strong risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia on ACE‐I or ARB therapy included higher baseline potassium levels, the concomitant use of K‐sparing diuretics, and the presence of diabetes mellitus or heart failure. The combination of these factors into a susceptibility score may allay provider concerns regarding the risk of hyperkalemia in low‐risk patients, encouraging greater prescription in patients with indications for ACE‐I or ARB therapy. Future work should focus on the risks and benefits of ACE‐I and ARB therapy in patients with higher risk scores, including whether use may be optimized with monitoring practices tailored to an individual patient's risk level.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^111y82gd]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent study indicates that infusing 1 mmol/kg of potassium chloride over 1–2 h is likely safe for young children in intensive care units with mild to moderate hypokalemia, however, those with severe hypokalemia may require additional supplementation. When administering potassium via peripheral veins, the concentration should not exceed 40 mmol/L to prevent phlebitis and pain. For higher concentrations, central venous lines are recommended, however, this does not apply to life-threatening conditions. Importantly, potassium dextrose-containing solutions must be avoided, as dextrose stimulates insulin secretion and can potentially worsen hypokalemia. Additionally, it is important when removing dextrose from intravenous fluids in ill children not eating as this can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage potential hypoglycemia in these patients. Potassium replacement should be scaled back when the serum potassium concentration exceeds 3.5 mmol/L. During this replacement approach, serum potassium checks are recommended every 1–2 h. Continuous ECG monitoring is essential, along with regular monitoring of blood gases and potassium levels. Additionally, concurrent hypomagnesemia in children with hypokalemia requires attention as it contributes to potassium wasting and lowers tubular potassium reabsorption. Management should focus on correcting low magnesium levels since hypokalemia is refractory until magnesium levels are within the range of 0.7–1 mmol/L. In specific conditions such as correcting electrolyte imbalances or acid–base disorders, alternative forms of potassium supplementation may be considered. These scenarios include potassium phosphate in diabetic ketoacidosis or potassium citrate in renal tubular acidosis.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^112fayVP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture". It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Association between serum potassium and 28-day mortality in elderly patients with sepsis: a multicenter cohort study [^1146waKN]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Several mechanisms may explain the linear relationship observed in elderly septic patients. First, age-related decline in renal function and reduced potassium adaptive capacity may impair the ability to handle potassium loads effectively. Second, the high prevalence of comorbidities in elderly patients, particularly chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and CHF, has been well-documented as independent risk factors for hyperkalemia. Third, the high prevalence of polypharmacy in elderly septic patients, particularly medications affecting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, may create a physiological environment more susceptible to potassium-related complications.

Our findings have important implications for clinical practice. The linear relationship between serum potassium and mortality suggests that traditional approaches to serum potassium management, which often focus equally on preventing both hypo- and hyperkalemia, may need modification in elderly septic patients. While maintaining normal potassium levels remains important, our results suggest that preventing hyperkalemia should be a primary focus in this population. This may influence several aspects of care: more frequent monitoring of potassium levels in elderly septic patients; earlier intervention when potassium levels begin to rise; careful consideration of medications affecting potassium homeostasis and potentially different target ranges for potassium replacement therapy.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114s2qxh]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Recommendations for the management of potassium with Finerenone

In accordance with the US labelling prescribing information for finerenone, serum potassium and eGFR should be measured and finerenone should be dosed appropriately in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment with finerenone should not be initiated if serum potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically, on a schedule similar to study visits in FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD (Month 1, Month 4, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. Importantly, such a schedule is actually similar with the usual biological monitoring recommended in CKD patients by the KDIGO 2012 guidelines (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Protocol for potassium management

If serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, the dose should be continued or increased to 20 mg per day (if the starting dose was 10 mg per day, i.e. for patients with a baseline eGFR 25 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). If serum potassium concentrations are > 4.8‐ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, the dose should be maintained at 10 mg daily or 20 mg daily. Serum potassium should be monitored 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment, and the dose adjusted as needed.

This is actually similar to the recommended procedure for RASi oversight, per KDIGO guidelines on diabetes management in CKD, which state "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". Finerenone should be temporarily discontinued if serum potassium concentrations are > 5.5 mmol/L and can be restarted at 10 mg daily when serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Finerenone has a short half‐life of 2–3 h and no active metabolites; therefore, hyperkalemia can be treated by discontinuing treatment. For patients with moderate liver disease (Child‐Pugh B), additional potassium monitoring should be considered (Table 4).

### The association between potassium level during the anhepatic stage of orthotopic liver transplantation and postoperative acute kidney injury: an exploratory study [^112mHiu2]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as the definitive and preferred modality for hepatic replacement in end-stage liver disease patients. Despite the escalating success rates of the procedure due to medical technological innovations, the postoperative outcomes, both in the short and long term, continue to be less than optimal. Acute kidney injury (AKI) post-LT, noted for its high prevalence and the potential for progression, has become a focal point for clinical practitioners.

It is well known that patients with AKI will experience disturbances in electrolyte levels, but imbalances in electrolyte levels, especially serum potassium concentration, may occur before the onset of AKI. While the association between serum potassium levels and the development of AKI has been increasingly explored across various clinical domains, its application in LT is relatively limited.

The principal objective of this investigation is to collect and analyze serum potassium and creatinine levels of patients to evaluate the prognostic potential of intraoperative serum potassium levels in anticipating AKI subsequent to LT. It is anticipated that the findings of this study will enhance the predictive capabilities for AKI risk post-LT, elucidate the nexus between intraoperative serum potassium levels and the incidence of postoperative AKI, and contribute novel perspectives for the early detection and risk stratification of AKI in LT recipients. Furthermore, this research endeavors to provide a scientifically robust foundation for the integrated management of patients undergoing liver transplantation.

Dosing, monitoring and adverse effects

Mitotane dosing varies based on performance status and mostly on the patient's and physician's preferences. However, in general, high-dose regimens should be considered for robust patients and low-dose regimens for those with poorer tolerance (Table 3).

Table 3
Dosing strategies for initiating mitotane therapy.

Plasma levels should be maintained above 14 mg/L for efficacy, while levels above 20 mg/L should be avoided due to toxicity risks. Monitoring begins every 3–4 weeks during dose titration and is spaced to 6–12 weeks once levels stabilize. Table 4 describes frequency of adverse effects with mitotane therapy and Table 5 provides some recommendations for monitoring these adverse events.

Table 4
Secondary adverse effects with mitotane.

Table 5
Recommendations for monitoring adverse effects of mitotane.

Adverse events must be carefully managed, including hydrocortisone replacement, which requires high-dose adjustments (2–3×) due to mitotane-induced cytochrome P450 3A4 activation, which accelerates hydrocortisone metabolism and increases cortisol-binding protein (CBG) levels.

Other steroidogenesis inhibitors used in ACC

Additional inhibitors, including metyrapone, osilodrostat, ketoconazole and etomidate, are used for hypercortisolism management (Supplementary Material S2). Combination regimens or 'block-and-replace' approaches with hydrocortisone may be required for rapid cortisol reduction, particularly before surgery or chemotherapy or in advanced disease. Severe hypercortisolism requires anticoagulation and pneumocystis prophylactic antibiotics until cortisol levels are controlled.

In cases of aldosterone-secreting tumors causing hypertension and hypokalemia, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone combined with potassium supplementation and electrolyte monitoring are mandatory.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^115m9UAn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The regulation of potassium homoeostasis changes dramatically in patients with kidney failure who are treated by haemodialysis. With the kidney largely out of the equation, haemodialysis patients rely on potassium removal during each dialysis session to prevent hyperkalaemia. In addition, the gut becomes an important accessory organ for potassium excretion. Despite these adaptations, hyperkalaemia (defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) remains a common electrolyte disorder occurring in approximately 14% of haemodialysis patients. Although seemingly counterintuitive, a minority of haemodialysis patients is hypokalaemic (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L), and this is usually related to poor dietary intake. The target serum potassium in haemodialysis is unknown, but one study suggests that a serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mmol/L is associated with the greatest survival. Of note, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this optimal serum potassium range seems to be lower (4.0–4.5 mmol/L). Furthermore, when analysing serum potassium in haemodialysis patients, it is important to factor in when it was measured (after the long or short interdialytic interval, time of day and seasonality), and to analyse serial measurements to exclude transient hyperkalemia. Nephrologists can manage potassium balance in haemodialysis patients in three ways, including (i) by modifying the dialysate potassium concentration, (ii) by prescribing potassium binders and (iii) by modifying dietary potassium intake (Figure 1). The reason to implement such interventions is usually driven by recurring predialysis hyperkalaemia and the related risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Although the prevention of acute complications is important, another relevant question is how these interventions affect long-term outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials in this area. Therefore, instead, we need to rely on registries, which often provide useful insights into how real-world management influences long-term outcomes. A good example of such a registry is the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). In this issue, Mercadal et al. use this registry to analyse the effect of prescription patterns of dialysate potassium and potassium binders on survival in over 25 000 patients who started haemodialysis in 2010–13 and were followed until the end of 2014. Using Cox proportional hazard models, the investigators show that dialysis centres that used two or three dialysate potassium concentrations had a lower mortality risk than centres that only used one formula. In addition, patients who used the potassium binder sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate in a dose of 4–8 or ≥ 8 g/day had a lower mortality risk than patients who did not use potassium binders. Conversely, patients who used potassium binders in a dose < 4 g/day had a higher mortality risk. Oral potassium supplements, which were used in 6% of patients, were not associated with a survival benefit. What does this study teach us on potassium management in haemodialysis patients and what are the implications for clinical practice?

### Association of serum potassium time in target range with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFpEF [^1173Htm4]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the frequency of potassium monitoring in the TOPCAT trial, we recommended the schedule for sK measurements as follows: first, the sK levels should be measured prior to initiating ACEI/ARB/diuretic therapy; then, they should be monitored again within 1 week of drug administration. For those patients with abnormal potassium levels, repeat measurement within 7 days was recommended. For those patients with stable potassium levels, it is recommended to monitor the potassium levels every 4 weeks and eventually extend to 6-month intervals. In cases involving medication adjustment, potassium monitoring should be carried out within 1 week of the adjustment. To effectively maintain sK levels, interventions for hyperkalaemia include dietary potassium restriction, reduction of RAAS inhibitor usage and the use of newer medications. Potassium binders or dialysis may be required for precise potassium control in specific patients such as those with renal impairment. Conversely, in cases of mild hypokalaemia in patients with HF, it is recommended to increase the dosage of ACEIs/ARBs/angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) to meet guideline-recommended targets. In patients with persistent fluid overload and more severe hypokalaemia, loop diuretics are preferred to manage congestion, and potassium supplementation may also be considered. Further studies are warranted to determine whether aggressive management of dyskalaemia using potassium supplements for hypokalaemia or potassium binders for hyperkalaemia can reduce mortality in patients with HFpEF. The comprehensive application of these measures helps maintain potassium levels within the target range, ensuring long-term potassium stability and improving overall CV outcomes.

### Twice-weekly and incremental hemodialysis treatment for initiation of kidney replacement therapy [^116wp2Yt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality is highest in the first months of maintenance hemodialysis (HD) therapy. In many Western countries, patients who transition to kidney replacement therapy usually begin thrice-weekly HD regardless of their level of residual kidney function (RKF). RKF is a major predictor of survival. RKF may decline more rapidly with thrice-weekly HD treatments, is associated with a reduced need for dialytic solute clearance, and is an important factor in the prescription of peritoneal dialysis. In this article, we review the concept of incremental HD, in which weekly dialysis dose, in particular HD treatment frequency, is based on a variety of clinical factors, such as RKF (including urine output > 0.5 L/d), volume status, cardiovascular symptoms, body size, potassium and phosphorus levels, nutritional status, hemoglobin level, comorbid conditions, hospitalizations, and health-related quality of life. These 10 clinical criteria may identify which patients might benefit from beginning maintenance HD therapy twice weekly. Periodic monitoring of these criteria will determine the timing for increasing dialysis dose and frequency. We recognize that twice-weekly HD represents a major paradigm shift for many clinicians and jurisdictions. Therefore, we propose conducting randomized controlled trials of twice-weekly versus thrice-weekly HD to assess the potential of twice-weekly HD to improve survival and health-related quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs, protecting fragile vascular accesses, and optimizing resource use during the first year of hemodialysis therapy. Such incremental and individualized HD therapy may prove to be the most appropriate approach for transitioning to dialytic therapy.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: the stockholm creatinine measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE‐I) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post–myocardial infarction. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. 6, 7, 8, 9 Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. 6 Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit. 10

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE‐inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within 1 week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE‐I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. 11 The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first 4 weeks after initiation or dose change for high‐risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg, potassium > 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) and within 4 to 12 weeks for all others. 12 The American Heart Association recommends checking serum electrolytes and creatinine before and 1 week after starting an ACE‐I. 13 Clinical trials suggest that the rate of hyperkalemia after initiating renin–angiotensin system blockade is low 14, 15; however, the frequency of monitoring and rates of hyperkalemia in clinical practice are not well defined.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111bJiDr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Given the evidence that hyperkalemia in HF is not always an ominous sign, the analysis of the northern Danish cohort needs to be approached with some caution. Despite careful analytical methods that attempted to mitigate sources of bias, findings from this analysis remain limited by residual confounding. Individuals with incident hyperkalemia were more burdened by comorbidities, such as more prevalent ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral arterial disease. Thus, we have to be careful to assert a general causal relationship between hyperkalemia and clinical outcomes across the entire spectrum of hyperkalemia.

Furthermore, there are new treatment options either approved or in the pipeline for patients with a history of hyperkalemia, such as the potassium binders (patiromer and ZS‐9). 2 Future studies will need to prove safety and efficacy of these agents, especially in their use as a preventative strategy in patients at risk for hyperkalemia. Specifically, we need to understand whether potassium binder use in the population with HF will do the following: (1) allow added RASi or MRA; (2) permit increasing doses of RASi or MRA to maximize tolerated dosing; and (3) sustain the long‐term benefits of RASi or MRA use. Given the risks associated with hyperkalemia, unmonitored use of RASi/MRA can be dangerous, as was seen with the introduction of spironolactone for the treatment of HF with reduced EF. 16 More contemporary reports have confirmed the suboptimal laboratory monitoring after RASi/MRA initiation, even in patients at highest risk. 18, 19 Suboptimal monitoring puts patients at increased risk for adverse effects related to hyperkalemia, particularly in the "high‐risk zone" of potassium level > 5.5 mmol/L. Efforts to encourage guideline‐directed laboratory monitoring appear logical, but we also need to understand whether greater monitoring efforts and what monitoring strategies would improve safety of patients with HF and particular the ones at high risk for hyperkalemia in the real world. A summary of currently recommended potassium/renal function monitoring 20, 21 after initiation of RASi and MRA is presented in the Figure. In conclusion, because hyperkalemia in HF is highly prevalent, efforts to understand its associated risk, predict and monitor its onset, and develop effective treatment strategies that do not impede the use of guideline‐directed medical therapy should be of highest priority.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

Methods

Patients

A total of 160 adult patients who underwent classical orthotopic LT at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from October 1, 2022, to July 31, 2023, were initially screened for this study. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final sample of 136 patients was enrolled. Inclusion criteria included: (1) Age between 18 and 65 years. (2) First-time LT with a classical orthotopic procedure. (3) End anhepatic stage serum potassium levels ranging from 3.0 mmol/L to 4.5 mmol/L. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Emergency LT due to acute liver failure. (2) Renal replacement therapy within the last three months. (3) Concurrent hepatorenal syndrome. (4) Interventions affecting serum potassium levels, such as blood transfusion, furosemide, sodium bicarbonate, or calcium chloride, administered between the end anhepatic stage and the first 15 min of the neo-hepatic phase. (5) Multi-organ combined transplantation. (6) Missing critical data. The study was approved by the hospital's ethics committee (protocol number: QYFY WZLL 29057). All procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and have been approved by the appropriate institutional committee(s). The privacy rights of human subjects have been observed. The study strictly adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). This investigation adheres to the reporting guidelines of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative.

Anesthesia protocol

Upon admission to the operating room, routine monitoring was established, including a five-lead electrocardiogram, non-invasive cuff blood pressure monitoring and pulse oximetry. External defibrillation pads were applied, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring was performed via radial artery puncture under local anesthesia in both the left and right hands. After triple checks, the anesthesiologist induced anesthesia by administering appropriate doses of midazolam, sufentanil, propofol and cisatracurium based on the patient's body weight. After the medication took effect, endotracheal intubation was performed. General anesthesia with a combination of intravenous and inhalation agents was used throughout the surgery. Adjustments to the medication dosage, ventilator settings, and blood product transfusion were made rationally based on the patient's intraoperative vital signs, BIS values, and blood gas analysis results to maintain hemodynamic stability and ensure the smooth progression of the surgery.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^1139Tryh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The understandably strong impulse to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should therefore be tempered by consideration of the less visible risk of post-dialysis hypokalaemia. Pragmatically therefore one can conclude the following general principles:

Firstly, pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia should be controlled, though an overly tight range may be counterproductive, so the previously recommended target for pre-dialysis potassium still seems optimal (4.0–6.0mmol/L). Caveats to interpreting this range should be noted: firstly, achievement of pre-dialysis potassium within this range does not necessarily mean that dialysate potassium is optimal, and secondly, consistent adherence to treatment is most likely just as important as specifics of the potassium range or dialysis prescription.

Secondly, non-dialysate approaches to hyperkalaemia may sometimes be more favourable. Dietary reduction may be preferable if it can be achieved without an adverse effect on protein-calorie intake, and other dialysis changes may be appropriate, such as increasing blood flow, duration or frequency. Consideration could also be given to potassium binding resins.

Thirdly, lower dialysate potassium does increase the removal of potassium during each session, and based on the risk of arrhythmias due to hyperkalaemia, dialysate potassium should be reduced if other measures are not possible or successful. However, dialysate potassium should be no lower than is necessary to achieve this goal – individualization does therefore seem necessary, so that each patient uses the highest dialysate potassium which still controls pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. This pragmatic approach has probably driven the steady increase in the use of higher potassium dialysates, and reduction in the use of concentrations below 2.0mmol/L, over the 5 DOPPS phases between 1996 and 2015.

Finally, and particularly for measurements taken remote from the laboratory, the relatively high frequency of measurement errors (for example due to in vitro haemolysis) should be remembered when interpreting potassium levels.

2.2 Dosage for Administration in Intravenous Fluids to Correct Hypophosphatemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION provides phosphorus 3 mmol/mL (potassium 4.7 mEq/mL).

The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources.

Initial or Single Dose

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose and are intended for most patients. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose. The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium serum concentrations.

cup to a maximum of phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq) as a single dose.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

The concentration of the diluted solution and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter.

Peripheral administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 6.4 mmol/100 mL (potassium10 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 6.4 mmol/hour (potassium 10 mEq/hour).

Central administration:

The maximum recommended concentration is phosphorus 18 mmol/100 mL (potassium 28.2 mEq/100 mL).
The maximum recommended infusion rate is approximately phosphorus 15 mmol/hour (potassium 23.5 mEq/hour).

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates of potassium higher than 10 mEq/hour in adults and 0.5 mEq/kg/hour in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of
additional doses, assess the patient clinically and obtain serum phosphorous, calcium and potassium
concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Re-visiting pH-adjusted potassium to avoid hypokalemic crisis during management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a conceptual framework [^116oYfQC]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment guidelines recommend to initiate potassium-replacement when serum potassium (S K) drops within normal range, and to withhold insulin if S K is below normal. Despite strict recommendations, hypokalemia is frequently observed in DKA.

Methods

Scientific literature was thoroughly searched to find 1) DKA treatment guidelines, 2) studies reporting hypokalemia in DKA, 3) and literature elaborating mechanisms involved in hypokalemia.

Results

Acidosis affects S K and its regulators including insulin, catecholamines and aldosterone. Current conceptual framework is an argument to gauge the degree of hypokalemia before it strikes DKA patients utilizing S K level after adjusting it with pH. Suggested approach will reduce hypokalemia risk and its associated complications. The nomogram calculates pH-adjusted potassium and expected potassium loss. It also ranks hypokalemia associated risk, and proposes the potassium-replacement rate over given time period. The differences between current DKA treatment guidelines and proposed strategy are also discussed. Moreover, reasons and risk of hyperkalemia due to early initiation of potassium replacement and remedial actions are debated.

Conclusion

In light of proposed strategy, utilizing the nomogram ensures reduced incidence of hypokalemia in DKA resulting in improved clinical and patient outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic benefits can also be expected when avoiding hypokalemia ensures early discharge.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111cZZL1]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5.1 - Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Rationale

Historically, it was often difficult to remove the potassium accumulated between dialysis sessions, so dialysate potassium between zero and 2mmol/L was common. The requirement for dialysate with potassium levels that are close to, or within, the normal range reflects the increased efficiency of modern dialysis and the increased age of the modern patient. In most units dialysate potassium is determined by the choice of acid concentrate: zero potassium is no longer used, and suppliers offer concentrates with potassium between 1 and 4mmol/L.

Removal of accumulated potassium by intermittent haemodialysis inevitably leads to a fluctuating profile of serum potassium with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias at both high and low concentrations. This probably contributes to the clustering of sudden cardiac death around the peridialytic period, and at the end of the weekend gap.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Potassium phosphate [^112D9KpM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyperkalemia

Potassium phosphates injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium [see Contraindications (4)]. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of potassium phosphates injection and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

When administering potassium phosphates injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer potassium phosphates injection and use an alternative source of phosphorus [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

The maximum initial or single dose of potassium phosphates injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium through a peripheral venous catheter is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

Drug Interactions

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

### A systematic review on predictors of postreperfusion hyperkalemia during liver transplantation [^111YUgJv]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In liver transplantation, postreperfusion hyperkalemia occurs within the first five minutes following revascularization and presents the greatest risk, potentially resulting in fatal arrhythmias and postreperfusion syndrome. Consequently, vigilant monitoring and management of potassium levels during this critical period are essential for anesthetic care. This study examined the recipient and donor-related factors that may influence the occurrence of PRHK.

Important findings

Our findings revealed that elevated baseline potassium levels are strongly correlated with the incidence of PRHK. This consistent relationship suggests that monitoring and potentially managing potassium levels preoperatively could be essential in preventing complications related to hyperkalemia. The predictive thresholds identified in this study (4.45 mmol/L and 4–4.5 mmol/L) may serve as important benchmarks for clinicians when evaluating patient risk profiles prior to liver transplantation. In light of these findings, additional strategies have been identified in the literature to address the risks associated with elevated potassium levels during liver transplantation. For example, Wen-Jin Zhang's study showed that administering a bolus of regular insulin during the anhepatic stage effectively prevents PRHK in DCD liver transplant recipients, particularly those with microsteatosis or diffuse swelling. Furthermore, the role of intraoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT) in managing renal dysfunction and its complications, such as hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, has gained attention. Ha Yeon Kim et al. reported that patients with severe renal dysfunction who underwent preoperative continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) did not experience hyperkalemia during the critical period post-reperfusion. This suggests that preoperative CRRT may be a viable strategy for high-risk patients, helping to maintain stable potassium levels and reduce potential complications. On the other hand, studies by Dieter Adelman et al. and SD Baeka et al. indicated that the need for intraoperative RRT may not be as essential as previously believed, with similar rates of hyperkalemia and acidosis observed between patients who required preoperative dialysis and those who did not.

### Sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride (Ringer's) [^116ZfKAt]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

Extraordinary electrolytes losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Solutions containing potassium or calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in the presence of renal disease.

Parenteral calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic container in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements, or the use of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.

### Amiloride hydrochloride [^116SqJof]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Hyperkalemia

Amiloride HCl should not be used in the presence of elevated serum potassium levels (greater than 5.5 mEq per liter).

Antikaliuretic Therapy or Potassium Supplementation

Amiloride HCl should not be given to patients receiving other potassium-conserving agents, such as spironolactone or triamterene. Potassium supplementation in the form of medication, potassium-containing salt substitutes or a potassium-rich diet should not be used with amiloride HCl except in severe and/or refractory cases of hypokalemia. Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels. If potassium supplementation is used, careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary.

Impaired Renal Function

Anuria, acute or chronic renal insufficiency, and evidence of diabetic nephropathy are contraindications to the use of amiloride HCl. Patients with evidence of renal functional impairment (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] levels over 30 mg per 100 mL or serum creatinine levels over 1.5 mg per 100 mL) or diabetes mellitus should not receive the drug without careful, frequent and continuing monitoring of serum electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN levels. Potassium retention associated with the use of an antikaliuretic agent is accentuated in the presence of renal impairment and may result in the rapid development of hyperkalemia.

Hypersensitivity

Amiloride HCl is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product.

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1–5.4)

Guideline 5.1 -Selection of dialysate potassium

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum potassium in the range 4.0–6.0mmol/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to haemolysis) when interpreting levels. [1B]

We suggest choosing dialysate potassium between 1.0 and 3.0mmol/L for the majority of patients, using an individualised approach, in general using the highest dialysate potassium that is sufficient to control pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to managing hyperkalaemia, which may include decreasing dialysate potassium and/or other measures, including dietary advice, medication review and increased dialysis frequency. [2D]

Guideline 5.2 - Selection of dialysate buffer

We recommend an optimal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate in the range 18.0–26.0mmo/L, remembering to consider measurement errors (e.g. due to exposure to air) when interpreting levels. [1C]

We suggest the term 'dialysate buffer' rather than 'dialysate bicarbonate' to avoid confusion arising from differences in manufacturers' terminology. [2C]

We suggest choosing dialysate buffer below or equal to 37.0mEq/L for the majority of patients, using a standardised or individualised approach. [2C]

We suggest a combined approach to abnormal pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate, which may include increasing dialysis dose, oral bicarbonate, nutritional support, or individualising dialysate buffer. [2D]

Guideline 5.3 - Supplementation of dialysate with phosphate

We suggest considering supplementation of the dialysate with phosphate in patients on augmented dialysis schedules. [2D]

Guideline 5.4 - Paediatric dialysate considerations

We recommend individualisation of dialysate electrolyte concentrations, including potassium, buffer and calcium. [1C]

We suggest an individualised dialysate temperature, between core temperature and 0.5°C below, with monitoring of intradialytic core temperature for neonates and smaller children. [2D]

Anticoagulation

We recommend that patients without increased bleeding risk should be given unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin during dialysis to reduce clotting of the extracorporeal system. [1A]

We recommend that systemic anticoagulation should be omitted or minimised in patients with increased bleeding risk. [1C]

We recommend that patients with heparin allergies should be prescribed a non-heparin form of anticoagulation. [1A]

### Effects of hyperkalaemia and non-adherence to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure in Italy: a propensity-matched study [^116oYwEP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Restrictions in RAASi therapy in chronic HF patients who either feature HK or high potassium levels, even if often still in the 'normal range' (i.e. potassium level from 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L), are suggested by current guidelines and observed in real‐world clinical practice; however, questions were raised whether this is justified and appropriate. 16 Indeed, previous results showed that potassium levels or increases in potassium levels during RAASi up‐titration within the relative 'normal' range did not interfere with the beneficial effects of these therapies and was not associated with worse outcomes, 17 being tolerated by patients. On the contrary, previous results from the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) showed that, regardless of the fact that HK did not interfere with the beneficial effects of spironolactone, it was associated with higher mortality rates. 18 This was confirmed by a population‐based, time‐series analysis of health care Canadian databases after RALES publication: spironolactone prescriptions highly increased in HF patients treated with ACEi, leading to a rise by a factor of about three of both the rate of hospital admission involving a diagnosis of HK and the rate of HK associated with in‐hospital death among these patients (P < 0.001). 19 In such a perspective, ESC guidelines recommend to strictly monitor potassium level during RAASi therapy and to lower/discontinue RAASi treatment to minimize risks associated with HK. However, discontinuation or lowering of ACEi/ARB dosages was associated with more adverse outcomes, 7, 15 suggesting that high potassium levels could contribute to severely adverse outcomes. These findings might have implications for clinical practice, suggesting that lowering potassium levels in patients with HK might lead to improved guideline‐directed treatment with ACEi and ARB. These data are important considering the availability of new potassium‐lowering drugs, 20 effective in keeping potassium levels within the normal range. 21, 22 Hence, data on RAASi therapy and HK must be interpreted in the context of the benefits of RAASi with regard to CV mortality, always controlling for elevated potassium. 23, 24, 25

At present, a tenable approach to maintain optimal RAASi dosages together with adequate potassium levels could be a more frequent, periodic, monitoring of serum potassium which is currently poor, 26, 27 along with electrocardiogram, to catch the signs of impending threshold events. Assessment of renal function could also be performed at the same time intervals.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (isolyte S) [^115bFNEa]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

General

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

### Safety and effectiveness of a modification of diet in renal disease equation-based potassium replacement protocol [^116yifvC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

No data exist regarding the safety and effectiveness of a potassium replacement protocol for hospitalized patients when potassium replacement dosing regimens (KRDRs) are adjusted to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease estimation of glomerular filtration rate (MDRD GFR).

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a potassium replacement protocol in which KRDRs are prescribed based on MDRD GFR and serum potassium deficiency (Kdef).

Methods

Patients prescribed the potassium replacement order set were identified in a retrospective fashion. Serum potassium, prescriber-defined goal serum potassium, and MDRD GFR data were collected for patients who received protocol KRDRs. The KRDR to be administered is selected based on Kdef (goal serum potassium minus measured serum potassium) of 0.1–0.2, 0.3–0.5, or more than 0.5 mEq/L and the patients' MDRD GFR of greater than 70, 40–70, or less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (any patient undergoing dialysis is included in the < 40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) group). Efficacy was evaluated by determining the change in serum potassium level (Delta K) following potassium replacement, the number of KRDRs needed to achieve goal serum potassium, and the milliequivalents of potassium needed to achieve goal serum potassium levels. Safety was assessed by the incidence of serum potassium values greater than 5.0 mEq/L following replacement.

Results

One hundred forty-nine patients were evaluated. There were 184 protocol initiations and 257 KRDRs administered to achieve goal serum potassium levels. The DeltaK was 0.50 ± 0.40 mEq/L (mean ± SD) following KRDR. The Delta K was similar between MDRD GFR groups. One hundred thirty six (73.9%) protocol initiations required 1 KRDR, and 168 (91.3%) protocol initiations required 1 or 2 KRDRs to achieve goal serum potassium. Patients whose MDRD GFR was 40–70 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were less likely to achieve goal serum potassium value after 1 KRDR (58.2% vs 79.6% > 70 group and 84.6% < 40 group). This was true regardless of the patient's goal serum potassium. One (0.54%) serum potassium greater than 5.0 mEq/L occurred following a KRDR.

Conclusions

Our potassium replacement protocol based on MDRD GFR and Kdef effectively corrects hypokalemia. Fewer protocol initiations achieved goal serum potassium levels in the group with MDRD GFR 40–70 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Hyperkalemia rarely occurred following KRDR.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^114eKMQW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

DIETARY POTASSIUM INTAKE

Rather than binding potassium after dietary intake, a more direct strategy against hyperkalaemia could be to prescribe a low potassium diet (Figure 1). In patients with a tendency to develop hyperkalaemia, a dietary potassium intake of < 3 g/day (< 77 mmol/day) is recommended. Of note, the general population and patients with CKD already consume a relatively low potassium diet. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of lower and higher dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD (including patients treated with dialysis) on serum potassium and mortality. This review found that a potassium-restricted diet (1295 mg/day) lowered serum potassium by 0.22 mmol/L compared with an unrestricted — but still low potassium — diet (1570 mg/day). Furthermore, a low potassium diet (1670 mg/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard compared with higher dietary potassium intake (4414 mg/day). However, the evidence to support these effects was classified as very low-quality evidence. A small randomized controlled trial analysed the effect of dietary potassium restriction for 2 years on nerve function in patients with CKD Stage G3 or G4. The intervention caused modest but significant reductions in dietary potassium intake (3272 versus 3874 g/day) and serum potassium (4.6 versus 4.8 mmol/L), which was sufficient to improve the total neuropathy score (the primary outcome). This study illustrates that dietary potassium restriction may have benefits beyond lowering serum potassium, although the study had several limitations. At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that higher dietary potassium intake may be beneficial, even for patients with CKD. To date, 11 cohort studies analysed the association between urinary potassium excretion (as a proxy for dietary intake) and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD. Although the majority of these studies showed that a higher urinary potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes or mortality, this was not a consistent finding. To address the possibility of a causal link between dietary potassium depletion and kidney outcomes, we are currently conducting a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial with potassium supplementation in patients with CKD. Higher dietary potassium intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of stroke in subjects without CKD and prevents kidney damage in experimental models of CKD. Because a high potassium diet usually consists of fruits and vegetables, potassium-independent factors such as low animal protein, high-fiber content and an alkaline diet may also play a role. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial showed that both alkali treatment and fruits and vegetables can reduce kidney injury in patients with CKD. To take advantage of these effects, the need for clinical trials comparing a potassium-restricted diet with the combination of a potassium-liberalized diet and potassium binders in patients treated with haemodialysis has recently been emphasized.

Adrenocortical carcinoma — medical control of hypercortisolism and hormone-related symptoms includes ketoconazole or metyrapone (11β-hydroxylase inhibitor), with the latter being much more reliable and immediate; 24-hour urine cortisol can be measured to monitor response; a 'block and replace' approach is emerging; etomidate, a potent 11β-hydroxylase inhibitor, can be used for immediate control at roughly ~1/10 of anesthetic dose, but needs to be given intravenously and administration is most often restricted to intensive care units; mifepristone is another alternative that binds and blocks the glucocorticoid receptor, but cortisol levels cannot be used to monitor adequate drug effect; rising cortisol levels can cause hypertension and hypokalemia via mineralocorticoid receptor activation, often necessitating spironolactone and/or potassium replacement; anti-androgenic therapy can be achieved with spironolactone or flutamide in women with significant hirsutism, abiraterone might emerge as an alternative, and male patients with gynecomastia due to tumor estradiol production are best treated with anti-estrogenic substances (tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitors.

### Dextrose monohydrate, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride (Delflex) [^114vyhsD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Electrolyte, Fluid and Nutrition Imbalances

Peritoneal dialysis may affect a patient's protein, water-soluble vitamin, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and magnesium levels and volume status. Monitor electrolytes and blood chemistry periodically and take appropriate clinical action.

Potassium is omitted from DELFLEX solutions because dialysis may be performed to correct hyperkalemia. In situations where there is a normal serum potassium level or hypokalemia, the addition of potassium chloride (up to a concentration of 4 mEq/L) may be indicated to prevent severe hypokalemia.

To avoid the risk of severe dehydration or hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.

Significant loss of protein, amino acids and water-soluble vitamins may occur during peritoneal dialysis. Replacement therapy should be provided as necessary.

5.2 Peritonitis and Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis

Infectious and aseptic peritonitis has been associated with peritoneal dialysis therapy. Following DELFLEX use, inspect the drained fluid for the presence of fibrin or cloudiness, which may indicate the presence of peritonitis. Improper clamping or priming sequence may result in infusion of air into the peritoneal cavity, which may result in abdominal pain and/or peritonitis. If peritonitis occurs, treat with appropriate therapy.

Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), sometimes fatal, is a complication of peritoneal dialysis therapy.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis

Monitor patients with conditions known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis [e.g., severe hypotension or sepsis that can be associated with acute kidney failure, inborn errors of metabolism, treatment with drugs such as nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)] for lactic acidosis before the start of treatment and during treatment with DELFLEX.

Solutions containing the lactate ion should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Lactate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.

5.4 Over Infusion

Over infusion of peritoneal dialysis solution volume into the peritoneal cavity may be characterized by abdominal distention, feeling of fullness and/or shortness of breath. Drain the peritoneal dialysis solution from the peritoneal cavity to treat over infusion.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^116aq76K]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^113e13U8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the absence of evidence, therapies are often based on intuition, belief, common sense or gut feeling. Over the years, some treatment strategies may become dogmas that are eventually considered as state-of-the-art and not questioned any longer. This might be a reason why there are many examples of "strange" treatments in medical history that have been applied in the absence of evidence and later abandoned for good reasons. In this article, five dogmas relevant to critical care medicine are discussed and reviewed in the light of the available evidence. Dogma #1 relates to the treatment of oliguria with fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors. In this context, it should be considered that oliguria is a symptom rather than a disease. Thus, once hypovolaemia can be excluded as the underlying reason, there is no justification for giving fluids, which may do more harm than good in euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients. Similarly, there is no solid evidence for forcing diuresis by administering vasopressors and loop diuretics. Dogma #2 addresses the treatment of crush syndrome patients with aggressive fluid therapy using NaCl 0.9%. In fact, this treatment may aggravate renal injury by iatrogenic metabolic acidosis and subsequent renal hypoperfusion. Dogma #3 concerns the administration of NaCl 0.9% to patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Since these patients are usually characterised by hyperkalaemia, the potassium-free solution NaCl 0.9%, containing exclusively 154mmol/l of sodium and chloride ions each, is often considered as the fluid of choice. However, large volumes of chloride-rich solutions cause hyperchloraemic acidosis in a dose-dependent manner and induce a potassium shift to the extracellular space, thereby increasing serum potassium levels. Thus, balanced electrolyte solutions are to be preferred in this setting. Dogma #4 relates to the fact that enteral nutrition is often withheld for patients with high residual gastric volume due to the theoretical risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux, potentially resulting in aspiration pneumonitis. Despite controversial discussions, there is no clinical data supporting that residual gastric volume should be generally measured, especially not in patients without a gastro-intestinal surgery and/or motility disorders. Clinical evidence rather suggests that abandoning residual gastric volume monitoring does not increase the incidence of pneumonia, but may benefit patients by facilitating adequate enteral feeding. Finally, dogma #5 is about sedating all mechanically ventilated patients because "fighting" against the respirator may cause insufficient ventilation. This concern needs to be balanced against the unwanted consequences of sedation, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay as well as increased risk of delirium. Modern concepts based on adequate analgesia and moderate to no sedation appear to be more suitable. In conclusion, dogmas are still common in clinical practice. Since science rather than fiction should govern our actions in intensive care medicine, it is important to remain critical and challenge long established concepts, especially when the underlying evidence is weak or non-existing.

### Optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of cardiac transplant candidates: approaches to be considered prior to transplant evaluation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates – 2006 [^116j7bm5]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonists — Aldosterone antagonists should therefore be considered in all candidates for heart transplantation. To minimize the risks of hyperkalemia and renal failure, aldosterone antagonists are generally contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl) or hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/liter). Careful and frequent monitoring of these laboratory evaluations is required after the initiation of an aldosterone antagonist, and then periodically, at least every 1 to 3 months.

ICU protocol implementation — factors determining suitability are organized into elements that favor or impede use, with examples. Favors use of protocol include "Need for frequent monitoring and adjustment", "Easily measured therapeutic goal", "Set process improves outcomes", "Decisions must be made in rapid sequence", "Easy to implement", and "Narrow therapeutic window", with examples "Serum potassium replacement with diuresis", "PTT during heparin administration", "Sterile technique for CVC placement", "Advanced cardiac life support", "Stress gastritis prophylaxis", and "Warfarin dosing" (ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; CVC = central venous catheter; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; PTT = partial thromboplastin time). Impedes use of protocol include "Competing goals of intervention", "Process not clearly associated with improved outcome", "High variability in individual response to therapy", and "Complicated and difficult to implement protocol", with examples "Oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and cardiac function for titrating PEEP in ARDS", "Tight glucose control", "Specific vasopressor use in sepsis", and "The Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) fluid protocol".

Electrolyte imbalances — assessment and monitoring: A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension, including primary or secondary Aldosteronism and other endocrine causes, and a basic metabolic panel should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, ACEi (angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor), ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker), and MRA (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). Common lab disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine. Hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide‑type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium‑sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of CKD. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide‑type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide‑type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia, other than emergency treatment for life‑threatening hyperkalemia, can also be managed with initiation of potassium‑lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid‑day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life‑threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

### Facility variation and predictors of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with heart failure [^115rfyjc]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction but are associated with hyperkalemia. We sought to evaluate the frequency, variation, and predictors associated with serum potassium monitoring in patients with HF initiated on an MRA among facilities in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with HF across 133 Veterans Affairs facilities from 2003 to 2013 who were given a new prescription of an MRA. The primary outcome was the mean percentage of patients per facility with serum potassium monitoring within 14 days of MRA dispensing. Univariate and covariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with monitoring.

Results

There were 142,880 patients identified with HF initiated on an MRA who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean (SD) percentage of patients per facility with serum potassium monitoring within 14 days was 41.6% (standard deviation 8.0%; minimum 18.9%, maximum 56.7%). Facilities with a higher frequency of monitoring were associated with membership in the Council on Teaching Hospitals (n = 70, P < .0001), had academic affiliations (n = 100, P < .0001), and a higher annual volume of patients with HF (≥ 200 patients, P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a large multicenter national sample of patients with HF receiving a new MRA prescription, the frequency of serum potassium monitoring was below recommended guidelines. Academic facilities and those with a higher volume of patients with HF were associated with an increased frequency of monitoring.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^116bkViM]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

A proactive approach to avoid both hyper and hypoglycemia should be taken in emergency laparotomy patients. Pre-operative blood glucose levels should be controlled in a similar range to critical care patients — between 144–180 mg/dL (8–10 mmol/L). Tight control of blood sugar has been relaxed since the first tight glycemic control ICU studies, the incidence of complications appears not to be significantly altered when allowing blood glucose to be 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) but with a reduction in hypoglycemic neurological complications. Most patients will be taking minimal calories by mouth and be receiving intravenous resuscitation and ongoing maintenance fluid with balanced crystalloid infusions which contain no glucose. Hypoglycemia should be treated with an intravenous 50% dextrose bolus and appropriate follow-up dextrose administration, again according to local hospital policy. It is unclear for hyperglycemia, whether a basal-bolus of insulin is beneficial compared with a standard sliding scale in the emergency surgical population. Judicious use of a variable rate insulin infusion (sliding scale) regimen should be utilized according to local hospital policy and attention given to plasma potassium levels that can be lowered by insulin administration. The ongoing management of glucose control is outlined in Part 2 of this Guideline. An HbA1c taken on admission is useful in guiding whether a patient has long-term glycemic control issues and may aid decision making on clinical intervention.

Electrolyte disturbance is common in this group of patients due to high fluid shifts and external losses of body fluids. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia are risk factors for cardiac dysrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation which is particularly common in this patient group due to age and preexisting atrial fibrillation, fluid shifts, electrolyte imbalance and septic shock needing vasopressor infusions. Attempts should be made to correct low potassium, phosphate and magnesium using intravenous repletion with appropriate monitoring and according to local policy to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation.

Recommendations:
Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are risk factors for adverse postoperative outcomes. Pre-operatively, glucose levels should be maintained at 144–180 mg/dL (8–10 mmol/L), a variable rate (sliding scale) insulin infusion should be used judiciously to maintain blood glucose in this range with appropriate monitoring of point of care blood glucose in line with local protocols to avoid hypoglycemia.
Correction of potassium, magnesium and phosphate prior to surgery should be done using the intravenous route with appropriate monitoring and following local hospital policy. However, it should not delay the patient from being taken to the operating room.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^111M2xWy]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Table 3
Biochemical characteristics (Mean ± SD) of DKA episodes treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analog (SC Analog; n = 30) and continuous intravenous regular insulin (IV Insulin; n = 30) during the first 30 hours of management with the same alternative fluid replacement therapy

According to this alternative insulin therapy protocol, SC rapid-acting analog is initiated at a dose of 0.15 U/kg every 2 hours, reducing it to 0.1 U/kg in case the rate of falling of plasma glucose concentrations exceeds 100 mg/dl/hour, until resolution of metabolic acidosis. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, 5% glucose solution will be added to saline solution (1:1) when blood glucose levels are close to 200 mg/dl. Approximately 12 hours after the treatment beginning, when metabolic acidosis is usually under control, intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin is initiated at the dose of 0.6–1 U/kg/day. This higher dose is required to compensate for the insulin resistance determined by DKA, and it will be frequently associated with extra SC 0.1 U/kg doses of rapid-acting analog according to capillary blood glucose monitoring every 3 hours. NPH insulin dose will be lowered to 0.4–0.7 U/kg/day at discharge from hospital.

Oral fluids may be introduced upon improvement of the level of consciousness, nauseas and vomiting. If oral acceptance is not enough to keep blood glucose levels between 90 and 180 mg/dl, an IV fluid solution with 5% glucose will be maintained, so that insulin therapy is not interrupted before the ketogenic process is totally under control. Oral potassium replacement may be maintained based on serum potassium measurements.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Nutrient supplementation and repletion after bariatric surgery — vitamin B1 (thiamine) — include preventive and therapeutic dosing. For prevention, ≥ 12 mg thiamine daily; preferably a 50–100 mg daily dose of thiamine from a B-complex supplement or high-potency multivitamin. Bariatric patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should be treated before or in the absence of laboratory confirmation and monitored/ evaluated for resolution of signs and symptoms. Repletion dosing varies by route: Oral therapy: 100 mg 2–3 times daily until symptoms resolve; IV therapy: 200 mg 3 times daily to 500 mg once or twice daily for 3–5 d, followed by 250 mg/d for 3–5 d or until symptoms resolve, then consider treatment with 100 mg/d orally, indefinitely, or until risk factors have been resolved; IM therapy: 250 mg once daily for 3–5 d or 100–250 mg monthly. Magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus should be given simultaneously to patients at risk for refeeding syndrome.
