## Question

Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about assessing dependence and withdrawal risk. Then, I should verify the level of care and whether inpatient management is indicated. Next, I will consider medication consolidation and switching to a long-acting benzodiazepine. After that, I need to set an individualized taper pace and monitoring plan. Then, I should review adjunctive psychosocial and pharmacologic strategies. I will also examine special populations and protracted withdrawal. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight safety considerations, including what to avoid during tapering.

> Let me first confirm how to assess dependence and withdrawal risk, because this dictates whether a taper is necessary and how conservative I should be. Physical dependence can develop within weeks of regular use, and risk rises with higher doses, longer duration, shorter half-life agents like alprazolam, and co-occurring psychiatric or substance use disorders; I should double-check dose equivalents using diazepam 10 mg as a low-dose anchor and ask about prior withdrawal symptoms or seizures, as these meaningfully increase risk [^cd40a0ea] [^0b2e3ac7] [^c03281aa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient versus inpatient care. I need to check for red flags that mandate a higher level of care: imminent safety risks from continued use, unstable co-occurring medical or psychiatric conditions, or anticipated severe or complicated withdrawal such as seizures or delirium; in these cases, inpatient or residential medically managed withdrawal is recommended, whereas most patients without these risks can taper as outpatients with close follow-up [^f5ebeaff] [^1b6d887d] [^d8d5f308].

> Next, I should review medication consolidation and switching strategies. If a patient is on multiple benzodiazepines, I need to convert to a single agent and consider switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine like diazepam to smooth withdrawal and reduce interdose rebound; wait, let me verify the equivalence and transition pacing — typically one dose at a time over 1–2 weeks with dose adjustments based on response, and I should avoid exceeding about 30 mg diazepam equivalents during the taper to mitigate seizure risk in high-dose users [^58856149] [^f199eac6] [^7767acc8].

> I will now examine taper pacing, and I need to ensure I individualize this. A typical starting point is 5–10% of the total daily dose every 2–4 weeks, not exceeding 25% every 2 weeks; but wait, I should confirm that slower is often better for long-term or high-dose users, and that pausing or slowing the taper is the first response to significant withdrawal symptoms, with some patients requiring months to over a year to complete the process [^4e44418f] [^c9369454] [^97f8227d].

> Let me consider adjunctive psychosocial interventions, because these meaningfully improve outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy, including CBT for insomnia, and brief primary care interventions like prescriber letters or short consultations, increase discontinuation rates at 6–12 months; I should also educate on sleep hygiene, mindfulness, and consider peer support, and I need to ensure I coordinate care with mental health clinicians when anxiety or insomnia were the original indications [^dfa5b63e] [^4e44418f].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite slowing the taper? I should review adjunctive pharmacologic options, keeping in mind the evidence is limited and heterogeneous. Carbamazepine has the most consistent signal for reducing withdrawal severity, pregabalin may reduce withdrawal symptom scores, and tricyclics or paroxetine can help with anxiety during taper, though benefits may not persist; I should confirm that flumazenil is not recommended for tapering due to safety concerns, and that phenobarbital is reserved for inpatient settings with expertise given risks and limited direct evidence for benzodiazepine withdrawal [^950883a2] [^943757d7] [^633ac9be] [^2f11b374].

> I need to ensure I address special populations carefully. In older adults, I should generally favor tapering given elevated risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression, and I should use smaller dose reductions and closer monitoring; in pregnancy, I should balance maternal-fetal risks and coordinate with obstetrics; in patients with co-occurring opioid use disorder, I should stabilize opioid treatment first and avoid abrupt benzodiazepine withdrawal; in correctional settings, I should convert to a long-acting benzodiazepine and taper no faster than 25% per week with linkage to care on release [^44267ac5] [^1292995d] [^8c9c9e68] [^e88cfe18].

> Let me think about protracted withdrawal, because patients often report persistent symptoms for months. I should confirm that gradual tapers may reduce risk, reassure patients that symptoms typically resolve as neuroadaptation occurs, and avoid reinstating benzodiazepines if possible; instead, I can manage residual anxiety, insomnia, or sensory symptoms with non-benzodiazepine medications and continued psychosocial support, and I should schedule follow-up beyond acute withdrawal to monitor for relapse and ongoing symptoms [^208c3813] [^63496ced].

> I should double-check what to avoid during tapering. Abrupt discontinuation can precipitate seizures, delirium, and severe rebound, so I must not stop benzodiazepines suddenly in dependent patients; flumazenil should not be used for tapering due to refractory seizures and arrhythmias; and general anesthetics like propofol or ketamine are not recommended for this purpose outside specialized contexts, so I need to steer clear of these risky approaches [^04109461] [^633ac9be] [^2ddef62a].

> Next, I should review a practical algorithm to keep this organized. First, assess dependence and risk to decide if tapering is indicated; second, choose the care setting with a low threshold for inpatient care in high-risk patients; third, consolidate and switch to a long-acting benzodiazepine if appropriate; fourth, set a 5–10% reduction every 2–4 weeks with built-in flexibility to pause; fifth, monitor at each step for withdrawal and functional impact; sixth, layer psychosocial support and consider adjunctive medications if symptoms impair progress; seventh, plan for protracted symptoms and arrange follow-up after discontinuation [^dd2c3473] [^58856149] [^4e44418f] [^63496ced].

> Finally, I should confirm key safety pearls. I need to check PDMPs to identify duplicate prescriptions and interacting drugs, counsel on hazards of combining with alcohol or opioids, and ensure patients know how to reach me between visits if symptoms flare; if a seizure occurs, I should treat acutely and reconsider the taper pace and whether to add an anticonvulsant, recognizing that some addiction specialists use levetiracetam or carbamazepine for kindling risk, though consensus is limited and discipline-specific [^c03281aa] [^0ca19321].

Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment centers on **gradual dose reduction** to prevent seizures and severe symptoms, with typical tapers of 5–10% every 2–4 weeks and slower rates for high-dose or long-term use [^4e44418f] [^c9369454]. Switching to a **long-acting benzodiazepine** (e.g. diazepam) can smooth withdrawal and improve adherence [^7ffb89fa] [^58856149]. Adjunctive CBT or CBT-I improves success and reduces withdrawal severity [^dfa5b63e] [^ce7f6dae]. For severe or complicated withdrawal (seizures, delirium, or unstable vitals), manage inpatient with close monitoring and consider phenobarbital in expert hands; avoid abrupt discontinuation and flumazenil due to risks [^633ac9be] [^2ddef62a]. Individualize the taper, monitor at each step, and treat residual symptoms with non-benzodiazepine options as needed [^4e44418f] [^63496ced].

## Indications for benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment

Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment is indicated when:

- **Physical dependence**: Likely after regular use ≥ 3 months or shorter courses at high doses [^0b2e3ac7].
- **Risk-benefit imbalance**: Ongoing use poses greater risks than benefits (e.g. falls, cognitive impairment, overdose) [^44267ac5].
- **Patient preference**: The patient desires discontinuation after informed discussion [^0ba6cab8].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

Before initiating withdrawal, perform a comprehensive assessment:

- **Dependence risk**: Dose, duration, frequency, and agent half-life; shorter-acting agents (e.g. alprazolam) increase risk [^cd40a0ea].
- **Withdrawal risk**: History of seizures, delirium, or severe withdrawal; co-medications (e.g. anticonvulsants, antidepressants); psychiatric comorbidities [^0ca19321].
- **Patient factors**: Age, hepatic function, pregnancy, and support system [^1292995d].

---

## Tapering strategies

### General principles

- **Gradual reduction**: Avoid abrupt discontinuation to prevent seizures, delirium, and severe rebound symptoms [^04109461].
- **Individualized pace**: Tailor to tolerance, typically 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; not exceeding 25% every 2 weeks [^4e44418f].
- **Long-acting substitution**: Consider switching to diazepam for smoother tapering and stable plasma levels [^7ffb89fa] [^58856149].

---

### Specific tapering protocols

| **Protocol** | **Description** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard taper | 5–10% reduction every 2–4 weeks | Most patients |
| Slow taper | 2.5–5% reduction every 2–4 weeks | High-dose, long-term use, or severe withdrawal history |
| Rapid taper | 25% reduction weekly for 2–4 weeks, then slow | Urgent indications (e.g. pregnancy, severe adverse effects) |
| Phenobarbital-assisted taper | Inpatient protocol using phenobarbital to substitute and taper | Severe dependence, inpatient setting |

---

## Adjunctive pharmacological interventions

Evidence for adjunctive medications is limited; consider only when withdrawal symptoms persist despite optimized tapering:

- **Carbamazepine**: May reduce withdrawal severity, particularly in high-dose users [^950883a2].
- **Pregabalin**: May alleviate withdrawal symptoms and anxiety [^943757d7].
- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs or SNRIs for coexisting anxiety or depression [^notfound].
- **Gabapentin**: May help with anxiety and insomnia during taper [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Behavioral therapies significantly improve outcomes:

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Reduces withdrawal severity and improves discontinuation rates [^dfa5b63e].
- **CBT for insomnia (CBT-I)**: Addresses sleep disturbances during withdrawal [^dfa5b63e].
- **Mindfulness and relaxation**: Support symptom management and coping [^dfa5b63e].

---

## Management of severe or complicated withdrawal

Severe withdrawal (seizures, delirium, autonomic instability) requires **inpatient care**:

- **Setting**: Inpatient or residential medically managed setting with continuous monitoring [^633ac9be].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Benzodiazepines (preferably long-acting) as first-line; phenobarbital may be considered in expert hands [^633ac9be].
- **Monitoring**: Regular vital signs, seizure risk assessment, and structured withdrawal scales (e.g. CIWA-B) [^633ac9be].

---

## Special populations

- **Older adults**: Generally recommend tapering due to higher risks; use slower tapers and close monitoring [^44267ac5].
- **Pregnant patients**: Avoid abrupt withdrawal; coordinate with obstetrics for individualized planning [^1292995d].
- **Patients with substance use disorders**: Coordinate care, consider residential treatment, and address cross-tolerance [^4fb6cc72].

---

## Post-withdrawal follow-up and relapse prevention

Post-withdrawal care should include **follow-up** to monitor for protracted symptoms and relapse, with **non-benzodiazepine treatments** for residual anxiety, insomnia, or depression. Relapse prevention should incorporate ongoing psychosocial support and patient education [^63496ced].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Gradual taper**: 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; slower for high-dose or long-term use [^4e44418f].
- **Long-acting substitution**: Consider diazepam for smoother tapering [^7ffb89fa].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: CBT/CBT-I and selective pharmacologic adjuncts as needed [^dfa5b63e].
- **Severe withdrawal**: Inpatient management with close monitoring and expert pharmacotherapy [^633ac9be].
- **Individualization**: Tailor to patient factors, comorbidities, and preferences [^c9369454].

---

Benzodiazepine withdrawal treatment requires a **patient-centered, gradual taper** with individualized pacing, long-acting substitution when appropriate, and adjunctive behavioral therapies. Severe withdrawal necessitates inpatient care with expert pharmacotherapy, and ongoing follow-up supports recovery and relapse prevention.

Background

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons. For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence). We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence). The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence). Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence). Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement.

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^ce7f6dae]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

De-prescribing and withdrawal

Professional guidelines recommend treatment withdrawal for most patients on long term benzodiazepines. This usually takes 3 to12 months or longer, often supported by switching to diazepam, a benzodiazepine whose long half life and availability in various strengths allows gradual dose reduction. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effective interventions to support withdrawal, and a recent review failed to identify evidence of sufficient quality to support any pharmacological interventions. Psychosocial interventions may be more promising: cognitive behavioural therapy plus tapering is effective in the short term, and relaxation techniques and individualised GP letters to patients can facilitate withdrawal. However, better evidence is urgently required for both drug and non-drug options.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^450bb661]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — heterogeneity and withdrawal risk indicates that although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper; however, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients, making it not always clear whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal. Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses, and the CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper. It can be helpful for clinicians and patients to discuss what to expect with the taper, how to manage withdrawal symptoms, and how to contact clinicians before the next scheduled visit to help patients feel more confident and in control.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^74f0a401]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — key recommendations state that clinicians should engage in ongoing risk–benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering; clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients; clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal; clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response; and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^ff535a19]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine recommendations: Recommendation V.19: While no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to clinical benefits of their longer duration of action. Recommendation V.20: If waiting for lab test results or if the test are unavailable, if a patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. Recommendation V.21: Clinicians should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression. Recommendation V.22: A benzodiazepine prescription for acute alcohol withdrawal should be discontinued following treatment.

### BAP updated guidelines: evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of substance abuse, harmful use, addiction and comorbidity: recommendations from BAP [^0fef9340]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal of benzodiazepines, BAP 2012 guidelines recommend to offer minimal interventions, such as advisory letters, other information provision, or general practitioner advice in patients with early/mild dependence using benzodiazepines in therapeutic doses.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^3c8690c9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing (conducted by trained personnel) at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring; use front loading while under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication as another option. Prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing in inpatient settings; consider using fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper if symptom-triggered treatment cannot be used.

### Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal… [^44d8cd5b]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are benzodiazepines safe and effective for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Evidence-Based Answer Benzodiazepines are safe and effective for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, particularly for the prevention of withdrawal seizures, although their superiority to anticonvulsants has not been demonstrated convincingly. There is no clear benefit of one benzodiazepine over another or of symptom-triggered versus fixed-dose scheduling. Practice Pointers Benzodiazepines are used widely for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, with the goals of reducing the severity of withdrawal, preventing delirium, and reducing the incidence of seizures. This systematic review identified 57 relevant randomized controlled trials with a total of 4, 275 participants. The quality of the included studies, many of which date from the 1970s and 1980s, was fair, and most were small.

Only nine studies clearly concealed allocation of patients to treatment or control groups, and only 21 adequately described the randomization procedures, although all but three were double-blinded. Not surprisingly, the authors found that benzodiazepines were much more effective than placebo at preventing alcohol withdrawal seizures. However, there was no significant difference in prevention of seizure between benzodiazepines and antiseizure drugs. There also was no difference in control of symptoms among benzodiazepines and other drugs such as clonidine or carbamazepine. There were trends in favor of benzodiazepines, particularly longer-acting drugs, for prevention of delirium. Thirteen studies, with a total of 571 patients, compared different benzodiazepines but found no differences in effectiveness among them.

Only three studies, with a total of 262 patients, compared fixed-dose with symptom-triggered dosing schedules, and no clear conclusions could be drawn. An evidence-based guideline from the American Society of Addiction Medicine 1 recommends benzodiazepines as a first-line agent for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The guideline notes that although agents with a longer duration of action may provide fewer breakthrough symptoms, those with a shorter duration of action, such as lorazepam, may be preferred when there is concern about prolonged sedation. 1.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^34109638]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The new Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering published in this special issue can assist clinicians with overcoming the dilemmas and uncertainties that have hindered benzodiazepine tapering (when clinically appropriate to do so). This guideline was developed through a partnership of experts from 10 professional societies representing a broad spectrum of specialties that are commonly involved in prescribing or supporting tapering of benzodiazepines: family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, geriatrics, addiction medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatric pharmacy, and medical toxicology. The Guideline emphasizes the importance of a patient-centered process with shared decision making and the goal of maximizing benefits while minimizing harm to each person's health and well-being.

The Guideline recommends regular reassessment of each patient, considering both the risks and benefits of ongoing benzodiazepine therapy as well as those associated with benzodiazepine tapering. Tapering is recommended when the overall risks outweigh the benefits of continued benzodiazepine therapy for the individual. The Guideline also notes that clinicians should generally consider tapering of long-term benzodiazepines in older adults, unless there are compelling reasons for continuation. When benzodiazepine tapering is indicated, the Guideline emphasizes the importance of starting low and going slow (e.g. beginning with a 5–10% reduction in total daily dose every 2–4 weeks), monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal or other negative taper-associated effects following each dose reduction, and adjusting the tapering pace based on each patient's response (i.e. as tolerated by an individual patient).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^f74051e8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — managing mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms — "Most patients (but not all) will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper". When symptoms are challenging, "the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10". If those measures are unsuccessful, "clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^dd2c3473]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — determining whether and where to taper outlines an algorithm that begins by asking, "Do the risks of continued prescribing outweigh the benefits?" while noting "Risks associated with BZD tapering should also be considered"; if the patient is not "likely to have physical dependence?", "Discontinuation or a short taper is recommended. Monitor withdrawal symptoms and adjust approach as needed". If "Tapering is recommended", clinicians then assess, "Can the patient be safely treated in an outpatient setting?" to determine care setting.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1b0c01b7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal seizure, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate treatment with a medication effective at preventing another seizure following a withdrawal seizure. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy, preferably a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam. Consider administering phenobarbital as another option but is less preferred than benzodiazepines.

Description

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

Methods

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and clinical consensus process. The process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

Recommendations

Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk-benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering, clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients, clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal, clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response, and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

### Timely and effective outpatient benzodiazepine withdrawal protocol… [^2f11b374]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: The article about benzodiazepine use disorder by Robertson, et al. 1 did not mention the most effective way to wean patients from short-acting benzodiazepines. I successfully have used a rapid taper of phenobarbital over 6 days. Phenobarbital has a duration of action of 80 to 120 hours vs 6 to 8 hours for lorazepam. 2, 3 A 6-day taper of phenobarbital allows patients to immediately discontinue benzodiazepines without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I recommend the following tapering protocol: Days 1 and 2:

64. **8 mg three times daily Days 3 and 4**:
64. **8 mg twice daily Days 5 and 6**:

64. 8 mg at bedtime Using this simple protocol, short-acting benzodiazepines can be safely discontinued. In Reply: Thank you for your suggested approach of prescribing phenobarbital for benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Most published evidence supports the use of phenobarbital for treating alcohol withdrawal in a hospital setting, with only case reports available for its use in benzodiazepine withdrawal. 1, 2 The retrospective observational study referenced in your letter offers valuable insights into the use of phenobarbital for acute detoxification from benzodiazepines in hospitalized patients. 3 On average, these patients were administered phenobarbital, 220 mg daily, stayed in the hospital for 8 days, and underwent treatment for 18 days. In addition, 42% of these patients supplemented their phenobarbital treatment with long-acting benzodiazepines. Although the efficacy and safety profile of phenobarbital for benzodiazepine discontinuation in the hospital setting are promising, it may be premature to extrapolate these findings to an outpatient setting.

Additional studies would be beneficial to determine the safety and efficacy of phenobarbital and establish optimal dosing and weaning protocols in the outpatient setting.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPERING BENZODIAZEPINES

Determining Whether to Taper

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines
Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Tapering is indicated for patients who are likely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Key Takeaways

This Guideline aims to assist clinicians in helping patients who have developed physical dependence safely taper BZDs while minimizing withdrawal symptoms and associated risks. The recommendations in this Guideline address considerations for tapering, level of care, tapering strategies, withdrawal management, and specific patient populations.

Due to the paucity of evidence addressing BZD tapering strategies, the majority of the recommendations in this Guideline are based on clinical consensus. Three recommendation statements are based on low-quality evidence from ten studies (see " Summary of Recommendations ").

The following are ten key takeaways of this Guideline for adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence:
Clinicians should base clinical recommendations regarding continued BZD prescribing on ongoing assessment of the risks and benefits of continued BZD use as well as those of tapering/discontinuation (see Table 2). Tapering is generally indicated when the risks of continuing BZD medication outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should conduct more frequent risk–benefit assessments of continued BZD prescribing for patients who: i. Are concomitantly taking opioid medication ii. Have an SUD iii. Have additional risk factors for adverse effects, such as co-occurring physical conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) or mental health conditions (e.g. bipolar spectrum disorder) Clinicians should use caution if utilizing urine drug screen immunoassays for BZDs due to known limitations. Clinicians should consider the maternal–fetal dyad when assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing in patients who are pregnant. Clinicians should taper BZDs in most older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years) unless there are compelling reasons for continuation.
Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and their care partners utilizing shared decision-making strategies.
Clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms (see Recommendation 2 " Rationale " and associated evidence summary). Physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients(see Table 3).
Although most patients can complete BZD tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when patient presentation indicates significant risk that cannot be safely managed in outpatient care.
Clinicians should design the tapering strategy to minimize harms from both continued BZD use and the tapering process, such as withdrawal symptoms and recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. The initial pace of the BZD taper should generally include dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks. The taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks. Patients who have been taking lower doses for a relatively short period of time (e.g. < 3 months) may be able to taper more quickly. The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the point where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust tapering based on patient response. Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (see Appendix B). Clinicians should monitor patients for the emergence of BZD withdrawal signs and symptoms with each dose reduction. If significant signs or symptoms emerge, the taper should be slowed or paused. Some patients experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even with gradual tapering, and should be offered slower tapering as needed. In some cases, maintaining a patient on a lower dose may be sufficient to reduce the current risks such that they no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering adjunctive psychosocial interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) to support successful tapering (see Recommendation 10 " Rationale" and associated evidence summary).
Clinicians should provide concurrent treatment for any co-occurring physical health conditions and psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, that could interfere with the BZD taper.
Clinicians should employ harm reduction strategies — such as providing opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) to those concomitantly taking opioids or otherwise at risk of opioid overdose, connecting patients to local resources, and providing patient education — based on each individual patient's risks.
It may take months to years to fully taper off BZDs, particularly if patients have been taking a high dose for an extended period of time.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — scope and exclusions states that the Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, including assessing risks and benefits, partnering with patients, level of care, and tapering strategies with withdrawal management. It pertains to patients taking BZDs regularly and at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, and addresses population-specific considerations including co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, SUD, other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients. It is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly, nor to those prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal); non-BZD medications acting on GABA receptors and children and adolescents (i.e., < 18 years old) are beyond the scope.

Management of protracted withdrawal after benzodiazepine (BZD) discontinuation — Some patients may experience protracted symptoms of withdrawal after BZD discontinuation, which may result from a combination of physical and psychological BZD dependence and the neurological effects of BZDs. Longer-term BZD use and use of high-dose, rapid-acting BZDs increase the risk of protracted withdrawal, although these post-acute symptoms can also occur after discontinuation of low-dose BZDs. Protracted symptoms persist beyond the expected elimination of the BZD (e.g., 4–6 weeks), and some patients experience symptoms for months or years; in a convenience sample of 1,200 individuals more than 50% reported feeling dependent when taking benzodiazepines, and a large survey estimated that 54% sought medical services after BZD discontinuation. Although limited research exists, the CCG agreed protracted withdrawal causes significant harms for a subset of patients, and current guidance suggests gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may reduce the risk of protracted withdrawal symptoms.

Introduction

Over 10% of US adults reported past-year prescription benzodiazepine use from 2015–2016, with the prevalence and total volume of prescribing having grown over the prior 2 decades. After opioids, benzodiazepine are the medication most involved in prescription overdose (OD) deaths; by 2020, the US had the highest ever number of benzodiazepine-involved OD deaths. The growth in use and associated harms may account for increased attention from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a 2016 warning related to coprescribing with opioids; a 2020 class-wide boxed warning regarding "the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions"; and an Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline for the Safe Tapering of Benzodiazepines in progress.

The FDA guideline development announcement is focused on reducing long-term benzodiazepine use in a manner that is consistent with expert opinion and professional guidelines, which suggest that short-term or intermittent benzodiazepine use has a more favorable risk-benefit profile. While extensive evidence characterizes the risks associated with benzodiazepine use, no studies have focused explicitly on discontinuation risks. Conventional wisdom might suggest benzodiazepine discontinuation would reduce risk of adverse events, yet this has not been the case with long-term prescription opioid discontinuation. In fact, cessation of treatment may be particularly fraught for benzodiazepine: psychologically, because many patients find the prospect of discontinuation distressing, and physiologically, because of physical dependence and the potential for withdrawal, including seizures.

To inform benzodiazepine policy and guidelines, we sought to determine the cumulative risks or benefits associated with benzodiazepine discontinuation. We did so using an emulated target trial approach in national claims databy identifying a population of patients receiving stable long-term benzodiazepine treatment and estimating the association of discontinuation with all-cause mortality and other potential associated harms. Given the increased mortality associated with coprescribed opioids and benzodiazepine, we stratified analysis by opioid use to inform decision-making for patients coprescribed opioids. We hypothesized that prescription benzodiazepine discontinuation would be associated with reduced risk of mortality and other adverse events.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^99e8c1a6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine characteristics, tapering, accumulation, and hepatic considerations: Benzodiazepines are commonly recommended as first-line agents for managing most forms of alcohol withdrawal, and diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide are the most frequently used in treating alcohol withdrawal. While there is no evidence to show superiority of effectiveness or adverse effects among benzodiazepines, slower-acting agents with long half-lives can be considered preferred in clinical practice, helping provide a smoother course of withdrawal, greater control of breakthrough and rebound signs or symptoms, and greater coverage for preventing breakthrough withdrawal seizures and delirium. For patients on shorter-acting agents, a more gradual taper and more frequent reassessment are advised. Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health; other signs of accumulation include ataxia, confusion, memory impairment, and delirium, and benzodiazepine-associated delirium has been diagnosed by the administration of flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, though this protocol was not reviewed by the Guideline Committee. Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function, and in such cases the dose can be reduced or an agent with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used; laboratory tests can help indicate the need to adjust the treatment plan, but treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the treatment setting.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^7e47ba94]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine-based management emphasizes that benzodiazepines are the preferred agent for treating alcohol withdrawal, and long-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents, with adequate treatment with a long-acting benzodiazepine effective in preventing withdrawal seizures. Patients with CIWA-Ar scores < 10 and who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal may be provided supportive care alone and monitored, and it is also appropriate to use benzodiazepines prophylactically for alcohol withdrawal. Patients with CIWA-Ar scores > 10 and patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy and supportive care. Front loading is recommended for patients at risk for severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar ≥ 21), and diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are preferred agents for front loading; in jail settings, front loading, fixed dosing, and symptom-triggered dosing are all appropriate and may be used in combination. The patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored regardless of the dosing schedule used, qualified health care staff should monitor for signs of oversedation and respiratory depression, if symptoms are not controlled as expected with the prescribed dose the provider should consider increasing the dose, and benzodiazepines used to treat alcohol withdrawal should be tapered and discontinued following treatment.

Alcohol withdrawal medications note that long-acting benzodiazepines are the most commonly used medications for treating alcohol withdrawal, with dosing approaches including front loading, fixed, and symptom-triggered; symptom severity will help determine the most appropriate dosing regimen, which may be adjusted during the course of treatment, and many jails routinely give one or two doses of benzodiazepine prophylactically (under protocols, with patient-specific orders) to patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal as a low-risk, low-cost, effective preventive measure.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^b8bf4ea2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal delirium — benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy and dosing: patients should be sedated to achieve and maintain a light somnolence and benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line agents. When available, medication should be administered intravenously; intermittent IV administration of long- and short-acting medications is acceptable and effective, while continuous IV infusion is considerably more expensive and there is no evidence of therapeutic superiority. Patients receiving repeated high intravenous doses of lorazepam or diazepam should be monitored closely for signs of hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis. When treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, use an established dosing protocol as a guide but individualize dosing; intravenous symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading is appropriate, and once light somnolence is achieved and patients are calm and cooperative, or if IV medication is not available, shifting to oral symptom-triggered treatment is recommended. Very large doses of benzodiazepines may be needed to control agitation; clinicians should not hesitate to provide such large doses but should keep in mind the possible risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression, and when large doses are used there is risk of accumulation of long-acting benzodiazepine metabolites, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function or the elderly, who should be monitored closely.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^066335da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

3 If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Recommendation for Partnering with Patients
4 Clinicians should develop the BZD tapering strategy in coordination with patients and their care partners in a shared decision-making process whenever possible (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendation for Level of Care Considerations
5 BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings. However, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when: a Patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use of the BZD medication (e.g. medication interaction, overdose, accidents, falls, suicidality or other self-harm) that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) b Patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) c The patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

### Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal [^41b9857c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a cluster of symptoms that occurs in alcohol-dependent people after cessation or reduction in alcohol use. This systematic review focuses on the evidence of benzodiazepines' use in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004) and EU-PSI PSI-Tri database with no language and publication restrictions. We also screened references of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness and safety of a benzodiazepine in comparison with a placebo or other pharmacological intervention or other benzodiazepine were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Fifty-seven trials, with a total of 4,051 people were included. Despite the considerable number of randomized controlled trials, there was a very large variety of outcomes and of different rating scales and relatively limited quantitative synthesis of data was feasible. Benzodiazepines offered a large benefit against alcohol withdrawal seizures compared to placebo (relative risk [RR] 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 to 0.69; p = 0.01). Benzodiazepines had similar success rates as other drugs (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12) or anticonvulsants in particular (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16) and offered a significant benefit for seizure control against non-anticonvulsants (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.75; p = 0.02), but not against anticonvulsants (RR 1.99; 95% CI 0.46 to 8.65). Changes in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scores at the end of treatment were similar with benzodiazepines versus other drugs, although some small studies showed isolated significant differences for other, less commonly, used scales. Data on other comparisons were very limited, thus making quantitative synthesis for various outcomes not very informative.

Authors' Conclusions

Benzodiazepines are effective against alcohol withdrawal symptoms, in particular seizures, when compared to placebo. It is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the relative effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines against other drugs in alcohol withdrawal, because of the large heterogeneity of the trials both in interventions and assessment of outcomes but the available data do not show prominent differences between benzodiazepines and other drugs in success rates.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^11d61aae]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis — preventative pharmacotherapy states that for patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal, preventative pharmacotherapy should be provided, and benzodiazepines are first-line treatment. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital can be used by providers experienced with its use, and in settings with close monitoring, phenobarbital adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome, and providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk not experiencing significant signs or symptoms but have a history of severe or complicated withdrawal, an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness, severe coronary artery disease, or displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^2ddef62a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Management of severe or complicated benzodiazepine withdrawal — clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings with monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), and assessments for seizure risk, managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Weak Recommendation) and should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), and clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score ≥ 19). Administer phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in a setting with close monitoring. Consider administering other adjunct medications after ensuring that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines has been administered.

Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms

Recommendations for Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms
12 Clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g. residential withdrawal management program) with: a Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation) b Assessments for seizure risk and managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

13 Tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital: a Can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
14 Clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so.
When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. Clinicians should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

Rationale

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^e88cfe18]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal medications — pharmacotherapy with a long-acting benzodiazepine is used to stabilize withdrawal symptoms before slowly tapering by 10–25 percent per week, and tapering should be no more rapid than 25 percent per week; in circumstances where initial tapering requires unusually high doses of benzodiazepines, providers may consider transferring the patient to a hospital with expertise in sedative withdrawal. Tapers extending beyond the time of custody will require a prescription for the long-acting benzodiazepine initiated for tapering, as well as linkage to ongoing care at the time of release.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^8c9c9e68]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long-term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team, as appropriate. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. As emphasized in an FDA advisory, buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system. Whereas the combined use of these medications increases risks, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks.

If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine therapy at current dosages, decisions about tapering medications (e.g. whether to taper opioids first, taper benzodiazepines first, or consider carefully transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine before tapering benzodiazepines) should be individualized and reevaluated over time. Considerations include patient priorities, the patient's clinical considerations, the patient's response to therapeutic changes, consultation with other clinicians managing the patient's care, and, consultation with other specialists (e.g. an addiction specialist) if needed. Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. Tapering rates should be individualized. Examples of benzodiazepine tapers and tips for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal are available. Cognitive behavioral therapy increases tapering success rates and might be particularly helpful for patients struggling with a benzodiazepine taper. If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered. Clinicians should communicate with mental health professionals managing the patient to discuss the patient's needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

Recommendation 12

Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).

### Review of withdrawal catatonia: what does this reveal about clozapine? [^926fa321]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for withdrawal catatonia

The 24 cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia identified presented in a nearly identical fashion to "typical" cases of catatonia previously described in the literature in regard to both symptoms and treatment response. We would therefore suggest following pre-established guidelines for the treatment of catatonia when encountering a case of benzodiazepine withdrawal catatonia, including using lorazepam as the medication of choice. The use of antipsychotic medications with high D2 receptor antagonism, such as typical antipsychotics, should be avoided. If lorazepam is not effective or if the patient is experiencing high fevers or is medically compromised, ECT should be considered. Conservative measures such as ensuring adequate hydration and being mindful of falls risk due to the use of sedating medication are essential as well.

As clozapine withdrawal catatonia has not been widely studied in the past, treatment suggestions are based on the accumulation of data from this literature review. Based on our findings, we would suggest the first-line treatment for clozapine withdrawal catatonia be early recognition and reinstitution of clozapine. Clinical guidelines recommend that when more than 2 days of clozapine treatment have been missed, clozapine should be re-started at a dose of 12.5−25 mg and increased slowly by 25−50 mg daily over 1−2 weeks until a therapeutic dose is reached. The purpose of the slow taper is to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects including orthostatic hypotension and seizures. There is however emerging evidence that rapid titration of clozapine using a higher starting dose and increasing by up to 100 mg daily is safe and provides faster resolution of psychotic symptoms. We speculate that an early and fast titration of clozapine would also result in a reduction of the duration of symptoms in clozapine withdrawal catatonia. A rapid inpatient titration with close monitoring should therefore be considered in cases where there are no pre-existing conditions that predispose an individual to experience adverse effects, such as old age, cardiac disease, or seizure disorder.

In addition to reinstitution of clozapine, the use of adjunct benzodiazepines can be considered, but are unlikely to be effective if used as a monotherapy. Sometimes reinstitution of clozapine is not possible due to various factors including drug intolerance or clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. When clozapine reinstitution is not possible, we would suggest the use of ECT. Consideration of conservative measures such as those described above are even more important in the treatment of clozapine withdrawal catatonia due to its association with autonomic instability and its prolonged course.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^f5ebeaff]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Rationale and service options for benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — BZD tapering can typically be accomplished in outpatient settings, and although no direct evidence was found regarding level of care decisions for BZD tapering, the CCG agreed that most patients can undergo tapering in outpatient settings. In the systematic review, 42 of the 57 studies included were conducted in outpatient settings, and the level of care options for many patients may be limited to outpatient or inpatient settings or, in rare instances, skilled nursing facilities. Patients with suspected or confirmed SUD or other psychiatric disorders may require additional support, especially if they have had previous unsuccessful attempts to taper from BZDs, and these patients may be eligible for intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization programs, and residential care within the specialty addiction and mental health treatment systems. Clinicians should consider inpatient settings if patient presentation indicates an immediate risk of serious harm related to continued BZD use, including recent falls, motor vehicle accidents, or overdose related to BZD use or acute suicidality or self-harm behaviors; clinicians should also consider inpatient care for patients with significant and unstable co-occurring physical or mental health conditions that cannot be managed safely in outpatient settings, and inpatient care is generally indicated if patients are experiencing or anticipated to experience severe or complicated withdrawal; a history of complicated withdrawal involving seizure or delirium is a significant predictor of future complications, and patients with a history of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal may be more likely to have more severe BZD withdrawal due to cross-tolerance.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^5f2c9a4a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — pharmacotherapy prophylaxis (Recommendations IV.13 and IV.14) notes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or concomitant alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal, and such patients should be provided with preventative pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment because of their well-documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in Level 2-WM settings for providers experienced with its use; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital (in Level 2-WM settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate options. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk who have: a history of severe or complicated withdrawal; an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness; severe coronary artery disease; displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^886bddd6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As we saw after the release of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain in 2016, Guidelines can have unintended consequences. There may be a large population of patients for whom benzodiazepine tapering is indicated. Clinicians should prioritize those who are at the highest risk of harm. Benzodiazepine medications should not be abruptly discontinued in patients who are physically dependent. Alternative strategies for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal risk (e.g. tapering with very long-acting agents) may be used when there are compelling reasons for more rapid taper or discontinuation and are also discussed in the Guideline. This Guideline should not be used as a reason to abandon patients who require a benzodiazepine taper or continued long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

While considerations for initiating benzodiazepine were outside of the scope of this Guideline, it is clear we need to think carefully about when to start these medications and particularly when to continue with subsequent prescriptions. It is critical that we educate patients on these risks at the outset to support truly informed consent.

Outpatient taper management — algorithm directs clinicians first to ask, "Would the patient benefit from transitioning to a longer-acting BZD?", and if yes to "Transition to longer-acting BZD" by "Estimate equivalent dose", "Transition one dose at a time, over 1–2 weeks", and "Adjust dose based on patient response"; otherwise "Determine initial dose reduction", with "Typical initial dose reduction: 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; Generally not more than 25% every 2 weeks", then "Monitor withdrawal symptoms", use the branch "No or mild withdrawal symptoms" to "Consider similar pace for next dose reduction", and employ supportive steps including "Offer adjunctive interventions/medications as appropriate", "Consider switching to a longer-acting BZD", "Consider maintaining on lower dose if further dose reductions are not tolerated", and "If paused, consider slower taper when ready to resume", while ensuring to "Engage in shared decision making process with the patient (and care partner[s]) whenever possible".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^f199eac6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

ASAM benzodiazepine dosing regimens — at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring (e.g. Level 2–WM), symptom-triggered treatment conducted by trained staff is the preferred benzodiazepine dosing method, with front loading under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication also appropriate. At settings without extended on-site monitoring (Level 1–WM), symptom-triggered dosing is appropriate if patients or a caregiver can reliably monitor signs and symptoms with a withdrawal severity scale and follow dosing guidance.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^51c46185]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Sedative withdrawal recommendations — treatment should not be delayed based on the potential timeline for release, and patients who have been taking sedatives should be converted to an equivalent dose of long-acting benzodiazepine, with clonazepam described as having a long half-life, being well-tolerated and easy to administer, and as the preferred medication for treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal for most patients. Dose equivalencies for clonazepam will not hold for all patients and must be individualized according to the patient's response, and adequate dosing of clonazepam will control sedative withdrawal symptoms including increased heart rate, sweating, and hand tremor. Benzodiazepines should be tapered over a period of weeks or months with taper duration based on agent of choice, dose, frequency and duration of use, comorbid physical or mental health conditions, and treatment setting; in patients who are not hospitalized, the medication should not be tapered any more rapidly than 25 percent per week, and as the taper nears the end it may be necessary to taper more slowly if anxiety or insomnia develop, with these symptoms continuing for many months, and comorbid conditions should be monitored throughout withdrawal to inform the taper schedule. If withdrawal symptoms increase, medication dosage should be stabilized or even increased for a period of days, and signs and symptoms of sedative withdrawal may last beyond the period of acute withdrawal, may take months or years to resolve, and should be treated with evidence-based interventions. If the patient is experiencing both sedative and opioid withdrawal, provide methadone or buprenorphine to stabilize withdrawal from opioids before tapering the dose of the sedative, and if the patient has been using multiple sedative substances or a sedative and alcohol, withdrawal should be handled by using an equivalent or longer-acting agent than the longest-acting agent used by the patient.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating preventative pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting (at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal) for patients at risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy to reduce the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Administer phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) as an alternative option. Administer phenobarbital or transfer patients to a more intensive level of care if benzodiazepines are contraindicated.

Recommendations for the Tapering Process
6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Adjunctive Interventions
10 Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation).
11 Clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper (e.g. sleep difficulty, anxiety). However, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Recommendations for Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms

12 Clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g. residential withdrawal management program) with:

Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
Assessments for seizure risk, managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

13 Tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital: a Can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

14 Clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1b6d887d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient benzodiazepine withdrawal management — indications and focus: Clinicians should consider inpatient BZD withdrawal management when patients are at imminent risk of significant harm from continued BZD use that is unlikely to be mitigated rapidly by the taper's initial dose reduction, patients have co-occurring physical or mental health conditions that makes BZD tapering unsafe in outpatient settings, or patients are experiencing or imminently expected to experience severe or complicated withdrawal. As with any tapering plan, BZD tapering in inpatient settings should focus on providing supportive care and managing and minimizing withdrawal symptoms and co-occurring conditions, as appropriate, and patients who initiate BZD tapering in inpatient or residential medically managed settings may complete their taper in outpatient settings if appropriate.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine mono-dependence management in outpatient settings [^950883a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The improved safety profile of benzodiazepines compared to barbiturates has contributed to a high rate of prescription since the seventies. Although benzodiazepines are highly effective for some disorders, they are potentially addictive drugs and they can provide reinforcement in some individuals.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine mono-dependence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group' Register of Trials (October 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2004), EMBASE (January 1988 to October 2004), PsycInfo (1985 to October 2004), CINAHL (1982 to October 2004), Pascal, Toxibase, reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of benzodiazepines dependence management regardless of type, dose (daily and total) and duration of benzodiazepine treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 458 participants were included. The studies included could not be analysed cumulatively because of heterogeneity of inteventions and participants' characteristics. Results support the policy of gradual rather than abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepine. Progressive withdrawal (over 10 weeks) appeared preferable if compared to abrupt since the number of drop-outs was less important and the procedure judged more favourable by the participants. Short half-life benzodiazepine, associated with higher drop-out rates, did not have higher withdrawal symptoms scores. Switching from short half-life benzodiazepine to long half-life benzodiazepine before gradual taper withdrawal did not receive much support from this review. The role of propanolol in benzodiazepine withdrawal was unclear; adding tricyclic antidepressant (dothiepin) decreased the intensity of withdrawal symptoms but did not increase the rate of benzodiazepine abstinence at the end of the trial. Buspirone and Progesterone failed to suppress any benzodiazepine symptoms. Carbamazepine might have promise as an adjunctive medication for benzodiazepine withdrawal, particularly in patients receiving benzodiazepines in daily dosages of 20 mg/d or more of diazepam (or equivalents).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this systematic review point to the potential value of carbamazepine as an effective intervention for benzodiazepine gradual taper discontinuation. Carbamazepine has shown rather modest benefit in reducing withdrawal severity, although it did significantly improve drug-free outcome. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm these benefits, to assess adverse effects and to identify when its clinical use might be most indicated. Other suggested treatment approaches to benzodiazepine discontinuation management should be explored (antidepressants, benzodiazepine receptors modulator).

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^3b6ec905]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to emphasize that physical (or physiological) dependence is distinct from a benzodiazepine use disorder (BUD). Nearly all patients who take benzodiazepines daily or near daily for a prolonged period (ie, more than a month) will develop physical dependence, which manifests in tolerance and risk for withdrawal when the medication is stopped, or the dose is reduced. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can manifest with a wide array of symptoms that can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from recurrence of the condition for which the medication was originally prescribed. It is important for clinicians and patients to be aware of the heterogeneous presentations of benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including protracted withdrawal, and not to minimize or dismiss the concerns of patients who are experiencing less-common symptoms.

It is estimated that only 1.5% of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines develop a BUD, and patients with BUD typically need additional services and support during benzodiazepine tapering. Clinicians should consider referring patients with BUD to a qualified addiction treatment provider so that benzodiazepine tapering can be managed by or in coordination with the specialty team.

It is critical for clinicians to demonstrate and maintain compassion and understanding throughout the tapering process, starting during the initial conversations with patients about tapering the medication. Patients often need reassurance from their clinicians and to know they will be supported and listened to throughout the process. Clinicians and patients should expect that patients will provide input on and, when appropriate, influence the tapering strategy.

Benzodiazepine tapering is challenging for physicians and advanced practice providers across specialties. However, as most benzodiazepines are prescribed in primary care settings, this guideline is particularly important for family medicine and internal medicine clinicians. A number of resources have been developed to help clinicians implement the recommendations in the Guideline, including continuing medical education, clinician and patient pocket guides and handouts, and downloadable clinical tools such as a benzodiazepine dose equivalents and decision flow charts.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^2b5ea257]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper. However, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients. As a result, determining whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal is not always clear (see Table 3). Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. One of the most significant challenges the CGC faced in writing this Guideline was developing tapering recommendations that apply broadly in the context of this patient heterogeneity. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses.

The CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper, particularly given the heterogeneity in responses to BZD tapering. It is important to educate patients on what to do if they experience concerning symptoms and how to contact their clinicians, if necessary, before the next scheduled visit. This can help patients feel more confident and in control of a process that is often associated with some level of apprehension.

Prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers, if applicable, and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions that may be impacted by the taper. In addition, clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper (see Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents). A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation.

Tapering Versus Discontinuation

If the clinician determines, in the context of the risk/benefit assessment and shared decision-making, continuing the BZD prescription is no longer appropriate, they need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal. The risk of severe withdrawal syndrome following regular use of therapeutic doses of BZD has been recognized since the 1960 s. Factors including use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment contribute to a higher likelihood of physical dependence and risk of severe withdrawal.

If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued. While limited evidence was found comparing tapering strategies, the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation. Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias. Although labeled "gradual", the taper duration was only 7–8 days. There was no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion between groups. However, patients in the tapering group reported significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks, compared to patients who abruptly stopped their BZD use. In discussing these studies, the CGC agreed that benefits of tapering are likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies. See Table 1 in Supplementary Material 5 for the full Evidence to Decision Table comprising these studies.

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

### Agonist substitution – a treatment alternative for high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent patients? [^5e3f888f]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

There is vast evidence for the superiority of agonist treatments (methadone, buprenorphine) over a withdrawal approach in opioid-dependent populations. Little research, however, has been conducted on the same approach for the treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence. Even large-scale reviews and meta-analyses discussing treatment strategies for benzodiazepine-dependent patients focus solely upon approaches that aim at achieving abstinence, namely on complete BZD withdrawal. While the types of interventions differ (e.g. gradual benzodiazepine taper with a long or a short half-life benzodiazepine, switching to non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics or prescribing adjunctive medications such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants on an in- or out-patient basis), the common aim of treatment still is total abstinence from benzodiazepines. However, the majority of patients suffering from high-dose BZD dependence do not succeed with long-term abstinence, irrespective of the procedure, and clinicians have been using BZD 'substitution' treatment in such cases for decades. Therefore, we suggest the evaluation of a substitution approach in this group, consisting of maintenance treatment with a slow-onset, long-acting BZD. Advantages of such a procedure may be improved health, less craving, fewer withdrawal complications, reduced anxiety, increased treatment retention, improvements in social functioning and less illegal activity. Cognitive impairments, the most problematic side effects of substitution treatment with benzodiazepines, could possibly be minimized by using an optimal agonist.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^97f8227d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^cd40a0ea]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk and determining physical dependence: when discontinuation is appropriate, clinicians "need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal". The risk of severe withdrawal has "been recognized since the 1960 s", and factors increasing risk include "use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment". Many patients using BZDs for a short time "(e.g., less than a month)" may stop without withdrawal, but those using low doses for an intermediate time "(e.g., 6 weeks)" may not be dependent. For alprazolam, which has "a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites", dependence can occur more rapidly; therefore, "a taper may be appropriate" even for daily use of short duration "(e.g., 2–4 weeks)". If dependence is uncertain, clinicians "should elicit information from patients" about concerns and preferences, and strict thresholds are difficult because risk is influenced by multiple patient and drug factors.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^ba26f6b6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — benzodiazepine front loading — describes front loading as administering a moderate to high dose of a long-acting benzodiazepine to rapidly control withdrawal, noting diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are the preferred agents and that this approach is typically used in patients at risk for or experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 19). The guideline states front loading has been shown to reduce the duration of treatment, incidence of withdrawal seizure, and duration of delirium, and that a front-loading regimen can follow a fixed schedule such as 20 mg diazepam PO every 2 hours for 3 doses. It advises clinicians should monitor patients closely during treatment and, if the CIWA-Ar is used with short acting benzodiazepines, assessments should be done promptly in order to prevent seizures due to protocol errors.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process

Recommendations for Adjunctive Interventions
10 Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions (e.g. CBT, CBT-I) or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation).
11 Clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper (e.g. sleep difficulty, anxiety), although clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Clinicians should educate patients on lifestyle factors that could support BZD tapering (e.g. sleep hygiene, physical activity as appropriate to ability).
Clinicians can consider other evidence-based approaches such as mindfulness-based interventions.
Clinicians can consider referring patients to peer specialist services for support during the taper.

Rationale

Adjunctive Psychosocial Interventions

A systematic review which found gradual tapering supported by adjunctive psychosocial interventions was more effective than gradual tapering alone. Psychosocial interventions encompass evidence-based behavioral interventions (e.g. CBT, CBT-I; see Appendix 4 for a summary of adjunctive psychosocial interventions). In addition, patients may find approaches tailored to withdrawal-related symptoms helpful (e.g. sleep hygiene for withdrawal-related sleep difficulties, evidence-based mindfulness practices). Some patients may also benefit from peer specialist services when experiencing challenges with tapering. The CGC recommends that clinicians offer adjunctive psychosocial interventions to patients tapering BZDs, especially those whose daily functioning has been negatively impacted by withdrawal symptoms.

A Cochrane review by Darker et al.found moderate-quality evidence that patients were more likely to have successfully discontinued BZDs at 1 month and 3 months post-treatment when they received CBT during the tapering process. Although CBT has the most evidence, other behavioral interventions that have been studied include MI, direct-to-consumer educational interventions (e.g. letters and booklets mailed to patients), relaxation therapy, and counseling via telemedicine. A recent meta-analysis by Lynch et al.showed a significantly higher rate of BZD discontinuation at 6 months and 12 months among patients who received a brief intervention delivered in primary care (e.g. short consultation with prescribers, letters from prescribers recommending discontinuation) compared to those receiving usual care, with risk ratios of 2.73 and 3.41, respectively, favoring the intervention. See Table 10 in Appendix 5 for the full Evidence to Decision table on CBT.

Managing Mild to Moderate Withdrawal Symptoms

Many patients will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper. If patients experience challenging symptoms, the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10. If pausing or slowing the taper has not been successful, clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions (see "Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process").

Assessing and Managing Seizure Risk

Clinicians should pay particular attention to ascertaining if patients have experienced seizures in the past, as such a history can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. Clinicians should also conduct a thorough medication review, as medications that lower the seizure threshold can increase the risk of BZD withdrawal seizures. PDMPs can help detect multiple BZD prescriptions and concurrent prescriptions of controlled medications that lower the seizure threshold. If seizure risk is identified, clinicians can consider a slower taper rate and should have a clear plan for how to address a seizure if it does occur, including the immediate response with appropriate medication.

The CGC noted that clinicians from various medical subspecialties differ in their management of seizure risk. Addiction medicine specialists commonly use adjunctive pharmacotherapies (e.g. levetiracetam, carbamazepine) to prevent seizures in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal who have a history of withdrawal-related seizures. In these instances, addiction medicine clinicians are particularly concerned about the phenomenon of increasing seizure severity with repeated episodes of withdrawal (i.e. kindling). However, neurologists generally do not treat seizure risk prophylactically. As such, the CGC did not come to consensus on management of seizure risk in patients experiencing BZD withdrawal. The CGC recommends that clinicians manage seizures and seizure risk according to current standards of care, which may differ across disciplines.

### Treatment of medication overuse headache – guideline of the EFNS headache panel [^f04ec02e]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Medication overuse headache is a common condition with a population-based prevalence of more than 1–2%. Treatment is based on education, withdrawal treatment (detoxification), and prophylactic treatment. It also includes management of withdrawal headache.

Aims

This guideline aims to give treatment recommendations for this headache.

Materials and Methods

Evaluation of the scientific literature.

Results

Abrupt withdrawal or tapering down of overused medication is recommended, the type of withdrawal therapy is probably not relevant for the outcome of the patient. However, inpatient withdrawal therapy is recommended for patients overusing opioids, benzodiazepine, or barbiturates. It is further recommended to start individualized prophylactic drug treatment at the first day of withdrawal therapy or even before. The only drug with moderate evidence for the prophylactic treatment in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse is topiramate up to 200mg. Corticosteroids (at least 60mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50mg) are possibly effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Patients after withdrawal therapy should be followed up regularly to prevent relapse of medication overuse.

Discussion and Conclusion

Medication overuse headache can be treated according to evidence-based recommendations.

### Tapering patients off of benzodiazepines… [^e1112135]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

HOW TO TAPER Abruptly discontinuing benzodiazepines after a patient has been taking them daily for more than one month is potentially dangerous; withdrawal can be severe or even life-threatening. Taper schedules should be individualized, considering factors such as lifestyle, personality, environmental stressors, reasons for taking benzodiazepines, and amount of available personal and clinical support. Because anticipatory anxiety is often related to withdrawal, benzodiazepines are commonly tapered slowly, with psychological support emphasized during the process to help patients learn alternative coping skills. 5 whereas others recommend a fairly rapid schedule, with the option to slow down if withdrawal symptoms become unmanageable. 8 For some patients, tapers longer than six months may lead to too much focus on the taper process, causing further anxiety and possible worsening of long-term outcomes.

6, 8 Still, other patients may do much better with slower, longer tapers. Even benzodiazepine tapers lasting one to two years can be successful. There are three basic approaches to a benzodiazepine taper: use the same medication for tapering; switch to a longer-acting equivalent; and use adjunctive medications to help mitigate potential withdrawal symptoms. The dosage reduction mainly depends on the starting dose and whether the patient is tapering as an inpatient or outpatient. For safety reasons, outpatient tapers usually need to be slower than inpatient tapers. Patients taking higher dosages of benzodiazepines can usually tolerate larger reductions than those taking lower dosages. Supratherapeutic doses can initially be reduced by 25% to 30%, then further reduced by 5% to 10% daily, weekly, or monthly as appropriate, based on how well the patient tolerates withdrawal symptoms during the taper. Addition of an anticonvulsant should be considered for high-dosage withdrawal. Studies have shown that adjunctive medications, such as carbamazepine, imipramine, divalproex, and trazodone, can mitigate some of the withdrawal discomfort. 6 Use of antidepressants, such as duloxetine or amitriptyline, may help patients with chronic pain. Switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine equivalent may allow for a smoother taper experience. 5, 6, 8.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^e8e5d907]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^0ba6cab8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians often do not discuss tapering with patients and continue renewing prescriptions because of concern for withdrawal, as well as patients' perception of benefits. Clinicians may feel uncomfortable starting these conversations due to the perceived sensitivity and difficulty of the topic. However, many patients indicate they would be open to considering tapering chronic medications, including BZDs, if clinicians discussed it with them.

In addition to discussing the risks and benefits of BZD use, clinicians should acknowledge and discuss the risks and benefits associated with BZD tapering or discontinuation. Patients can experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms with abrupt or rapid discontinuation of BZDs, and some patients experience significant symptoms even with gradual dose reduction. As such, it is important for clinicians to adopt a patient-centered approach when considering BZD tapering, acknowledging patient concerns and engaging in a shared decision-making process. Engaging patients in discussions about their BZD use serves two important purposes:
Clinicians are presented with opportunities to educate patients on the risks and benefits of BZD use, alternative pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options to manage the condition for which they are taking BZDs, and the tapering process. Discussions on tapering should prepare patients for what they can expect during the process, including potential withdrawal symptoms and how they will be managed.
Patients are presented with opportunities to help clinicians understand how their BZD use impacts them, as well as their treatment goals and preferences. This insight into each patient's experience with BZDs can help inform clinicians' education efforts for a given individual. These discussions can empower patients to be active participants in their health care by sharing valuable information to help their clinicians better tailor treatment plans, including BZD tapering strategies, to incorporate their unique needs, goals, and preferences.

Assessing Risks and Benefits of Continued Benzodiazepine Prescribing

Clinicians should review BZD use frequently for patients who have a history of SUDs, as these individuals are at increased risk of developing SUDs to other substances compared to those without a history of SUD. In addition, patients who use BZDs and have co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) or OUD are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality because of the cross-tolerance and combined CNS and respiratory depressant effects of these substances. Clinicians should carefully consider these risks when determining the appropriateness of continued BZD prescribing.

Considerations for Benzodiazepine Tapering in Patients with Substance Use Disorder

Abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous. The CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response. If more rapid tapering is indicated — for example, due to imminent safety risks or when alternate treatment options have been unsuccessful — clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents"). Clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the appropriate timing of BZD tapering.

Tapering can be complicated when patients have been obtaining BZDs from the illicit drug market, where counterfeit pills can include novel synthetic BZDs (e.g. etizolam, flubromazolam). These novel synthetic BZDs have not been well studied and may not be detected with standard drug testing or toxicology assays. The European Union Drugs Agency's New benzodiazepines in Europe – a review provides helpful information on emerging new BZDs. In addition, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) tracks emerging threats related to BZDs. Determining an equivalent BZD dose to begin tapering is complicated when patients are taking BZDs from the illicit drug market. In general, clinicians should titrate the BZD dose to the minimum dose necessary to control a patient's withdrawal symptoms and taper from that point. Clinicians should consider residential treatment if patients need after-hours clinical monitoring or medical management to support safe and effective BZD tapering.
