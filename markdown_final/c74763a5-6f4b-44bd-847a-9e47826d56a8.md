## Question

it is a good iead to just check the ecg tyo get baseline heart

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if it's a good idea to get an ECG just to establish a baseline for heart health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who exactly is being considered for ECG screening. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for asymptomatic adults. Next, I will examine the evidence for benefits and harms of screening ECGs. After that, I need to identify special scenarios where a baseline ECG is appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and provide practical guidance for patient discussions [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh].

> Let me first confirm the target populations, because the answer hinges on baseline risk and clinical context. I need to distinguish asymptomatic low-risk adults from intermediate or high-risk adults, athletes, people starting medications that affect conduction or QT, and anyone with symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. The USPSTF frames decisions around 10-year CVD risk when evaluating screening ECGs, which will guide how I parse recommendations in each group [^112AU8CT].

> Next, I should review the major guideline positions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the USPSTF gives a D recommendation against screening with resting or exercise ECG in asymptomatic, low-risk adults and an I statement (insufficient evidence) for intermediate/high-risk adults, while the American College of Physicians advises against cardiac screening tests in asymptomatic, low-risk adults as low-value care. The ESC 2024 chronic coronary syndromes guideline recommends a resting ECG when patients report chest pain as part of a diagnostic workup, not for routine asymptomatic screening, which is a key distinction I need to keep clear [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh] [^114MSTvt].

> Now I will examine the evidence base. I should double-check RCTs: two randomized trials in asymptomatic adults with diabetes found no reduction in events from screening with exercise ECG, and there are no RCTs showing benefit for resting ECG screening in asymptomatic populations. Observational studies show many ECG abnormalities correlate with increased risk, but association does not equal improved outcomes with screening, and recent cohort work underscores limitations and potential biases in ECG-based screening cascades, so I should be cautious about inferring utility from prognostic associations alone [^116NC6Fi] [^112AU8CT] [^113QsiC3].

> I need to ensure I weigh potential harms and opportunity costs. False positives can drive unnecessary downstream testing and procedures, anxiety, labeling, and cost, especially when pretest probability is low; high-value care advice emphasizes focusing on modifiable risk factors instead of screening ECGs in low-risk adults. Traditional risk scores already inform preventive therapy decisions, and adding screening ECG rarely changes management in ways proven to improve outcomes in low-risk populations [^117VTJqh] [^112AU8CT].

> Let me consider appropriate scenarios where a "baseline ECG" is actually recommended. Before initiating QT-prolonging or conduction-slowing therapies, targeted ECG assessment is advised, such as with methadone and certain S1P modulators like ozanimod or ponesimod, particularly in patients with risk factors or conduction concerns. In systemic diseases with known cardiac involvement, baseline ECG can be part of screening or staging, for example in extracardiac sarcoidosis and in Turner syndrome at diagnosis, and Kawasaki disease protocols include baseline ECG at suspicion. For symptomatic presentations, resting ECG is indicated diagnostically, not as screening, and ambulatory monitoring is appropriate when arrhythmias are suspected. For athletes, routine universal ECG screening remains debated; U.S. bodies generally do not mandate it, while selected European guidance and programs consider it in structured settings, so I should individualize by program resources and expertise [^111wDEQy] [^1143muct] [^113jSrPZ] [^114BR6nw] [^1152G6ii] [^113iBE3Y] [^114MSTvt] [^115sNi4A] [^113fvbwr] [^112ffpXb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost stated that a "pre-operative baseline ECG" is standard for everyone, but I should verify that; without a supporting guideline here and given variability in pre-op testing by age, comorbidities, and surgery risk, I should avoid overgeneralizing and stick to the contexts supported by the cited recommendations in this discussion. Instead, I will emphasize that screening ECGs for asymptomatic low-risk adults are discouraged, while diagnostic ECGs and targeted baseline ECGs for specific medications or conditions are appropriate [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh].

> I will now synthesize the recommendation. For asymptomatic, low-risk adults, obtaining a baseline ECG "just to check" is not a good idea, given no demonstrated outcome benefit, the risk of false positives and downstream harms, and poor cost-effectiveness. For asymptomatic intermediate/high-risk adults, evidence is insufficient; decisions should be individualized rather than routine. For any symptomatic patient, an ECG is indicated as part of diagnostic evaluation. For special situations such as QT-prolonging agents, certain systemic diseases, and structured sports cardiology programs, a baseline ECG can be appropriate when aligned with guideline-directed indications and local expertise [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh] [^114MSTvt] [^111wDEQy] [^113fvbwr].

> If a patient requests a baseline ECG, I should explain the lack of proven benefit and potential harms, and pivot toward evidence-based prevention: risk calculation, blood pressure control, lipid management, diabetes screening, and smoking cessation; if a baseline ECG was already obtained and shows minor abnormalities, I need to avoid over-interpretation without clinical context because classification of "minor" versus "major" findings varies and may not warrant action in the absence of symptoms. If palpitations or syncope occur later, targeted testing including resting or ambulatory ECG can then be pursued based on pretest probability [^117VTJqh] [^113QsiC3] [^115sNi4A].

> Bottom line, I should confirm that routine "baseline" ECG screening in asymptomatic, low-risk individuals is discouraged by major guidelines and not supported by outcome data, while selective use in medication initiation, specific systemic diseases, athlete programs with infrastructure, or symptomatic presentations is appropriate. The clinical focus should remain on validated risk assessment and modification of risk factors rather than screening ECGs in the general asymptomatic population [^112AU8CT] [^117VTJqh] [^111pPkuJ].

It is **generally not recommended** to obtain a routine baseline ECG for asymptomatic, low-risk adults, as it does not improve outcomes and may prompt unnecessary testing and anxiety [^112AU8CT] [^111pPkuJ]. Baseline ECG is appropriate for patients with **cardiac symptoms** or **known heart disease**, and before starting **QT-prolonging drugs** [^111wDEQy] [^114MSTvt]. In athletes, ECG may be considered in high-risk or competitive settings but is not universally required [^113fvbwr]. For low-risk patients, prioritize risk factor management and lifestyle; **use ECG selectively** based on clinical context.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

### General adult population

- **USPSTF recommendations**: Routine ECG screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults at low risk of cardiovascular events (10-year risk < 10%) [^112AU8CT].

- **ESC guidelines**: Resting ECG is recommended for patients with chest pain or suspected myocardial ischemia, but not for routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^114MSTvt].

- **AAFP guidelines**: Routine ECG screening is not recommended for asymptomatic individuals at low risk of cardiovascular events [^111pPkuJ].

---

### Specific populations

- **Athletes**: Pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation, including ECG, may be considered for competitive athletes, particularly those at higher risk [^113fvbwr].

- **Patients initiating QT-prolonging medications**: Baseline ECG is recommended before starting medications known to prolong the QT interval, such as methadone or certain oncology drugs [^111wDEQy] [^113NPQTL].

- **Patients with specific medical conditions**: Baseline ECG is recommended for patients with conditions such as Kawasaki disease, Turner syndrome, or sarcoidosis, where cardiac involvement is a concern [^113iBE3Y] [^1152G6ii] [^114BR6nw].

---

## Benefits of baseline ECG

Baseline ECG can **detect asymptomatic arrhythmias**, conduction abnormalities, or structural heart disease, enabling early intervention. It also establishes an individual's cardiac baseline for future comparisons and supports risk stratification to guide further diagnostic evaluation and management.

---

## Limitations and potential harms

- **False positives and unnecessary testing**: Routine ECG screening in low-risk populations can lead to false positives, resulting in unnecessary diagnostic procedures, anxiety, and increased healthcare costs [^112AU8CT].

- **Limited predictive value**: ECG abnormalities alone have limited predictive value for future cardiovascular events, particularly in asymptomatic individuals without risk factors.

- **Resource utilization**: Routine ECG screening in low-risk populations may not be cost-effective and can strain healthcare resources.

## Clinical scenarios where baseline ECG is particularly useful

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for baseline ECG** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients (chest pain, palpitations, syncope) | Strongly recommended [^114MSTvt] |
| Patients with known cardiovascular disease | Strongly recommended |
| Patients initiating QT-prolonging medications | Strongly recommended [^111wDEQy] |
| Competitive athletes (high-risk or elite) | Considered [^113fvbwr] |
| Patients with specific medical conditions (Kawasaki disease, Turner syndrome, sarcoidosis) | Strongly recommended [^113iBE3Y] [^1152G6ii] [^114BR6nw] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where baseline ECG is not recommended

Avoid routine ECG screening in **Asymptomatic, low-risk adults**, given its limited benefit and potential harms [^112AU8CT], and in **Patients without cardiovascular risk factors**, for whom it is likewise not recommended [^111pPkuJ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine baseline ECG is not recommended for **asymptomatic, low-risk adults** because of **limited predictive value** and **potential harms**. Baseline ECG is valuable for symptomatic patients, those with known cardiovascular disease, individuals starting QT-prolonging medications, competitive athletes, and patients with specific medical conditions. Use clinical judgment and individual risk assessment to decide whether to obtain a baseline ECG.

### Screening for cardiovascular disease risk with electrocardiography: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112AU8CT]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which encompasses atherosclerotic conditions such as coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, is the most common cause of death among adults in the United States. Treatment to prevent CVD events by modifying risk factors is currently informed by CVD risk assessment with tools such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equations, which stratify individual risk to inform treatment decisions.

- **Objective**: To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography (ECG).

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on whether screening with resting or exercise ECG improves health outcomes compared with the use of traditional CVD risk assessment alone in asymptomatic adults.

- **Findings**: For asymptomatic adults at low risk of CVD events (individuals with a 10-year CVD event risk less than 10%), it is very unlikely that the information from resting or exercise ECG (beyond that obtained with conventional CVD risk factors) will result in a change in the patient's risk category as assessed by the Framingham Risk Score or Pooled Cohort Equations, which would lead to a change in treatment and ultimately improve health outcomes. Possible harms are associated with screening with resting or exercise ECG, specifically the potential adverse effects of subsequent invasive testing. For asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk of CVD events, there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which information from ECG can impact treatment decisions.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^114MSTvt]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, specifically with respect to ECG (resting), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a resting 12-lead ECG in all patients reporting chest pain, unless an obvious non-cardiac cause is identified. This is particularly crucial during or immediately after an episode suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### ECG-based cardiac screening programs: Legal, ethical, and logistical considerations [^112ffpXb]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Screening asymptomatic people with a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) has been theorized to detect latent cardiovascular disease. However, resting ECG screening is not recommended for numerous populations, such as asymptomatic middle-aged sedentary individuals, as it is not sufficiently sensitive to detect coronary artery disease. While the issues raised in this article are largely common to all screening programs, this review focuses on two distinct programs:

- **Screening elite athletes**: For conditions associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD), and
- **Screening individuals aged ≥ 65 years**: For atrial fibrillation (AF).

These two settings have recently gained attention for their promise and concerns regarding the prevention of SCD and stroke, respectively. If screening is to be done, it must be done well. Organizations conducting screening must consider a range of legal, ethical, and logistical responsibilities that arise from the beginning to the end of the process. This includes consideration of whom to screen, the timing of screening, whether screening is mandatory, consent issues, and auditing systems to ensure quality control. Good infrastructure for interpretation of ECG results according to expert guidelines and follow-up testing for abnormal screening results, including a pathway to treatment, are essential. Finally, there may be significant implications for those diagnosed with cardiac disease, including insurance, employment, the ability to play sports, and mental health issues. There are several legal risks, and the best protective measures are good communication systems and thorough clinical auditing to ensure quality control.

### Preparticipation athletic screening including an electrocardiogram: An unproven strategy for prevention of sudden cardiac death in the athlete [^116DE2r4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

One of the fundamental principles of evidence-based medicine is that clinical practice should be based on evidence derived from sufficiently robust data to ensure that the benefits, risks, and costs of an intervention are known. Although intuitively appealing, athletic screening programs with routine electrocardiograms (ECGs) followed by restriction of at-risk individuals have not been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing the inherent risk of athletic sudden death. The incremental use of a screening ECG to a history and physical examination remains debatable because of insufficient evidence to conclusively resolve the issue. Long-term outcomes with a large group of athletes undergoing screening and restriction are limited to a small number of observational trials. One supports and many do not support ECG screening with athletic restriction of at-risk athletes. Although programs and policies to decrease sudden death are laudable, they need further evaluation before being implemented on a large-scale basis. Currently, athletes are best protected by a strategy of secondary prevention with improvements in resuscitation and emergency action plans.

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^112NY1fT]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is a devastating event that may be preventable by effective pre-participation screening; however, there is no universally accepted screening method for the conditions associated with SCD. In Italy, a pre-participation electrocardiogram (ECG) screening program has been in place since 1982, and a previous study by Corrado et al. has shown that it has significantly decreased the incidence of SCD. However, a comparative study by Maron et al. has disputed these findings. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the Association for European Paediatric Cardiology (AEPC) both recommend a screening history and physical examination (H&P) be performed. The AEPC guidelines also recommend a 12-lead ECG be performed before clearing an athlete to play, while the AHA does not.

The last meta-analysis on the subject was published in 2015. That same year, an international group of cardiologists came to a consensus on an update to ECG interpretation criteria in athletes. This was the third such update since 2010, following the publication of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) criteria in 2010 and the Seattle criteria in 2013, indicating a need for a new meta-analysis to reflect these updates. Therefore, we sought to conduct a meta-analysis of the literature between 2015 and 2020 to compare the value of H&P with that of a 12-lead ECG as a screening tool for detecting cardiac disease.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^113DWx7r]. Clinical Cardiology (2020).

- **Introduction**: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a powerful and easily available tool for the detection of cardiac disorders in asymptomatic individuals, often preceding symptoms by considerable time. Several studies have linked ECG abnormalities with cardiovascular (CV) events and prognosis in asymptomatic adults, predominantly focusing on major ECG aberrations.

Minor ECG abnormalities are common from middle age and frequently seen in clinical practice among asymptomatic subjects. They are generally regarded as unspecific and not linked to specific myocardial disease. The prognostic value of minor ECG abnormalities is not fully known but has potential for preventive considerations. Here, we present a longitudinal population-based observational cohort study of 50-year-old men, investigating the correlation between a negative T-wave in resting ECG and mortality during a 48-year follow-up.

### There is no reason to adopt ECGs and abandon American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology history and physical screening for detection of cardiovascular disease in the young [^111kPnYW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The article by Williams et al. critiques the notion of replacing traditional history and physical screening with electrocardiograms (ECGs) for detecting cardiovascular disease in young individuals. The authors argue that the existing guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology provide a robust framework for assessing cardiovascular health without the need for routine ECG adoption in this population.

### The ageing athlete: Screening prior to vigorous exertion in asymptomatic adults without known cardiovascular disease [^113Y7mo8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely considered the best available test for screening asymptomatic adults without known cardiovascular (CV) disease prior to initiating a vigorous exercise program due to its prognostic value, widespread availability, and low cost. Observational studies have demonstrated an increased relative risk of cardiovascular events with positive screening exercise ECG tests in men with diabetes, advanced age, or multiple cardiac risk factors. Recent observational studies have not demonstrated similar prognostic value for exercise ECG testing in asymptomatic healthy women.

Despite the predictive ability of exercise ECG testing in several groups, there have been no studies demonstrating a significant impact of screening on morbidity and mortality in completely asymptomatic patients, leading to significant discordance in consensus guidelines on screening. One prospective observational study is ongoing in Italy that may, for the first time, demonstrate the ability to decrease incident cardiovascular events using preparticipation screening exercise ECG testing in adult athletes with targeted exclusion from athletics.

Until more conclusive data is available, the authors currently recommend screening exercise ECG testing in asymptomatic men with diabetes and asymptomatic men over age 45 with two or more cardiovascular risk factors prior to initiating a vigorous exercise program. Consideration should also be given to screening asymptomatic patients younger than 45 with particularly strong risk factor exposure or elderly patients with fewer than two risk factors.

### Sudden cardiac death and preparticipation screening: The debate continues-in support of electrocardiogram-inclusive preparticipation screening [^115ujKpG]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading cause of death in young athletes during exercise, and there is international agreement among major medical and sporting bodies that young athletes should undergo preparticipation cardiovascular screening. However, there is currently no universally accepted screening protocol, and substantial debate exists about what constitutes the ideal approach to preparticipation screening. The primary objective of preparticipation screening is the detection of intrinsic structural or electrical cardiovascular disorders that predispose an athlete to SCD. Considerable evidence suggests that screening athletes with only a history and physical examination leaves most athletes with a serious underlying cardiovascular disease undetected and, thus, cannot adequately achieve the primary objective of screening. Preparticipating cardiovascular screening inclusive of an electrocardiogram (ECG) greatly enhances the ability to identify athletes at risk, is the only model shown to be cost-effective, and may reduce the rate of SCD.

The major obstacle to ECG screening in the United States is the lack of a physician workforce skilled in the interpretation of an athlete's ECG. However, recent studies have demonstrated a capacity to distinguish physiological ECG alterations in athletes from findings suggestive of underlying pathology that is both feasible and has a low false-positive rate. Efforts are underway to increase physician education in ECG interpretation. After two decades of debating the proper screening strategy to identify athletes at risk, the weight of the evidence increasingly supports the inclusion of ECGs in preparticipation screening.

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation - is it worth the effort [^115p1cSb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Distribution of screening yield in a population of 1000 individuals, with an undetected disease prevalence of 5% and a sensitivity and specificity of both 95%.

One could speculate that many of the patients falsely diagnosed with AF during screening, particularly when using one-lead ECG recordings, have an excess of premature atrial contractions (PACs) and/or short runs of PACs. An excess of PACs and runs of PACs is associated with an increased risk for incident AF, stroke, and mortality. Thus, one could further speculate that individuals falsely diagnosed with AF due to supraventricular activity could benefit from OAC treatment. However, there are no prospective trials yet demonstrating the benefit of OAC for this indication.

The diagnostic performance of several newer ECG recording devices has been reported. However, these validation studies are mostly conducted in an office setting compared to the gold standard of 12-lead ECG. In most cases, this setting does not resemble the actual screening environment, where participants are expected to record multiple intermittent ECG recordings or a continuous ECG recording in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with AF in screening studies using long-term ECG often have multiple paroxysmal AF episodes, which should increase diagnostic accuracy. The true diagnostic performance of newer ECG devices during ambulatory use is therefore partly unknown, as most detected cases of AF are paroxysmal. Comparison with the gold standard of 12-lead ECG in this setting is not possible.

### Routine electrocardiogram screening and cardiovascular disease events in adults [^113QsiC3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

There are several limitations in the study. First, a consensus regarding the classification of major and minor ECG abnormalities remains elusive. In fact, the classification of major and minor ECG abnormalities has varied across studies. We observed that multiple ECG abnormalities that are often considered minor were associated with CVD risk. Therefore, additional evaluation of the stratification of ECG abnormalities in risk assessment is warranted.

Second, as we defined CVD outcomes based on ICD-10 codes, we cannot rule out the possibility that the outcome was misclassified (i.e. patients with ECG abnormalities are likely to obtain diagnostic codes of CVD, leading to bias away from the null). Third, we included all-cause death in our primary composite outcome because causes of death were not available in the database, which requires additional evidence focusing on CVD death.

Fourth, the research may exhibit self-selection bias as the cohort consisted solely of individuals who have undergone annual health screening, potentially excluding lower socioeconomic groups who are less inclined to participate in such screenings. We observed a higher incidence rate for the primary outcome among individuals without ECG at baseline compared with our analytical samples. Fifth, because of the lack of data on follow-up examinations (e.g. echocardiogram reports), the presence of complications, and other relevant medical notes, we could not assess the potential influence of ECG results on clinical decisions, indications for follow-up examinations, or the potential harm caused by ECGs.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^117Eu9Rw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

A negative T‐wave in the ECG registered at 50 years of age in asymptomatic individuals from a randomized observational cohort carried an increased risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular death during lifetime follow‐up. The enhanced risk remained after adjustment for other ECG abnormalities and other cardiovascular risk factors. A major T‐wave inversion conveyed a higher risk than minor, and a negative T‐wave carried enhanced risk also in the absence of other risk factors.

### Dynamic electrocardiogram changes are a novel risk marker for sudden cardiac death [^116NHtqy]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities have been evaluated as static risk markers for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but the potential importance of dynamic ECG remodeling has not been investigated. This study examines the nature and prevalence of dynamic ECG remodeling among individuals who eventually suffered SCD.

- **Methods**: The study population was drawn from two prospective community-based SCD studies in Oregon (2002, discovery cohort) and California, USA (2015, validation cohort). For this present sub-study, 231 discovery cases (2015–17) and 203 validation cases (2015–21) with ≥ 2 archived pre-SCD ECGs were ascertained and were matched to 234 discovery and 203 validation controls based on age, sex, and duration between the ECGs. Dynamic ECG remodeling was measured as the progression of a previously validated cumulative six-variable ECG electrical risk score.

- **Results**: Oregon SCD cases displayed a greater electrical risk score increase over time compared to controls [+1.06 (95% confidence interval +0.89 to +1.24) vs. -0.05 (-0.21 to +0.11); P < .001]. These findings were successfully replicated in California [+0.87 (+0.7 to +1.04) vs. -0.11 (-0.27 to 0.05); P < .001]. In multivariable models, abnormal dynamic ECG remodeling improved SCD prediction over baseline ECG, demographics, and clinical SCD risk factors in both Oregon [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.770 (95% confidence interval 0.727–0.812) increased to area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.869 (95% confidence interval 0.837–0.902)] and California cohorts.

### Screening for coronary heart disease with electrocardiography: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111xPUqj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Update of the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for coronary heart disease (CHD).

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits of screening with electrocardiography (ECG) in asymptomatic adults to reduce the risk for CHD events versus not screening, the effect of identifying high-risk persons on treatment to reduce risk, the accuracy of stratifying individuals into risk categories, and the harms of screening.

- **Recommendations**: The USPSTF recommends against screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at low risk for CHD events (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG for the prediction of CHD events in asymptomatic adults at intermediate or high risk for CHD events (I statement).

### Electrocardiograms (ECGs) in phase I anticancer drug development: The MD Anderson Cancer Center experience with 8518 ECGs [^111BQ4J7]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac sequelae from oncologic drugs are important in early cancer drug development, with the prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) by noncardiac drugs being the most common cause of drug development delays, nonapprovals, and post-marketing withdrawals by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Patients and methods**: We analyzed 8,518 electrocardiograms (ECGs) in 525 consecutive cancer patients enrolled in 22 industry-sponsored phase I clinical trials, starting 1 January 2006.

- **Results**: Seventy-four patients [14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11% to 17%] with normal QTc at baseline had QTc intervals above the upper limit of normal after treatment initiation; 33 patients (6%, 95% CI 4% to 9%) had prolonged QTc intervals at baseline, and only one (3%, 95% CI 0% to 16%) worsened after dosing. Seven of 33 patients (21%, 95% CI 9% to 39%) with prolonged baseline QTc had normalization of QTc intervals after dosing. All QTc prolongations were clinically insignificant; study drugs were continued uneventfully. Two of 525 patients (0.4%, 95% CI 0% to 1%) experienced cardiac serious adverse events, specifically myocardial infarction possibly related to the drug and unstable atrial flutter related to metastatic disease. Both cardiac events were detected by clinical assessment, not by surveillance ECGs.

Frequent ECG monitoring provided no clinically significant information in 525 patients in early phase trials.

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^112PHUim]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Controversy exists over the use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in sports pre-participation screening. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of history and physical examination (H&P) with ECG at detecting both cardiac disease and sudden cardiac death–associated conditions (SCD-AC). Pre-participation studies published from 2015 to 2020 with athletes aged 10 to 35 years old were included. This resulted in a sample of 28,011 athletes screened, with 124 cardiac diagnoses, 103 of which were SCD-AC.

A meta-analysis of log odds ratios (ORs) was conducted using a random-effects model. The ORs for the association between H&P and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were not statistically significant (OR = 3.4, P = 0.076; OR = 2.9, P = 0.078). Conversely, the ORs for the association between ECG and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were statistically significant (OR = 60, P < .001; OR = 148, P < .0001).

In conclusion, the odds of detecting both cardiac disease and conditions related to SCD with ECG are greater than with H&P during sports pre-participation screening.

This study aimed to identify electrocardiographic predictors of left ventricular enlargement or persistent dysfunction following a myocardial infarction. Baseline and predischarge 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 272 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, who were enrolled in the Healing and Early Afterload Reducing Therapy trial, were evaluated and compared to echocardiographic data obtained at baseline and day 90. ST-segment elevation, QRS score, and the number of negative T waves were assessed at both time points. The majority of patients (87%; n = 237) received reperfusion therapy. Multivariate models were utilized to adjust for potential confounders, including maximal creatine kinase level and ejection fraction at baseline.

None of the baseline electrocardiographic variables independently predicted ventricular enlargement or recovery of function. However, the sum of ST- and maximum ST-segment elevation, and the number of leads with ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm in the predischarge ECG, were independent predictors of ventricular enlargement from baseline to day 90. Each lead with ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm was associated with 3.5 mL of ventricular enlargement (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6 to 5.5 mL; P < 0.0001). The number of leads with ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm (OR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.74; P < 0.0001) was independently associated with a lower likelihood of recovery of function.

### Simple electrocardiographic measures improve sudden arrhythmic death prediction in coronary disease [^11111RNm]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination of standard electrocardiographic (ECG) markers reflecting domains of arrhythmic risk improves sudden and/or arrhythmic death (SAD) risk stratification in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).

The association between ECG markers and SAD was examined in a derivation cohort (PREDETERMINE; N = 5462) with adjustment for clinical risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and competing risk. Competing outcome models assessed the differential association of ECG markers with SAD and competing mortality. The predictive value of a derived ECG score was then validated (ARTEMIS; N = 1900). In the derivation cohort, the 5-year cumulative incidence of SAD was 1.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–1.9] and 6.2% [95% CI 4.5–8.3] in those with a low- and high-risk ECG score, respectively (P for Δ < 0.001). A high-risk ECG score was more strongly associated with SAD than non-SAD mortality (adjusted hazard ratios = 2.87 vs. 1.38, respectively; P for Δ = 0.003) and the proportion of deaths due to SAD was greater in the high versus low risk groups (24.9% vs. 16.5%, P for Δ = 0.03). Similar findings were observed in the validation cohort. The addition of ECG markers to a clinical risk factor model inclusive of LVEF improved indices of discrimination and reclassification in both derivation and validation cohorts, including correct reclassification of 28% of patients in the validation cohort [net reclassification improvement 28 (7–49%), P = 0.009].

### There is no reason to adopt ECGs and abandon American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology history and physical screening for detection of cardiovascular disease in the young [^111ktmPA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Williams et al. have presented a large retrospective observational study addressing methods for screening young healthy competitive student-athletes for cardiovascular disease. Their proposed strategy adds the 12-lead ECG, which the authors have advocated for several years, to the time-honored targeted history and physical screening examination recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Inferences are drawn about the screening efficacy of each of these two approaches.

Williams et al. assembled data from a large nonconsecutive cohort of high school athletes and other students, adding to the ongoing controversy surrounding the value of universal ECG screening for cardiovascular diseases in competitive athletes. This practice of ECG screening has been mandated in Italy for more than 40 years, but remains the subject of substantial scientific controversy. Notably, the most common cause of sudden death in the Italian data is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and not hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is the most common cause of sudden death in the US athlete population. For a variety of reasons, ECG screening has met repeated opposition in societal guidelines from the US cardiology community and has been published in Circulation on three occasions over 25 years, most recently just five years ago.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112KEv5M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Despite decades of quality-improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter three distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum. First are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI, who have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival.

Second are prescreened patients who have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these two scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated.

Third are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care: those arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms who are primarily screened by that ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG. The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG.

### Frequency of electrocardiographic recordings in patients presenting with angina pectoris (from the investigation of national coronary disease identification) [^111kYJkJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The appropriate progression of diagnostic testing for acute angina has been the topic of several recommendations by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). We measured how frequently electrocardiography (ECG) is provided as the initial cardiac diagnostic test, as recommended for patients with new angina. Using an insurance database representing 2% of the U.S. adult population, we identified patients undergoing a new cardiac diagnostic process for angina. Rates of initial ECG were stratified by age, gender, co-morbid disease, and care setting.

Of 4.4 million patients, 18,139 met the entry criteria by presenting with anginal symptoms for testing. A substantial portion (35%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 34% to 35%) did not receive the initial ECG recommended by expert guidelines. Patients treated in emergency departments received an initial ECG more frequently (91%, CI 90% to 92%) than patients tested in outpatient settings (61%, CI 60% to 62%; risk ratio [RR] 0.67, CI for RR 0.65 to 0.68) or inpatient hospital settings (34%, CI 32% to 37%; RR 0.38, CI for RR 0.36 to 0.40). Slightly lower rates of initial ECG were observed in men (RR 0.93 vs. women, CI for RR 0.91 to 0.95) and patients over 64 years (RR 0.93 vs. younger patients, CI for RR 0.91 to 0.95). Total diagnostic costs averaged $954 when testing began with the recommended ECG versus $1,233 when testing did not.

In conclusion, ECG is not universally obtained as the initial test for patients presenting with anginal symptoms, despite evidence-based recommendations for such use.

### Application of the 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for risk stratification for sudden death in adult patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^112Ydt8v]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). High credibility.

The management of the asymptomatic pre-excited patient largely hinges on risk stratification and individual patient considerations and choice. A high threshold to treat patients may lead to a small overall risk of death, while a low threshold clearly leads to increased invasive testing and ablation with associated cost and procedural risk. A firm recommendation to uniformly assess all by electrophysiology study or, alternatively, reassure all is inappropriate and unjustified by data as reflected in the recent guideline recommendations. The use of noninvasive and invasive parameters to identify the potentially at-risk individual, with surveillance for symptoms in those comfortable with this approach, or ablation for those choosing this alternative for individual reasons, remains the cornerstone of best practice.

### The electrocardiogram as a prognostic tool for predicting major cardiac events [^116eQ8EB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Among patients with cardiac disease, identifying those at low risk and those at high risk for major cardiac events is crucial for the rational clinical management of individual patients. Correct noninvasive risk stratification of cardiac patients has significant clinical implications. It would avoid unnecessary exposure to potentially risky invasive diagnostic or interventional procedures in low-risk patients while allowing an appropriate aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach in high-risk patients.

Furthermore, appropriate identification of low- and high-risk patients also has social and economic implications by favoring the optimization of resource distribution and costs. A large number of studies in previous decades provided evidence that several methods and variables derived from the analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) are powerful predictors of major cardiac events in several clinical conditions. Despite that, there has been limited attention to how several of these findings can be used in clinical practice.

In recent years, most studies on the risk stratification of cardiac patients have primarily focused on the use of several serum/plasma biomarkers, with reduced attention to ECG variables. Surprisingly, there have been few attempts to establish whether the various proposed risk markers add any significant information to that obtainable from ECG methods. This article explores the evidence for the prognostic value of variables derived from the assessment of the ECG signal.

### Beneficial effects of long-term intravenous iron therapy with ferric carboxymaltose in patients with symptomatic heart failure and iron deficiency [^114RMrtc]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

At the baseline visit, prior to commencing treatment, clinical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, assessment of NYHA class, 6MWT, and health-related quality of life were obtained for each patient. Randomization was achieved using a central interactive voice response system to allocate patients to treatment groups and avoid selection bias. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either intravenous iron or placebo (normal saline). Subjects were stratified by site and Hb levels (two strata: subjects with Hb < 12.0 g/dL vs. Hb ≥ 12.0 g/dL). Stratification was incorporated into this study to help ensure a balance of baseline Hb across treatment groups.

### Assessment of multi-ion channel block in a phase I randomized study design: Results of the CiPA phase I ECG biomarker validation study [^112p3nBk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Potential implications of CiPA

ICH E14 states that it is inconclusive as to whether drugs that prolong QTc are pro-arrhythmic and that certain factors may modify the risk of QTc prolongation, including prolonging QTc up to a "plateau" value, and that pro-arrhythmic risk might be influenced by other pharmacologic effects (e.g. other ion channel effects in addition to hERG block). Although ICH S7B and E14 guidelines state that the presence of QTc prolongation does not mean that a drug will cause arrhythmias and the presence of QTc prolongation should support planning for and interpretation of subsequent clinical studies, the way they have been used in practice has been to sometimes drop compounds or drugs from development, which may not always be appropriate.

One of the potential impacts of CiPA is to better inform when QTc prolonging drugs require intensive ECG monitoring in phase III trials. ICH E14 describes a nuanced approach for ECG monitoring in late-stage trials in the question and answer (Q&A) section (see figure 1 in Vicente et al.). Briefly, the results can be divided into categories of whether the mean ΔΔQTc at therapeutic exposures is 20 ms. In the ICH E14 Q&A, if the ΔΔQTc at maximal "worst case" therapeutic exposures is < 10 ms, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late-phase trials. However, if higher exposures are only expected in a limited subset of patients, intensive ECG monitoring may only be required in that specific patient population. If the ΔΔQTc effect is 10–20 ms at therapeutic exposure, intensive ECGs are needed.

### Screening for cardiovascular disease risk with resting or exercise electrocardiography: Evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^116NC6Fi]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The objective of this study is to review the evidence on screening asymptomatic adults for CVD risk using electrocardiography (ECG) to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data sources included MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 2017, as well as references, expert consultations, and literature surveillance through April 4, 2018.

- **Study selection**: English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies reporting reclassification, calibration, or discrimination that compared risk assessment using ECG plus traditional risk factors versus traditional risk factors alone were included. For harms, additional study designs were eligible. Studies of persons with symptoms or a CVD diagnosis were excluded.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality was conducted, along with a qualitative synthesis of findings.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcomes and measures included mortality, cardiovascular events, reclassification, calibration, discrimination, and harms.

Results showed that sixteen studies were included (N = 77,140). Two RCTs (n = 1,151) found no significant improvement in screening with exercise ECG (versus no screening) in adults aged 50 to 75 years with diabetes for the primary cardiovascular composite outcomes (hazard ratios, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.59–1.71] and 0.85 [95% CI, 0.39–1.84] for each study). No RCTs evaluated screening with resting ECG. Evidence from five cohort studies (n = 9,582) showed that adding exercise ECG to traditional risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol level, and high-densi

### Cardiac evaluation of young athletes: Time for a risk-based approach [^111xxGnv]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Electrocardiogram-detectable etiologies have been implicated in 117 cases of sudden cardiac arrest and death in US competitive athletes (ages 11‐29 years).

When ample sports cardiology resources are available, the routine use of ECG is feasible in the pre-participation cardiovascular screening (PPCS) of all athletes. However, reserving the ECG for smaller populations of higher-risk groups may offer a more pragmatic approach for institutions that lack the infrastructure and expertise to support an ECG-based model on a larger scale.

It is prudent, however, to consider the ethical issues of such an approach. Institutions may argue that equivalent screening services should be available to all athletes under their care and not differentiated based on sex, race, or sport. This notion is supported by data from France, Denmark, and the United States, which demonstrates that the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in recreational athletes and nonathletic individuals is higher than previously thought. While recreational athletes are not required to undergo a PPCS prior to sports participation, should these individuals be precluded from primary preventative strategies? Critics may argue that a larger number of epidemiological studies, using mandatory reporting systems for case identification, are warranted before we can reliably define "high-risk" populations. However, nearly all preventive practices in medicine base the rigor of the screening evaluation on the individual risk of the patient. Thus, there is justification, in the setting of limited resources, to provide the most intensive screening to those in greatest need.

### Zeposiastarter kit [^1143muct]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Before the initiation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, the following assessments should be conducted:

- **Cardiac evaluation**: Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, consult a cardiologist [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Complete blood count**: Obtain a recent (i.e. within the last 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC), including lymphocyte count [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Liver function tests**: Obtain recent (i.e. within the last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Ophthalmic assessment**: Obtain a baseline evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, near the start of treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Skin examination**: Obtain a baseline skin examination prior to or shortly after initiation of ZEPOSIA. If a suspicious skin lesion is observed, it should be promptly evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Or prior medications**: If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Determine if patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular conduction [see Warnings and Precautions].

### Sports cardiology: A glorious past, a well-defined present, a bright future [^111Z96Fr]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

The attention towards sports cardiology has dramatically grown after the introduction of the preparticipation screening (PPS) and the need for specific education on ECG interpretation in athletes, given the differences between athletes and the general population. The PPS is a medical evaluation conducted on athletes before sports competitions, aimed at detecting a clinically silent cardiac condition that may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or that may worsen with intensive exercise. It may be periodical (e.g. annually) or once in a lifetime. The rationale behind the PPS is that young adults who participate in competitive sports tend to exercise to their limits, thus increasing the risk of SCD, particularly when they are unaware of suffering from a cardiac disease predisposing them to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

The interest in medical evaluations for competitive athletes before sports competitions started in Italy in the 1950s. The PPS was established by the Italian government in 1982, with an annual screening that was mandatory by law across the entire nation for all athletes wishing to compete, irrespective of their professional or non-professional status. The screening is conducted by sports medicine physicians and includes history, physical examination, 12-lead resting ECG, and exercise testing or an ECG-monitored step test.

### Cardiac repolarization and the safety of new drugs defined by electrocardiography [^115YaWk9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

A compelling assessment of both short- and long-term cardiac safety is increasingly emphasized before regulatory marketing approval. In that context, cardiac adverse effects that were otherwise unexpected become manifest when large numbers of subjects are treated after market approval, many of whom take multiple medications, have co-morbidities, and are subject to other conditions that were not represented in the original clinical trial population. Since 2005, dedicated, robust, and well-controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) trials are required, usually conducted in Phase II, to define the cardiac risk of a new therapy before large-scale Phase III trials are conducted or marketing is approved.

### Evaluation and management of cardiac safety using the electrocardiogram in oncology clinical trials: Focus on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval) [^113NPQTL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Non-antiarrhythmic drugs have been reported to prolong the QTc interval and induce potentially fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. An increasing number of drugs used for treating malignancies are no exception. Therefore, both oncologists and regulators expect sponsors of oncology drugs to evaluate their effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG), particularly on the QTc interval, during drug development.

For agents that cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the primary approach is to conduct an intensive ECG evaluation. This involves robust ECG recordings during early-phase clinical trials, characterizing the concentration-QTc interval relationship, and following up with appropriate ECG monitoring in later development phases.

This article describes the broad principles of these approaches, including recommendations for exclusion criteria related to baseline QTc interval and cardiac comorbidity. It also describes methods for conducting ECG monitoring and a proposed scheme for managing any emerging QTc-related effects.

### Proposed enhanced recommendations for interpretation of electrocardiographic screening of athletes [^115gdxxD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

While there is ongoing debate about the role of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in the routine screening of young athletes during pre-participation evaluations, studies continue to support the use of ECG within properly organized settings. This paper aims to offer considerations for enhancing the international ECG recommendations for the interpretation of the ECGs of young athletes through an emphasis on the following:

- **Percentile outliers**: Identification of extreme values outside the normal range.
- **Computerized ECG technology**: Advancements in automated analysis and interpretation.
- **Clarification of terminology**: Ensuring consistent and precise use of language.

We specifically highlight criteria for early repolarization, left atrial abnormality, right bundle branch block, ST shifts, and high and low voltage QRS.

### ECG as a part of the preparticipation screening programme: an old and still present international dilemma [^1117L2nX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Long-term Italian experience has provided evidence that preparticipation screening in competitive athletes with 12-lead ECG, history, and physical examination is effective in identifying potentially lethal cardiovascular diseases. However, it is not being routinely practiced in other countries.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the usefulness of a preparticipation screening programme in a sample of players belonging to different disciplines.

- **Material and methods**: From September 2006 to June 2008, 1220 young athletes from different sports disciplines underwent a cardiovascular examination that included personal and family history, physical examination, and a resting 12-lead ECG. Those with abnormal findings were referred for additional tests.

- **Results**: 1220 athletes were screened; 96% were males with a mean age of 23 (4) years. 90 (7.4%) players were referred for additional tests because of abnormal findings on baseline examination: 11 (0.9%) due to personal or family history, 4 (0.08%) due to physical examination, and 75 (6.14%) due to 12-lead ECG. Echocardiographic assessment fulfilled left ventricular hypertrophy criteria in 8 of the 90 players. Of those, one case was considered an athlete's heart, and one case was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (septal thickness 23 mm). Further tests were needed in the remaining six, included in the "grey area", with one additional case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (apical variant) suggested by cardiac MRI.

- **Conclusion**: Given the ability of the 12-lead ECG to detect individuals with structural heart disease, we suggest its inclusion as a part of preparticipation screening programs.

### Dynamic electrocardiogram changes are a novel risk marker for sudden cardiac death [^117YUEHf]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

To investigate risk factors independently associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) events, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis including all baseline comorbidities, baseline electrocardiogram risk score (ERS), and increased ERS. In the multivariable analysis models for both discovery and validation cohorts, a one-unit increase in the ERS was independently associated with an SCD event [Oregon: OR 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.49–4.1, P < 0.0001; California: OR 3.24, 95% CI 2.48–4.24, P < 0.0001]. Detailed results of the multivariable model are described for both discovery and validation cohorts.

- **Univariate and multivariate models for sudden cardiac death risk factors**: To evaluate the predictive power of abnormal ERS progression beyond baseline ERS and clinical SCD risk factors, we performed logistic regression analyses including baseline ERS and clinical variables, with and without ERS change, in both Oregon and California cohorts. In Oregon, the addition of the ERS change to baseline ERS and clinical variables improved the discriminative value of SCD from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.771 (0.729–0.814) to an AUC of 0.875 (0.843–0.907). Similar results were obtained in the California cohort, where the addition of the ERS change improved the AUC from 0.785 (0.741–0.829) to 0.882 (0.850–0.914). Regression model performance metrics and AUC curves in the Oregon and California cohorts are presented.

### Screening asymptomatic adults with resting or exercise electrocardiography: A review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115cMxrr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death in adults. Screening for abnormalities using resting or exercise electrocardiography (ECG) might help identify persons who would benefit from interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk by identifying key abnormalities.

- **Purpose**: To update the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence review on screening for resting or exercise ECG abnormalities in asymptomatic adults.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (2002 through January 2011), the Cochrane Library database (through the fourth quarter of 2010), and reference lists.

- **Study selection**: Randomized, controlled trials and prospective cohort studies.

- **Data extraction**: Investigators abstracted details about the study population, study design, data analysis, follow-up, and results, assessing quality using predefined criteria.

- **Data synthesis**: No study evaluated clinical outcomes or the use of risk-reducing therapies after screening versus no screening. Furthermore, no study estimated the accuracy of resting or exercise electrocardiography in classifying participants into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk groups compared with traditional risk factor assessment alone. However, 63 prospective cohort studies evaluated abnormalities on resting or exercise ECG as predictors of cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Abnormalities on resting ECG (ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch block, or left-axis deviation) or exercise ECG (ST-segment depression with exercise, chronotropic incompetence, abnormal heart rate recovery, or decreased exercise capacity) were examined.

### The pre-sports cardiovascular evaluation: Should it depend on the level of competition, the sport, or the state [^116DKwfi]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in an athlete is a rare but tragic event, and significant controversy exists regarding the most effective method to define those at highest risk. Recommendations of the American Heart Association require that a history and physical examination be used for preparticipation screening, with an abnormal cardiac finding expected to prompt further evaluation. Given the lack of data documenting that electrocardiogram (ECG) screening in all competitive athletes is either feasible or appropriate, these guidelines state that such screening is optional but not mandatory. The extremely low incidence of SCD events, in conjunction with the low sensitivity and specificity of ECG as a screening tool in athletes, contributes to this recommendation.

Although these guidelines target all competitive athletes, there may be subgroups of athletes, based on age, level of competition, individual sport, or state of residence, for which mandatory ECG screening may be both appropriate and sensible. Given the lack of resolution of the ongoing ECG debate, it is perhaps reasonable to consider screening specific high-risk subgroups of athletes rather than continuing to dispute whether to screen all competitive athletes or none at all. Recent data suggest that such a program may be feasible and may provide a rationale basis for subsequent expansion of cardiovascular screening programs.

### Major adverse cardiac event rates in moderate-risk patients: Does prior coronary disease matter [^115vyJpk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This study indicates that moderate-risk patients (History, ECG, Age, and Risk factors score ≥ 4; nonischemic electrocardiogram; and negative serial troponin measures) with no prior coronary artery disease have a low 30-day major adverse cardiac events rate. However, patients with a history of coronary artery disease are at higher risk for adverse events, even in the absence of elevated troponins or acute ischemic electrocardiogram changes.

These data suggest that routine objective cardiac testing may not be indicated in moderate-risk patients without a history of coronary artery disease. Prospective research evaluating the safety and efficacy of avoiding hospitalization and objective cardiac testing among moderate-risk patients without prior coronary artery disease is needed.

### Dynamic electrocardiogram changes are a novel risk marker for sudden cardiac death [^113c9yKH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities have traditionally been evaluated as static risk markers for sudden cardiac death (SCD), yet the potential significance of dynamic ECG remodeling has not been explored. This study investigates the nature and prevalence of dynamic ECG remodeling among individuals who eventually suffered SCD.

The study cohort was derived from two prospective community-based SCD studies conducted in Oregon (2002, discovery cohort) and California, USA (2015, validation cohort). For this sub-study, 231 discovery cases (2015–2017) and 203 validation cases (2015–2021) with two or more archived pre-SCD ECGs were analyzed and matched to 234 discovery and 203 validation controls based on criteria of age, sex, and duration between the ECGs. Dynamic ECG remodeling was quantified by tracking the progression of a previously validated cumulative six-variable ECG electrical risk score.

Notably, Oregon SCD cases exhibited a greater increase in their electrical risk score over time compared to controls, with changes of +1.06 (95% confidence interval +0.89 to +1.24) versus −0.05 (−0.21 to +0.11); P < 0.001. These results were effectively replicated in California, showing an increase of +0.87 (+0.7 to +1.04) versus −0.11 (−0.27 to 0.05); P < 0.001. In multivariable models, abnormal dynamic ECG remodeling enhanced the prediction of SCD risk beyond baseline ECG, demographics, and clinical risk factors in both regions. In Oregon, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.770 (95% confidence interval 0.727–0.812), which increased to 0.869 (95% confidence interval 0.837–0.902) with the inclusion of dynamic ECG changes.

### An overview of the electrocardiographic monitoring devices in sports cardiology: Between present and future [^11724knu]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The intense and continuative exercise training induces multiple physiological cardiovascular (CV) adaptations, better known as the athlete's heart. This condition is characterized by several adaptations, including an increase in left ventricular (LV) mass; a harmonious remodeling of the cardiac chambers to enhance the cardiac output; the downregulation of sympathetic and upregulation of parasympathetic tone; and the dispersion of ventricular depolarization that is recognizable at the resting electrocardiogram (ECG).

However, aside from these beneficial adaptations, both athletes and sedentary individuals might present early‐stage or covert structural CV diseases that need to be identified to prevent a dramatic event such as sudden cardiac death (SCD), which can be triggered by intense exercise and other modulating factors such as competition. The primary purpose of the preparticipation screening (PPS) is the early identification of cardiac conditions that could potentially cause SCD in athletes. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that physical activity might reveal the arrhythmic substrate and accelerate the progression of some cardiomyopathies, such as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. An athlete reporting exercise‐induced symptoms is a rather unusual event for two reasons: athletes are generally healthy, and they also rarely report symptoms to physicians, even when aware of experiencing symptoms, due to the possible disqualification. Hence, when an athlete spontaneously refers palpitations or other symptoms to the team personnel, including doctors, it is a significant occurrence.

### Is an exercise tolerance test indicated before beginning regular exercise? A decision analysis [^117FgKnv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The present study, using a decision analysis, evaluates whether an exercise tolerance test (ETT) is indicated before initiating regular physical activity to reduce the risk of sudden death during exercise training.

- **Design**: The study encompasses a decision tree, Monte Carlo simulation, and utility analysis for adults at low to high risk for coronary disease, with a time horizon of five years, with or without routine ETT screening before initiating physical activity.

- **Measures**: Mortality in Monte Carlo simulation; expected values in utility analysis.

- **Results**: Routine screening decreases mortality in intermediate to high-risk populations but not in low-risk persons. At all risk levels, the number of exercise-induced deaths prevented is less than the added number of deaths from angiography. Utility analysis indicates inferiority of routine screening, regardless of risk. Personal preferences (perceived stigma from having coronary disease and perceived benefit of regular exercise on quality of life) have a strong influence on the optimal choice.

- **Conclusion**: Routine screening before initiating regular exercise is not recommended for the purpose of reducing the risk of sudden death during exercise training.

### Deep neural network-estimated electrocardiographic age as a mortality predictor [^116GpshY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In this paper, we use a data-driven approach to obtain a model that predicts age from the raw ECG tracing. By having the chronological age of the person as the prediction target, we expect the trained model to learn to capture, on average, how aging affects the ECG exam. Indeed, having a predicted ECG-age higher than one's actual age is an indication that the exam is similar to those of older people, who have a higher associated cardiovascular risk and are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases.

We show that classical cardiovascular risk factors are associated with having an ECG-age more than 8 years greater than the chronological age. For some risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, the association remains even when only normal ECGs were considered (cf. Fig. 3). Moreover, this study shows, in three different cohorts, that the difference between the ECG-age and the chronological age can be used as a marker of the risk of death.

### Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of ECG screening for conditions related to sudden cardiac death in young athletes [^114JaLuj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Controversy exists over the use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in sports pre-participation screening. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of history and physical examination (H&P) with ECG at detecting both cardiac disease and sudden cardiac death-associated conditions (SCD-AC). Pre-participation studies published from 2015 to 2020 with athletes aged 10 to 35 years were included. This yielded data from 28,011 athletes screened, resulting in 124 cardiac diagnoses, 103 of which were SCD-AC.

A meta-analysis of log odds ratios (ORs) was conducted using a random-effects model. The ORs for the association between H&P and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were not statistically significant (OR = 3.4, P = 0.076; OR = 2.9, P = 0.078). However, the ORs for the association between ECG and detecting both cardiac disease and SCD-AC were statistically significant (60, P < .001; 148, P < .0001). In conclusion, the odds of detecting both cardiac disease and conditions related to SCD with ECG are greater than with H&P during sports pre-participation screening.

### Cost analysis of the history, ECG, age, risk factors, and initial troponin (HEART) Pathway randomized control trial [^113yZ5ft]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The HEART Pathway is a diagnostic protocol designed to identify low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain who are safe for early discharge. This protocol has been shown to significantly decrease healthcare resource utilization compared to usual care. However, the impact of the HEART Pathway on the cost of care has yet to be reported.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a cost analysis of patients enrolled in the HEART Pathway trial, which randomized participants to either usual care or the HEART Pathway protocol. For low-risk patients, the HEART Pathway recommended early discharge from the emergency department without further testing. We compared index visit cost, cost at 30 days, and cardiac-related healthcare cost at 30 days between the two treatment arms. Costs for each patient included facility and professional costs. Cost at 30 days included total inpatient and outpatient costs, including the index encounter, regardless of etiology. Cardiac-related healthcare cost at 30 days included the index encounter and costs adjudicated to be cardiac-related within that period. Two hundred seventy of the 282 patients enrolled in the trial had cost data available for analysis. There was a significant reduction in cost for the HEART Pathway group at 30 days (median cost savings of $216 per individual), which was most evident in low-risk (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction score of 0–1) patients (median savings of $253 per patient) and driven primarily by lower cardiac diagnostic costs in the HEART Pathway group.

### Cardiac screening with electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging: Advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^117VTJqh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Cardiac screening in adults with resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging can reveal findings associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease events, but inappropriate cardiac testing of low-risk adults has been identified as an important area of overuse by several professional societies.

- **Methods**: Narrative review based on published systematic reviews, guidelines, and articles on the yield, benefits, and harms of cardiac screening in low-risk adults.

- **Results**: Cardiac screening has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. It is also associated with potential harms due to false-positive results because they can lead to subsequent, potentially unnecessary tests and procedures. Cardiac screening is likely to be particularly inefficient in adults at low risk for coronary heart disease given the low prevalence and predictive values of testing in this population and the low likelihood that positive findings will affect treatment decisions. In this patient population, clinicians should focus on strategies for mitigating cardiovascular risk by treating modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight, and by encouraging healthy levels of exercise.

- **High-value care advice**: Clinicians should not screen for cardiac disease in asymptomatic, low-risk adults with resting or stress electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, or stress myocardial perfusion imaging.

### Association of 6-minute walk performance and physical activity with incident ischemic heart disease events and stroke in peripheral artery disease [^114m6E76]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **Baseline and follow-up data collection**: Baseline measures included the ankle-brachial index (ABI), medical history, phlebotomy, a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and measurements of height and weight for calculating body mass index (BMI). After baseline testing, participants were asked to return every 2 months. At each follow-up visit, participants underwent an ECG and completed a questionnaire to identify any new hospitalizations. Home visits were conducted for participants unwilling or unable to attend a follow-up visit. If a home visit was refused, participants were contacted via phone to obtain information about hospitalizations.

- **Baseline measures**: We ascertained and confirmed baseline comorbidities using patient reports from questionnaire administration, medical record reviews, medication use, and primary care physician questionnaire results. These data were entered into comorbidity algorithms developed and validated by the Women's Health and Aging Study to ascertain and confirm baseline comorbidities, including diabetes, angina, heart failure, pulmonary disease, history of myocardial infarction (MI), and cancer. Symptomatic angina at baseline was defined as exertional chest pain that did not begin at rest, resolved within 10 minutes of rest, or resolved with nitroglycerin.

- **Ankle-brachial index**: We used a hand-held Doppler probe (Nicolet Vascular Pocket Dop II) to measure systolic blood pressures after the participant rested supine for 5 minutes. Measured pressures were taken from the right brachial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial arteries, as well as the left dorsalis pedis artery.

### Ponvory [^113jSrPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of Ponvory treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In patients with sinus bradycardia, first-or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Ponvory is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.

Use of Ponvory in patients with a history of syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.

Experience with Ponvory is limited in patients receiving therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g. beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate).

### Routine ECG screening in infancy and early childhood should not be performed [^115ouQA7]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

For those of us working in the field of inherited heart conditions, our ultimate aim is the prevention of sudden cardiac death in young people in our communities. We share this passion and drive with our colleagues Saul et al, who advocate for infant screening of infants for long QT syndrome (LQTS). Although Saul et al. aimed to write an unbiased review of the subject, they present data that support screening while underrepresenting evidence against it. Their illustrative Figure 1 is arguably misleading, as it presents a graph of freedom from any cardiac event in symptomatic individuals with familial LQTS. We know that 87% of deaths from LQTS occur in those who were previously symptomatic. However, this discussion is not about symptomatic patients with LQTS; it is about the detection of presymptomatic individuals on a community level.

Our aim is to present evidence that has led us to oppose the conclusions and suggestions of their article. Most pediatric cardiologists, including ourselves, do not wish to see ECG screening in infancy. Saul et al. state that there is sufficient evidence to propose ECG screening in infancy for LQTS. We disagree with this view for several reasons:

- **Effectiveness**: The effectiveness of such a program has not been evaluated in terms of outcome.
- **Reliability of ECG**: The ECG is an unreliable diagnostic tool with unacceptable reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity.
- **Adverse effects**: The adverse effects of overdiagnosing or underdiagnosing LQTS in thousands of individuals have not been evaluated.
- **Lack of definitive criteria**: There are no definitive criterion standards by which LQTS can be excluded once tested.

### Saving athletes' lives a reason to find common ground [^112Z1dzt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although both U.S. and European guidelines recommend screening athletes for suspected heart disease before participation in competitive sport, they disagree on which findings are associated with increased risk as well as those athletes whose activities should be restricted. Recent Italian data suggest that screening programs can save lives, but few countries have fully adopted such practices. It is time to develop an international consensus on who should receive pre-participation screening, who should perform the screening, what tests the screening should consist of, and what criteria should be used to restrict participation.

### Prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms in a large, unselected population undergoing pre-participation cardiovascular screening [^115K4wCn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The implementation of 12-lead ECG in the pre-participation screening of young athletes remains controversial, with several issues being widely debated, including the prevalence and spectrum of ECG abnormalities identified during these screenings.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed a large, unselected population of 32,652 subjects [26,050 (80%) males], prospectively examined in 19 clinics associated with the Italian Sports Medicine Federation. Most participants were young amateur athletes aged 8–78 years (median 17), predominantly students (68%), mainly engaged in soccer (39%), volleyball, or basketball (8% each), athletics (6%), cycling (5%), and swimming (4%). ECG patterns were evaluated according to widely used clinical criteria. The 12-lead ECG patterns were considered normal in 28,799 of the 32,652 athletes (88.2%) and abnormal in 3,853 (11.8%). The most frequent abnormalities included prolonged PR interval, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and early repolarization pattern (total 2,280, 7.0%). Distinct ECG abnormalities included deeply inverted T-waves in more than two precordial and/or standard leads (751, 2.3%), increased R/S wave voltages suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy (247, 0.8%), conduction disorders such as RBBB (351, 1.0%), left anterior fascicular block (162, 0.5%), and left bundle branch block (19, 0.1%). Rarely, cardiac pre-excitation pattern (42, 0.1%) and prolonged QTc interval (1, 0.03%) were found.

In conclusion, in a large, unselected population of young athletes undergoing pre-participation screening, the prevalence of markedly abnormal ECGs is noteworthy.

### Routine electrocardiogram screening and cardiovascular disease events in adults [^113HATTV]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US and globally. In 2019, 6.2 million people died of CVD between the ages of 30 and 70 years, and the rate of premature CVD mortality continues to rise, underscoring its substantial burden. Identifying high-risk individuals is crucial for CVD prevention, as key drugs for properly managing atherosclerotic factors have been developed. The resting electrocardiogram (ECG) has been proposed for screening purposes in asymptomatic populations since it is the most widely used, accessible, and least invasive cardiovascular test. However, the ECG may not be cost-effective and may potentially increase unnecessary testing and care cascade through incidental findings. Due to insufficient evidence on whether screening ECG can improve health outcomes, the US Preventive Services Task Force and the European Society of Cardiology do not recommend performing screening ECG for individuals at low risk of CVD.

According to the recent US Preventive Services Task Force guideline, "a considerable number of studies have reported hazard ratios [HRs] and other measures of association between ECG changes and cardiovascular outcomes". More than 30 studies have assessed the association of ECG abnormalities with the risk of cardiovascular events. However, evidence on the clinical utility of routine ECG in the general population remains insufficient because most of the existing literature consists of observational studies conducted on outdated, non-general populations, and for limited ECG abnormalities.

### Pre-participation examination of competitive athletes: Role of the ECG [^114nN6ec]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac death in athletes is rare but has a significant social impact due to the paradox it presents: athletes perceived and admired as the fittest and healthiest individuals suddenly die during their sport. Mass media coverage is guaranteed in such cases, especially involving top athletes, while other competitive and noncompetitive athletes of all ages, along with team members, sponsors, and large parts of society, remain puzzled and frightened.

The debate continues regarding how to minimize these fatalities, with an ongoing search for cost-effective preparticipation screening methods for competitive athletes. Despite the routine availability and relative inexpensiveness of ECG screening, there is a debate about whether it should be part of the initial screening for every athlete before high-intensity training and during annual checkups. The role of ECGs in these examinations remains a topic of intensive discussion due to the lack of strict criteria for determining which ECG findings should prompt further investigation.

In this article, we analyze the main publications on sudden cardiac death, focusing on the benefits of ECG screening in preparticipation examinations. It has been shown to be feasible and effective in identifying athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Turner syndrome, specifically concerning ECG, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a resting ECG at the time of diagnosis. This is to assess for findings consistent with congenital heart disease, arrhythmia, or conduction abnormalities. A cardiologist should obtain and review follow-up ECGs at intervals deemed appropriate based on baseline findings, underlying congenital heart disease, and clinical course.
